Following Mies' rigorous Cartesian logic, the three architects' project transformed the strictly homogeneous exhibition hall into a continuous yet subtly differentiated space where the thirteen artists exhibiting on the upper hall started interesting dialogues and so heightened the intensity of the exhibition's theme. ==References== \\"Berlin - Tokyo / Tokyo - Berlin Die Kunst zweier Städte\\", Berlin, 2006. editors: Angela Schneider, Gabriele Knapstein, David Elliott u. a. 350 pages in German language, publisher: Hatje Cantz Verlag, == External links == *Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin-Tokyo/Tokyo-Berlin.

Its natural habitats are moist tropical and subtropical forests and pastures. ==Description== The Ceylon caecilian grows to about long and resembles a large earthworm. The skin is formed into over 300 transverse folds which give the caecilian the appearance of being segmented. The head has a rounded snout and a pair of extensible tentacles near the mouth, rather closer to the eyes than to the nostrils. The colour of this caecilian is steely blue above and pale yellow underneath, with a yellow band running along either side of the body. ==Distribution and habitat== The Ceylon caecilian is endemic to southwestern and central Sri Lanka. It has also been reported to occur in northeastern India, but more likely this sighting referred to a different species. It lives in burrows in damp earth or leaf litter in subtropical or tropical moist lowland and montane forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, cleared forested areas, and pasturelands at elevations of up to above sea level. ==Biology== The Ceylon caecilian feeds on earthworms and other small invertebrates. When it has captured an earthworm, it reverses into its burrow, sometimes twisting its head around or twirling its whole body to subdue its prey. Reproduction takes place in underground chambers or other hidden places, where the female lays strings of about 30 white, jelly-coated eggs. She then coils her body around the eggs and broods them until they hatch into larvae about long. The larvae move out of the burrow and wriggle to pools or water courses that form in the wet season. They have three pairs of external feathery gills, a lateral line system, and a tail fin which enables them to swim. The gills persist, but they have lost their lateral lines by the time they undergo a relatively slow metamorphosis at about nine months old. ==Status== The Ceylon caecilian is listed as being of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because, although its range is probably less than , it is locally common in the areas in which it lives and does not seem to have any significant threats. It is a very adaptable animal and can cope with changes in its habitat. Large areas of its range are found in well-protected national parks, including the Sinharaja World Heritage Site, the Knuckles Range Forest Reserve, the Dellawa Forest Reserve and the Udawatta Kele Sanctuary. ==References== glutinosus Category:Amphibians described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Amphibians of Sri Lanka Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Ichthyophis glutinosus"},{"id":"12383289","text":"Ichthyophis hypocyaneus, the bantam caecilian, is a species of amphibian in the family Ichthyophiidae of caecilians, endemic to Indonesia.

They were intensively trained by the Soviet and Russian military forces between 1930 and 1996, and used in 1941–1942, against German tanks in World War II. Initially dogs were trained to leave a timer-detonated bomb and retreat, but this routine was replaced by an impact-detonation procedure which killed the dog in the process. The U.S. military started training anti-tank dogs in 1943 in the same way the Russians used them, but this training exposed several problems and the program was discontinued. ==History== In 1924, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics approved the use of dogs for military purposes, which included a wide range of tasks such as rescue, delivery of first aid, communication, tracking mines and people, assisting in combat, transporting food, medicine and injured soldiers on sleds, and destruction of enemy targets. For these purposes, a specialized dog training school was founded in the Moscow Oblast. Twelve regional schools were opened soon after, three of which trained anti-tank dogs. Mirror Раздавлена при падении “железного занавеса”. Донецкий кряж, № 2352 (24 November 2006) The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had no dedicated dog trainers. Therefore, they recruited hunter, police, and even circus trainers. Several leading animal scientists were also involved, in order to help organize a wide-scale training program. German Shepherd Dogs were favored for the program for their physical abilities and ease of training, but other breeds were used as well. The idea of using dogs as mobile mines was developed in the 1930s, together with the dog-fitting mine design. In 1935, anti-tank dog units were officially included in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. ==Training== The original idea was for a dog to carry a bomb strapped to its body, and reach a specific static target. The dog would then release the bomb by pulling with its teeth a self-releasing belt and return to the operator. The bomb could then be detonated either by a timer or remote control, though the latter was too rare and expensive at the time to be used. A group of dogs practiced this for six months, but the reports show that no dogs could master the task. They performed generally well on a single target but became confused after the target or location was changed and often returned to the operator with the bomb unreleased, which in a live situation would have killed both the dog and the operator. Continual failures brought about a simplification. The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations. Each dog was fitted with a mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the chassis were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle. ==Deployment by the Soviet Union== Military parade on Red Square, Moscow, 1 May 1938 The use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941 and 1942, when every effort was made by the Red Army to stop the German advance at the Eastern Front of World War II. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Red Army. The first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \\"special departments\\" (military counterintelligence). Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers. Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Red Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead. Another serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own diesel engine tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had gasoline engines. As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks. This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army. The efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs. This claim was considered propaganda by many Russian historians who believed it was meant to justify the dog training program. There are, however, documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen. For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near Hlukhiv, six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of Stalingrad, anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the Battle of Kursk, 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defence near Tamarovka, Bykovo. The German forces knew about the Soviet dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took measures to defend against them. An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas. After 1942, the use of anti- tank dogs by the Red Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs. However, training of anti-tank dogs continued after World War II, until June 1996. ==Use by other countries== The Imperial Japanese Army received about 25,000 dogs from their ally Germany and organized several dog training schools in Japan, and one in China at Nanjing. In 1943, U.S. forces considered using armed dogs against fortifications. The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at Fort Belvoir. The dogs, called \\"demolition wolves\\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed. In 2005, insurgents attempted to use a bomb-equipped dog during the Iraq War. The dog was detonated without inflicting damage. More often, donkeys were used, as they were more reliable. Donkeys are traditionally equipped with sacks and thus could carry a large explosive charge without looking suspicious. ==See also== *Anti-tank warfare *Animal-borne bomb attacks *Dogs in warfare *Exploding animal *Military animals as living bombs ==References External links == *Museum-Style Anti-Tank Dog Exhibit Photographs * *Собаки – истребители танков (Russian) Webarchive copy Category:Abandoned military projects of the Soviet Union Dog, anti-tank Category:Animal cruelty incidents Category:Anti-tank weapons Category:Combat occupations Category:Military animals Category:Military equipment of the Soviet Union Category:Weapon guidance Category:Working dogs Category:Dogs in warfare ","title":"Anti-tank dog"},{"id":"12383293","text":"The Javan caecilian (Ichthyophis javanicus) is a species of amphibian in the family Ichthyophiidae endemic to Indonesia.

The tail is short, about . The body width is . There are 308–317 transverse folds. The head is rounded and oval. The eyes are visible, covered by skin and slightly raised. A collection of larvae likely belonging to this species measure in total length, suggesting a relatively large size at metamorphosis. All but the largest larvae retain the lateral line system. ==Habitat and conservation== Ichthyophis mindanaoensis occurs in lowland and submontane primary and secondary rainforests at elevations of above sea level, and probably higher. It has also been recorded in agricultural land adjacent to remnant natural forest patches. Adults are subterranean and have usually been observed under rocks, decaying logs and debris, and in shallow pools of mountain streams, but also in soil beside irrigation ditches. The larvae occur in unpolluted streams, rivers, and quiet pools near streams. This species has a very localized and patchy distribution, but it can be relatively abundant where it occurs. It is threatened by habitat loss and conversion, although it seems to be fairly adaptable, and might thereby not be significantly threatened, except locally. Furthermore, caecilians often killed because they are mistaken for snakes.

It resulted in a complete Axis victory over the Red Army. After destroying five Soviet armies at Kiev in late September 1941, the German Army Group South advanced east and south to capture the industrial Donbass region and the Crimea. Within days of the battle of Kiev's conclusion, the Soviet Southern Front launched an attack on 26 September with two armies on the northern shores of the Sea of Azov against elements of the German 11th Army, which was simultaneously advancing into the Crimea. After initially pushing back the Romanian 3rd Army, which fought under German command, the Soviet advance ground to a halt when the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Brigade arrived to reinforce their Axis allies. On 1 October the 1st Panzer Army under Ewald von Kleist swept south to isolate the two Soviet armies. The offensive caught the Red Army completely by surprise, forcing them to retreat on 3 October to avoid encirclement. The Germans now attacked from the west, north and east, cutting the Soviets off on 7 October after capturing Melitopol and Berdiansk. The Soviet 9th and 18th Armies were caught in a vise and annihilated in four days. The Soviet defeat was total; 106,332 men captured, 212 tanks destroyed or captured in the pocket alone as well as 766 artillery pieces of all types. All units of the German 11th Army and the 1st Panzer Army lost 12,421 men combined from 21 September to 10 October; actual German losses in the battle were lower as only parts of both armies fought in the battle. The death of or capture of two-thirds of all Southern Front troops in four days unhinged the Front's left flank, allowing the Germans to capture Kharkiv on 24 October. Kleist's 1st Panzer Army took the Donbass region that same month, while Manstein's 11th Army was freed to conquer Crimea with its full strength from 18 October onward. ==The battle== After concluding the Battle of Kiev in September 1941, the German Army Group South advanced from the Dniepr to the Sea of Azov coast. The city of Rostov was assigned as the objective for the 11th Army now commanded by General von Schobert, however he died in a crash on the same day after landing his liaison Fieseler Storch aircraft in a minefield. To replace him, General of Infantry von Manstein was ordered to travel from the Leningrad sector of the front to the extreme southern sector. He would also receive support from the 4th Luftwaffe Air Fleet. At this time the LIV Army Corps of the 11th Army was still engaged in Crimea, and because the Romanian forces were still engaged in the Siege of Odessa, the Army's resources for the Rostov objective were severely limited even against retreating Red Army troops. Therefore, initially von Manstein replaced the LIV Corps with the smaller XXX Army Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps, and ordered the LIV Corps into the first echelon in the advance to Rostov. Late in September the 3rd Romanian Army joined the 11th Army in its advance towards Rostov, but was severely depleted by the attacks of the Soviet 9th and 18th Armies on 26 September. This forced a halt to the Army's advance to safeguard its flank, and forced Manstein to use his only mobile reserve unit, the Leibstandarte Brigade to shore up Romanian defenses.Werner Haupt, Army Group South: The Wehrmacht in Russia 1941-1945, pp. 87-91 After the LSSAH had stabilized the Romanian sector, the Soviets increased the pressure on XXX Army Corps. The Soviets did not respond to the buildup of the 1st Panzer Army on their northern flank. On 1 October the Germans started their counterattack from the north and the west. The rapid advance of German armored and motorized forces from the north compelled the Soviets to retreat on 3 October. The 11th Army took up the pursuit, with the Leibstandarte's attack eliminating the Soviet 30th Rifle Division's HQ section and dispersing its subordinate formations. Melitopol was captured by III Panzer Corps on 5 October. The LSSAH reconnaissance battalion under Kurt Meyer captured Berdiansk on 6 October. The XIV motorized Army Corps under Gustav Anton von Wietersheim linked up with the Leibstandarte to encircle seven Red Army divisions in the Mariupol-Berdiansk area on 7 October. Four days later the battle was over and the 150,000 9th and 18th Army troops caught in the pocket had been killed or captured. The Germans took more than 106,332 prisoners, both in the pocket and during the pursuit, along with 212 tanks and 772 guns of all types. The 18th Army commander Smirnov was killed in action and buried with full military honours by the Germans. ==Aftermath== First Battle of Rostov The assault on Rostov began on 17 November, and on 21 November the Germans took Rostov. However, the German lines were over-extended, and von Kleist's warnings that his left flank was vulnerable and that his tanks were ineffective in the freezing weather were ignored. On 27 November the Soviet 37th Army, commanded by Lieutenant- General Anton Ivanovich Lopatin, as part of the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation (17 November 1941 – 2 December 1941), counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city. Adolf Hitler countermanded the retreat. When von Rundstedt refused to obey, Hitler sacked him, and replaced him with von Reichenau. However, von Reichenau saw at once that von Rundstedt was right and succeeded in persuading Hitler, via Franz Halder, to authorise the withdrawal,Clark, Alan (1965). Barbarossa: The Russian-German Conflict 1941–45; p. 178 and the 1st Panzer Army was forced back to the Mius River at Taganrog. It was the first significant German withdrawal of the war. Renewed offensive The offensive along the Azov coast was resumed in the summer of 1942, during Fall Blau. With air support from the Ju 87s of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, Wilhelm List's Army Group A recaptured Rostov, the \\"gate to the Caucasus\\", on 23 July 1942 relatively easily.Hayward (2001), p. 145. Further South along the coast, the remaining small ports and coastal areas still in Soviet hands were captured by Romanian Cavalry. Yeysk fell to the Romanians on 8 August. The campaign came to an end on 23 August, when the Romanians captured the port of Temryuk after bitter house-to-house fighting against Soviet naval infantry. As Romanian troops entered the last Soviet-held Azov port, the main warships of the Soviet Azov Flotilla were scuttled to avoid capture: gunboats Bug, Don and Dniester (each of 840 tons and armed with two 130 mm guns).Robert Forczyk, The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil With the Sea of Azov secured, the Axis proceeded to launch a massive amphibious operation (Fall Blücher) in a bid to wipe out Soviet resistance on the Taman Peninsula and open the sea route to the Crimea.Malcolm H.

It may also increase or decrease noise from other sources. Activating the ground lift on a particular piece of equipment opens the connection between the equipment ground and the shielding conductor of audio cables attached to the equipment, leaving those cables grounded only at their opposite end. XLR connectors used for audio. If all pieces of equipment are tied to a common ground reference without establishing ground loop, no current flows in the ground conductors and cable shields, and no noise is introduced into signal circuits. In applications such as sound reinforcement for a concert, however, it is difficult to ensure all equipment shares a common ground reference. == Ground lift switch == Professional audio equipment intended for use with balanced lines may have a ground lift switch for the cable shield. The ground lift switch eliminates unwanted hum and buzz by interrupting the ground loops between equipment, preventing current flow along the cable shield between two devices. The switch disconnects pin 1 on the XLR jack, which is connected to the braid or foil shield in the cable and acts as the ground point of the circuit. Ground lifts do not conform to Audio Engineering Society standard AES48. ==Other ways of isolating the cable shield== Specially wired signal adaptors may leave the shield connection disconnected, or connected to safety ground through an RF bypass capacitor. Isolation transformers may be used to convert from balanced lines to single- ended inputs, and also to isolate the cable shield from the equipment safety ground. ==Safety== Removal of the safety ground connection on equipment can expose users to an increased danger of electric shock and may contradict wiring regulations.Douglas Self, Self on Audio 2nd edition, Newnes, 2006 pp. 113-116 The safety ground is disconnected by an adaptor (cheater plug) in a power lead in which the ground conductor is deliberately disconnected, or by cutting a ground pin in the power plug. If a fault develops in any line- operated equipment, cable shields and equipment enclosures may become energized, creating an electric shock hazard. For example, the metal shell of a stage microphone or the strings of a guitar may become energized, creating a hazard to performers. British musicians Leslie Harvey and Keith Relf were, in the 1970s, examples of this type of electrocution, in both cases fatal. Many other musicians have experienced electric shock due to ungrounded or improperly grounded equipment with less severe consequences. == See also == * Electromagnetic compatibility ==ReferencesExternal links== * Sound System Interconnection Category:Electrical signal connectors ","title":"Ground lift"},{"id":"12383319","text":"Ichthyophis singaporensis, the Singapore caecilian, is a species of amphibian in the family Ichthyophiidae endemic to Singapore.

His father died when he was four, leaving his mother to raise the children. The family; however, did not suffer financially due to provision being made.2 Both Werner's elementary and high school education was received in Vienna. He had several interests throughout school, including music, particularly the violin, and the sciences. At the age of 10 he became particularly interested in books containing information about the theory of Evolution. These would be the interests that shape his university experiences.1 ==Education== Werner entered Technische Hochschule, a German technical university, in 1908 with the intention of becoming an engineer. A year later, in 1909, Werner realized that this was not desire, and transferred to the University of Vienna with a new plan to become a composer and music historian. While at The University, Werner was exposed to a variety of new materials, and found that he was increasingly interested in philosophy and psychology. From 1912-1913, Werner published multiple articles, including \\"A Genetic Table of Conceptual Forms\\", his first article. His dissertation was \\"The Psychology of Esthetic Enjoyment\\", for which he was awarded a Ph.D. and graduated summa cum laude in 1914.12 ==Career== Following graduation, Werner remained at the University as an assistant, working with Sigmund Exner at the University's Institute of Physiology. From 1914-1917, following a short-term military service involvement, he conducted research, both at the University of Munich and University of Vienna. This research included rhythmic factors in perception and created melodies by children aged 2.5–5 years of age. In 1917, he became a Research Assistant to William Stern at the Psychological Institute at Hamburg. Eventually, in 1921, he was given the position of Privatdozent at University of Hamburg; a position that he remained in for twelve years.2 University of Hamburg Although involved in many disciplines at the University, Werner's the majority of his work fell into perception (including problems with perception), development, and aesthetic-expressive factors in speech. During his time at the University he was productive in his research, publishing several articles in these fields, and simultaneously carried the title of co-editor of the Zeitschrift für Psychologie. He left the position at Hamburg due to the Nazis in 1933, eventually moving to the United States to accept a position at the University of Michigan.1 ==Later life== For three years, Werner was funded by a grant at the University of Michigan. For a brief year, Werner accepted a position as a visiting professor at Harvard, but returned to Michigan the following year as a senior research psychologist at the Wayne County Training School. While at these two positions, Werner's work remained spread across several interests including: contour, metacontrast, binocular perception of depth, aesthetics, and developmental comparisons between normal functioning children and children with mental retardation. Following the death of his wife, he left the University for his first teaching position in the United States at Brooklyn College working on the effects of brain damage in 1942. Five years later, he left the University to take a position at Clark University in the Department of Psychology and Education. His research at the University, as many of his other positions, focused primarily on perception and language, and collaborated with his colleagues Seymour Wapner and Bernard Kaplan on several projects. This was the position he held for the longest, remaining at the University for 17 years.12 Awards 12 -1955: Ford Foundation Grant of $5,000 -1956: Elected to Clark chapter of Phi Beta Kappa Society -1956: Membership to American Academy of Arts and Sciences -1957 Awarded title of Ordentlicher Professor Emeritus at University of Hamburg -1960 Awarded title of Professor Emeritus at Clark University ==Distancing== Distancing is a concept arising from the work of developmental psychologists Heinz Werner and Bernard Kaplan to describe the process of establishing a subject's individuality and identity as an essential phase in coming to terms with symbols, referential language and eventually full cognition and linguistic communication. Werner and Kaplan's work was later expanded and edified into more refined therapeutic practice by the pioneer in deaf-blind patient therapy, Dr. Jan Van Dijk, and later refined by the work of Dr. Susan Bruce. ==Selected works== * Werner, H.

The body is robust and the limbs are short. In males, the snout is subelliptical or nearly acuminate in dorsal view, but more rounded in females. The tympanum is distinct, but the supra-tympanic fold is poorly developed. The canthus rostralis is rounded and indistinct. The finger tips are rounded whereas the toe tips are slightly swollen, but neither have discs. No webbing is present. Skin is smooth, but a distinct lateral fold, broken into small glandular segments, runs from the eye over the tympanum to the groin. Dorsal coloration is variable, with various shades light or dark brown, orange-brown, tan, or gray. There is a usually inconspicuous pattern of longitudinally arranged, irregular, dark marks. A light mid-dorsal stripe is usually present. The venter is usually white with some gray dotting, but occasionally very dark with many melanophores. The male advertisement call is a frequency-modulated signal, with an upward frequency sweep. ==Habitat and conservation== This occurs on the plateaus and in the coastal mountains of the Serra Geral range at elevations of above sea level. It lives in forests and pine plantations. It is associated with Araucaria angustifolia trees. Males call from the ground, mostly hidden among roots, stones, and fallen branches. Calling takes place between early afternoon and midnight, especially after showers. Because the species has not been observed close to water, it is assumed that reproduction involves foam nests and non-feeding larvae, as is common in related species. This species has a limited distribution, but it is common in its range and its populations are thought to be stable.

Taberah is described by the Torah as being three days' journey from Mount Sinai, and therefore its modern identification relies heavily on the identification of Mount Sinai.

It is endemic to Guyana. First described from the upper Potaro River based on specimens collected before 1905, it is now known from a number of sites around the Pakaraima Mountains in west-central Guyana. The specific name lutzi honors Adolfo Lutz, a Brazilian medical entomologist and parasitologist and a pioneer of herpetology. Common names Lutz's tropical bullfrog and Lutz's thin-toed frog have been coined for the species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is sub-elliptical when seen above and rounded-acute in profile. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The toe tips are expanded into small discs but lack circummarginal grooves. The forearms bear tubercles, and the lower surface of tarsus has distinct, white-tipped tubercles. The dorsal coloration is highly variable, and there are five major forms: (1) dark brown, grey or black ground color without or with a barely discernible pattern, (2) light–medium grey ground color with a well-defined pattern (a strongly marked dark brown–black inter-orbital bar and post-orbital ridges; chevron between shoulders almost continuous with round lumbar spots and irregular dark brown–black markings on the back), (3) as (2) but light grey, brown or reddish brown ground color and lighter, smaller, and much less evident/absent markings on the back, (4) similar to (2) but with dark brown to black mottling instead of well-defined markings on the back, and (5) dark grey to black ground color with large orange–orangish brown oblique lateral stripe, possibly with discernible darker markings. Most specimens have a white stripe that passes from the eye to the arm insertion, sometimes partly encompassing the tympanum. A narrow, yellow mid-dorsal stripe is often present but may be intermittent. The posterior surfaces of thighs are black with distinct yellow, orange, or red spotting or mottling. Males have yellow to orangish yellow throats and bellies. Vocal sac is internal. ==Reproduction== Kok and colleagues hypothesize that males use their shovel-shaped snouts to excavate underground nesting chambers. Reproduction takes place during the wettest part of the year—excavation of egg chambers requires wet soils. The male advertisement call is a sequence of regular notes repeated about 17–23 times per minute. The dominant frequency is about 3300–3600 Hz. Female fecundity is 3–10 eggs. ==Habitat and conservation== Adenomera lutzi occurs lowland and montane tropical primary forests at elevations of above sea level. It is a primarily nocturnal that lives in and on leaf litter. Reproduction does not depend on bodies of water. This species can be locally common. There are no known threats to it. It occurs in an area of undisturbed remote forest, and it is also known from the Kaieteur National Park. ==References== lutzi Category:Endemic fauna of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians described in 1975 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Adenomera lutzi"},{"id":"12383460","text":"Leptodactylus marmoratus, commonly known as the marbled tropical bullfrog, is a common species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.

The widespread taxon is now recognized as a distinct species, Adenomera saci. ==Etymology== The specific name martinezi honours Antonio Martínez, an Argentine entomologist. Common name Martinez's tropical bullfrog has been coined for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on just one specimen, in snout–vent length. The snout is pointed in dorsal view and acuminate in lateral view; in males, the snout tip has a well-developed, shovel-like fleshy ridge. The tympanum and supratympanic fold are present. The finger tips are rounded but not expanded, without webbing or fringing. The toe tips are unexpanded and unflattened; no webbing is present. Dorsal coloration consists of 4–6 symmetrically arranged rows of longitudinal dark-colored spots on moss green (male) or grayish brown (female) background. Cream-colored vertebral stripe is present. The belly is uniformly yellow. Males have an internal, subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call is long (63–151 ms) with 15–21 pulses; it is audibly pulsed even to the human ear. ==Habitat and conservation== Adenomera martinezi occurs in grassy field environments associated with rock outcrops in sandy/muddy soil. The type locality is at a transitional Cerrado/Amazonian region. Males call after nightfall within underground chambers or from exposed calling sites, typically among grassy tufts. The assessment of the conservation status of this species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) predates redelimitation of this species, necessitating a reassessment. Given its very restricted known distribution, Adenomera martinezi should probably be classified as \\"near threatened\\" species. ==References== martinezi Category:Frogs of South America Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1956 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Adenomera martinezi"},{"id":"12383467","text":"Alsodes australis is a species of frog in the family Alsodidae found in western Argentina and eastern Chile (Aysén Region) from 46°25′S to 42°25′N.

It is featured each week on the cover of the online magazine Salon. The show has been airing on the website since January 2007 and stars two rabbits: Buns, a gray male rabbit, and Chou Chou, a black and white female rabbit. == Overview == The internet show stars Buns (a brown dwarf rabbit) and Chou Chou (an English Lop), two rabbits who critique popular culture from the chairs in their living room. Rabbit Bites began as a good-natured, yet harsh critique of the current state of Internet video and vlogging in particular. Rabbit Bites has satirized many of the video creators who were central in popularizing web video, on which it originally focused. After 6 months, Rabbit Bites started to examine popular culture and give opinions in the rabbits' typical \\"biting\\" style. Buns and Chou Chou have covered topics ranging from television shows, such as American Idol and To Catch A Predator, to celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and Britney Spears, and general pop culture topics, such as the iPhone. Now, Rabbit Bites continues in this format as a social critique, particularly of celebrity, attitudes about wealth and luxury, and the death of culture. The show also has two additional components in some episodes. Chou Chou has her own show, called Coffee With Chou. It's a talk show with Chou Chou as the host and Buns as the sidekick. Chou Chou has done real interviews with author Andrew Keen and blogger Robert Scoble, as well as fake interviews, created by editing previous interview footage with celebrities. Chou Chou has done interviews in this style with stars such as Paris Hilton and Eli Roth. Since the show began, real guests include David Alan Grier, William Redpath, Greg Fitzsimmons, Dana Snyder, Bobby Lee, Tom Papa, Michael Ian Black, Jane Lynch, Carbon Silicon, Patton Oswalt, Janeane Garofalo, and the band They Might Be Giants. The third component of the show is a \\"man on the street\\" segment, in which the rabbits ask one of their correspondents to go out and seek responses from the public. The first of these was done by Nalts, who is popular on YouTube, in regards to finding out about Generation Y and its need for praise. == Philosophical and historical references == Although the show is mostly a critique of pop culture, it does contain some hidden meanings and references to art and history. Plato's Allegory of the Cave has been referenced in two episodes. An older one about the podcast \\"Amyville\\", and a more recent one about horror films, such as Hostel and Saw. In an episode about the infamous Alec Baldwin voicemail message, Buns and Chou Chou talk about how the camera obscura is present in life. An early episode about Robert Scoble features paintings by Piet Mondrian. An early episode about The Long Tail features the Tower of Babel. Two episodes feature the idea and significance of mirror images. An episode covering CSI features mirror images in a painting by Vermeer. Also, an episode covering blogger Ryanne Hodson features the rabbits mentioning mirror images when Hodson holds a stained glass piece that is made to look like her. == In the media == In addition to being featured each week on Salon, the show has been featured on the YouTube homepage, as well as the Yahoo! Video homepage. The show has won The 9 on Yahoo! twice and has been featured in the British newspaper The Guardian. Amanda Congdon covered the show and interviewed Buns, Chou Chou, and Quixote on her series Amanda Across America, and the show has also been mentioned in the New York Times as being \\"twisted and sublime\\". == References == * * *  Notes  == External links == *Rabbit Bites official website *Rabbit Bites on Salon.com Category:Internet broadcasting ","title":"Rabbit Bites"},{"id":"12383488","text":"Alsodes igneus is a species of frogs in the family Alsodidae endemic to Chile; it is only known from its type locality, Tolhuaca National Park, Malleco Province, on the western slopes of the Andes.

This rare species is endemic to southern Chile where it is known from two specimens, the holotype that was collected from Puerto Edén (Wellington Island), and one paratype from Seno Huemules on the mainland. ==Etymology== The specific name kaweshkari refers to Kaweshkar Indians, \\"brave people\\" and hunters of sea lions who live in Puerto Edén. ==Description== Both type specimens are males. They measure in snout–vent length (i.e., large in comparison to most other Alsodes). The body is robust. The flanks and dorsal surfaces are granular, as is the skin around vent and posterior thighs. The ventral skin is smooth with minute granules. The dorsum, arms, and legs are brown; the areas around nostrils, lips and, eyes are light brown. The iris has a coppery reticulum. Belly is whitish yellow. The tympanum is absent. The toes are fringed and have some webbing at their bases. The fingers are unwebbed. However, fingers have some spines in males—a secondary sex characteristic, as are the black patches of keratinous spines in the chest. The holotype was destroyed by fire on 3 December 2007. ==Habitat and conservation== Both locations have small forests composed of Nothofagus betuloides, Embothrium coccineum, Maytenus magellanica, and Drimys winteri, surrounded by tundra. One specimen was collected under a log at the forest-tundra border, the other by a small stream, both near the sea level ( asl).

At the time of the assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2012 (published 2013), the species was known from six streams (five in Argentina and one in Chile) in an area encompassing some 9 km². A study published in 2013 extended the known range a few kilometers west and included another Chilean stream. ==Habitat== Alsodes pehuenche is an aquatic frog. It is found primarily in galleries inside small permanent snowmelt streams with stony banks, covered by herbaceous vegetation; it can also be found in ponds and swamps derived from snowmelt. The altitude of its habitat is between asl. ==Description== Males in two Chilean locations measured on average and females in snout–vent length. The body is bulky and extremities are robust. The head is wide with snout that is short and rounded. The dorsal coloration is light brown with diffuse, irregular, darker blotches. There are sometimes dispersed yellowish blotches that are more frequent in females. ==Life cycle== This frog has very slow development: time to metamorphosis is estimated to be at least four winters. ==Conservation status== The streams A. pehuenche inhabits are impacted by paving the highway in their catchment. This has already impacted the hydrology and it may affect water quality, particularly because of salting of the highway in winter. Additional threats are waste from tourists and tramping by livestock.

Prior to the duo's formation in 1992, both brothers were members of The Kentucky Headhunters, a Southern rock-influenced country rock band. In 1993, Brother Phelps charted with its debut single \\"Let Go\\", which reached a peak of No. 6 on the Billboard country music charts. In all, the duo charted six singles between 1993 and 1995 (although only one other single reached Top 40), in addition to recording two albums on Asylum Records. Brother Phelps disbanded in 1995, with Doug rejoining the Kentucky Headhunters as lead singer, and Ricky Lee assuming a solo career. ==Biography== The Brothers are Ricky Lee Phelps, who was born in Edmonton, Kentucky, and Doug Phelps who was born in Leachville, Arkansas, in 1960. They were raised in the Missouri Bootheel and Doug graduated from a small school named Southland in Cardwell, Missouri. They joined The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986. Ricky Lee served as lead vocalist, while Doug played bass guitar and sang backup vocals. The Kentucky Headhunters released its debut album, Pickin' on Nashville, in 1989, producing four Top 40 singles on the country charts with it. After the band's second album, 1991's Electric Barnyard, failed to produce a major hit, Ricky Lee and Doug announced that they were leaving to form their own group. Mark Orr then became lead singer of The Kentucky Headhunters, while Anthony Kenney took over as bass guitarist. The newly formed duo (named Brother Phelps, after Ricky Lee and Doug's minister father), signed to Asylum Records in 1992. Unlike the country rock sounds of The Kentucky Headhunters, Brother Phelps featured a more traditional country music sound. Their first single, \\"Let Go\\", reached a peak of No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts in 1993, higher than any of The Kentucky Headhunters' singles had peaked. The same year, the duo's first album (also titled Let Go) was released. Brother Phelps' second and final album, Any Way the Wind Blows (its title track a J. J. Cale cover), was released in 1995 to critical acclaim, although it failed to produce any Top 40 singles. The duo disbanded in 1995, with Doug returning to the Kentucky Headhunters, assuming the role of lead vocalist after Orr's departure. Ricky Lee, meanwhile, continued to record as a solo artist. ==Discography== Albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Album details ! colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"45\\" US Country ! width=\\"45\\" US Heat - ! scope=\\"row\\" Let Go  * Release date: August 3, 1993 * Label: Asylum Records  56  21 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Any Way the Wind Blows  * Release date: March 7, 1995 * Label: Asylum Records  43  24 } Singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Single ! colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"45\\" US Country ! width=\\"45\\" CAN Country -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1993 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Let Go\\"  6  8  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" Let Go - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Were You Really Livin'\\"  28  54 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1994 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Eagle over Angel\\"  53  54 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Ever-Changing Woman\\"  62  90 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1995 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Any Way the Wind Blows\\"  53  48  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Any Way the Wind Blows - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Not So Different After All\\"  65  77 } Music videos { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !

It has close connections with definability in second-order arithmetic and with weak systems of set theory such as Kripke–Platek set theory. It is an important tool in effective descriptive set theory. The central focus of hyperarithmetic theory is the sets of natural numbers known as hyperarithmetic sets. There are three equivalent ways of defining this class of sets; the study of the relationships between these different definitions is one motivation for the study of hyperarithmetical theory. == Hyperarithmetical sets and definability == The first definition of the hyperarithmetic sets uses the analytical hierarchy. A set of natural numbers is classified at level \\\\Sigma^1_1 of this hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only existential set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers. A set is classified at level \\\\Pi^1_1 of the analytical hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only universal set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers. A set is \\\\Delta^1_1 if it is both \\\\Sigma^1_1 and \\\\Pi^1_1. The hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the \\\\Delta^1_1 sets. == Hyperarithmetical sets and iterated Turing jumps: the hyperarithmetical hierarchy== The definition of hyperarithmetical sets as \\\\Delta^1_1 does not directly depend on computability results. A second, equivalent, definition shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be defined using infinitely iterated Turing jumps. This second definition also shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be classified into a hierarchy extending the arithmetical hierarchy; the hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the sets that are assigned a rank in this hierarchy. Each level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy corresponds to a countable ordinal number (ordinal), but not all countable ordinals correspond to a level of the hierarchy. The ordinals used by the hierarchy are those with an ordinal notation, which is a concrete, effective description of the ordinal. An ordinal notation is an effective description of a countable ordinal by a natural number. A system of ordinal notations is required in order to define the hyperarithmetic hierarchy. The fundamental property an ordinal notation must have is that it describes the ordinal in terms of small ordinals in an effective way. The following inductive definition is typical; it uses a pairing function \\\\langle \\\\cdot , \\\\cdot\\\\rangle. * The number 0 is a notation for the ordinal 0. * If n is a notation for an ordinal λ then \\\\langle 1, n \\\\rangle is a notation for λ \\\\+ 1; * Suppose that δ is a limit ordinal. A notation for δ is a number of the form \\\\langle 2, e\\\\rangle, where e is the index of a total computable function \\\\phi_e such that for each n, \\\\phi_e(n) is a notation for an ordinal λn less than δ and δ is the sup of the set \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_n \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\}. There are only countably many ordinal notations, since each notation is a natural number; thus there is a countable ordinal which is the supremum of all ordinals that have a notation. This ordinal is known as the Church-Kleene ordinal and is denoted \\\\omega^{CK}_1. Note that this ordinal is still countable, the symbol being only an analogy with the first uncountable ordinal, \\\\omega_{1}. The set of all natural numbers that are ordinal notations is denoted \\\\mathcal{O} and called Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}. Ordinal notations are used to define iterated Turing jumps. These are sets of natural numbers denoted 0^{(\\\\delta)} for each \\\\delta < \\\\omega^{CK}_1. Suppose that δ has notation e. The set 0^{(\\\\delta)} is defined using e as follows. * If δ = 0 then 0^{(\\\\delta)}= 0 is the empty set. * If δ = λ \\\\+ 1 then 0^{(\\\\delta)} is the Turing jump of 0^{(\\\\lambda)}. The notations 0' and 0 are commonly used for 0^{(1)} and 0^{(2)}, respectively. * If δ is a limit ordinal, let \\\\langle \\\\lambda_n \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\rangle be the sequence of ordinals less than δ given by the notation e. The set 0^{(\\\\delta)} is given by the rule 0^{(\\\\delta)} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle n,i\\\\rangle \\\\mid i \\\\in 0^{(\\\\lambda_n)}\\\\\\\\}. This is the effective join of the sets 0^{(\\\\lambda_n)}. Although the construction of 0^{(\\\\delta)} depends on having a fixed notation for δ, and each infinite ordinal has many notations, a theorem of Spector shows that the Turing degree of 0^{(\\\\delta)} depends only on δ, not on the particular notation used, and thus 0^{(\\\\delta)} is well defined up to Turing degree. The hyperarithmetical hierarchy is defined from these iterated Turing jumps. A set X of natural numbers is classified at level δ of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, for \\\\delta < \\\\omega^{CK}_1, if X is Turing reducible to 0^{(\\\\delta)}. There will always be a least such δ if there is any; it is this least δ that measures the level of uncomputability of X. == Hyperarithmetical sets and recursion in higher types == A third characterization of the hyperarithmetical sets, due to Kleene, uses higher- type computable functionals. The type-2 functional {}^2E\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{N}^{\\\\mathbb{N}} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} is defined by the following rules: :{}^2E(f) = 1 \\\\quad if there is an i such that f(i) > 0, :{}^2E(f) = 0 \\\\quad if there is no i such that f(i) > 0. Using a precise definition of computability relative to a type-2 functional, Kleene showed that a set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetical if and only if it is computable relative to {}^2E. == Example: the truth set of arithmetic == Every arithmetical set is hyperarithmetical, but there are many other hyperarithmetical sets. One example of a hyperarithmetical, nonarithmetical set is the set T of Gödel numbers of formulas of Peano arithmetic that are true in the standard natural numbers \\\\mathbb{N}. The set T is Turing equivalent to the set 0^{(\\\\omega)}, and so is not high in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, although it is not arithmetically definable by Tarski's indefinability theorem. == Fundamental results == The fundamental results of hyperarithmetic theory show that the three definitions above define the same collection of sets of natural numbers. These equivalences are due to Kleene. Completeness results are also fundamental to the theory. A set of natural numbers is \\\\Pi^1_1 complete if it is at level \\\\Pi^1_1 of the analytical hierarchy and every \\\\Pi^1_1 set of natural numbers is many-one reducible to it. The definition of a \\\\Pi^1_1 complete subset of Baire space (\\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}) is similar. Several sets associated with hyperarithmetic theory are \\\\Pi^1_1 complete: * Kleene's \\\\mathcal{O}, the set of natural numbers that are notations for ordinal numbers * The set of natural numbers e such that the computable function \\\\phi_e(x,y) computes the characteristic function of a well ordering of the natural numbers. These are the indices of recursive ordinals. * The set of elements of Baire space that are the characteristic functions of a well ordering of the natural numbers (using an effective isomorphism \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{N}^{\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{N}}). Results known as \\\\Sigma^1_1 bounding follow from these completeness results. For any \\\\Sigma^1_1 set S of ordinal notations, there is an \\\\alpha < \\\\omega^{CK}_1 such that every element of S is a notation for an ordinal less than \\\\alpha. For any subset T of Baire space consisting only of characteristic functions of well orderings, there is an \\\\alpha < \\\\omega^{CK}_1 such that each ordinal represented in T is less than \\\\alpha. == Relativized hyperarithmeticity and hyperdegrees == The definition of \\\\mathcal{O} can be relativized to a set X of natural numbers: in the definition of an ordinal notation, the clause for limit ordinals is changed so that the computable enumeration of a sequence of ordinal notations is allowed to use X as an oracle. The set of numbers that are ordinal notations relative to X is denoted \\\\mathcal{O}^X. The supremum of ordinals represented in \\\\mathcal{O}^X is denoted \\\\omega^{X}_1; this is a countable ordinal no smaller than \\\\omega^{CK}_1. The definition of 0^{(\\\\delta)} can also be relativized to an arbitrary set X of natural numbers. The only change in the definition is that X^{(0)} is defined to be X rather than the empty set, so that X^{(1)} = X' is the Turing jump of X, and so on. Rather than terminating at \\\\omega^{CK}_1 the hierarchy relative to X runs through all ordinals less than \\\\omega^{X}_1. The relativized hyperarithmetical hierarchy is used to define hyperarithmetical reducibility. Given sets X and Y, we say X \\\\leq_{HYP} Y if and only if there is a \\\\delta < \\\\omega^Y_1 such that X is Turing reducible to Y^{(\\\\delta)}. If X \\\\leq_{HYP} Y and Y \\\\leq_{HYP} X then the notation X \\\\equiv_{HYP} Y is used to indicate X and Y are hyperarithmetically equivalent. This is a coarser equivalence relation than Turing equivalence; for example, every set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetically equivalent to its Turing jump but not Turing equivalent to its Turing jump. The equivalence classes of hyperarithmetical equivalence are known as hyperdegrees. The function that takes a set X to \\\\mathcal{O}^X is known as the hyperjump by analogy with the Turing jump. Many properties of the hyperjump and hyperdegrees have been established. In particular, it is known that Post's problem for hyperdegrees has a positive answer: for every set X of natural numbers there is a set Y of natural numbers such that X <_{HYP} Y <_{HYP} \\\\mathcal{O}^X. == Generalizations == Hyperarithmetical theory is generalized by α-recursion theory, which is the study of definable subsets of admissible ordinals. Hyperarithmetical theory is the special case in which α is \\\\omega^{CK}_1. ==Relation to other hierarchies References == * H. Rogers, Jr., 1967.

It is monotypic, being represented by a single species, Atopophrynus syntomopus, also known as the Sonson frog. Its taxonomic placement within the superfamily Brachycephaloidea is uncertain, although many sources place it in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to Colombia and only known from its type series from Sonsón, in the Cordillera Central, Antioquia Department. ==Description== The type series consists of three adult females, all measuring about in snout–vent length. The head is narrower than the body. The snout is short, oval in dorsal view and protruding in lateral view. Tympanum is absent. The canthus rostralis is rounded. Skin is smooth apart from a few scattered subconical tubercles dorsally. The fingers are basally webbed and, except the first one, bearing obvious rounded pads. The toes are almost fully webbed and bearing broad discs. Dorsal coloration is red with green markings overlain with white flecks, especially on the flanks. The lower parts are pale olive with blue-white spots edged with brown. The digital tips are yellow. The iris is bright copper. All females were carrying large eggs in their ovaries; one of them had 12 eggs ) in diameter. ==Habitat and conservation== The species is only known from three specimens that were collected in 1981 during daytime on wet rocks very close to a stream in primary forest at above sea level. Despite numerous surveys to the area of the type locality, no further specimens have been found. At present, the habitat at the type locality is completely degraded. It is unclear whether the species survives at or near the type locality. ==References== Category:Craugastoridae Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Amphibians described in 1982 Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Atopophrynus"},{"id":"12383612","text":"WHCL-FM (88.7 FM) is an independent, non-profit, and educational college radio station licensed to the Trustees of Hamilton College operating out of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, United States. It is the only radio station in the town of Clinton. The station serves the Utica area and broadcasts a variety of music around the Mohawk Valley. The station is student-run with a community adviser. == Format == The format of WHCL has been freeform since its inception. Every semester, a weekly schedule is set comprising student, professor, and community member shows. These shows start on the top of the hour and typically last for either one or two hours. Due to the large student investment, there is a wide diversity of radio music on the show; including indie, rap, world music, country, and metal. Several professors also host shows relating to their subject of discourse, including Latin music, theatrical dramas and jazz. These music shows are also interspersed with several talk shows covering a breadth of topics, including sports discussion, politics, lyrical analysis, pop culture and culinary discourse. Specialty shows are occasionally held for notable events, including sports programming and fundraising events for alumni. At least one non-student-operated show runs on the station: Gary Sroka's \\"Saturday Polka Review,\\" formerly on WUTQ and WUSP, moved to WHCL in late 2015 after WUSP suddenly shut down. The station is in operation during the academic year and over the summer, typically between the hours of 6 AM to 2 AM, but does not operate overnight. Overnight, there is a setup that pulls various songs from a large playlist interspersed with PSAs and the WHCL call. The station does not operate between scheduled programs which are listed on the website. A stream of the broadcasting audio is available on the website. == Development == In its early years, WHCL was a low-power station confined to the college campus, and its 2.5 watt signal was monaural. By the mid-1980s, however, it had expanded to 270 watts, with stereophonic broadcasting to the entire Mohawk Valley. == Community == The WHCL Executive Board hosts a publication and a variety of events for the campus community. The Radio Board creates a biweekly (every other week) publication called The Wattage which chronicles new album reviews, music thought pieces, community answers to questions, and the broadcasting schedule. WHCL is also responsible for hosting and funding concerts for students on the Hamilton College campus, with various artists including Cloud Nothings, Snail Mail, Varsity, and Diet Cig. The station also hosts CD drives to benefit the station and community. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Hamilton College (New York) HCL-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1941 ","title":"WHCL-FM"},{"id":"12383617","text":"Barycholos pulcher is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It has also been introduced to the upper part of the Mantaro River, but it is unclear if this population persists. It is found both in large marshy lakes and smaller deep lakes.

Females grow larger than males. The tadpoles also grow very large, up to about in length. ==Conservation and threats== Once common, this frog is now rare and considered endangered by the IUCN. During a survey in 2012 it was only found at about 10% of the visited sites and in low densities, leading to the suggestion of recognizing it as critically endangered. The primary threats to the species are capture for human consumption, predation by introduced trout, pollution from mining, agriculture and human waste, and water fluctuations caused by the Upamayo Dam. These factors have also contributed to the decline of the native Orestias pupfish, historically an important part of the diet of the frog, but not recorded in a recent study of its diet. Although not yet detected in T. macrostomus, some of its relatives have strongly declined due to diseases like chytridiomycosis and Ranavirus. Mass deaths have occurred in T. macrostomus, with a particular large one in 1996, but the reason for this is unknown. Much of its range is within reserves, but protection is insufficient. Local and national groups, partially funded internationally, have started monitoring and conservation projects for this species, and education for the people living in its range. In 2008, an experimental captive breeding program was initiated at two centers at Lake Junin and it resulted in a few thousand tadpoles, but this project ceased in 2012. Following progress and success with the captive breeding program for the related Titicaca water frog, it is planned to expand it to the Junin species at Huachipa Zoo in Lima. ==See also== * Goliath frog (Conraua goliath) – the world's largest frog from Africa * Helmeted water toad (Calyptocephalella gayi) – a very large aquatic to semi-aquatic species from Chile ==References== also Arias Carlos S. 2003 UNIVERSIDAD RICARDO PALMA ESTADO DE CONSERVACION Y ANALISIS DE LOS FACTORES CRITICOS PARA LA VIABILIDAD POBLACIONAL DE Batrachophrynus macrostomus (Peters,1873) \\" RANA DE JUNIN \\" Tesis para optar el Titulo Profesional de Licenciado en Biología https://www.academia.edu/34643967/UNIVERSIDAD_RICARDO_PALMA_ESTADO_DE_CONSERVACION_Y_ANALISIS_DE_LOS_FACTORES_CRITICOS_PARA_LA_VIABILIDAD_POBLACIONAL_DE_Batrachophrynus_macrostomus_Peters_1873_RANA_DE_JUNIN_Tesis_para_optar_el_Titulo_Profesional_de_Licenciado_en_Biolog%C3%ADa UNFOUORTUNATELY I CALLED DENVER ZOO I GOT IN CONTACT WITH MANY PEOPLE BUT THE WORKS FOR JUNIN FROG ARE NOT WORKING OR NO ONE WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING i HOPE THAT SOMEONE WILL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS IVE BEEN TRYING THIS SINCE 2000 unfourtunately due to lack of information , expertise this frogs are being lost! macrostomus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Endangered animals Category:Endangered biota of South America Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1873 ","title":"Telmatobius macrostomus"},{"id":"12383649","text":"Year's Best SF 7 is a science fiction anthology edited by David G.

It is endemic to Chile and known from the Los Lagos and Aysén Regions between Villa O'Higgins in the south and Kent and Melchor Islands in the north; there is a record from Alao Island further north but this might represent Batrachyla taeniata. The specific name nibaldoi honors , Chilean marine biologist, in recognition of his \\"remarkable contribution to the development of the zoology in Chile\\". Common name Nibaldo's wood frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult females measure in snout–vent length; male length is not reported. The snout is rounded in dorsal view and sloping in lateral profile. The tympanum is visible; the supra-tympanic fold is evident. The fingers and toes are slender and have moderately pointed tips. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have thin, basal webbing. Dorsal ground color is from light brown or yellowish brown to grayish, with dark brown spots that forming longitudinal lines. There is a dark canthal band, continuing behind the eye to the tympanic region. The ventrum is white. ==Habitat and conservation== Batrachyla nibaldoi occur in steppe habitat in valleys surrounded by forest of Nothofagus antarctica, Nothofagus betuloides and Drymis winteri. They are often found under logs rocks and in shrub habitat. Males call from lagoons and temporary pools with plenty of vegetation. Eggs are laid under rocks and moss and when rain floods, larvae develop in the water. This species is locally abundant, including along the Carretera Austral. Its range includes protected areas, e.g., Laguna San Rafael National Park. The introduced American mink is a potential threat. ==References== nibaldoi Category:Amphibians of Patagonia Category:Amphibians of Chile Category:Endemic fauna of Chile Category:Amphibians described in 1997 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Batrachyla nibaldoi"},{"id":"12383688","text":"Batrachyla taeniata is a species of frog in the family Batrachylidae.

Its noble figure makes the town hall the most characteristic landmark of the town. The town hall is the seat of the Mayor and The Town Council administration. In front of the town hall's façade there is a town's historical pillory. It goes back to the first half of the 17th century. Szydłowiec's pillory is a unique monument of the kind in Poland.

It is found in Ecuador and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and sandy shores. Its geographical range is very fragmented; it has a total area of about 20,000 km2 and is continuously shrinking due to human activities. ==Reproduction== Breeding is triggered by heavy rain fall and Pacific horned frogs reproduce explosively over the course of a single night. Typically, Pacific horned frogs lay underground during day and they are most active after sundown. Male frogs reproduce by approaching females both on land and shallow water and clasp on to the female, in a variation of axillary amplexus, in other word called \\"neck amplexus\\".Székely D, Székely P, Denoël M, Cogălniceanu D.

Outside the breeding season adults remain buried underground but emerge during the first heavy rains to breed in temporary ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture and wood extraction. It is also collected for pet trade. ==References== Category:Ceratophryidae Category:Amphibians described in 1948 Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Chacophrys"},{"id":"12383761","text":"A list of Western films released from 1950 to 1954. {  - !

It is endemic to Guatemala and only known from its type locality near Aldea Vista Hermosa, on the northern slopes of the eastern portion of the Sierra de las Minas, where the type series was collected in 1980–1981. ==Etymology== The specific name adamastus honors Jay M. Savage, in recognition of \\"his many contributions to herpetology, especially in the area of the biology of Eleutherodactylus\\" (n.b.—this species was originally described as Eleutherodactylus adamastus). It is derived from the Greek adamastos that means \\"untamed, wild, or savage\\". ==Description== The type series consists of seven individuals Three adult males and two adult females were measured: the males measure and the females in snout–vent length. The snout is ovoid in dorsal view and truncate in profile. The canthus rostralis is well-defined. The tympanum is distinct in males and indistinct in females. The fingers and toes bear discs; the toes have moderate webbing while the fingers are unwebbed. The upper parts of the body, flanks, and upper surface of limbs are strongly granular. The largest tubercles are on the flanks. Dorsal coloration is more or less uniformly brown, but most specimens have a weak inter-orbital bar and a marking below the eye. The larger tubercles are mostly gray. The venter is yellowish to cream with numerous dark brown melanophores that make a vermiculate pattern on belly and thighs. ==Habitat and conservation== This species is known from an undisturbed forest, transitional between premontane moist and premontane wet forest, at about above sea level. Individuals were mostly seen perched on leaf litter or rocks along or near streams, but one individuals was under a rock near a stream. Craugastor adamastus is threatened by habitat loss caused by agricultural activity and wood extraction, and by water pollution. The type locality, however, is in the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve. Chytridiomycosis is possibly behind the dramatic declines seen in many other stream-dwelling frogs, and could also affect this species. ==References== adamastus Category:Endemic fauna of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians described in 1994 Category:Taxa named by Jonathan A.

It is found in Guatemala and Mexico. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest. It is threatened by habitat loss. Many populations are attracted to living in or near cave entrances, due to orthopterans and other food sources. They are categorized by having truncated digital pads on their two outer fingers and each fifth toe extends longer than the third. A subspecies of Craugastor alfredi was recently discovered in the Honduras called Craugastor cyanochthebius. ==References== * * alfredi Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians described in 1898 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Craugastor alfredi"},{"id":"12383785","text":"Craugastor amniscola is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae. It is found in western Guatemala and in Chiapas, Mexico. The specific name amniscola is derived from Latin amnis for rivulet and -cola for dweller and refers to the habitat of this species. Accordingly, common name rivulet rainfrog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males can reach at least and adult females at least in snout–vent length. The snout is subacuminate in dorsal view and round in lateral view. Males have a few scattered, large, flat or rounded tubercles in their upper eyelids. The tympanum is distinct. The finger and toe discs are weakly developed. The fingers have weak lateral keels while the toes have lateral flanges and moderate webbing. The upper parts are medium to olive brown, with heavy black mottling on the back. The limbs have moderately distinct crossbars. The flanks and the groin are whitish with irregular brown or black mottling. The venter is whitish or cream. ==Habitat and conservation== Craugastor amniscola inhabits premontane dry forests along small tributary streams at elevations of above sea level. Development is direct, i.e., there is no free-living larval stage. This species is threatened by habitat loss and water pollution. Chytridiomycosis is a potential threat. ==References== amniscola Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Taxa named by Jonathan A.

It is found in the Mira River drainage in extreme northern Ecuador and in adjacent southern Colombia (Nariño, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca Departments) in foothills and lower cloud forest on the Pacific lowlands and slopes of the Cordillera Occidental. It altitudinal range is asl. Specific name refers to the extensive foot webbing of the species: it is a compound of the Latin anatis (of a duck) and pes (foot). ==Description== Strabomantis anatipes is a large species: males measure more than and females > in snout–vent length. In males, skin of dorsum bears numerous pimple like spinules and a pair of sinuous postorbital ridges, but is smooth with low tubercles, short ridges, and postorbital ridges in females. They are greenish brown with orangish warts and ridges. Groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs are dull yellow with black reticulation. Throat is white with brown vermiculations. Venter and undersides of limbs are yellow. Iris is bright copper with black flecks and a brown horizontal streak. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are forests, from tropical moist lowland forest to lower cloud forest. It is closely associated with small streams. It is nocturnal, sitting on rocks, very steep cliffs, or in rocky crevices alongside streams. Strabomantis anatipes is a very uncommon species. It is believed to be declining in abundance. Habitat loss caused by agricultural development, logging, and human settlement is probably the main threat to it. Also pollution from spraying illegal crops is a significant threat. ==ReferencesExternal links== * anatipes Category:Amphibians described in 1983 Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Strabomantis anatipes"},{"id":"12383794","text":"A list of Western films released in the 1960s. {  - !

It was endemic to the Cordillera de Celaque in Honduras. Its natural habitats were moist premontane and lower montane forests. It lived on the ground along streams. Craugastor anciano was an extremely rare species that is now considered extinct. Chytridiomycosis is a possible reason, although habitat loss may have also contributed. ==References== anciano Category:Endemic fauna of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Frogs of North America Category:Amphibian extinctions since 1500 Category:Amphibians described in 1988 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Craugastor anciano"},{"id":"12383800","text":"Craugastor andi is a species of rain frog in the family Craugastoridae which has not been seen since 1990. It is found in the Caribbean drainage of Costa Rica in the mountains and hills of the Cordillera Central and the far northeastern Cordillera de Talamanca, and in extreme northwestern Panama. Frank and Ramus (1995) give it the vernacular name Atlantic robber frog. It is known locally in Spanish by the generic names, used for many species, of rana de hojarasca, ranita or sapito.Pounds, A. & Bolaños, F. (2004). Craugastor andi. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 22 July 2007. ==Taxonomy== This species was first described in 1974 by Jay M. Savage as Eleutherodactylus andi, who split it from the no longer recognised waste- basket taxon E. palmatus. The holotype was collected at , some north from the juncture of the Claro River and the Hondura River, in Vázquez de Coronado canton, San Jose Province, Costa Rica. Stephen Blair Hedges classified it in the subgenus Craugastor in 1989. A phylogenetic analysis using DNA by Crawford and Smith, published 2005, indicated it should be moved into a new genus. It was formally moved to genus Craugastor by Frost et al. in 2006. Hedges, Duellman and Heinicke classified it in subgenus Craugastor of the genus Craugastor in 2008. It was formerly classified in the family Leptodactylidae, but as of 2014 is placed in the family Craugastoridae. Lynch and Duellman classified it in the species group of E. fitzingeri in 1997. In 2000 Lynch removed it from said group. Savage places it in a E. fitzingeri series in the E. fitzingeri group in 2002. Hedges, Duellman and Heinicke then place it in the Craugastor fitzingeri series of the species group of C. melanostictus in 2008, which was followed by Padial, Grant, and Frost in 2014. Etymology When he first described it Savage dedicated this species to Dr. Andrew Starrett, his \\"good friend and Costa Rican field companion\\"; the specific name andi has no actual meaning in Latin, Savage states the word is just \\"an arbitrary combination of letters\\". ==Description== Female Craugastor andi are relatively large and can grow to in snout–vent length, whereas males are smaller, up to SVL. The head is rather narrow, with a long, pointed snout. It is 30 to 43% as wide as long. The limbs are only slightly webbed, there is a minute membrane between the third and fourth fingers, which extends at most only a little beyond the first subarticular tubercle of each digit, whereas the feet have a thin web between all five of the digits; it extends to the subarticular tubercle between the first to third digits, from the third to fifth it extends slightly beyond this tubercle. The third and fourth fingers are tipped with enlarged ball or disc-like pads, the other digits have much smaller discs, the feet smaller than the hands. The discs of the hands are equal to or wider than the tubercles. The skin of the back can be either smooth with some warts, but is never tuberculate. Adult males have nuptial pads and vocal slits. The dorsum (back) is dark brown, sometimes with a thin, light mid-dorsal stripe running down the centre of its back. The ventral surface has a white background colouration, sometimes tinged yellow or reddish on the undersides of the thighs and towards the end of the creature, and is covered with dark splotches. The groin and the back of the thighs are coloured chocolate brown with bright yellow dots or broad stripes on living specimens. The throat is dark brown or solid black, a lighter-coloured stripe runs down it. The iris is coloured coppery gold and is split through the middle with a horizontal dark brown line. Living specimens are more colourful than dead animals, the ventral surface is then described as bright yellow, usually tinged with salmon-pink. It has a karyotype of 2n=22. ==Distribution== As of 2002 it has been collected from the Costa Rican mountain ranges (cordilleras) of the Guanacaste, Tilarán, Volcánica Central and the north of the Talamanca. It was seen in Panama some time before 2010 along the Río Claro in Bocas del Toro Province. ==Ecology== Habitat The native habitat of Craugastor andi is tropical, wet premontane rainforest with bromeliads, usually close to streams, at elevations of to above sea level. Savage (2002) states that it has mostly been collected at an altitude of . In Panama it has been collected at . Behaviour It is a nocturnal, probably arboreal species. The frog is usually found near streams and has also been found up to 5m high in the water pools in the centres of many bromeliads growing as epiphytes on trees. Males call from along streams; females descend from trees to mate. Savage describes the call as \\"a deep glug, repeated several times\\". Breeding takes place during the first heavy rains of the wet season. Gravid females have been found in bromeliads. The eggs are laid on dry land. This species possesses \\"direct development\\", the eggs develop directly into tiny juvenile frogs, skipping a tadpole stage. Diseases This frog is suspected to be susceptible to the deadly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. ==Conservation== It was formerly believed to be endemic to Costa Rica. It was assessed for the IUCN as being \\"critically endangered\\" in 2004, and in 2008 it retained this status, due to its \\"drastic population decline\\". It is considered threatened in Costa Rica, and is protected by the wildlife conservation law No. 7317, environmental law No. 7554 and the decree No. 26435-MINAE. The frog was regularly seen in the annual collections of amphibians at least in two of the various nature parks of Costa Rica it was known from, but in the late 1980s this species suddenly declined and disappeared from the amphibian collections. The last record of this species was from 1990, and it has not been seen since (as of August 2007), despite it having been searched for. It has not been seen in Cascajal, San Jose Province, since 1972. Because it has seemingly disappeared from the areas in which it has almost only been collected - otherwise pristine, well-managed nature reserves, infection by the introduced fungal disease chytridiomycosis has been suggested as the reason of decline, as this has also impacted other similar frogs from similar habitats. The IUCN also mentions unspecified possible impacts from climate change. It is, or was, found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, the Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve and the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica from in altitude. There is no ex situ population of this species under conservation. ==References External links == * Undated photograph of an individual from Bocas del Toro, Panama. andi Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1974 Category:Taxa named by Jay M.

It is found in the Chocoan rainforests from near sea level to elevations of in northwestern Ecuador and western Colombia. ==Description== Strabomantis anomalus are large frogs. Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Skin of dorsum is coarsely tuberculate with many short ridges and folds, but without complete dorsolateral folds. They are dull grayish brown, yellowish brown, or brown from above, with indistinct darker blotching. Groin is variably mottled brown or black on pale yellow, yellowish tan, or pink. Rear of thigh are dark brown or black, with yellow or tan mottling or spots. Throat is suffused with brown or gray, with white spots or mottling, but sometimes darker, mottled black and white, in juveniles. Venter is dull white or yellowish white to pale yellow, or, occasionally, bright, yellow. On one occasion, a female was found crouched on a mass of 69 eggs in a shallow depression. The nest was on a river bank, likely to be flooded at the next heavy rain, which is unusual for presumed direct-developing species. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Strabomantis anomalus are lowland and submontane forests. They live mainly along clear, gravely streams flowing through swampy moist rainforest. They are commonly found along small, slow- flowing streams at night, usually on the ground or on rocks beside or in shallow water in the stream. Strabomantis anomalus can be locally a moderately common species. It is believed to be declining in abundance. Habitat loss caused by agricultural development, logging, and human settlement is probably the main threat to it. Also pollution from spraying illegal crops is a significant threat. ==References== anomalus Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1898 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Strabomantis anomalus"},{"id":"12383813","text":"Craugastor aphanus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to the Sierra del Mico and Sierra de las Minas ranges in the Izabal Department of eastern Guatemala. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. In addition to the marked sexual dimorphism in size, males differ from females by having a relatively larger tympanum that is round as opposed elongated, and in coloration: the dorsum of adult females is medium or dark brown, whereas that of juveniles and males is usually paler and often with some yellow, orange, or reddish brown hue, occasionally dark olive brown. Even more strikingly, the venter is yellowish in males and purplish in females. The skin of the dorsum is smooth but has prominent occipital folds that extend from the posterior edge of upper eyelids to above the scapulae. Neither fingers nor toes are webbed but they bear small discs. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitat is low-altitude ( above sea level) cloud forest. Although much of its habitat is within a protected area, small-scale wood extraction is taking place and the species is known from only from two locations, hence it assessment as \\"Vulnerable\\". == References == aphanus Category:Amphibians described in 1994 Category:Taxa named by Jonathan A.

It is known by various common names but most commonly as the barking frog (also common robber frog, cliff frog). The nominal species likely includes more than one species, sometimes described as subspecies such as the common barking frog (Craugastor augusti augusti), western barking frog (Craugastor augusti cactorum), and eastern barking frog (Craugastor augusti latrans). The epithet augusti is in honor of renowned French zoologist Auguste Duméril. It is called the barking frog because its call sounds like the barking of a small dog, although vocalizations vary by area. It is an abundant species in Mexico but apparently rare in the United States. However, they are very difficult to detect unless they are calling, which only occurs during few nights after rains. ==Description== Barking Frog, Tamaulipas (Craugastor augusti), juvenile, Municipality of Gómez Farías, Tamaulipas, Mexico (9 August 2004). Adult Craugastor augusti measure . They have a characteristic fold of skin across the back of the head as well as well-developed tubercles on their feet. Colouration is sexually dimorphic. ==Habitat and life cycle== The natural habitats of Craugastor augusti are shrublands and deserts. It is a terrestrial frog that hides under rocks, in caves, or crevices. Eggs are laid in similar microhabitats and develop directly to small froglets, without freeliving tadpole stage. They are known to live for up to seven years in the wild, at least, and 11 years in captivity. ==References== augusti Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians of the United States Category:Taxa named by Alfredo Dugès Category:Amphibians described in 1879 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Craugastor augusti"},{"id":"12383824","text":"A list of Western films released in the 1980s. {  - !

It is a nocturnal species. Strabomantis bufoniformis is uncommon throughout its range, with the exception of Gorgona Island where it is quite common. It may have disappeared from Costa Rica where it has not been seen since 1978. Nevertheless, it is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" because it is relatively widespread and its overall population is stable. ==References== bufoniformis Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1896 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Strabomantis bufoniformis"},{"id":"12383873","text":"A list of Western films released in the 2000s. {  - !

She was built by W. Henderson Co in Glasgow, for the express purpose of serving NYK's Japan to Seattle route. NYK originally intended that she be built at the Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards in Japan; however, Mitsubishi had experienced problems in the completion of Hitachi Maru, which had led to considerable delays. NYK chose not to wait, and Shinano Maru was ordered to Scotland. She was completed in April 1900. During the Russo-Japanese War Shinano Maru was converted into an armed merchantman. She has the distinction of discovering the Russian Fleet near Tsushima Strait on the eve of the Battle of Tsushima. After the war Shinano Maru reverted to civilian use, being scrapped in 1951. ==Early civilian service== Shinano Maru, with a length of , was designed to carry 238 passenger (26 first class, 20 second class, 193 third class), and her accommodations were regarded as modern and comfortable at the time of her completion. Initially, Shinano Maru was placed in service on Nippon Yusen routes between Australia and Japan.. Later in her early service with Nippon Yusen, Shinano Maru was reassigned to North Pacific routes to North America, making regular voyages between Yokohama and Seattle. She was involved in a collision off Victoria, British Columbia with the SS Empress of Japan on June 3, 1902. The novelist Kafū Nagai was a passenger in 1903. ==Battle of Tsushima== With the start of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Shinano Maru was one of the first ships requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Army for use as a troopship and military transport to convey troops and supplies to Korea and Manchuria. In March 1905,Corbett, p. 154. Shinano Maru was armed and converted into an auxiliary cruiser at Kure Naval Arsenal, mounting two guns (one fore and one aft), and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy under the command of Captain Morikawa.Corbett, p. 222. Shortly before the Battle of Tsushima she was assigned to the Auxiliary Squadron of the Combined Fleet along with six other armed merchantmen and three torpedo boat tenders Corbett, p. 218. assigned to patrols of the Tsushima Strait to search for the Russian Baltic Fleet, which had been dispatched around the world to relieve the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. On the night of May 26–27 Shinano Maru, , and were deployed as a lookout screen in the strait between Gotō Islands and Jeju-do.Corbett, p. 221, uses Quelpart for Jeju-do. At 2:45 Shinano Maru sighted a suspicious ship, but the rising moon prevented proper identification. Shinano Maru steamed ahead and properly sighted the opponent at 4:30. It was an apparently unarmed hospital ship, communicating signals to other enemy ships, invisible in the morning haze. The sighted ship turned out to be the Russian hospital transport Orel.Not the battleship of the same name. The rest of the Russian fleet had already sailed past Orel, undetected by the Japanese. Morikawa settled to search and seize Orel and closed in, only to notice half a dozen other Russian ships nearby.Corbett, p. 223. He fled the scene and broadcast the report of the sighting on the wireless. However, grid coordinates reported by Shinano Maru were incorrect by 10 to 20 miles, owing either to Morikawa's errors in dead reckoning or to his misunderstanding of Orels position in the Russian order of battle. The Japanese Third Division hurried to the grid square reported by Morikawa, but could not find the trace of the enemy. At 6:05 Shinano Maru reestablished visual contact with the Russian fleet, and continued shadowing it at four to five miles distance. Russian officers advised admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky to interfere but Rozhestvensky refused, insisting on continuing his course in strict radio silence.Corbett, p. 224. At 6:40 Shinano Maru was relieved by .Idzumi in Corbett, p. 226. Confusion caused by Morikawa's first report was resolved, and now the Combined Fleet had precise information on the Russian advance.Corbett. p. 226. This intelligence ultimately led to the decisive Battle of Tsushima. In the aftermath of the battle Shinano Maru and Dainan Maru located the sinking and forced the captain to surrender it.Corbett, p. 308. Shinano Maru took the Russian survivors to captivity in Sasebo. ==Post-war civilian service== Shinano Maru returned to civilian service in 1906, on Nippon Yusen's routes to Seattle. After more modern vessels were available, Shinano Maru was transferred to regional services, especially the Kobe – Keelung route. In 1913, Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen sought refuge in Japan, and travelled to Kobe on Shinano Maru. In 1923, the ship was transferred to Kinkai Yusen, a subsidiary company of Nippon Yusen. In 1929, the ship was sold to Hokushin Kisen, and sold again in 1930 to the fisheries company Nichiro, which converted it into a floating factory ship supporting the fishing fleets in the North Pacific processing salmon off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. Pressed back into service as a transport in the Pacific War, Shinano Maru was torpedoed January 18, 1944 with moderate damage, then slightly damaged by a naval mine on June 1, 1945, and again by an airstrike on July 14, 1945, which killed two crewmen. She was docked at Nagasaki during the final days of the war. Shinano Maru was so obsolete and rusted that noted manga artist Shigeru Mizuki wrote in his diary that the iron of the hull was so rusted and thin that he considered it miraculous that the ship remained afloat, and that even the wake of a torpedo would be enough to sink it. After the surrender of Japan, it was used as a repatriation vessel bringing back Japanese former prisoners-of-war from Siberia. One of those returning to Japan on Shinano Maru was the future novelist Shōhei Ōoka. At the beginning of the Korean War, the ship was used as a mother ship for landing operations of the U.S. Navy.Field, p. 291 Shinano Maru was sold for scrap in 1951. ==NotesReferences== * Corbett, J.

Challenger is a non-releasable bald eagle in the care of the non-profit American Eagle Foundation. He is the first bald eagle in history trained to free fly into places including the North Carolina Zoo. ==Life== In a storm in 1989, Challenger was blown from his nest as an eaglet and hand raised by humans. During his early years, he experienced too much human contact and imprinted on his human handlers. Two unsuccessful release attempts resulted in Challenger almost dying and eventually being handed over to the Federal authorities. Authorities have since given Challenger to the American Eagle Foundation for care and educational programs. He lives with other birds of prey at Dollywood Theme Park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Challenger is named in honor of the space shuttle crew, who were killed when it disintegrated shortly after launch. In 2019, on Challenger's 30th birthday, the Foundation announced that the eagle would be retired from free flights and make only gloved appearances. ==Awareness== Challenger has been an ambassador for his species since 1993. He has raised a great level of public awareness for the habitat destruction of the bald eagle. Since he is so widely recognized, Challenger is noted as a large factor in the bald eagle being taken off the Endangered Species List. ==Performances== Sports events *MLB World Series – 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 *NFL Pro Bowl – 2002, 2003, 2004; NFC Championship Game - 2018 *Fiesta Bowl – 1999, 2013 *Men's Final Four – 2005 *NCAA College Football National Championship – 2011, 2017 *Daytona 500 – 2015 *Army-Tulane Football Game – 2015 * Arizona Cardinals–San Francisco 49ers Football Game – 2016 * Cotton Bowl Classic Bowl - 2017  Teams  *Atlanta Braves *Arizona Cardinals *Auburn University *Boston College Eagles *Philadelphia Eagles *Chicago Cubs *University of Connecticut *San Francisco Giants *Green Bay Packers *Buffalo Bills *Florida Marlins *Indianapolis Colts *Texas Rangers *Kansas City Chiefs *Minnesota Vikings *New York Yankees *Oklahoma State University *Detroit Lions *Tennessee Titans *University of Kansas *University of Tennessee *Florida State University *Louisiana State University *Carson- Newman University *Georgia Southern University *United States Military Academy  Individual events  *1996 Paralympics *Disney's Animal Kingdom Grand Opening *World War II Memorial groundbreaking ceremony *White House ceremonies *High Point University Graduation Ceremonies *Ceremony delisting the bald eagle as an endangered species *University of Kansas vs. University of Nebraska 3 NOV 2001 *2007 Texas vs. Oklahoma State football game *We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial, January 18, 2009 *October 2, 2010, Boston College vs. Notre Dame Football Game *May 19, 2014, Boston College Commencement ceremony *Horatio Alger Association Award Ceremony 2014 * HP Communications, Inc.

The documentary was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK, styled as a loose successor to Dawkins' documentary of the previous year, The Root of All Evil?, as seen through the incorporation of brief clips from said documentary during the introduction of the first part by Dawkins. The first part aired 13 August 2007 and the second on 20 August 2007. It includes interviews with Steve Fuller, Deepak Chopra, Satish Kumar, and Derren Brown. ==Episode 1: Slaves to Superstition== Dawkins points to some of science’s achievements and describes it as freeing most people from superstition and dogma. Picking up from his superstition-reason distinction in The Root of All Evil? (while recycling some footage from it), he then says reason is facing an \\"epidemic of superstition\\" that \\"impoverishes our culture\\" and introduces gurus that persuade us \\"to run away from reality\\". He calls the present day dangerous times. He returns to science’s achievements, including the fact that, by extending people's lifespan, it helps them to take more advantage of life. He turns his attention to astrology, which he criticizes for stereotyping without evidence. Having put astrology to the test and referred to larger-scale experiments, he then briefly describes the mechanics of astronomy, and then expresses frustration that 50% of the UK population – more than are members of one religion – believe in the paranormal. He then visits a psychic medium, Simon Goodfellow, who makes statements Dawkins interprets as referring to retirement – which most people his age would soon be going in for but not Dawkins. Cornell then finds himself in contradiction over whether or not the \\"spirit G\\", who allegedly communicates with him, is Dawkins's family member. Cornell next tries suggesting this spirit was in the military – again, typical of deceased relatives of people Dawkins’s age, but not of Dawkins. Cornell finishes with several explanations of why his powers might not always work, but Dawkins insists extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and then talks to the sceptical Derren Brown about cold reading, including misleading tricks it uses. In another notable segment Dawkins visits a psychic for £50 who said she could hear or see his father \\"on the other side.\\" Dawkins let the woman do the reading and at the end informed her that his father is alive, and he visits him frequently. Dawkins now visits a spiritualist church, and makes several criticisms of the alleged evidence of communication with the dead by medium Craig Hamilton-Parker, and adds that many may become obsessed with such performances and find it difficult to get over the loss of loved ones, adding that most people present are regulars. Hamilton-Parker says his psychic powers have been \\"proven to me against my rationality\\". Dawkins ends his study of séances by noting the arguments are based on untestable, private, subjective anecdotes, and compares this to religion. Dawkins now describes the history of scientific knowledge of echolocation, and points to the cumulative build-up of corroborating evidence for scientific explanations of the phenomena. He visits psychologist Chris French, who is performing a double-blind test of dowsing. None of the dowsers perform better, in a statistically significant sense, than is expectable by chance alone. While the dowsers are surprised, Dawkins and French note that their confidence is untouched, and they prefer explanations (French states some may call them excuses) that retain the hypothesis that they have paranormal dowsing powers. Dawkins next attempts his own explanation of belief in the paranormal in a combination of evolutionary and psychological terms, saying: \\"we don’t want to believe things just happen\\", and he suggests superstition is just the sort of animal error committed by Skinner’s pigeons. Dawkins now interviews Satish Kumar about ideas such as 'treeness' and 'rockness'. Dawkins points out that it is all evidence-free assertion. He responds to the \\"science is bleak\\" argument by saying that the world is so wonderful that the word 'mundane' has a mismatched meaning and etymology. He then complains about the long-term fall in the number of students taking chemistry and physics at A-level. He suggests this is partly because of the UK education system encouraging students to value personal feeling over evidence and reason. He interviews the relativist Steve Fuller and criticises him for being \\"so close to being right but ... damn wrong\\". Fuller points out that different people can interpret the same evidence differently. Fuller also points out the benefits of the Internet, and Dawkins agrees, but then turns to the dangers it poses in causing the spread of fabricated statements. He also points to the fact that the MMR vaccine scandal involved an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the UK government. Dawkins concludes that reason \\"built the modern world. It is a precious but fragile thing\\". ==Episode 2: The Irrational Health Service== Richard Dawkins examines the growing suspicion the public has for science-based medicine, despite its track record of successes like the germ theory of disease, vaccines, antibiotics and increased lifespan. He notes a fifth of British children are currently not immunised against measles, mumps and rubella, attributing it to fears arising from a highly controversial report linking the vaccine with autism. Dawkins criticizes the growing field of alternative medicine which does not pass the same objective and statistical rigour as scientifically derived treatments using controlled double-blind studies. Without verifiable evidence, alternative therapies must rely on biased anecdotes and word of mouth to perpetuate. Dawkins observes these treatments have fanciful rationales and rituals behind them, with many alternative treatments employing pseudoscientific jargon such as \\"energy\\", \\"vibration\\" or \\"quantum theory\\" to give themselves greater credence to patients. Homeopathy is singled out as an example of a mainstream alternative medicine that has public support and taxpayer funding through the National Health Service. Dawkins explains that the rationale behind it is unfounded and demonstrates that the magnitude of dilution required is so great the patient is practically imbibing pure water. This is illustrated by the typical homeopathic dilution of 30C (1:10030, that is thirty steps of dilution by 1% each time), which requires a drop of active ingredient dissolved in a body of water greater than the whole ocean.Homeopathy: The Ultimate Fake, Stephen Barrett, M.D. Dawkins cites a 2005 meta-analysis by The Lancet that concludes that homeopathy has no consistently demonstrable effect on health.Shang, Aijing; Karin Huwiler-Müntener, Linda Nartey, Peter Jüni, Stephan Dörig, Jonathan A C Stern & Daniel Pewsner (2005-08-17), \\"Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy and allopathy.\\" The Lancet 366: 726-732 Dawkins hypothesises that practitioners of alternative medicine spend longer time than regular doctors on their patients when attending to them. An interview with Professor Nicholas Humphrey suggests that this empathic attention may cause a placebo effect in patients, but this is not a substitute for conventional science-based medicine. The episode concludes with Dawkins making an appeal to skeptical, rational inquiry based on evidence, claiming \\"reason has liberated us from superstition and given us centuries of progress. We abandon it at our peril.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Interview with Richard Dawkins about The Enemies of Reason *Enemies of Reason official site at Channel 4 * In the media: Times Online: *Richard Dawkins and the New Age fakers *The gullible age The Daily Telegraph: *New age therapies cause 'retreat from reason' *Unreasonably superstitious – Michael Deacon talks to Richard Dawkins Guardian Unlimited: *Screen Burn by Charlie Brooker Category:2007 British television series debuts Category:2007 British television series endings Category:2000s British documentary television series Category:Channel 4 documentaries Category:Works by Richard Dawkins Category:English-language television shows Category:Scientific skepticism mass media ","title":"The Enemies of Reason"},{"id":"12383901","text":"Craugastor charadra is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae.

Some of his best known songs began as live improvisations. Medema was born almost blind; his eyes only let him tell light from shadow and see outlines of major objects. He began playing the piano when he was five years old, and three years later began taking lessons in classical music through braille music, playing by ear and improvising in different styles. In 1969, he majored in music therapy at Michigan State University in Lansing, studying both piano and voice. Afterwards he worked as a music therapist in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later at Essex County Hospital in New Jersey. In 1973, he began performing and recording his own songs while at Essex County Hospital. \\"I had a bunch of teenagers who were really hurting,\\" he says, \\"and I started writing songs about their lives. Then I thought, 'Why don't you start writing songs about your Christian life?' So I started doing that, and people really responded.\\" His lyrics generally provide social commentary on themes such as justice, hunger, poverty, homelessness, and Christian charity as it pertains to them. He has published a total of 26 albums, the first of which he recorded for Word and Shawnee Press, and then went on to found Brier Patch Music in 1985. Through Brier Patch Music, he organizes and schedules his events, as well as publishes his music. The business was named after Brer Rabbit's home in the legendary Uncle Remus stories. \\"Brer Rabbit lived in a place not comfortable for anyone else,\\" Medema says, \\"and we decided to follow him there.\\" Performances regularly include songs improvised both musically and lyrically by accepting audience recommendations, sermon topics, or guest speaker stories as their basis. He performs in national and worldwide (church) congregations, campuses, youth gatherings, and annual assemblies. He lives near San Francisco, California, with his wife Jane. They have been married since 1965 and have two grown children and four grandchildren. ==References== *Sun Herald *Baptist Standard Information given in this article refers to the links mentioned above as well as to the artist's webpage ==External links== *Ken Medema's Official web site Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:American male singer- songwriters Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Musicians from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:Blind musicians Category:Songwriters from Michigan Category:Singers from Michigan Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Ken Medema"},{"id":"12383906","text":"Strabomantis cheiroplethus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Craugastor chrysozetetes appears to have been able to form hybrids with Craugastor fecundus. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitat was premontane wet forest at elevations of above sea level. It occurred along the stream Quebrada de Oro. It was always a rare species, and after several visits to the only known site failed to locate the species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed it as extinct in 2004. The cause of extinction is thought have been habitat loss and change (deforestation resulting from agricultural encroachment, human settlement of the region, logging, fires, and landslides). Chytridiomycosis might also have played a role. However, this was changed to Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) in 2019 following the possibility that it may survive within Pico Bonito National Park. ==References== chrysozetetes Category:Endemic fauna of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibian extinctions since 1500 Category:Amphibians described in 1989 Category:Taxa named by Jay M.

The premise is that if scores on a test correlate with job performance, then it is economically useful for the employer to select employees based on scores from that test. == Legal context (United States) == The United States Supreme Court has decided several cases clarifying the place of employment testing in the context of discrimination law. In particular, these cases have addressed the discriminatory use of tests when promoting employees by requiring tests beyond the education required for the job. A central finding in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. was that the employer must demonstrate (or be prepared to demonstrate) that its selection process is related to the job being filled.Griggs v. Duke Power Co. :401 U.S. 424 (1971) == Test types used == Different types of assessments may be used for employment testing, including personality tests, intelligence tests, work samples, and assessment centers. Some correlate better with job performance than with others; employers often use more than one to maximize predictive power.  Performance assessment tests  Performance-based assessment testing is a process to find out if applicants can do the job for which they are applying. It is done through tests, which are directly administered and judged by Hiring Managers who will be supervising the potential hire. The tests are peer-to-peer and reflect real business tasks that candidates have to perform, should they be selected for the role. The tests are open ended, time bound, business related questions which applicants need to submit their responses for in order to prove their abilities.  Personality tests  Personality tests may potentially be useful in personnel selection. Of the well-known Big Five personality traits, only conscientiousness correlates substantially with traditional measures of job performance, and that correlation is strong enough to be predictive.Barrick, M. R., & Mount, M. K. (1991). The big five personality dimensions and job performance: A meta- analysis. Personnel Psychology, 44, 1-26. However, other factors of personality can correlate substantially with non-traditional aspects of job performance, such as leadership and effectiveness in a team environment.Hogan, R. (2006). Personality and the fate of organizations. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is also used. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is a highly validated psychopathology test that is generally used in a clinical psychology setting and may reveal potential mental health disorders.Official MMPI-2 Description However, this can be considered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as the employer having knowledge of a medical condition prior to an offer of employment. This is an illegal basis for a hiring decision in the United States. Employers considering personality tests should focus on tests designed for job purposes and do not provide any information regarding an applicant's mental health or stability. Notable situations in which the MMPI may be used are in final selection for police officers, fire fighters, and other security and emergency personnel, especially when the employees are required to carry weapons. An assessment of mental stability and fitness can be reasonably related and necessary in the performance of the job. Employment integrity testing is used to determine an applicant's honesty and integrity.  Cognitive ability tests  Tests of cognitive ability can assess general intelligence and correlate very highly with overall job performance.Schmidt, F.L., & Hunter, J. (2004). General Mental Ability in the World of Work: Occupational Attainment and Job Performance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86(1), 162–173. Individuals with higher levels of cognitive ability tend to perform better on their jobs. This is especially true for jobs that are particularly intellectually demanding.  Job-knowledge tests  Employers administer job-knowledge tests when applicants must already possess a body of knowledge before being hired.U.S. Office of Personnel Management \\"Assessment Decision Guide\\". Retrieved on 2008-08-14. Job-knowledge tests are particularly useful when applicants must have specialized or technical knowledge that can only be acquired through extensive experience or training. Job-knowledge tests are commonly used in fields such as computer programming, law, financial management, and electrical or mechanical maintenance. Licensing exams and certification programs are also types of job-knowledge tests. Passing such exams indicates competence in the exam's subject area. Tests must be representative of the tested field, otherwise, litigation can be brought against the test-giver.  Situational judgment tests  Situational judgment tests are commonly used as employee-selection and employee-screening tools and have been developed to predict employment success.Ployhart, R. E. (2006). Staffing in the 21st century: New challenges and strategic opportunities. Journal of Management, 32, 868-897. These tests present realistic hypothetical scenarios in a multiple-choice format. Applicants are asked to state what they would do in a difficult job-related situation.Lievens, F., Peeters, H., & Schollaert, E. (2008). Situational judgment tests: A review of recent research. Personnel Review, 37, 426-441. Situational judgment tests measure the suitability of job applicants by assessing attributes such as problem solving, service orientation, and striving for achievement.Whetzel, D. L., & McDaniel, M. A. (2009). Situational judgment tests: An overview of current research. Human Resource Management Review, 19, 188-202. == See also == * Civil Rights Act of 1964 * Industrial and organizational psychology * Objective test * Projective test * Psychological testing * Situational judgement test * Watson v.

The tympanum is prominent. The fingers and the toes bear discs; the toes are moderately webbed. Skin typically bears warts and ridges. The dorsal coloration varies from gray-brown to brown to orange-brown. Some individuals have a wide, light middorsal stripe. Most individuals have only some blackish spots and a vague, darker dorsal pattern. The throat is typically grey with a white line down the middle. The belly is pale white or yellow. The male advertisement call is a variable series of harsh chirps or clacks. ==Habitat and conservation== Craugastor fitzingeri occurs in humid lowland and montane forests below . It is often found in disturbed forest or forest edge, although it does not occur in secondary forest in the Colombian part of its range. In lowland dry forest areas, it is restricted to riparian gallery forest in the dry season, but ranges more widely in the wet season. By day these frogs are found on the forest floor, usually concealed in leaf litter, but they can also be active. At night, they often climb onto logs or into low vegetation. Males typically call at dusk from elevated positions on low herbs and in bushes, etc. This species can be locally abundant, but some populations have declined.

Although it was centered on the town of Trois-Rivières, in the same way as the predecessor electoral district of the same name for Lower Canada, its boundaries had been significantly altered by the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, to favour voters of British background over the francophone Canadiens. Sydenham wanted to ensure members were elected who would support the new union and his government and drew the boundaries with this goal. It was an example of a linguistic and ethnic gerrymander.Irving Martin Abella, \\"The 'Sydenham Election' of 1841\\" (1966), 47 Canadian Historical Review 326, p. 334 [subscription needed].Paul G. Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada 1841-1867 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962), p. 4. The Union Act, 1840 merged the two provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, with a single Parliament. The separate parliaments of Lower Canada and Upper Canada were abolished.Union Act, 1840, 3 & 4 Vict., c. 35, s. 2. The Union Act provided that the pre-existing electoral boundaries of Lower Canada and Upper Canada would continue to be used in the new Parliament, unless altered by the Union Act itself.Union Act, 1840, s. 18. Three Rivers was one of the electoral districts specifically defined in the Union Act. The Act provided that the town would continue as a separate electoral district, electing one member to the Legislative Assembly.Union Act, 1840, s. 20. However, instead of continuing the district under the previous boundaries, the Act gave the Governor General the power to draw new boundaries for the district.Union Act, 1840, s. 21. The Governor General exercised this power by a proclamation on March 4, 1841, only four days before the elections were to begin on March 8.\\"Proclamation, March 4, 1841\\", Journals of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada, 1st Parliament, 1st Session, 1841, p. xiv.Abella, \\"The 'Sydenham Election' of 1841\\", p. 337. The boundaries set by the Proclamation were as follows: The effect of these boundaries was to contract the electoral district, excluding the outlying areas of the town, which had a largely French-speaking population, thus diluting the voting strength of the francophone voters. ==Members for Three Rivers (1841-1867)== Three Rivers was represented by one member in the Legislative Assembly.

The head is as wide as the body and broader than long; the snout is subacuminate. The canthus rostralis is moderately sharp. The tympanum is visible and large. The fingers are long and thin with wide finger pads. The innermost toes have slight webbing; the toe tips are enlarged. The coloration is gray with some greenish tinge. There is some darker brown dorsal blotching. The venter is cream yellow. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitat is pine-oak forest at elevations of above sea level. It is a rare frog that appears to have declined as it has not been seen after 1984, despite surveys to locate it; it might be extinct. is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging and conversion of forest to agricultural land. However, it has also disappeared from suitable habitat, suggesting that chytridiomycosis might have been at play. ==References== guerreroensis Category:Endemic fauna of Mexico Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Craugastor guerreroensis"},{"id":"12384016","text":"Craugastor gulosus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The specific name monnichorum honors the Monniche family, owners of the property where the type series was collected. However, the common name coined for this species, Dunn's robber frog, refers instead to the scientist who described the species, Emmett Reid Dunn. ==Description== Adult males measure at least and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is flat and broad. The tympanum is small (especially in females) but visible. Supratympanic and dorsolater folds are present. The finger and toe discs are well-developed, and the two outermost finger discs are particularly large. The toes have basal webbing. Dorsal coloration in adults is dark brown with considerable variation in shade and patterns between individuals. ==Habitat and conservation== Craugastor monnichorum occurs in humid montane forests at elevations of about above sea level. It can be found on the ground, rocks, and in low vegetation. The development is direct (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage). The main threat to this species presumably is habitat loss (deforestation).

It is endemic to southeastern Costa Rica and only known from its type locality in the Las Tablas protected area in the Puntarenas Province, near the Panamanian border. Only a single individual—the holotype collected in 1992—has ever been observed. It is unusual in its ghost-like, gray-white coloration, and it was initially thought that the specimen was an albino form of some other species. However, the specimen is also morphologically distinct, although some uncertainty regarding the validity of this species remains. ==Etymology== The specific name phasma is Greek for \\"apparition\\" or \\"spirit\\" and refers to the ghost-like appearance of this species. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Based on morphological data, Savage and colleagues (2004) suggested that the sister species of Craugastor phasma is Craugastor talamancae, a lowland species. Later studies have grouped Craugastor phasma with montane species in the Craugastor melanostictus species group. ==Description== The holotype, an adult female, measures in snout–vent length. Apart from the black eyes and scattered black markings on the head and hind limbs, the dorsal and ventral surfaces are uniformly gray-white. Skin is smooth. The head is slightly broader than it is wide. The snout is obtuse in profile. The canthus rostralis is sharp. The tympanum is ovoid and distinct. The fingers and toes bear disks. The toes have basal webbing. ==Habitat and conservation== The holotype was found on a rocky stream bank in lower montane rainforest at above sea level. The site was part of a transect that was regularly monitored for two years, but no other specimens were observed. The type locality is within the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve. However, the holotype was sick and observed among dead and dying frogs, so disease is a possible, immediate threat to this species. ==References== phasma Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Endemic fauna of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians described in 1996 Category:Taxa named by Jay M.

Before being recognized as representing a separate species, Craugastor pozo were identified as Craugastor brocchi. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are wet forest areas at elevations of above sea level. They occur on the forest floor under leaf-litter among limestone boulders and limestone caves. They hide by day and are active on the forest floor and in low vegetation by night. This rare species is threatened by habitat loss. It is not known to occur in any protected area. ==References== pozo Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Endemic fauna of Mexico Category:Amphibians described in 1995 Category:Taxa named by Jay M.

Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The specific epithet flava is derived from the Latin word for \\"yellow\\" and refers to the typical colouration of the plant's upper pitchers and other vegetative parts. ==Botanical history== Nepenthes flava entered cultivation several years prior to being described and was known from at least 2004 under the placeholder name \\"Nepenthes spec. nov. Sumatra\\".Wistuba, A. 2004. Nepenthes spec. nov. Sumatra. Wistuba.com. [archived page from April 15, 2004] The species was formally described by Andreas Wistuba, Joachim Nerz and Andreas Fleischmann in an issue of Blumea published on July 4, 2007.Nepenthes flava Wistuba, Nerz & A.Fleischm.. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). The description was based on cultivated plant material; Wistuba cult. Wistuba 100201 was designated as the holotype. This specimen was collected at an altitude of 1800 m and is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands (L) in Leiden, together with an isotype. The describing authors explained their choice of the specific epithet flava as follows: > The specific epithet ‘flava’ refers to the bright yellow colour of the upper > pitchers and most of the lower pitchers. Climbing plants especially give the > impression of a mainly yellow plant. A detailed and slightly modified description of N. flava appeared in Stewart McPherson's 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World. Whereas the type description mentions a basal crest on the underside of the lid, McPherson writes that no appendages are present in either lower or upper pitchers. ==Description== Nepenthes flava is a climbing plant growing to a height of 6 m. It only remains in the rosette stage for a short time before transitioning into a scrambling vine. The stem, which may be branched, is around 3 mm in diameter and has roughly cylindrical internodes measuring up to 14 cm in length. The stem ranges in colour from green to dark red. The lamina (leaf blade) is linear, oblong, or narrowly obovate, and measures up to 9 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width. Its apex is usually acute, but may also be obtuse. The base of the lamina is attenuate and clasps the stem for around half to three-quarters of its circumference. Three prominent longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Indistinct reticulate veins are also present. The lamina is yellowish-green in colour and the midrib may be reddish. Tendrils reach 24 cm in length and may be green to red. Rosette and lower pitchers are either infundibular throughout or ovate and variably inflated. They are small, measuring only up to 7 cm in height by 4 cm in width. A pair of wings (≤3 mm wide) often runs down the upper third of the pitcher's ventral surface, bearing fringe elements around 5 mm long. Occasionally, the wings may be absent altogether. The peristome varies from cylindrical to slightly expanded and has a wavy outer margin. It is up to 12 mm wide and bears fine ribs up to 0.6 mm high and spaced up to 1 mm apart. On the inner margin of the peristome, these ribs terminate in teeth up to 1.5 mm long, with the largest located towards the rear. The pitcher mouth is round and slightly elongated towards the rear, although it rarely exhibits a neck. The pitcher lid or operculum is narrowly ovate or elliptic and measures up to 3.5 cm in length by 2 cm in width. On its lower surface, the lid bears a basal glandular crest or no appendages at all, as well as numerous circular nectar glands (0.3 mm in diameter), which are concentrated around the midline and crest. An unbranched, filiform spur (≤4 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Unlike their aerial counterparts, lower pitchers vary greatly in pigmentation. The pitcher cup may be yellow, orange, red, or even purple, whereas the inner surface may be light yellow, light orange, or whitish. The peristome is usually darker than the rest of the pitcher, typically being dark orange to purple, although it may be creamy white and occasionally exhibits red stripes. The lid has a similar colour to the pitcher cup, usually having a darker upper surface with dark red speckles. Upper pitchers are tubular to narrowly infundibular in the lower two-thirds, becoming broadly infundibular above. Characteristically, the hollow pitcher tube often continues past the curved basal portion and for some distance up the tendril. Upper pitchers are similar in size to their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 6 cm in height by 3.5 cm in width. The peristome is flattened and expanded, reaching 15 mm in width. As in lower pitchers, its outer margin is undulate. The peristome ribs are up to 0.2 mm high and spaced up to 0.5 mm apart. The lid is ovate or elliptic and has a somewhat truncate apex. It measures up to 4 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width. A reduced basal crest may be present on the underside of the lid or it may be absent entirely. Other parts are similar to those found in terrestrial traps. Upper pitchers are typically yellow throughout, but some specimens may have a completely red or red-striped peristome and mature traps may be orange or reddish on the upper surface of the lid. Nepenthes flava has a racemose inflorescence up to 15 cm long. Male inflorescences are more floriferous, bearing 15–40 flowers, compared to 15–25 in females. The peduncle measures up to 4 cm in males and up to 8 cm in females. Flowers are borne solitarily on pedicels that reach 6 mm in males and 11 mm in females. A basal bract is often present (≤4 mm long). The nectariferous tepals are ovate and measure up to 3 mm in length by 1 mm in width. The androphore is around 3 mm long and terminates in an anther head measuring 1–1.5 mm in diameter. The ovary is 3–4 mm long. The morphology of the fruits and seeds has not been documented. The inflorescence is yellowish throughout. All mature vegetative parts are glabrous, but a caducous indumentum is present on some developing structures. Young parts of the stem bear a sparse covering of reddish-brown, basally branched hairs (0.2–0.5 mm long). A dense indumentum of reddish-brown hairs (0.5–1 mm long) is present on developing pitchers and tendril ends. The inflorescence bears branched, yellowish-brown hairs measuring 0.5–1 mm in length. Tepals have a dense covering of curved, reddish-brown hairs (around 0.2 mm long) along their margins. Ovaries also have a dense covering of reddish-brown hairs, but these are longer, measuring 0.5–1 mm. ==Ecology== Nepenthes flava is only known from a single mountain in the Barisan Mountains of North Sumatra, Indonesia. In the interests of conservation, the exact locality has not been disclosed. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1800–2200 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The typical habitat of N. flava is upper montane mossy forest dominated by Rhododendron and Leptospermum plants. It often grows terrestrially in more open areas of forest, where the vegetation rarely exceeds 4–5 m in height. The species is naturally sympatric with N. mikei, N. ovata, N. rhombicaulis, and N. spectabilis. Natural hybrids with N. ovata and N. rhombicaulis have been recorded. The only known locality of N. flava does not lie within the boundaries of a national park. Although it appears to be locally abundant, Stewart McPherson considers the species to be \\"at significant risk of being poached and over-collected\\" and cites the \\"rapid demise\\" of N. aristolochioides, another highly sought-after Sumatran plant, as an example of the possible fate of this species. ==Carnivory== The pitcher fluid of N. flava is highly viscous and coats the inner pitcher walls. This is especially true of aerial traps, which must contend with the action of the wind. The sticky inner walls have been observed to trap small flying insects above the surface of the fluid. The prey subsequently slide down into the fluid where they are digested. It has been suggested that the pitchers of this species function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 36(1): 23–27. ==Related species== Nepenthes flava is thought to be closely related to both N. inermis and N. jacquelineae. However, it cannot be a natural hybrid between these species as it does not occur sympatrically with them. The pitchers of N. flava bear a close resemblance to those of N. jacquelineae. Nepenthes flava differs from this species in that its upper pitchers are markedly smaller and have a peristome that is significantly narrower, bears distinct ribs, and has an undulate margin. In addition, the upper pitchers of N. jacquelineae are not known to be yellow throughout, a colouration that is characteristic of N. flava. Nepenthes flava bears a conspicuous band of nectar glands on the underside of the lid, around the midline. This feature, among others, distinguishes it from N. inermis. With N. inermis, this species shares similarly infundibular pitchers, a narrow lid, and the habit of rapidly transitioning from a rosette to a climbing plant (with associated sudden internode elongation). Furthermore, the seedling pitchers of these two species can appear quite similar. Nepenthes inermis differs most obviously in having upper pitchers that completely lack a peristome and in lacking conspicuous glands on the underside of the lid. The describing authors considered N. flava to likely represent an evolutionary link between the pair of N. inermis and N. jacquelineae and \\"common Sumatran species such as N. ovata\\". They further speculated: > Nepenthes flava might represent an intermediate between N. ovata of northern > Sumatra and the unusual N. inermis of the western Sumatran mountains, and > would confirm Danser’s hypothesis in which he united common species familiar > to him, i.e. N. bongso, N. carunculata Danser and N. singalana, with the > distinctive species N. inermis and N. dubia Danser into the subgenus > Montanae Danser (Danser, 1928). Nepenthes ovata, N. jacquelineae and others > were not known at this time, but it seems likely he would have included them > in subgenus Montanae as well. Other species that produce somewhat similarly shaped upper pitchers include N. eymae, N. jamban, N. pitopangii, N. talangensis, and N. tenuis. Nepenthes flava can be distinguished from all of these species on the basis of a combination of features: entirely yellow upper pitchers; a broad, wavy peristome; very small peristome teeth; and a narrowly ovate or elliptic lid that lacks appendages (or has a small basal crest). Furthermore, compared to many of these species, and particularly N. eymae, N. flava is a diminutive plant. ==Natural hybrids== Two natural hybrids involving N. flava have been recorded; the describing authors found examples of crosses with N. ovata and N. rhombicaulis. Most of the observed hybrids were young rosette plants. Although N. flava is also sympatric with N. mikei and N. spectabilis, no natural hybrids with these species have been recorded. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Habitat photographs of Nepenthes flava Category:Carnivorous plants of Asia flava Category:Plants described in 2007 ","title":"Nepenthes flava"},{"id":"12384208","text":"Craugastor psephosypharus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Uranium mining in Wyoming was formerly a much larger industry than it is today. Wyoming once had many operating uranium mines, and still has the largest known uranium ore reserves of any state in the U.S. At the end of 2008, the state had estimated reserves dependent on price: 539 million pounds of uranium oxide at $50 per pound, and 1,227 million pounds at $100 per pound.US EIA, Uranium reserves, 2008, 27 Sept. 2012. Wyoming has produced a total of 84,000 tonnes of uranium, and from 1995 until 2015, actually led the nation in production. Total reserves as of 2015 still amounts to 141,000 tonnes at 0.065 percent grade. However, since the early 1990s, this production has been by the in situ leach method. The Wyoming uranium mining industry was hard-hit in the 1980s by the drop in the price of uranium. When the uranium price dropped, the uranium-mining boom town of Jeffrey City lost 95% of its population in three years. ==Powder River Basin== Geologic map of the Pumpkin Buttes uranium area US Geological Survey geologist David Love discovered uranium in 1951 near Pumpkin Buttes, about 25 miles northeast of Midwest, Wyoming. Other deposits were found along a 60-mile northwest-southeast trend in the southwest part of the Powder River Basin, and production began in 1953. The deposits are roll fronts in fluvial sandstones of the Eocene Wasatch Formation and underlying Paleocene Fort Union Formation.Raymond E. Langden, Geology and geochemistry of the Highland uranium deposit, Wyoming Geological Association Earth Science Bulletin, Dec. 1973, p.41-48. The principal ore minerals are uraninite, coffinite, metatyuyamunite, and carnotite. Gangue minerals are calcite, gypsum, pyrite, iron oxide, and barite.Vernon A Mrak (1968) Uranium deposits in the Eocene Sandstones of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933-1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.838-848. ==Northern Black Hills== Uranium was discovered in 1952 in Cretaceous sandstones of the Inyan Kara Group near its outcrop in Crook County, Wyoming, near the northeast edge of the Black Hills. Production began in 1953. Ore minerals are uraninite and coffinite in unoxidized sandstone, and carnotite and tyuyamunite in oxidized sandstone. Gangue minerals in unoxidized deposits are pyrite, marcasite, and calcite; in oxidized deposits calcite and iron oxide.Olin M. Hart (1968) Uranium in the Black Hills, in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933-1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.832-837. No mining has taken place in the Northern Black Hills district in recent years, but recent high uranium prices have brought new exploration drilling to the area. ==Gas Hills== The Gas Hills district, straddling the Natrona-Fremont county line in central Wyoming, was discovered on 9 Sept. 1953 by Neil McNeice, which led to the development of the Luck Mc Mine and others, with ore production beginning in 1955. The ore consisted of lenticular bodies of meta-autunite, uraninite, and coffinite in fluvial arkosic sandstones in the upper Wind River Formation of Eocene age. Mining was mostly by open pit, although there were also some underground mines.F. D. Everett (1963) Mining Practices at Four Uranium Properties in the Gas Hills, Wyoming, US Bureau of Mines, Information Circular 8151. Strathmore Minerals Corp. of Kelowna, British Columbia is currently applying for permits to mine properties in the Gas Hills district. ==Little Mountain district== In the Little Mountain mining district on the west side of the Bighorn Mountains, Big Horn County, Wyoming, uranium was produced from 1955 to 1970 from paleokarst breccias in the Madison Limestone of Mississippian age. The uranium occurs as carnotite and tyuyamunite.Ray E. Harris (1983) Uranium and thorium in the Bighorn Basin, in Bighorn Basin, Wyoming Geological Association, 34th Annual Field Conference Guidebook, p.171-177. ==Shirley Basin== Map of the Shirley Basin Uranium Area. Uranium was discovered in the Shirley Basin, Carbon County, in 1955. Production began in 1960 from underground and open-pit mines. Mining by in-situ leaching began in 1961, the first in-situ leach mining of uranium in the United States. The ore occurs as roll fronts in Eocene sandstone of the Wind River Formation, as uraninite with pyrite, marcasite, hematite, calcite, and organic matter.E. N. Harshman (1972) Geology and Uranium Deposits, Shirley Basin Area, Wyoming, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 745. ==Crooks Gap district== Map of the Crooks Gap-Green Mountain and Great Divide Basin Uranium Areas.

Childers, Uranium occurrences in Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary Strata of Wyoming and Northern Colorado, The Mountain Geologist, Oct. 1974, p.137-141. Most uranium deposits are in the Wasatch, with ore zones containing uraninite and pyrite. Oxidized ores include uranophane, meta-autunite, and phosphuranylite. ==Current Activity== By 2006, the only active uranium mine in Wyoming was the Smith Ranch-Highland in-situ leaching operation in the Powder River Basin, owned by Power Resources, Inc., a subsidiary of Cameco. The mine produced 907 tonnes of yellowcake (uranium oxide concentrate, U3O8) in 2006, making it the leading uranium producer in the United States.W.M. Sutherland, Wyoming, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.126. In October 2007, Energy Metals Corp. applied for a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) permit to start an in-situ leach mine at the Moore Ranch deposit in Campbell County in the Powder River Basin. Energy Metals is a subsidiary of Uranium One. The permit application is the first NRC application since 1988 for a new uranium recovery facility. The Moore Ranch deposit contains an estimated 5.8 million pounds (2600 tonnes) of uranium oxide. The uranium will be absorbed onto ion-exchange resin beads at the mine; the beads will be shipped to existing facilities of Power Resources Inc. (Cameco) in Wyoming and Nebraska for recovery of the uranium.Uranium One submits application for Moore ranch project in Wyoming, Mining Engineering, Nov. 2007, p.18. In September 2014, Uranerz Energy shipped the first uranium concentrate from its Nichols Ranch mine in the Powder River Basin.

Free started singing professionally at the age of 19 while living in Flint, Michigan (1973). In 1975, Free moved to Las Vegas, Nevada which eventually (in 1979) led to her relocating to Los Angeles, CA where she met Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge, Beck, Bogert & Appice, Rod Stewart) in 1983. Together they formed King Kobra and were signed to Capitol Records in 1984. Free recorded two albums with King Kobra, Ready to Strike and Thrill of a Lifetime, before leaving in November 1986 to pursue other musical interests. In 1987, Free formed a band with guitarist Danny Jacob, bassist and keyboardist Erik Scott and drummer Jan Uvena, which would later take the name Signal. Signal recorded one album for EMI, 1989's Loud and Clear, before disbanding soon after. In 1990, Free then joined up with Bruce Gowdy, (Stone Fury/World Trade) and Guy Allison (World Trade) (keyboards), forming a group known as Unruly Child. Unruly Child signed with Atlantic/Interscope Records in 1991 and released their self-titled debut album in 1992. In 1993, Free sang the theme song, \\"(To Be) The Best of the Best\\", for the action film, Best of the Best II. Also in 1993, a solo album consisting of demos Free had sung for a mother/daughter songwriting duo named Judithe and Robin Randall was released on an independent label in the UK called Now & Then Records. The album entitled Long Way from Love was re-released on Frontiers Records in 1998. This album version included some of the live performances Free gave while in Manchester, England for the first rock festival known as \\"The Gods of AOR\\" in October 1993. Shortly after the release of Long Way from Love, Unruly Child, after losing their record deal with Atlantic/Interscope, had reformed under the moniker Twelve Pound Sledge and were writing new material in hopes of re- signing with another U.S. label. That never happened, though songs from these sessions were later released in 1995, as a solo album on independent labels in Germany and Japan, entitled Tormented. Suffering with gender dysphoria all her life, Free came out to the world as Marcie Free in November 1993. In 1995, Free retired from the music business and moved back to Michigan to be close to her family. However, she still sings professionally on the side and in September 2009, Free, Gowdy and Allison reunited as Unruly Child and signed a recording contract with Frontiers Records. A new album with that label, Worlds Collide, has been released to critical acclaim. Unruly Child's triad (Free, Gowdy, Allison) continues to write and record. They released a new album in 2014 entitled Down the Rabbit Hole on the band's own label \\"Unruly Records\\".MelodicRock.com Interviews: The History Of Mark Free ==Discography== Studio albums *Long Way from Love (1993) with King Kobra * Ready to Strike (1985) * Thrill of a Lifetime (1986) with Signal * Loud & Clear (1989) * Signal Live (2000) with Unruly Child * Unruly Child (1992) * Tormented (1995) as Marcie Free * Worlds Collide (2010) * Down the Rabbit Hole (2014) * Can't Go Home (2017) * Big Blue World (2019) Guest appearances * David Cassidy – David Cassidy (1990) * Desmond Child – Discipline (1991) * Julio Iglesias – Crazy (1994) * Bobby Kimball – Rise Up (1994) * Venus & Mars – New Moon Rising (1998) * Venus & Mars – Grand Trine (2009) ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from South Bend, Indiana Category:American heavy metal singers Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from Indiana Category:LGBT singers from the United States Category:Transgender and transsexual musicians Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:King Kobra members ","title":"Marcie Free"},{"id":"12384241","text":"Craugastor rhodopis, also known as the polymorphic robber frog, is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The snout is subelliptical to elliptical from above and rounded in profile. The upper eye is covered with large tubercles. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers have large discs and weak lateral fringes. The toes have large discs, definite fringes, and are heavily webbed. Skin is dorsally very rugose.

The venter is pale yellow and is heavily marked brown, as is the throat and chest. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Craugastor rhyacobatrachus are streams in streams within humid montane forests at elevations of above sea level. It is associated with rocks and waterfalls, normally found at night sitting or foraging on rocks in mountain streams. This species was once quite common where it occurred. It appears to have gone extinct in Costa Rica, where, as of 2007, it has not been seen after 1964. It is also believed to have declined in Panama. In addition to habitat loss, the decline is assumed to be caused by chytridiomycosis. ==References== rhyacobatrachus Category:Frogs of North America Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Endangered fauna of North America Category:Taxa named by Jonathan A.

Frank and Ramus (1995) invented the name Veragua robber frog for use in English for the taxon Eleutherodactylus biporcatus (now the name of a Venezuelan species, but in 1995 the name for four other species of frog, including this one, see taxonomy), Veragua being a province of Colombia in the 1860s (now in central Panama) where in 1995 the holotype of E. biporcatus was thought to have been obtained. Because of the taxonomic reshuffling which occurred after Frank and Ramus coined the name \\"Veragua robber frog\\", their name is presently applied to Craugastor rugosus, despite the fact that it does not occur in Veraguas Province, and now shares this name with other species derived from E. biporcatus. ==Taxonomy== This frog is thought to have first been collected in Chiriquí whilst the region was still Colombian (Panama succeeded a few decades later) by one H. Ribbe, who sent a collection of herpetological specimens to Berlin in the early 1870s. It was then given the name Hylodes rugosus by Wilhelm Peters in 1873 in a lecture read before the Royal Prussian Academy of Science. A formal description was published in an untitled summary of this lecture (later titled as Über eine neue Schildkrötenart, Cinosternon effeldtii und einige andere neue oder weniger bekannte Amphibien) a year later (although dated to the previous year) by an anonymous author (edited by Ernst Kummer) in the monthly notice of the academy. Peters is considered the authority of the taxon. According to Bauer, Günther, and Klipfel in 1995 the holotype is ZMB7812, stored at the Berlin Zoological Museum (ZMB), however the ZMB itself has the holotype specimen being ZMB133470.SysTax. SysTax - Zoological Collections. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/zyqkbl accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-09-11. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1038094822 In 1877 the famous US fossil baron Edward Drinker Cope, having received a frog specimen from somewhere on the west coast of Central America (fide Cochran (1961)), described it as Lithodytes pelviculus. This specimen is preserved as USNM32326 according to Darrel R. Frost, Noble has it as USNM3236. In 1881 Paul Brocchi reclassified this taxon under the genus Hylodes. In 1893 Cope described the frog a second time as a new species under the name Lithodytes florulentus, having acquired a single juvenile specimen, with the head damaged, from the \\"Boruca\\" in the canton of Buenos Aires in Puntarenas Province of the southern Pacific zone of Costa Rica, from one G. K. Cherrie. Unfortunately the type specimen for this taxon is lost (fide Savage and Myers (2002)). Albert Günther, working in Britain, moved this new taxon to Hylodes a few years later, in 1900, and produced the first comprehensive check-lists for the countries of the region. At this time, H. rugosus was only known from Panama and Nicaragua, but suspected to occur in Costa Rica, whilst H. megacephalus, a frog also named by Cope from Costa Rica, was commonly considered extant here, and H. florulentus was still known from Cope's single specimen from the eastern highlands. According to Günther, H. pelviculus was a synonym of H. megacephalus. Thus, by the turn of the previous century what is presently (2019) understood as this frog species consisted of two taxa and one mixed taxon, and in 1904 the Norwegian herpetologist Leonhard Stejneger moved them all to the genus Eleutherodactylus. In the second half of 1916, during the United States occupation of Nicaragua and in the midst of an anti-imperialist civil war, an American herpetological and ichthyological expedition was mounted to obtain new specimens for US museums. As such, the expedition members returned without incident by early the next year, and the Harvard student Gladwyn Kingsley Noble set about describing the amphibians amongst their many collections. A series of thirty-one specimens were ascribed by him to belong to this taxon. He concluded that E. rugosus was simply the immature form of what was hereto known as E. megacephalus, believing that the darker colour of E. rugosus would lighten to that of E. megacephalus (in this collection there were some small individuals with light colour, but Noble does not explain this), and that the lack of cranial crest ornamentation in specimens previously identified as E. rugosus was simply a due to immaturity: according to him larger specimens of E. rugosus showed developing crests. As E. rugosus was the older name, and E. megacephalus the junior synonym, Noble considered E. rugosus the correct name, although it appears that many later authors preferred Cope's E. megacephalus. Noble agreed with Günther in that E. pelviculus was a synonym of E. megacephalus, and also mentioned the possible synonymy of yet another Cope taxon, E. gulosus - a rare, curiously large taxon only known at the time from the initial collection, although he did not formally synonymise this taxon as well. In 1921 Emmett Dunn collected what was thought to be the first specimen of E. rugosus known from Costa Rica near the town of Monteverde, himself and Tom Barbour not agreeing with Noble's synonymy. Fritz Nieden also ignored Noble in his contribution to the second edition of Das Tierreich (book 46) in 1923. Between 1947 and 1951 Richard Clark Taylor and Edward Harrison Taylor visited Costa Rica for a combined total of 8 months, and the two men amassed a collection of over 6,000 herpetology specimens, more than the total that had been harvested from the country in the previous centuries. In his report on the amphibians of the country based on this collection, the latter Taylor follows Noble in considering E. megacephalus to be a synonym E. rugosus, however Taylor expresses some doubt as to if E. pelviculus and E. gulosus could truly be synonymised with E. rugosus, both based on such a paucity of unclear evidence. Throughout most of 20th century this species was considered to be two accepted species under Stejneger's Eleutherodactylus taxonomy: E. florulentus (still only known from a single damaged specimen, missing since the 19th century) and E. rugosus (at the time a mix of both modern E. rugosus and modern E. megacephalus, and thought to be distributed from Honduras (perhaps even Mexico) to Panama), but in 1975 John D. Lynch synonymised both E. florulentus and E. rugosus, along with the older nomen E. pelviculus and E. megacephalus, and the mysterious E. gulosus (also still only known from the initial collections at the time), with E. biporcatus -under which the frogs of this species were known for the next few decades, and which was henceforth thought to be distributed from Honduras to Peru. In 2002 Savage and Myers reassessed E. biporcatus, searching for the type specimens of the various synonyms in Berlin. They were unable to locate some (see above), but managed to discover that the actual holotype for E. biporcatus had been collected in Venezuela, not in Veraguas Province as had been thought previously. This meant that E. maussi, as a Venezuelan taxon of frogs was known at the time, was in fact a junior synonym of E. biporcatus. Due to this, Savage and Myers split the old E. biporcatus into three resurrected taxa and one new species (E. opimus). Savage and Myers also synonymised E. florulentus and E. pelviculus with the earliest name; Peters' E. rugosus described in Germany in 1873, as Günther had first partially suggested over a century earlier. Not everyone accepted these changes however, Crawford and Smith moved E. florulentus to Craugastor florulentus in 2005, and Frost et al. recognised C. florulentus in 2006. In 2014 Frost accepted Savage and Myers' 2002 synonymy. Interspecific taxonomy It was formerly classified in the family Leptodactylidae but as of 2014 is placed in the family Craugastoridae. In 1989 Stephen Blair Hedges classified Eleutherodactylus florulentus, as specimens of this species were known at the time, in the subgenus Craugastor. In 2008 Hedges, Duellman and Heinicke also classified C. rugosus in the subgenus Craugastor. Savage includes this species in his Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri series, E. biporcatus group in 2002. Hedges, Duellman and Heinicke place it in their Craugastor gulosus series in 2008. Padial, Grant and Frost classify it under their C. punctariolus series in 2014. ==Description== These are relatively big rain frogs with a large head (females to in snout–vent length, males to ). The eyes have a black iris and the upper eyelid is covered in warts and bumps. There are crests just behind the eyes. The dorsum (back) is covered in warts and the creature appears much like a toad. There are hourglass-shaped ridges on the upper back, these are lined in lighter coloured stripes. There is no webbing between the digits of the limbs. The dorsum is dark brown, dark grey, or black in colour. The ventral surface of the animal is mottled brown with white and red. The ventral surfaces of the thighs may be either yellowish or orange. The inner thighs are ornamented with alternating bars of black and bright scarlet red; the black bars continue to the dorsal surface of the thighs. The groin has bright white and black marks. The juveniles are coloured differently than the adults: the dorsal warts are tipped in white at first but darken with age, the inner thighs are barred with white and black, and the ventral surfaces of the legs and groin are orange-red. According to Noble, it has a noticeably thicker and more robust stomach wall than other species of Eleutherodactylus (now split into Craugastor and other genera), but he was dissecting a mix of different species, mostly C. megacephalus, in order to describe C. rugosus. This frog is thought likely to not make a mating call. It has a karyotype of 2n= 20. Similar species It is easily told apart from most species of Craugastor which occur in the same region by the head being broader than long. The most similar species are C. megacephalus and C. gulosus, but both are much larger species. C. opimus from South America is also very similar, but does not occur sympatrically. ==Distribution== Although the distribution of this species at present is believed to be mostly restricted to eastern Costa Rica, initially it was in fact believed not to occur in this country and to exist in two disjunct populations in Nicaragua and Panama, this situation persisting until at least 1923 (fide Fritz Nieden). According to Savage (2002) and Frost (2015), Craugastor rugosus is now found on the slopes and lowlands facing the Pacific from the downstream region of the Rio Carara in Costa Rica southwards to the southern part of far western Panama. However, it is possible that the distribution of this species in fact stretches further north and east than indicated, although the history of taxonomic confusion makes it complicated to ascertain.

It is seen in Costa Rica in the Carara National Park, the Fila Chonta mountains, the Osa Peninsula and in the harbour town of Quepos, all in Puntarenas Province. ==Ecology== This frog can be found in humid and hot tropical lowland rainforests, moist premontane forest, secondary forest, plantations and heavily altered former forest habitats. It is usually found amongst the leaf litter of the forest. It has been seen hopping on the forest floor during the day. According to Savage (2002) it is found at altitudes from to above sea level. It is likely an ambush predator which generally preys on beetles, but may also attack lizards and other frogs. ==Conservation== According to the IUCN it was threatened by habitat loss in 2004. Protected populations occur in Carara National Park, Río Piro Wildlife Refuge, Corcovado National Park, Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge (from ), and at least historically in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve area. ==References External links == * Numerous in situ photographs of the frog rugosus Category:Amphibians described in 1873 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Craugastor rugosus"},{"id":"12384257","text":"Sagebrush Trail (UK title An Innocent Man) is a 1933 American Pre-Code Western film with locations filmed at Bronson Canyon starring John Wayne and featuring Lane Chandler and Yakima Canutt (Canutt plays the leader of the gang as well as doubling for Wayne in several stunts).

The following is a list of neighborhoods in Norwich. ==Bean Hill== Bean Hill was originally a separate village, located about a mile from the center of Norwich in close proximity to the Norwichtown Green. It was founded by a group of Episcopalians around a small green (now a public park). In the early 19th century it was the site of the Norwich Methodist Episcopal Church, which met in a building that also housed a classical academy and a free school.Excerpt from David Ruggles: A Radical Black Abolitionist and the Underground Railroad in New York City by Graham Hodges. Wall Street Journal website, accessed October 18, 2010. The African American abolitionist David Ruggles grew up in Bean Hill and had an Underground Railroad stop in this area in one of the houses. Several of the old colonial houses and the Methodist church building (now a photographic and investment business) still stand. Modern Bean Hill grew in all directions with the coming of a highway on and off ramp depositing into the area just below the green. This area is now commercial with numerous gas stations, a Courtyard Marriott and a park and ride. Extending out from the Green are more commercial establishments, small shopping centers and, to the northeast, residential neighborhoods. The copper company Phelps Dodge is located in the farther reaches of Bean Hill next to old mills. ==Chelsea or Downtown== Looking down Main Street, from Broadway, towards the Square, from a 1916 postcard Because of its location at the Y-fork of the Thames, Shetucket and Yantic Rivers, Chelsea became the home of the city's former shipping harbor located on Hollyhock Island. Because of Norwich's industrial and commercial nature, this neighborhood is quite large, with its borders extending from Washington Street in the west to Burnham Square in the east. At the core of Norwich's downtown are the harbor and a dense grouping of 18th-century buildings that are still mostly intact.Our Neighborhoods, Norwich Community Development Corporation The majority of big business, including the Wauregan Hotel, Reid and Hughes, Sears, Woolworth's and Chelsea Groton Bank, developed around Centennial Square before either closing altogether or moving out of the city or to East Great Plain with the economic tide. Numerous churches and historic homes, the former YMCA of Southeastern ConnecticutYMCA of Southeastern Connecticut and Post Office are also in and around Chelsea. The old train station and tracks are located here also, along with the city's grand Second Empire-style (1870) City Hall, New London County Superior Court, CLA Engineers and the Otis Library. The oldest remaining building in the city, Chelsea Landing Pub, is located here as well. The main public areas in this district are Centennial (aka Franklin) Square, City Hall (aka Union) Square and Howard T. Brown Memorial Park. The offices of the Norwich Bulletin are located in the former railroad station, most recently the site of the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen. The newspaper's previous longtime location, the Sunshine Building and the main newspaper building on Franklin Street in the north, just below the AT&T; offices next to City Hall, is now vacant. The original Otis Library was in a small brick building across the square from City Hall. In 2007 it moved from its previous location on Main Street, into a new Mission-style building on Main Street that incorporates its previous and adjacent locations. Chelsea/Downtown declined greatly after the city's manufacturing businesses moved overseas and downstate after shipping moved to New London. Most businesses went defunct, including the Wauregan Hotel. Many of the now-vacant buildings quickly fell into disrepair. The area was renamed the Chelsea Arts District for the theaters—the Donald L. Oat (run by the Norwich Arts Council) and the Spirit of Broadway—and small galleries that have been pioneers in trying to revive the downtown. Hollyhock Island became home to a pleasure craft marina on the south end and a decaying industrial zone with a sewage treatment plant on the north end. Several important buildings in downtown have been renovated, specifically the Wauregan Hotel, Chelsea Landing and Otis Library. Although not completely salvaged, Hollyhock Island was freed of the abandoned Duffy Mill complex. In 2012 a $22 million Intermodal Transportation Center was dedicated on Hollyhock Island. As of March 2015, the building remains mostly vacant except for serving as a turnaround for the region's Southeast Area Transit Authority (SEAT) buses. The harbor area and Howard T. Brown Park are popular for summertime music concerts and various annual festivals, including the Taste of Italy (Labor Day weekend), Juneteenth, and the Rotary Club of Norwich's summer carnival ==East Great Plains (or Westside)== Named from at least 1890, this section of Norwich is located in the southwest part of the city and is centered around the junction of New London Turnpike and Route 82. Three Rivers Community College, the Norwich Rose Garden Ice Rink and the Norwich Public Golf Course are located in East Great Plains. Stanton Elementary School is located in East Great Plains next to the second of Norwich's synagogues, Beth Jacob. ==East Side== On the Shetucket River and hills just northeast of Laurel Hill, this is a largely ethnic neighborhood on East Main Street and Hamilton Avenue. When first occupied, this district was dominated by Italian immigrants and later Poles. Haitians, Hispanics and most recently Asians have made this neighborhood their home. Anglo Saxon families have integrated the neighborhood as well, providing for a true melting pot. The area has not lost its ethnic character, as new Asian grocery stores open up alongside old Italian shops. Before water services were extended across the Shetucket, the East Side was watered by a spring up in the hills above Talman Street. The water would flow down and be collected by families at a communal fountain. Recently in a local ceremony, the fountain was reestablished in a small flowered alcove underneath a parking lot. This landmark of the East Side is observable from the intersection of Talman Street and East Main Street where it comes off the Preston Bridge. The Thames River Academy is located on the East Side. ==Greeneville== The Greeneville section of Norwich Connecticut was named by William Greene. In 1826, Greene purchased land on both sides of the Shetucket River to develop. In 1828, he transferred the land to the Norwich Water Power Company, in which he was the largest shareholder. Norwich Water Power Company began construction on a dam in 1829. By 1833, the dam and canals were finished and capable of providing water power to 40,000 to 50,000 spindles. Mills were quickly built along the Shetucket River during the mid-19th century to take advantage of this water power. The remains of the original dam may still be seen upstream of the present dam. Greeneville was originally settled by Irish immigrants who established St. Mary's Church in 1845, making it the oldest Catholic church in eastern Connecticut. The original structure still exists as Savage Hardware Store. The current church, completed in 1867, is located on Central Avenue. While originally Irish, it now also serves growing Hispanic and Haitian populations, regularly offering masses in Spanish and Creole. The Greeneville Dam Fishing Area provides fishing and boating access to the Shetucket River at the site of a fish ladder and dam operated by Norwich Public Utilities. Greeneville's Neighborhood Revitalization Zone committee is active in keeping the Greeneville section friendly for families and small businesses. ==Jail Hill== Located just above downtown, this district once featured a hilltop prison. It is now a quiet residential area with winding streets and view of the rest of the city. ==Laurel Hill== View from Laurel Hill, about 1916 On the opposite side of the river from Thamesville is Laurel Hill. It is also predominantly residential with most businesses and organization buildings located on Route 12. Its very riverfront contains old warehouses, a condemned trainyard and a cleared landfill. The former Thermos Corporation operated a plant here, the building of which has been converted into the Integrated Day Charter School. The Norwich portion of the now-defunct Norwich State Hospital is located on the very south end of Laurel Hill along with an abandoned planned community that is considered part of the former psychiatric hospital. There is also an apartment community right before the abandoned hospital called Thames View Apartments. Adjacent to the apartment complex is the Laurel Hill Volunteer Fire Department. Veterans' Memorial Elementary School and the former Laurel Hill Neighborhood School make up this neighborhood's educational dimensions. ==Norwichtown== Located in north central Norwich, Norwichtown is the old town of Norwich, where the town's founders first settled. The Norwichtown Green is surrounded by many historic houses and shops (now converted into law practices, nursing homes or bed and breakfasts) such as the John Mason School (now the central administration for the Norwich Public School System) and First Congregational Church. The neighborhood includes the Norwichtown Historic District. ==Occum== Named after Samson Occom, this was another milltown that was later incorporated into Norwich. Like Greeneville, it is located on the Shetucket River. The old mill and dam have since been demolished. Occum contains a small business center with a fire station and public park. The rest is devoted to residential housing and churches extending into Baltic. ==Ox Hill== Located just to the northeast of Washington Street and Broadway, Ox Hill is predominantly residential and recreational. The Norwich Vocational Technical High School is located at the former Mohegan Campus of Three Rivers Community (January 2009), the Mohegan Campus having merged with the Thames Valley campus.Norwich Tech project delayed until early next year Thomas J. Kelly Junior High School is located next to the vocational high school campus. Across the road from Kelly are sports fields, courts and parks used by the Norwich Recreation Department. The Rose City Senior Center and three broadcast towers are located up here as well. The rest of the area is residential in nature with connections to Norwichtown. Mohegan Park is also located on Ox Hill. ==Plain Hill== This gently sloping hill is located on the outskirts of Norwich, just above Bean Hill. It extends all the way up to the Sprague border. The area is entirely residential and very rural, with one main route (Plain Hill Road) connecting to side streets. Houses are few and far between in the more forested areas, while cleared areas host several homes and a radio tower. Side streets lead off into smaller subdivisions. Wilcox Pond, and Bog Meadow Reservoirs, two of the city's backup reservoirs, are located on Plain Hill. The city's meetinghouse for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints is located on Plain Hill near the Sprague border. ==Taftville== Ponemah Mills, about 1918 Named after the founder of the large textile mill in 1866, Taftville is north of Greeneville and west of the Shetucket River. Since the 19th century, Taftville has been the center of Norwich's French-Canadian population. Sacred Heart Church, located on the village's main street (Providence Street), for years celebrated the Catholic Mass in French. ==Thamesville== Taking its name from the Thames River, this predominantly residential neighborhood overlooks Chelsea, Laurel Hill, the Marina (former port of Norwich), and Thames and Yantic Rivers. Hosting small riverside businesses, this neighborhood intermixes local commerce and residential properties along Route 32 and the areas inland (West)to East Great Plains. The Norwich Police Department and City Fire Department cap off its northernmost point, and provide immediate response to this and many of the surrounding areas. Home to the American Ambulance headquarters and another office building designed by Richard Sharpe and Associates, Thamesville brings new air to the traditional architecture that dominated the area. The Spa at Norwich Inn is located in the southern portion of Thamesville, and is within walking distance or a short drive to the Mohegan Sun Casino Resort, located further south on Route 32. Thamesville itself is well within walking distance to most of the night-life of Chelsea also, but offers many venues of its own. The Basement Cafe, Fat Cat's, and Engine No. 6 are places the locals eat and relax. Next to the Uncasville border, a string of car dealerships has earned this portion of Route 32 the nickname, \\"The Auto Mall\\". The area's Shipping Street, site of the former Lehigh Oil Company complex, is one of Norwich's numerous blighted, abandoned manufacturing districts. Unfortunately it is the first view of Norwich from the Thames River traveling north from New London. Thamesville is a still developing neighborhood within Norwich. Formerly farmland (inland) and warehouse storage and factory sites (along the rivers), this area began to shift to predominately residential zones during the early- to mid-19th century, but offers many sites still available for development. Most of the homes in this area are single-family, with remodeled homes, apartment complexes, and condominiums filling the remainder this neighborhood. ==Union Street and City Hall Square== This is the in-between zone between Chelsea and Washington Street and Broadway. It contains two historic congregations (American Baptist and UCC) on City Hall Square, several city offices and numerous houses stretching up the hill towards Little Plains Park. The City Hall Square portion was originally known as Union Square. ==Washington Street and Broadway== This is the neighborhood between Chelsea and Norwichtown that stretches down the length of Washington Street and Broadway. During the city's economic booms during the Civil War and Reconstruction Period, this district became the playground of the rich. Numerous mansions, many of which still stand today, line Washington Street and Broadway while smaller houses exist behind them on side streets. Like Chelsea, during the economic slump Washington Street and Broadway also declined. The millionaires left and most of the mansions fell into states of disrepair. Recently, an effort has been undertaken to spruce up the neighborhood. Many of the mansions have been repaired and some converted to apartment spaces. The largest structure in the city, Saint Patrick's Cathedral,St. Patrick's Cathedral website stands at the intersection of Broadway and Union Street just above Little Plains Park. Built solely by the Irish immigrants to the city with dimes and wages, Saint Patrick's is a solid stone Roman Catholic cathedral, whose main steeple is the tallest structure in the city. The seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich, Saint Patrick's property extends to the Chancery, Offices and Saint Patrick's School in surrounding buildings. Monsignor King Park just across the street commemorates a former Monsignor of the cathedral. Other prominent churches in the neighborhood include Park Congregational Church. The Norwich Free Academy is just north of Saint Patrick's on Broadway. William W. Backus Hospital, about 1920 Chelsea Parade is the main park in Washington Street and Broadway. Containing a Civil War Memorial, the city time capsule and a flag pole, this area is mainly used as a war memorial and hosts the Memorial Day Parade and Remembrance Ceremonies. Columbus Park with a small obelisk dedicated to Christopher Columbus is located adjacent to the parade and across Crescent Street from the Norwich Free Academy. Across a small divider street from the tip of the parade is War Memorial Park, a small plot of land with memorials to veterans of foreign wars and POW-MIAs. Around Chelsea Parade is the Masonic Temple (since demolished in order to preserve an ancient Mohegan Indian burial ground), the Blackstone Apartments and smaller mansions. Up in the area of Sachem and Asylum Streets is Heritage Falls Park and Indian Leap, where an escaped Narragansett captive leaped over the Yantic Falls while fleeing from pursuing Mohegan Indians. This district extends up to the Norwichtown welcome sign on Washington Street. Between Norwichtown and the end of Washington Street lies the William W. Backus Hospital on 326 Washington street. Dedicated in 1893, Backus Hospital is named for William Wolcott Backus, a member of one of Norwich's oldest families who (along with William Albert Slater) led the effort to build it.Backus at a Glance - History Today, Backus is the city’s largest non-government employer. ==Yantic== Yantic Firehouse taken from Hale Mill The village is named after the Yantic River which flows through it. This was originally an independent milltown that was the site of several mills, including the former Yantic Woolen Company Mill.Village of Yantic, Connecticut http://neyarnandpattern.tripod.com/id42.html It contains small businesses, houses, some hotels, a strip club, a highway, a railroad, a firehouse and its picnic grounds, and the mill buildings. The New England Central Railroad tracks cross the Yantic River in Yantic over a truss bridge. Nearby, Sunnyside Street crosses the Yantic River over a unique stone bridge whose western end is flanked by two small towers. The Yantic Volunteer Fire Department Yantic Fire Engine Co. No. 1 http://www.yanticfireco.org/ is located opposite the former mill. Due to the planned nature of the milltowns that are now part of Norwich, Yantic contains a grid pattern street with mill house duplexes and Grace Episcopal Church. The last operator of the mill was the Hale Manufacturing Company, which ended production at the mill in 1988. In the early 1990s a project to convert the mill to a resort hotel was begun. However, plagued by financial and construction mis-management since 1995, it has been the latest failed attempt to revitalize the economic vitality of the once thriving village.

Craugastor stadelmani was formerly a relatively common species, but populations underwent dramatic declines in the 1990s. In 2004, the species was considered critically endangered, even possibly extinct, with no recent observations from the surveyed sites. The decline was probably caused by habitat loss, although chytridiomycosis may also have played a role, given that the species disappeared also from pristine sites; several populations occurred within protected areas. However, two living specimens were discovered in 2010 at one of sites where the species had apparently disappeared. Nevertheless, habitat loss remains a grave concern for the survival of this species.

One of the most famous Italian composers of his day, he was completely forgotten until 1962, when his work was discovered by composer, conductor, and musicologist Uberto Zanolli. ==Biography== Facco was born in Marsango, a small settlement near Padua and Venice.Cetrangolo, Grove. For many years, he was a conductor in Italy. In 1705, he was employed in Palermo as choirmaster, teacher, and violin virtuoso to Carlo Antonio Spinola, Marquis of Los Balbases (the Viceroy of Sicily). In 1708, the viceroy transferred his residence to Messina, and Facco followed him. In Messina, he composed The Fight between Mercy and Incredulity. In 1710, he presented in Messina Cathedral his work The Augury of Victories, dedicated to King Felipe V. In a report dated 22 January 1720, the Patriarch of the West Indies, Cardinal Carlos de Borja de Centelles and Ponce of León, Archbishop of Trebisonda, wrote that Facco had an excellent pay in the court of the king of Spain (having rejected an offer, of equal pay, by the Portuguese court, where Spinola served as Spanish ambassador). On 9 February, Facco was named clavichord master to the Prince of Asturias, Don Luis, the future King Luis I. Facco subsequently became clavichord master to the future king Fernando VI and, after 1 October 1731, to the future King Carlos III of Spain. In 1720, while Facco was considered one of the best composers of the time, the city council of Madrid commissioned him to compose an opera on a libretto by Jose de Cañizares. The opera, entitled Love is all Invention, or, Jupiter y Amphitrion, was performed in the Coliseo of the Buen Retiro Palace. It was dedicated to Saints Martha and Mary to celebrate the marriage of Facco's student, the Prince de Asturias, to Isabel of Orleans (which occurred in January 1721). In 1724 he wrote the music for the proclamation feast of Luis I. Facco fell victim of his scheming colleagues: he slowly lost all of his positions until, in the last years of his life, he was merely a violinist in the orchestra of the Royal Chapel. He died in Madrid on 16 February 1753. ==Works== Facco wrote a cycle of twelve concertos for violin, strings and organ with the title of Pensieri Adriarmonici (Thoughts Adriarmonicous), published in Amsterdam, the first book in 1716 and the second in 1718. He also wrote solo cantatas—on his own texts, for he was a skilled poet—these were found at the National Library of Paris, and were presented by soprano Betty Fabila for the first time (conducted by Uberto Zanolli) in 1962 at the Castle of Chapultepec in Mexico City. Facco must have composed numerous sacred works for the Royal Chapel in Madrid, but this music was probably destroyed, along with many other compositions, in the fire of 1734. Much of the information about Facco's life and works was discovered by Uberto Zanolli, an Italian- Mexican composer who found Facco's Pensieri Adriarmonici at the Vizcain Library in Mexico City in 1962. Since then, Zanolli has worked on putting together a biography of Facco and a musicological recovery of his work. Among other finds was Facco's birth certificate. ==List of works== Operas * Le regine di Macedonia (1710) * I rivali generosi (1712) * Penelope la casta, Act 3 only (1713; rest by P.

He was called by some the \\"Pugin of Belgium\\", with reference to influence on Bethune of the English Gothic Revival architect and designer, Augustus Pugin.William Henry James Weale, in: Building News, XXXVI, 1879, p. 350 ==Life== He was born in Kortrijk in 1821 in a wealthy Flemish family of French origin. He and his relatives were fervent Catholics, and many were active in politics and civil service. The family which was originally called \\"Bethune\\" was in 1845 granted nobility by the Belgian King and added the preposition \\"de\\" (some of them took the name \\"de Béthune-Sully\\"), in the 20th century, to underline their noble status. However, this great architect never used the particule. Bethune first studied law at the Catholic University of Leuven and later embarked on a career in public service on the provincial council of West Flanders in Bruges. He received his basic artistic training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kortrijk (his teachers were L. Verhaegen and Jules Victor Génisson). Paul Lauters introduced him to landscape painting while the sculptor C. H. Geerts (1807–1855) - himself a pioneer of the Gothic Revival style - made him familiar with sculpture. In 1842-1843 and in 1850 he visited England and met Augustus Welby Pugin (1812–1852) the advocate of Gothicism in England and another enthusiastic Catholic. The encounter with Pugin and his creations further stimulated Bethune's interest in architecture and applied arts. In imitation of Pugin and his followers, Bethune developed the idea that an artistic revival of the arts of the Christian world of the Middle Ages could inspire a new profoundly Christian/Catholic society. At home Bethune was encouraged by Canon C. Carton to become involved in the creation of genuinely \\"Christian Art\\". Gradually he began to make designs himself. In 1854 he even set up his own stained-glass workshop, advised by J. Hardman (1812–67), Pugin's stained-glass manufacturer. In 1862 he was a co-founder of the \\"Saint Luke schools\\" (Sint-Lucasscholen). These schools were opened as a Catholic counterpart to the official Academies and trained architects in the religious spirit of the Gothic tradition. The first permanent Saint Luke school opened in Ghent in 1863. These schools also offered an education for artisans that could work with stained glass, wood carving, painting, gold- and silverwork... The aim was to train craftsmen that could cope with the overall decoration of a newly built, fully decorated, Gothic church. As a teacher and as a patron of the archaeological society of the \\"Gilde de Saint-Thomas et de Saint-Luc\\" founded in 1863, Bethune had a decisive influence on the evolution of the Gothic Revival style in Belgium. Among those he taught or influenced were the architects Joris Helleputte and Louis Cloquet. Abroad, he maintained contacts and was appreciated by contemporaries such as Pierre Cuypers, Edward Welby Pugin, August Reichensperger and Edward von Steinle. ==Work== Loppem Castle In his architectural creations Bethune adopted the formal vocabulary of the typical late medieval brick architecture of Flanders, and specifically Bruges. Through his influence and teaching he introduced this stance by many of his followers. This, together with his strong Catholic inspiration and his association with the Gothic Revival movement in England, marks the difference between his school and the Neo-Gothic architecture advocated in Belgium by the Academies and the followers of Viollet-le-Duc. The latter school was more interested in restorations, while their new creations were mostly inspired by the French and Brabantic Gothic architecture. In general their creations were more inspired by a civil romanticism and lacked the religious and social idealism of Bethune and his Saint-Luke schools. Apart from architectural projects his very extensive oeuvre includes designs for practically all the plastic and decorative arts. From Belgium his designs found their way to most other European countries. The quality of his work can best be judged from his integrated building projects, which combine all forms of art, such as Loppem Castle, the complex in Vivenkapelle (including a church, a presbytery and a convent school) and the large complex of Maredsous Abbey. Bethune's designs show a strong architectural, archaeological and didactic character. With his stained-glass windows (f.e. in the cathedrals of Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, and Tournai), his mural paintings, (f.e. in the castle of Maaltebrugge, 1862–1864), and his mosaics (Aachen Cathedral 1872) he contributed significantly to the revival of these art forms. Among his most important realisations as a designer of gold- and silverwork are the Belgian Tiara offered to pope Pius IX in 1871, the Charles-the-Good Shrine in St. Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges (1883), the Saint Lambert Shrine in the St. Paul's Cathedral in Liège (1884). ==List of works== Neo-Byzantine mosaics in the dome of Aachen Cathedral designed by Bethune Architecture All architectural projects include the designs for decoration and furnishings. * Loppem Castle, 1859–1862. * Church, presbytery and schools in Vivenkapelle near Damme, 1860–1870. * Maredsous Abbey, 1872–1889. * Church Sacré Coeur of \\"Le Trieu\\" in Courrière, 1872–1873. * Church of the beguinage of Sint-Amandsberg near Ghent, 1874. * Chapel of Our Lady at the Jesuit Convent 'Oude Abdij\\" in Drongen, 1877. * Convent of the \\"Clarisses de l'Epeule\\" in Roubaix, France * Ecole de Saint-Luc (Saint-Luke school) in Tournai * Church Saint-Joseph in Roubaix, France * Church of , Antoing, Belgium Designs for applied arts * Design for the Belgian Tiara donated to Pope Pius IX in 1871. * Design for the mosaic decoration of the dome of Aachen Cathedral (executed by the workshop of Antonio Salviati), 1879–1881. * Funeral monument of Monseigneur Gravez, bishop of Namur, in Namur * Funeral monument of the Lefèvre family in Sclayn * Design for a Shrine to contain the relics of Charles I, Count of Flanders, in Bruges Cathedral, 1883–1885 * Design for the Shrine of Saint Lambert in the Cathedral of Liège, 1884. * Church of Dinant: Main altar and other religious furniture. * Interior decoration in the Castles of, Denée, Gesves and Spontin ==Family Name== During his lifetime, Jean Bethune never used the prefix 'de' in his family name. It was no longer in use in the family since the early 18th century. Only after his death, members of the family, including his son Jean- Baptiste (1853–1907) obtained in 1904 the 'de' addition, which was made retroactive into the person of Jean-Baptiste Bethune (1722–1799) and all his descendants. It thus also applied to Jean Bethune. It is therefore acceptable to give his name with or without the prefix, although in their genealogies, the members of the family do not use the prefix regarding ancestors who did not use it in their lifetime. Another part of the family succeeded in adding officially 'Sully' to their name. There is however no connection between them and the French princely family Bethune-Sully. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Coomans, Thomas, \\"Pugin Worldwide.

Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 228 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 1986 ==History== The Vallée du Grésivaudan in the Isère department where Peloursin is believed to have originated Ampelographers believe that Peloursin originated in the Isère department near Grenoble somewhere along the Vallée du Grésivaudan. The name Peloursin likely derives from the local word pelossier used to describe the blackthorn trees that populate the area and whose fruit the Peloursin grapes have a slight resemblance to. At some point the grape was brought to the northern Franche-Comté and Savoie wine regions but it is in the Isère that the vine crossed with Syrah to produce the Durif vine.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 316-317 & 779, Allen Lane 2012 Durif In the 1860s, French botanist François Durif kept a nursery of several grape varieties at his home in the commune of Tullins where he most likely had plantings of both Peloursin and Syrah. At some point the two vines cross pollinated and Durif discovered a new grape variety growing in his nursery. It was identified and named Plant du Rif (later Durif) by ampelographer Victor Pulliat in 1868. Durif later made its way to California where it was eventually named Petite Sirah. In the late 20th century University of California, Davis researchers led by Dr. Carole Meredith discovered that some of the California plantings of Petite Sirah were, in fact Peloursin, and that Peloursin had a parent-offspring relationship with Durif that likely sprung from a crossing with Syrah.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 168 Harcourt Books 2001 ==Viticulture== A vineyard of Durif/Petite Sirah in California. Recent DNA testing has shown that some California vineyards of Durif are actually field blends with Peloursin vines interspersed. Peloursin is a vigorous grapevine capable of producing high yields and excessive foliage if not kept in check with winter pruning and summertime leaf pulling. The variety tends to be a mid-ripening grape whose main viticultural hazards are susceptibility to botrytis bunch rot and black rot. ==Wine regions== Today Peloursin is nearly extinct in France though some attempts have been made in recent years to revive the variety. In the Tarn department of South West France plantings of the grapes have been added to an experimental vineyard in Peyrole. Jura wine producer Domaine Ganevat has plantings of Peloursin (called here Gros Béclan) in their Rotalier vineyard which they use in their vin de primeur blend. Outside France some plantings of Peloursin can be found in Victoria, Australia. In the late 20th century, several California vineyards that thought they were planted with Durif/Petite Sirah were found to be field blends that contain some plantings of Peloursin. ==Relationships and confusion with other grapes== Peloursin crossed with Syrah (pictured) to produce Durif/Petite Sirah. In addition to being a parent of Durif, Peloursin was also crossed with Persan to create Joubertin. DNA testing also suggest a relationship between Peloursin and Bia blanc which share some morphological similarities but the exact nature of that relationship is not yet known. Plantings of Peloursin are often confused with its offspring Durif and this was particularly the case in California where many plantings of Petite Sirah/Durif were discovered to actually be Peloursin. In the Jura region, it is sometimes confused both Poulsard and Béclan due to similarities in synonyms among the three grapes. In the Isère, Peloursin is sometimes confused with Dureza, one of the parent grapes of Syrah. ==Synonyms== Over the years Peloursin has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Belossard, Blauer Thuner, Chatille, Corsin (in Savoie), Durazaine, Duret, Durif fourchu, Famette, Feunette (in Haute-Savoie), Fumette (in Haute-Savoie), Gondran, Gro Nuar, Gronnat, Gronnay, Gros beclan (in Jura), Gros nat, Gros noir, Gros noirin, Gros plant, Mal noir, Mauvais noir, Mosaguin, Parlouseau, Parlousseau, Pelaursin, Pellorcin, Pellossard, Pelossard noir, Pellourcin, Pelorsin (in Isère), Pelossard, Pelossier, Peloursin noir, Plant d’Abas, Plant de Paris, Pourret (in Franche-Comté), Pourrot (in Franche-Comté), Saler, Salet, Salis, Sella, Soler, Spartin, Thuner, Thuner Rebe, Treillin, Verne and Vert noir.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Peloursin Accessed: March 24th, 2013 ==References== Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Peloursin"},{"id":"12384499","text":"Cycloramphus cedrensis is a species of frog in the family Cycloramphidae.

Four women in the family were married to doges and had the title of dogaressa: Tommasina Morosini was the wife of Pietro Gradenigo, Francesca Morosini was married to Andrea Dandolo, Dea Morosini to Niccolò Tron and Morosina Morosini to Marino Grimani. == Life == Marino Morosini's grave. Morosini was elected doge late in life, at the age of 68. At the time of his election, Morosini was the Procurator of Saint Mark's Basilica. During his political career, Morosini also held the position of Duke of Crete. He was married but did not have any children. His four-year tenure as doge was a time of peace for Venice, although during this period, Louis IX of France led a crusade against Egypt. Not wanting to jeopardize its trade agreement with the sultan, Venice chose not to participate in the crusade. Morosini sought to improve relations with the Vatican by making the concession to accept the establishment of a court of inquisition in Venice, but retained the right to appoint the judges. Nevertheless, tensions remained high between Rome and Venice.

He is most famous for hiring Joe Chill to murder young Bruce Wayne's parents in early versions of Batman's origin story, thus making him indirectly responsible for Batman's existence. ==Publication history== Lew Moxon first appeared in Detective Comics #235 and was created by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff. ==Fictional character biography== Golden / Silver Age version Sometime prior to their murder, Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha attend a costume party to which Dr. Wayne wears a bat-like costume. Thomas is subsequently taken from the party at gunpoint to meet notorious racketeer and bank robber Lew Moxon, who forces the doctor to remove a bullet from his shoulder. After completing the operation, he overpowers Moxon and his men and escapes. Lew Moxon is then arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for armed robbery. As he is taken away, he swears revenge on Thomas Wayne convinced that he's to blame for his downfall. Ten years later, Moxon's first order of business after getting released is to inform Thomas that he will get someone else to exact that revenge. It is suggested that Moxon specifically ordered Joe Chill to kill the Waynes but keep young Bruce alive, thus providing a convincing alibi for the criminal and allowing him to make the hit look like a failed robbery. Years later, Batman learns of Lew Moxon's involvement in the murder of his parents, by which time the aging gangster is operating a blimp business. Batman's first attempt to convict Moxon for the murder of his parents fails as he is now suffering from amnesia and is able to pass a lie detector test since he remembers nothing of that night. He is then released on bail with his only official crime being a minor charge for assault. Batman determines that Moxon's blimp business must be a cover for illegal activities and continues to trail the gangster. Eventually, after uncovering that Moxon is indeed using his blimps for criminal purposes, Batman confronts him while wearing his father's costume (his own had been damaged during an earlier fight). On seeing Dr. Wayne's costume, Moxon suddenly remembers what he had done. Thinking Batman was actually Thomas Wayne's ghost seeking revenge, Moxon panics and runs out into the street where he is run over and killed by a truck.Detective Comics #235. DC Comics. Modern Age (Post Zero Hour) version Lew Moxon was reintroduced into modern Batman continuity as an aging mob boss with failed political aspirations, who returned to Gotham City after several years in self-imposed exile. Years earlier, Lew Moxon traveled in the same circle of wealthy socialites as Bruce's parents, and considered the Waynes to be friendly associates despite their disdain towards his criminal activities. Bruce is invited to a party celebrating Moxon's return, at which he is reintroduced to the old man's daughter, Mallory, who turns out to be Bruce's childhood sweetheart. At the party, Wayne discovers that Moxon is the target of professional assassin Deadshot. For protection, Moxon has employed the ruthless Philo Zeiss as his bodyguard.Batman #591. DC Comics. During an earlier story, Zeiss killed Bruce's friend, Jeremy Samuels. When Bruce confronts Zeiss as Batman, Zeiss reveals that the murder of Samuels was carried out under the order of Moxon himself, as retaliation for something that Thomas Wayne had done to him years ago. Lew Moxon survives Deadshot's assassination attempts (though he is now confined to a wheelchair), but fires Zeiss for his failure. Batman discovers Mallory is an active member of her family's criminal empire.Batman #593. DC Comics. Ultimately, Batman discovers that Thomas, Martha, and (a very young) Bruce Wayne had attended a costume party (to which Dr. Wayne wore a Zorro costume) which was also attended by Moxon. At the party, Angelo Berretti, an \\"employee\\" of Moxon's business, told Dr. Wayne that a man's life was in danger. Dr. Wayne made Berretti promise his safe return before departing. He was then informed that the man in question was Moxon's nephew, who needed a bullet removed from his shoulder following a failed armed robbery. Dr. Wayne performed the operation, but refused to take any money for his services, and attacked Moxon. Following this, a furious Moxon had ordered a hit on Wayne, only to be thwarted by Berretti as he wanted to honor his word. Years later, Batman questions Berretti as to whether his former boss had been involved in the murder of the Waynes (which occurred a few months after the costume party). Berretti tells him Moxon was not involved. After Batman accepts Berretti's version of events and departs, Berretti holds his hand to his face and utters an ambiguous \\"Oh, thank God\\". Lew Moxon's involvement in the killing of the Wayne is, therefore, left to the reader's imagination.Batman #595. DC Comics. At the time when Bruce Wayne was accused of murder, Nightwing goes to stakeout Lew Moxon's house where he overhears him and Mallory arguing about the news revolving around Bruce Wayne.Nightwing Vol. 2 #66. DC Comics. Lew Moxon (alongside his current bodyguard Hellhound) is later killed by his former protector Zeiss at a meeting of Gotham's crime bosses (arranged by Spoiler). This event occurs at the commencement of the Batman: War Games story line.Batman: The 12-Cent Adventure #1. DC Comics. DC Universe In the pages of Batman: Three Jokers, Lew Moxon was mentioned to have owned a restaurant called Lew's Restaurant. It was mentioned in the news that the last members of the dwindling Moxon Crime Family were killed at their restaurant where an eyewitness states that Joker was responsible. It was also mentioned that the Moxon Crime Family were accused of orchestrating the deaths of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne only to be exonerated when Joe Chill confessed that he worked alone.Batman: Three Jokers #1. DC Comics. ==Place in continuity== During the Golden Age of Comic Books, Lew Moxon was established as the man who hired Joe Chill to kill Bruce Wayne's parents. During the Silver and Bronze Age of Comic Books, the Lew Moxon story remained canonical for tales set on Earth Two. For several years no mention is made of Moxon's role regards the origin of Batman on Earth One - that is until the Len Wein written mini- series, The Untold Legend of the Batman (published in 1980) re-introduced the Lew Moxon story, exactly as it was told in 1956. The canonical presence of the character is reinforced in the feature story in Detective Comics #500, \\"To Kill a Legend\\" when Batman and Robin are sent to a parallel Earth to avert the murder of that version of the Waynes. To accomplish that goal, the superheroes find and question that world's version of Moxon about the whereabouts of Chill. Moxon had not yet hired Chill to perform the murder and with the attention of this bizarre figure, accelerated his plan with a different killer to first murder Chill and then the Waynes. Batman discovered the dying Chill and deduced that the Waynes were in danger that very night; thus, Batman managed to arrive in Crime Alley in time and stop the murder. During the post- Crisis era, no mention is made of Lew Moxon, making his canonical status during this time uncertain. In Batman: Year Two, Batman confronts Joe Chill, much as he did in the Golden and Silver Age continuities. However, just as in previous continuities, Chill makes no reference to Lew Moxon before his demise. During the post-Zero Hour era, while Lew Moxon does appear in several issues, Joe Chill does not. After the events of Infinite Crisis, Joe Chill is again known to be responsible for the murder of the Waynes, and he was arrested for the crime on that same night. In Grant Morrison's Batman #673, Batman learns Chill acted on his own and that his parents' deaths were not ordered by someone else. ==Other versions== In the prequel comic to Justice League: Gods and Monsters, Batman tracks down Lew Moxon during a meeting with the other crime lords, along with his right-hand man, Joe Chill. When Batman corners them, Moxon offers him money to come work for him, but Batman refuses and then kills Moxon by sucking his blood. Kirk later attends Moxon's funeral where he meets Moxon's wife Angela and his son Jeremy. Kirk later becomes friends with Jeremy and reveals his secret to him. Jeremy then agrees to help Kirk find a cure for his condition. When Angela is murdered, Jeremy reveals that the other crime lords believe that Moxon had evidence against them and they also believe that he knows where they are. Batman later tracks down Angela's murderer, who turns out to be Joe Chill, who is now a vampire after Batman killed him. Batman though later on kills Chill with an axe. When he returns, Batman reveals to Jeremy that he found out that the other crime boss Chill was trying to defeat was Jeremy, who was groomed by Moxon to be a mobster like him and that his innocent, charming image was just an illusion. He then tells Jeremy that he doesn't want to be cured anymore. Jeremy then reveals that he knew that he killed his father and then offers that they work together. Before he leaves, Batman kills Jeremy by sucking his blood, leaving his body to sit in front of the fireplace. ==In other media== Lew Moxon appeared in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Chill of the Night!\\" voiced by Richard Moll. The episode mirrors many elements from the original story from the comics. Like the earlier appearances, he was the one who hired Joe Chill to kill Thomas Wayne. In this version, he admits to some guilt for leaving Bruce an orphan as the hit was only to be for Thomas Wayne and not his wife Martha. Disguised as a priest, Batman learns of Joe Chill's identity from Lew Moxon as he gives his confession on his deathbed. When Phantom Stranger brings Batman to the past where he encounters his parents at a masquerade ball, he and Thomas Wayne fend off Lew Moxon's thugs who crashed the masquerade ball to rob it. While in prison, Lew Moxon hired Joe Chill to dispose of Thomas Wayne. When he learns of this, Batman finds a lead on the identity of the man who killed his parents. ==See also== * List of Batman family enemies ==References== Category:Fictional business executives Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956 Category:Characters created by Bill Finger Category:Characters created by Sheldon Moldoff Category:Fictional crime bosses ","title":"Lew Moxon"},{"id":"12384644","text":"Pristimantis acuminatus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It is found in Costa Rica and Panama. It is locally known as sapito de hojarasca.Pounds, A., Bolaños, F., Solís, F., Ibáñez, R., Chaves, G., Savage, J., Jaramillo, C. & Fuenmayor, Q. 2004. Eleutherodactylus altae. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 22 July 2007. In 2008 the IUCN began calling it the mountain robber frog following Frank and Ramus (1995). ==Taxonomy== The species and its defining holotype were first collected on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica below the highest reach of a mountain pass between \\"Barba\\" and Irazú at approximately 4000 feet (2860m), on the mountain slope above the estate of one Felix Delgado (this region now lies in El Guarco, Cartago Province according to Savage (1974)). It was formerly, and is still often, known as Eleutherodactylus altae. It was classified in the subgenus Eleutherodactylus by John D. Lynch in 1996. Hedges, Duellman and Heinicke classified it under subgenus Hypodictyon in 2008. It was formerly classified in the family Strabomantidae but as of 2015 is placed in the family Craugastoridae. Savage (1980) classified it in the Eleutherodactylus cruentus group (which was considered a subset of the E. unistrigatus group). Lynch and Duellman (1997) considered it to be in the E. unistrigatus group of the Eleutherodactylus (Eleutherodactylus) martinicensis series. Savage (2002) placed it in the E. cruentatus group of his newly redefined E. martinicensis series. Hedges, Duellman, and Heinicke (2008) then placed it in the Pristimantis (Hypodictyon) ridens series. Padial, Grant, and Frost (2014) finally recommended not to attempt placing it in a species grouping. ==Description== This is a small frog; the males measure to 23.5mm, while the females 27mm. The back is covered in tiny bumps and the colour of it can vary from dark grey to black, sometimes but not always with tiny white speckles. The stomach and lower surface is dark brown. The eye has a copper- coloured iris. This species is distinguished by its bright coral-coloured groin. This colour extends up the front of the thigh in the form of dots, and also on the rear thigh as dots in a slightly more reddish-orange colour. This frog is thought likely to not make a mating call. It has a karyotype of 2n= 26. ==Distribution== It occurs throughout the northern section of the Cordillera Central of Costa Rica at mid-altitudes, and throughout the eastern Caribbean seaboard of this country, on the slopes of the Cordillera de Talamanca down to almost sea level, from near the Nicaraguan border southward to northwesternmost Panama in La Amistad International Park. It was initially believed it to be endemic to Costa Rica. ==Ecology== The habitats favoured by Pristimantis altae are tropical, humid, lowland and premontane forests and rainforests. It has been found at elevations of 60 to 1245m. According to Savage (2002), himself citing earlier studies, this species hides during the day in bromeliads as well as amongst leaf litter on the forest floor, and is found moving actively on low vegetation during the night. Although it is not confirmed in this species, it is thought to be a frog which lays its eggs directly on moist substrate on land, possibly on vegetation. It is thought to be a \\"direct developer\\", with the species skipping a tadpole stage, the eggs hatching directly into juvenile frogs. The only thing known about its diet is from Toft in 1981, who reported on dissecting a single individual to examine the stomach contents. These were said to be a few small arthropods. ==Conservation== Pristimantis altae is considered threatened in Costa Rica. The IUCN rated its population status to be \\"near threatened\\" in 2004, and in 2008 upheld that assessment on the grounds that the known extent of occurrence is less than 6,000km2. It is rarely seen, but often present. According to the IUCN in 2004 it was threatened by habitat loss, but in 2008 it stated that while the frog does not appear to adapt well to modified habitats, it is not believed to be threatened, as it continues to be present where it has historically been reported, is relatively abundant within its known range, and the majority of its known distribution is protected within well-managed reserves. It occurs in the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica at altitudes of 100 to 1200m. In Costa Rica it is regularly encountered by herpetologists at the Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and occurs in Braulio Carrillo National Park. It occurs in La Amistad International Park in both Costa Rica and Panama. ==References== altae Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1942 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis altae"},{"id":"12384692","text":"Pristimantis altamazonicus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Furthermore, specimens from Brazil and Bolivia traditionally referred to this species were found to represent other, as yet undescribed species. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. The snout is moderately short and sub-acuminate. Dorsal skin of dorsum smooth, but has small, scattered tubercles in males. Neither fingers nor toes are webbed but they do have lateral fringes. The dorsum and flanks are brown and have reddish and black stains. There is a clear, W-shaped mark in scapular region. There can also be longitudinal cream stripes and dark blotches. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis altamazonicus occur in closed-canopy, primary tropical forests, and occasionally in flooded or secondary forests. While they may be found in leaf-litter during the day, they are more typically perched on, and call from, low vegetation in the forest at night.

There are approximately 250 Albazinians in China who are descendants of about fifty Russian Cossacks from Albazin on the Amur River that were resettled by the Kangxi Emperor in the northeastern periphery of Beijing in 1685. Albazin was a Russian fort on the Amur River, founded by Yerofey Khabarov in 1651. It was stormed by Qing troops in 1685. The majority of its inhabitants agreed to evacuate their families and property to Nerchinsk, whereas several young Cossacks resolved to join the Manchu army and to relocate to Beijing. See Russian-Manchu border conflicts. ==Initiatives== Much uncertainty surrounds their migration to China. It is believed that, upon their arrival to the imperial capital, the Albazinians met the descendants of 33 Cossacks that had been captured by the Chinese in 1667 and several Cossacks that had settled in Beijing as early as 1649 and had become the parishioners of the South Roman Catholic Cathedral in the city. The veracity of this oral tradition about the pre-Albazinian Russian diaspora in China is open to question. The Albazinians formed a separate contingent of the imperial guard, known as the \\"unit of the yellow-stripe standard\\". Their first leader was Ananiy Uruslanov, or Ulangeri, a Tatar in the employ of the Manchu. The Russian surnames Yakovlev, Dubinin and Romanov were rendered in Chinese as Yao (姚), Du (杜), and Lo (Traditional Chinese: 羅, Simplified Chinese: 罗). The Qing gave permission for Solon widows to marry the Albazinians.Widmer 1976, p. 188. They married with Mongol and Manchu women.Aldrich 2008, p. 177.Baddeley 1919, p. 431.Standaert 2001, p. 368. The women available for marriage to the Albazinians were criminals from Beijing's jails.Widmer 1976, p. 21. Their priest, Maxim Leontiev, was allowed to hold divine service in a deserted Lamaist shrine. An old icon of St. Nicholas, evacuated by the Cossacks from Albazin, was placed in this unusual church, dedicated to the Holy Wisdom. The Albazinian company was placed into the Manchu Bordered Yellow Banner and lived in the northeast of the \\"Tartar city\\" in Beijing.Widmer 1976, p. 20. The Albazians were made into a Baoyi company, not a military company.Widmer 1976, p. 21. Although the descendants of the Cossacks intermarried with the Chinese and gradually lost their command of the Russian language, the Russian Orthodox Church regularly sent missions to Beijing, starting in 1713. As a result, the Abazinians came to form the core of the Chinese Orthodox Church. In 1831, Ioakinf Bichurin reported that there were 94 Albazinians in the capital of China. Other Russian travellers noted that, apart from their faith, the Albazinians were thoroughly Sinicized and bore little physical resemblance to the Russians. By the end of the 19th century, their number was estimated at 1,000. The Boxer Rebellion entailed the persecution of all Christians and Europeans in China. The Russian Orthodox Church claims that 222 Orthodox Chinese were martyred on 11 June 1900, including Father Mitrofan, who was later declared a holy martyr. An Orthodox chapel used to mark the burial place of the Chinese Orthodox martyrs in Beijing. It was destroyed in 1956 at the urging of the Soviet ambassador in China. Although several Albazinian families found it reasonable to move to the Soviet Union during the Cultural Revolution, the bulk of them still reside in Beijing and Tianjin. ==Later history== Albazinian Liturgy in Beijing, by Ivan Chmutov After the first siege of Albazin in 1685, most of the Cossacks were allowed to return to Russian territory at Nerchinsk, but nearly 45 of them decided to surrender to the Manchus. Many of these had native wives or concubines who were not allowed to leave the Manchu realm. They were sent to Beijing where they joined about 70 other Russian who had previously been captured or defected. They were enrolled in the seventeenth company of the fourth regiment of the Bordered Yellow Banner and given space in the northeast corner of the Tatar City of Peking (at a different place from the O-lo-ssu Kuan). This was a 'household' rather than line unit and had non-combat duties like bow-making. Some were used as messengers to Nerchinsk. Since most were illiterate they were of little use as translators or sources of intelligence.from Patrick G. March,'Eastern Destiny:Russia in Asia and the North Pacific,1996, Chapters 5,6,12 They were given an old Buddhist prayer house which was turned into the church of Saint Nicholas. The priest was Maxim Leonov who had been captured on the Amur in 1673 along with seventy other men. The Russian government was apparently unaware of the Saint Nicholas church, since, during the Ides mission of 1692 they asked permission to build an Orthodox church in Peking. When Tulishen went to Russia in 1712 he carried a request for a new priest, Father Maxim having died a year or so before. He returned with an archimandrite and nine lesser clerics (to serve a congregation of about 50). By the time of the Izmailov mission in 1722, only one priest and three junior clerics survived. The fifth article of the Treaty of Kyakhta authorized the permanent presence of a church, a priest with three assistants and six students to learn the local language. One of these, Alexei Leontev, helped negotiate the 1768 convention of Kyakhta. == See also == *Ethnic Russians in China *Harbin Russians *Russians in Hong Kong ==NotesReferences== * Encyclopaedia of Cossackdom (USA, 1966-70) * D.

Although there are many similar species that are endemic to these tropical locations, its unique physical, habitual, and behavioral characteristics distinguish it from other members of the genus Eleutherodactylus. This genus contains around 185 species that are located in the southern United States, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, with 16 different species endemic to Puerto Rico. The red-eyed coqui was not brought into Panama City from its native habitats until the late 1960s. There it became established in urban parks before it began to colonize outside the city in the 1980s. In Puerto Rico, the largest island inhabited by the red- eyed coqui, it is found up to 1,200 meters above sea level. It is often compared to the common coqui, Puerto Rico's unofficial territorial symbol, but upon a closer ecological look, the red-eyed coqui has many differences. ==Physical characteristics== The red-eyed coqui is best physically described by its angular, broad flat head, short body, cinnamon red colored eyes, black spotted thighs, a black streak on each side of its snout, a short black line above the tympanum (external auditory membrane), and a light colored line along the center of its back. Its upper body is a pale gray to dull brown color, and it contains individual non-webbed toes and long digits. People often confuse this species for the common coqui since their niches are seemingly unique. ==Habitat== The red-eyed coqui is found in lowland or intermediate elevation forests, such as dry forest, and is abundant in open, disturbed habitats. In contrast to common coquis, the red-eyed coqui is generally found in dry habitats. It can survive a long periods without rain as long as it remains hydrated in its hidden location. In Panama, however, it is found in urban areas, residential gardens, and unoccupied land. Although it is widely dispersed, it is not as abundant as other Eleutherodactylus species. In the day it hides under grass roots, loose barks of trees, rocks, logs, and trash. On the other hand, at night it hides in low bushes and tree branches which aids in its predation tactics. ==Behavior== Red-eyed coquis are nocturnal predators. They eat insects, spiders, other arthropods, and mollusks primarily at night. From dusk until dawn males call using a ' sound with no pause between the notes, and an assumed territorial call '. After midnight, however, the calls decrease greatly. In order to attract a mate, the male red- eyed coqui makes calls from prominent perches rather than low hidden locations until it finds a female. Their reproductive cycle is also unique. Members of the genus Eleutherodactylus do not require water as part of the reproduction process, because they do not pass through a tadpole stage. The female lays an egg clutch of 24 to 42 eggs under a thin layer of damp leaf litter or soil. The eggs hatch and a fully formed miniature version of an adult develops. Adults may guard the hatchlings as they develop. ==Survival== On the IUCN Red List the red-eyed coqui is classified as of 'least concern', meaning that in the absence of any threats it is not considered to be close to extinction. This is partly due to the wide range of suitable habitats for the red-eyed coqui's range. Puerto Rico's increasing forest habitat assists in the increase of suitable habitats for the frog. It is not clear how external factors specifically threaten the species, but its predator, the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis), regulates its population. ==See also== *Fauna of Puerto Rico *List of amphibians and reptiles of Puerto Rico ==References== Category:Eleutherodactylus Category:Amphibians of the United States Virgin Islands Category:Amphibians of Puerto Rico Category:Amphibians described in 1863 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Red-eyed coqui"},{"id":"12384750","text":"The Christian Democratic Party of Russia () is a Christian Democratic political party in the Russian Federation.

Here he farmed and ran a tannery until 1860, when a widow, Lydia Rogers, bought the property; her family inhabited it until selling it in 1931. While living with her mother in the 1860s, Rogers' daughter Sarah Elizabeth Rogers kept a careful diary that made her a significance source for period social history after it was published in the journal of the Ohio Historical Society.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 88. Fitz Randolph arranged for a composite structure; the house is primarily a brick building, although elements of stone are also present. Like many other period buildings, the house is built in the Greek Revival style of architecture, but unlike most such houses, it is built into a hillside. The one-story facade is divided into five bays, with the central bay being occupied by an elaborate entrance: four columns, two on each side, form a post and lintel structure around the doorway, and a transom light is placed above the door. Stairs provide access to a stoop by the raised main entrance, and a frieze is placed immediately below the edge of the roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-13. In 1978, the Fitz Randolph–Rogers House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its important place in local history. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1840 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Greek Revival houses in Ohio Category:Houses in Butler County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Hamilton, Ohio ","title":"Fitz Randolph–Rogers House"},{"id":"12384778","text":"Yunganastes ashkapara is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to Bolivia and is known from the vicinity of its type locality in the Chapare Province (northern Cochabamba Department) and from Abra de la Cruz in the Manuel María Caballero Province (western Santa Cruz Department). The specific name ashkapara is derived from Quechuan ashka meaning \\"a lot\\" and para for \\"rain\\", and refers to the very high rainfall in the region of the type locality. ==Description== Two adult males in the type series measure in snout–vent length (females are unknown). The head is narrower than the body; the snout is rounded. The tympanum is ovoid and the membrane is barely differentiated. The supra-tympanic fold is low and not obscuring the tympanum. The canthus rostralis is sharp. Neither fingers nor toes have webbing but the toes have weakly defined lateral fringes. The outer fingers have expanded discs; the toe discs are almost as large as these. Dorsal skin is shagreened. There is a prominent pair of dorsolateral folds. The dorsum is brown and has some darker markings. There is a dark brown canthal and supra-tympanic stripe. The upper lip has irregular brown blotches. The venter is cream, bearing some brown spots and blotches. Males have a large vocal sac. The male advertisement call is a short, single note that sounds like a \\"clack\\", as if two hard wooden sticks were beaten together. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitat of Yunganastes ashkapara is tropical moist montane forest. The forest at the type locality is very rich in epiphytes. The holotype was found calling from a moss-covered branch some above the ground at above sea level, although calls were heard from up to high in the canopy. Calls of this species were also heard along the road at . The second record is based on an individual climbing a moss-covered rocky wall adjacent to a small stream at . This species is potentially threatened by habitat loss (logging).

He notably played in the Premier League for Coventry City. He played in the Football League for Swansea City, Notts County, Stoke City, Wycombe Wanderers, Hereford United, Walsall, Exeter City, Cardiff City, York City and Darlington, as well as in Non-league for Cradley Town, Kidderminster Harriers, Bath City, Redditch United, Evesham United, Weston-super-Mare, Stourbridge, Willenhall Town and Boldmere St. Michaels. ==Playing career== Williams started his footballing career at his local club Cradley Town in 1990. After impressing in the lower leagues he attracted the attention of Football League sides and joined Welsh side Swansea City in 1991. After having a decent season with Swansea he move on up to Coventry City the following season. He spent three years with the sky blues making 80 league appearances, the most he would acquire in his career. Williams' early goal against Middlesbrough on 15 August 1992 was only the second goal ever scored in the newly formed FA Premiership (the goal came in the ninth minute of the game which was approximately four minutes after Brian Deane's goal against Manchester United on the opening day of the new season). Whilst at Coventry Williams had loan spells at Notts County, Stoke City and at his old club Swansea City. He left Coventry in 1995 and joined new league side Wycombe Wanderers to start a somewhat nomadic career. After two years with the chairboys he moved on to unsuccessful spells at Hereford United and Walsall. Williams then went on to have a new club every season starting with Exeter City in the 1997–98 season. He went on to play for Cardiff City, York City, Darlington, two seasons with Swansea City his third spell at the club and his final Football League side Kidderminster Harriers. Known as the \\"flying postman\\" due to his speed and career before football, when playing for Kidderminster scored famously against Wolves in the FA Cup 3rd round only for his goal to be equalised in the final minutes.*Lowe, Simon: \\"Stoke City The Modern Era – A Complete Record\\" (Desert Island Books, ). Following the end of his professional career Williams has gone on to have a similar nomadic career in non-league football. These clubs are Bath City, Redditch United, Evesham United, Weston-super-Mare, Stourbridge, Willenhall Town and most recently Boldmere St. Michaels. This has taken his total number of clubs to 22. He joined Willenhall Town managed by Mel Eves, in September 2007. In August 2008, Williams, now aged 40 scored a hat-trick for Boldmere St Michaels against Shifnal Town. ==Personal life== John has since worked as a youth and community worker in Birmingham whilst keeping links with the game as an agent with a Sports management company. His company 'Flying Postman productions' also produces football themed evening entertainments. At the 1992 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium he claimed the £10,000 pound first prize when he won the Rumbelows Sprint Contest in a time of 11.49 seconds beating amongst others Leigh Jenkinson and Efan Ekoku.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGkiQnKkp3Q ==Career statistics== Source: {   center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Swansea City 1991–92 Third Division 39113030104611 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Coventry City 1992–93 Premier League 418102000448 - 1993–94 Premier League 323102000353 - 1994–95 Premier League 7000000070 - Notts County (loan) 1994–95 First Division 5200000052 - Stoke City (loan) 1994–95 First Division 4000000040 - Swansea City (loan) 1994–95 Second Division 7200000072 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Wycombe Wanderers 1995–96 Second Division 298102020348 - 1996–97 Second Division 191443200257 - Hereford United 1996–97 Third Division 113000000113 - Walsall 1997–98 Second Division 1000000010 - Exeter City 1997–98 Third Division 364000000364 - Cardiff City 1998–99 Third Division 43125321105116 - rowspan=\\"2\\"York City 1999–2000 Third Division 363101010393 - 2000–01 Third Division 6000100070 - Darlington 2000–01 Third Division 245000010255 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Swansea City 2001–02 Third Division 414211010455 - 2002–03 Third Division 271101000291 - Kidderminster Harriers 2003–04 Third Division 444411010505 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career Total !452!!71!!23!!9!!19!!3!!8!!0!!502!!83 } :A.

It is endemic to Venezuela and currently only known from its type locality, the north base of Pico Tamacuari, in the Sierra Tapirapecó, Amazonas state. ==Etymology== The specific name avius is Latin adjective meaning \\"out of the way\\" or \\"remote\\". It refers to the remote type locality. ==Description== The type series consists of three adult males, two adult females, and three juveniles. The males measure and the females in snout–vent length. The head is as wide or wider than the body and wider than it is long. The snout is slightly rounded to truncate or bluntly pointed in dorsal view and rounded in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct and rounded or slightly oval. The fingers and toes have broad terminal discs but no webbing. Skin on the dorsum is tubercular. Dorsal color and pattern are very variable. The ground color varies from shades of orangish brown to brown or tan to greenish brown. Some specimens had a median and two dorso-lateral stripes that are grayish brown or brown and lack a dark inter-orbital bar. One specimen had a tan vertebral line that extended through the dark inter-orbital bar to the snout. The female holotype had vague blotches that became only noted after preservation. Two specimens had one or more chevrons. Juveniles and some adults had black scapular ridges. The flanks are always obliquely banded or mottled with grayish brown or brown on pale orangish brown. Ventral surfaces have yellow or orange coloring. The male advertisement call is unknown. The female holotype (33 mm SVL) was found in amplexus with a much smaller male (20 mm SVL). Later on, the female laid 18 eggs measuring in diameter when the jelly coat is included, or with the yolk only. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitat is montane tepui forest at elevations of above sea level.

Because of the mound's height and its placement on a ridgeline, an individual at the summit can see for a great distance. In the late nineteenth century, it was theorized that mounds such as the Great Mound were built as observation or watch points, and that the builders maintained the ability to light fires atop the mounds as a method of communicating across wide distances. The potential of these mounds for long-distance communication was demonstrated in 1990 by three groups of volunteers. After climbing the Great Mound, the first group established visual contact with the Hill-Kinder Mound in Franklin (more than to the northeastDeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed.

Later years saw the destruction of a more significant part of the top; today, only about 75% of the mound is free from disturbances. Nevertheless, the mound is believed to be a significant archaeological site; its size is believed to indicate the stability of the culture that built it and the dedication of its members to commemorating those buried within it.

Pillar Hall atrium, Belsay Hall. Quarry Garden, Belsay Hall. The house was built between 1810 and 1817 for Sir Charles Monck (then of Belsay Castle close by) to his own design, possibly assisted by architect John Dobson. It is built in ashlar with a Lakeland slate roof in the Greek Doric style. The house measures square, with a lower kitchen wing attached to the north side. Externally the house appears to have two stories, although there is an additional storey hidden within the roof space to provide servant accommodation. This service side of the house was badly affected by dry rot in the 1970s and, following remedial work, it has been left as a weather-proof shell to illustrate how the house was built. The hall was the residence of the Middleton family until 1962. ==Present day== The entire Belsay Hall house is unfurnished and maintained in a condition of benign decay, with only necessary structural maintenance undertaken. This allows it to be used as a setting for bespoke art installations each summer. There are extensive gardens, formal and naturalistic, such as the linear Quarry Garden. There is wheelchair access to the Quarry Garden, the ground floor of both the Hall and the Castle, and to the café.

He was a faculty member at the University of Texas, University of Michigan, and joined University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, in 2001. == Career & Research == Vojo Deretic's main contributions to science come from studies by his team on the role of autophagy in infection and immunity.Deretic V, Saitoh T, Akira S. Autophagy in infection, inflammation and immunity\\" Nat Rev Immunol 2013 Oct;13(10):722-37.http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v13/n10/abs/nri3532.html. Autophagy, a cytoplasmic pathway for the removal of damaged or surplus organelles, has been previously implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, diabetes, development, and aging. His group is one of those that made the discovery that autophagic degradation is a major effector of innate and possibly adaptive immunity mechanisms for direct elimination of intracellular microbes (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis). This has added immunity and infection to the repertoire of autophagy's sphere of influence. The Deretic laboratory has subsequently shown that autophagy in mammalian cells plays not only a degradative role but that it also carries the task of unconventional secretion of cytoplasmic proteins, such as IL-1beta and others including HMGB1 and ferritin. This has led to the term \\"secretory autophagy\\" These proteins normally reside in the cytosol but exert their functions extracellularly. This area is still developing, which inevitably brings controversies such as gasdermin's role in IL-1 unconventional secretion via plasma membrane pores vs. secretory autophagy, and stimulates further work on a broad selection of substrates secreted, excreted or released from cells. This work, along with the work by others in yeast, extends the influence sphere of autophagy from its canonical roles inside the cell and the confines of the intracellular space to the extracellular space, affecting cell-cell interactions, inflammation, tissue organization, function, and remodeling. Dr. Deretic's laboratory has furthermore linked autophagy with a large family of innate immunity proteins playing complex roles and termed TRIMs, such as TRIM5 (implicated in HIV restriction), TRIM16 and PYRIN/TRIM20 (implicated in inflammasome regulation), and TRIM21 (implicated in Type I Interferon responses) etc. TRIMs play immune and other roles but with incompletely understood function(s), and the above cited work shows that they act as autophagic receptor-regulators in mammalian cells. Among these, TRIM16 has been proposed to play a role of the first selective secretory autophagy receptor. T A series of studies from Dr. Deretic's group shows how the human immunity related GTPase IRGM works in autophagy by demonstrating IRGM's direct interactions with the core autophagy (ATG) factors, and their assembly and activation downmstream of PRRs: NOD1, NOD2, TLRs, RIG-I and inflammasome components, enabling them to carry out antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory autophagic functions of significance in tuberculosis and Crohn's disease. A related line of studies shows that IRGM helps recruit a SNARE Syntaxin 17, which is also a target for phosphorylation and control by TBK1 and plays a role in both autophagy initiation and maturation. Both IRGM and Syntaxin 17 bind mammalain Atg8s such as MAP1LC3B (LC3s) and GABARAPs. The most recnt studies show that IRGM controls lysosomal biogenesis though binding to and controlling TFEB, the key transcriptional regulator of lysosomal genes. Moreover, mammalian Atg8s, which interact with IRGM, are upstream of lysosomal biogenesis and control both mTor and TFEB. Thus, the notion that mammalain Atg8s, such as GABARAPs and LC3s, are builders of autophagsomal membrane may need to be revisited. The mammalian Atg8s association with SNAREs has proven to be far more general than originally anticipated. It has recently been expanded to a large number of other SNAREs, with one specific subset characterized as driving lysosome biogenesis via a TGN-lysosome trafficking route. These studies have led to an unanticipated alternative model for how mammalian Atg8s work - by broadly interacting with and modulating SNAREs to redirect general intracellular membrane flow toward the organelles that converge upon the lysosomal-autolysosomal system. Moreover, recent studies show that mammalian Atg8s actually regulate lysosomal biogenesis, expanding or potentially revising their function that was originally restricted to be autophagosomal formation. The most recent studies by Dr. Deretic's group from the AIM center for autophagy, inflammation and metabolism studies, provide insight into how cells detect endomembrane damage and what systems are deployed to help repair or eliminate/replace such membranes. In a recent paper in Molecular Cell, this group has shown that a novel system termed GALTOR, based on Galectin-8, interacts with the mTOR regulatory system composed of SLC38A9, Ragulator, RagA/B, RagCD. Following lysosomal damage, GALTOR inhibits mTOR causing its dissociation from damaged lysosomes. The key to GALTOR's action are galectins, sugar-binding cytosolic proteins, which can detect glycoconjugates exposed on the lumenal (exofacial) side of the lysosomal membrane upon membrane damage, thus transducing the breach of the membrane to mTOR. The physiological consequences of mTOR inhibition following endomembrane damage are many including induction of autophagy and metabolic switching. Dr. Deretic's group has previously shown how chloroquine works by functions in respiratory epithelial cells including suppressing inflammation and drivers of fibrosis that can lead to lung damage and loss of function, and recently put that in the context of how chloroquine, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin may help with the covid19 pandemic crisis. A follow-up study indicates that ciprofloxacin has potent effects on inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells as measured by reduced cytopathic effects, quantitative RT-PCR and plaque forming units. Ambroxol is another drug that has beneficial effects in Vero E6 cells. The functional roles of galectins in cellular response to membrane damage are rapidly expanding and Dr. Deretic's group has recently shown that Galectin-3 recruits ESCRTs to damaged lysosomes so that lysosomes can be repaired. Most recent findings show that Galectin-9 responds to lysosomal damage by activating AMPK, a central regulator of metabolism and autophagy. This occurs by Galectin-9-dependent activation of the ubiquitination systems on damaged lysosomes resulting in K63-ubiqutination of TAK1, an upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates AMPK.

It was moved from west of the bridge in Pitt to its current location and later became a grocery store. It is the only early 1900s building left standing. Little evidence remains of the town other than the state signs. To the north of the railroad tracks is a lot where pulpwood is handled.

The story is a remake of 1978 Mexican telenovela Viviana. On Monday, September 14, 1998, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting Camila weekdays at 8:00pm, replacing Vivo Por Elena. The last episode was broadcast on Friday, January 15, 1999 with Nunca te olvidaré replacing it the following day. Bibi Gaytán and Eduardo Capetillo starred as protagonists, while Adamari López, Kuno Becker, Lourdes Reyes and Mariagna Prats starred as the main antagonists. Gabriela Goldsmith, Víctor Noriega and Enrique Lizalde starred as the Stellar performances. ==Plot== Camila Flores (Gaytán) lives with her grandfather in a small village. She meets Mexico City attorney, Miguel Gutierrez (Capetillo), and they quickly fall in love and are married in a civil ceremony. Their church wedding is planned to be a few weeks later, but it never takes place. Miguel abandons his new wife to marry Mónica Iturralde (López), the spoiled daughter of powerful lawyer Don Armando Iturralde (Lizalde). Racked by guilt in a loveless (and bigamous) marriage, Miguel is torn between his love for Camila and his fear of returning to the poverty that he has spent so much energy escaping. Meanwhile, Camila finds out she is pregnant and resolves to raise her child by herself and to never forgive her husband. Mónica rapidly becomes disillusioned with her marriage, and she falls in love with Julio (Kuno Becker), the son of the owners of a local beauty salon and gym. The gym is one of the main locations where the action takes place, as Camila is employed there before her pregnancy becomes noticeable. Ada (Dinorah Cavazos) is soon a good friend of Camila's, while Selene (Lourdes Reyes) sees Camila as a rival for Julio's affection. Rodrigo (Xavier Ortiz) has his advances rejected by Camila and helps Selene frame her for a theft. The Iturralde Law Firm is also central to the action, as is Don Armando's home, where his wife Ana María (Gabriela Goldsmith) fights a long-term illness. ==Cast== *Bibi Gaytán as Camila Flores *Eduardo Capetillo as Miguel Gutiérrez *Adamari López as Mónica Iturralde *Enrique Lizalde as Armando Iturralde *Gabriela Goldsmith as Ana María de Iturralde *Kuno Becker as Julio Galindo *Patricia Martínez as Rosario \\"Chayo\\" Juárez *Lourdes Reyes as Selene Olivares *Abraham Ramos as Pablo Juárez *Yuvia Charlin as Beatriz Molina *Arlette Pacheco as Iris Molina *Julio Mannino as Nacho Juárez *Rebeca Mankita as Natalia Galindo *Daniel Gaurvy as Hernán Galindo *Margarita Magaña as Laura Escobar *Raúl Magaña as Iván Almeida *Raquel Pankowsky as Gloria *Mariagna Prats as Teresa Zúñiga *Maleni Morales as Mercedes Escobar *Víctor Noriega as Dr. Robin Wicks *Vanessa Guzmán as Fabiola *Gerardo Murguía as Andrade *Polly as Julieta *Francesca Guillén as Cecilia *Diana Golden as Silvia Escalante *Enrique Becker as Artemio *Hector Cruz as Fausto *Ignacio López Tarso as Don Genaro *Martha Navarro as Digna *Evelyn Solares as Adela *Sussan Taunton as Renata *Mike Salas as Mike *Giovan D'Angelo as Lorenzo Alarcón *Dinorah Cavazos as Ada Obrera *José Luis Montemayor as Rafael Buendía *Ricardo Carrión as Lucio *Xavier Ortiz as Rodrigo Sandoval *Rafael Inclán as Luis Lavalle *Lisette Morelos as Ingrid Valverde *Ismael Larrumbe as Agent Robledo *Myrrah Saavedra as Mrs. Urquidi *Gustavo Negrete as Doctor *Luis Uribe as Nicandro *Indra Zuno as Elisa *Humberto Elizondo as Lic.

Hidley Cottage is a small Carpenter Gothic house in western Butler County, Ohio, United States. Erected in 1860, the house is important as one of the area's few houses of its style, and it has been named a historic site. The cottage sits on land first owned by Butler County pioneer Samuel Dick, who acquired the title in 1801; he bequeathed it to his son David, who constructed a combined gristmill and sawmill on the property in 1810. A complex series of property transfers resulted in Hidley's acquiring title both to the mill and to the land on which the house was built, but years apart. He arranged for the house's construction in 1860, eight years before buying full title to the mill, which was ultimately demolished in 1940.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places.

The walls are board and batten, unlike typical weatherboarding, while the gabled roof and the porch feature finely decorated bargeboards and other wooden details. Both doors and windows are placed both on the front and on the sides, with a single window appearing in the top half story. A single chimney sits at the center of the roofline. In 1980, the Hidley Cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a distinction now held by more than eighty locations countywide.

Origin and Identity of Fejervarya (Anura: Dicroglossidae) on Guam. Pacific Science 70(2):233-241. https://doi.org/10.2984/70.2.9 ==Description== The greenhouse frog is a very small species, ranging from in length. These frogs are usually drab or olive-brown in colour, and occur in two forms; one has two broad stripes running longitudinally down the back, and the other is mottled. The undersides of both are a paler colour than the back, and the eyes are red. ==Distribution and habitat== The greenhouse frog is native to Cuba and some other islands in the West Indies. It has been introduced to Hawaii and Florida, where it has become common. It has been sporadically found in southern Georgia, southern Alabama and eastern Louisiana. It is an introduced species in Jamaica , Guam and Shenzhen, China. It lives in moist leaf litter, often near human habitations, but is seldom seen because it is nocturnal. It sometimes emerges on warm, rainy days in summer, and in Florida, it has been found hibernating in March under the flaking bark of a wild tamarind (Lysiloma) tree. ==Diet== The diet of the greenhouse frog consists of small invertebrates, such as ants, beetles, mites, spiders, and roaches. ==Reproduction== The greenhouse frog is unusual in that its eggs are not laid in water or in a frothy mass as is the case in some tree frogs. Instead, the eggs are enclosed in a thick membrane and laid singly in concealed, damp locations, such as beneath a log, buried in debris, or even under a flower pot. Clutch sizes vary between three and 26 eggs in Florida. They pass through their tadpole stage while still in the egg, and emerge as fully developed juvenile frogs about long with a short tail that soon gets reabsorbed. In warm conditions, hatching may occur on the 13th day of development. The tadpoles have an \\"egg tooth\\" on the end of their snouts to help them to emerge from the egg case. Afterwards, this is no longer of use, so is shed. The adult frog may provide some parental care by guarding the eggs, as frogs have been observed lurking in the vicinity of egg clumps. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk project (HEAR), Eleutherodactylus planirostris * [http://www.hear.org/articles/pdfs/herp_review_frogs_1999v30n1.pdf Eleutherodactylus introductions to Hawaii (Kraus et al. 1999, Herpetological Review) Category:Eleutherodactylus Category:Amphibians of Cuba Category:Fauna of the Cayman Islands Category:Frogs of North America Category:Least concern biota of North America Category:Amphibians described in 1862 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Greenhouse frog"},{"id":"12385066","text":"Maximilien Charles Alphonse Cerfberr of Medelsheim (20 July 1817, Epinal--16 December 1883, Paris) was a French journalist, writer and governmental official.

The rightmost building in the block is the former location of McCrory's Variety Store; it occupied the building circa 1930, while previous occupants' names are unknown. One of Hamilton's few Neo-Renaissance buildings, it is built of brick with a stone foundation and basement, and covered with a flat roof. Stone covers much of the exterior, which is divided into five bays by its prominent arched windows. Nothing substantial remains of the original first-story exterior, which has been profoundly modified since construction in 1875. Higher stories retain a greater degree of integrity, due to components such as a metal entablature, a cornice supported by brackets. In 1983, the building was evaluated by the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation program of the Ohio Historical Society; although it was deemed to be in good condition with no substantial dangers, it was deemed ineligible for any type of federal historic site designation.Walsh, Rita, and Merrit. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: McCrory's. Ohio Historical Society, 1983-10. Nevertheless, it was included in the High Street Commercial Block when the block was named a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004; the district qualified both because of its architecture and because of its place in local history.

He often astonished friends and relatives in the mid-twentieth century by recounting how his father had been taken to visit the battlefield of Waterloo shortly after the battle (his father was born in 1803 and died in 1889). In 1897, he attended the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he founded the Student Representative Council. He graduated B.Sc. with first- class honours in late 1901 and was offered a University Fellowship. He went on to study at the Zoological Institute in Zurich, Switzerland. ==Career== Returning to Wales, Fleure became Head of the Department of Zoology at Aberystwyth in 1908.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936. Following his retirement in 1944, he was President of the Royal Anthropological Institute from 1945 to 1947. He was a founder member of the Guernsey Society, which was established in 1943 to represent the interests of the Nazi-occupied island to the British Authorities. After the war, he was a regular contributor to The Quarterly Review, as well as to The Guernsey Farmhouse, a book published by the Society in 1964 celebrating the ancient family houses in the island. He also authored biographies of several scientists including Arthur Robert Hinks, Alfred Cort Haddon, James George Frazer and Emmanuel de Margerie From 1927 through 1956 he was the co-author of the ten volumes of The Corridors of Time by Harold John Edward Peake. ==Personal life== In 1910 Fleure married Hilda Mary Bishop in King's Lynn; they had one son and one daughter.

To avoid a conflict of interest with his position as chaplain, Mercier wrote under the pen names of Louis Mercier, MA (Oxon) and Mercier Lewis. ==Chronology== Born on 9 January 1820 (christened 7 February 1820, Old Church, Saint Pancras, London, ) the only son of Francis Michael Jacob Mercier, Lewis Page Mercier came of French Huguenot stock; his grandfather was pastor of the French Protestant church in Threadneedle Street, London. As a child he almost certainly spoke a species of French at home, a possible qualification for his later translations of Verne. The family was located in the London Borough of Hackney, home of the original silk industry of French mercers (). In 1837 Mercier entered Trinity College, Oxford, where he was the College Latin Essayist. In 1839 he received an open scholarship from the University. He received a Third in \\"Greats\\" (Greek and Latin) receiving his B.A. on 25 June 1841, and obtained a post-graduate bursary at University College, Oxford, the \\"Browne Exhibition\\", established by one Browne in 1587. Forgoing an academic but at the time necessarily celibate career, he gave up his exhibition to marry Anna Marie Hovell in 1842. He became a deacon in 1843 and a presbyter in 1845. In 1855 he was awarded his M.A. degree from University College. His first posting was to Glasgow where he was Assistant Minister of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Chapel, 2nd master of the Glasgow College School, and Chaplain to the Garrison. While in Glasgow he was admitted to membership in the Glasgow Philosophical Society (15 November 1843). From Glasgow he moved on to be 2nd Master at a new school in Edgbaston, near Birmingham (1846). and headmaster (1849). In 1857 he moved back to Hackney, becoming headmaster at the St. John’s Foundation School and Assistant Reader at the Chapel of the Foundling Hospital in nearby Brunswick Square.Crockford's Clerical directory, London, 1858. See for example In 1861 we find him living at the school at age 41, head of a family of 9 children (ages 1,2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15), numerous servants and 25 pupils.U.K. Census, June 1861, available at http://www.ancestry.com/ Relieved of his position by the Governing Board in 1861, he then became Chaplain at the Chapel of the Foundling Hospital, then one of the most important charitable institutions in England. The Foundling HospitalR. H. Nicholls and F. A. Wray, The History of the Foundling Hospital, London: Oxford University Press, 1935. was the first public charity in England, established in 1739 by a Royal Charter granted by King George II and Queen Caroline. The buildings were erected on purchased by Thomas Coram, the ship captain who sponsored its establishment. Early benefactors were the painter William Hogarth and the composer George Friedrich Handel, who played at the opening and conducted his Messiah every year thereafter. Well known artists contributed paintings, and the Foundling Hospital became the first picture gallery in the country. Church services at the chapel with famous preachers, famous musicians, a professional choir and organist attracted large crowds of the most well connected people in London throughout the century. Charles Dickens who lived nearby attended regularly with a reserved pew. The buildings were torn down in 1926 to make way for a fish market, which was never built. In 1865 Lewis Mercier suddenly found it necessary to borrow £250 secured by a bond from Lord Leigh of Stoneleigh (Warwickshire), the wealthiest landowner in England, at the rate of 12% per annum. (Lord Leigh had appointed him Provincial Grand Chaplain to the Freemasons, Warwickshire in 1852.) By 1870, in ill health and unable to repay his debt when it came due, he was forced to seek extra funds by offering to perform translating tasks for the publishers Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, who were in the process of printing a religious book of his. In 1871, Sampson Low acquired the English rights to several of Jules Verne's books. For this project the firm assigned the translating duties to Mercier and chose Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas as the first volume to appear, which it did in November 1872. As a translator of Verne's newly popular fiction, Mercier offered one advantage to Sampson Low: speed. A linguist of sorts, conversant with older French dialects, possibly fluent in multiple languages, he worked in his spare time with his assistant Eleanor Elizabeth King (1838 — ??) to translate three Verne novels in little over a year, enabling Sampson Low to come out with new Verne books for the Christmas trade in 1872 and 1873. Unfortunately Mercier's shaky grasp of contemporary French idioms and limited knowledge of his era's science and technology led him into many foolish translating errors. He has also been criticized by British and American scholars for his stilted prose and for the many cuts and omitted details that blemish his translations. In view of his desperate financial situation it has been conjectured that the deletions could have been dictated by his editors at Sampson Low; however no hard evidence has been found to support this surmise. It is equally likely that he worked fast simply to get paid fast.Citations of the errors in Mercier's translations, and further surmises as to how they might have occurred, may be found in Norman Wolcott's , found in Mobilis in Mobile - The Newsletter of the North American Jules Verne Society, Vol. 12, No. 2, December 2005, and in expanded form in a publication of the same title, published by Choptank Press, St. Michaels, MD, 2007.

The pamphlet entitled The actual condition of the British Museum, a literary expostulation was sold on Russell Street in front of the building by a sandwich man. Some of the Museum officials furnished information for the compilation of the pamphlet. Mercier apparently read this pamphlet and published his rebuttal The British Museum. An impartial statement, in answer to a pamphlet by Stephan Poles under the pseudonym \\"M.A.\\" (i.e. Master of Arts). Both of these pamphlets are available in British depositary libraries. Stefan Poles died on 22 November 1875 only a few weeks after the death of Mercier. ==Other works== Mercier also translated The Wreck of the Hansa (The German Arctic expedition of 1869-70), as well as publishing several religious works and instructional materials for teachers of Greek and Latin listed below: * A Manual of Greek Prosody.

Slate Aircraft Corporation City of Glendale Negatives, Accession number 2006-0039 ==History== Early designs Francesco Lana de Terzi's airship c.1670 One of the earliest proposals for a flying machine based on rational principles was Francesco Lana de Terzi's design for a vacuum airship, c.1670. He had measured the pressure of air at sea level and based on this he proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. His proposed methods of controlling height are still widely used; carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and venting the lifting containers to lose height. In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases. The concept of a metal-clad dirigible airships was again explored in the late 1800s by Russian rocket theorist Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky.Von A. Kosmodemyansky, X. Danko. 2000. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky His Life and Work The Minerva Group, Inc., . He wrote that since his teens (in the early 1870s) \\"the idea of the all-metal aerostat has never left my mind\\"Kosmodemyansky 2000 pages 18-19 \\"In 1885, at the age of 28, I decided to devote my energies to aeronautics and elaborate the theory of the all-metal dirigible.\\" and by 1891 he had produced detailed designs of a variable volume corrugated metal envelope airship that did not need ballonets. These were submitted to an Imperial department for aeronautics, which convened a conference to consider it. In 1891 they declined his request for a grant to produce a model, considering the idea \\"cannot have any considerable practical importance\\".Kosmodemyansky 2000 page 23 In 1892 he published his designs as Aerostat Metallitscheski (the all-metal dirgible aerostat).Carl Zeiss AG. 2005. The Route to the Stars, page 29Kosmodemyansky 2000 pages 19-21, page 19 details pulleys for contracting the envelope, page 21 shows a larger versionAnatoly Zak. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky At around the same time, in 1892 the Russian Imperial war ministry agreed to let Schwarz build his metal airship in St Petersburg, though at his own expense.Dooley A.183 Schwarz Schwarz's first aluminum ship of 1893 collapsed on inflation. His second airship flew at Tempelhof, Berlin in 1897, landed but then collapsed. Aircraft Development Corporation In 1926 the Aircraft Development Corporation announced in Detroit, USA, that they were planning to construct a prototype.  Slate All-Metal Airship  The 1929 Slate All-Metal Airship, built in Glendale, California, had a hull constructed from corrugated aluminum panels, along with a revolutionary propulsions system consisting of a \\"blower\\" at the nose of the airship which would propel the vehicle forward by creating a partial vacuum ahead of the vessel. The centrifugal propulsion was later replaced by a conventional engine and propeller mounted on the tail end of the airship's gondola. The rolled seams intended to hold the panels together subsequently unrolled owing to gas pressure created by superheating during an attempted launch of the airship.  ZMC-2  The U.S. Navy's ZMC-2 was one of the few airships to be constructed in the late 1920s. Like the Schwarz airship of the 1890s, the ZMC-2 had a system of framework integrated with stressed-skin construction that presaged both the pressurized fuselage construction used decades later in commercial airliners, and even elements of American lunar rockets, such as the Saturn V launch vehicle. The ZMC-2 was successful both in performance and longevity. Its manufacture required the development of a riveting machine and final assembly that are comparable to later rockets and transport aircraft fuselages, while being capable of dealing with aluminum skin thicknesses thin enough to allow aerostatic lift. The final assembly of the single closing seam of the two hull-halves took over two months. Filling the rigid shell was similarly problematic, requiring an expensive and time-consuming process of filling it first with carbon dioxide, then with helium, and finally purifying the helium by scrubbing residual carbon dioxide from the helium. In addition, the hull had to be strengthened to sustain the weight of the carbon dioxide during the filling process.  LZ-132  In the early 1950s, Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin GmbH commissioned a design study to explore the construction of the LZ-132. The project was abandoned.  American Skyship Industries  Between 1982 and 1995, American Skyship Industries, a subsidiary of Wren Skyships Ltd. of the Isle of Man in Great Britain and itself a spinoff from Airship Industries, promoted its metal-clad airship projects in the USA, receiving substantial state loans but never delivering a product. Varialift Airships An aerostatic design from the company Varialift Airships PLC in the UK has designed an aluminium monocoque outer structure and internal skeleton, together with a patented buoyancy mechanism that it claims can allow it to operate at high altitudes and therefore fly faster than current designs, at lower fuel consumption levels than hybrids since no energy is needed to generate lift, only to power the craft forward. ==NotesReferences== * Dooley, Sean C., The Development of Material-Adapted Structural Form - Part II: Appendices.

Luisa Carlotta wished for her niece Isabella to become heiress to the Spanish throne instead of her uncle Carlos, and therefore supported the new succession law issued by the king. She was involved in an incident during the sickness of the Spanish monarch regarding this issue: when the Spanish king lay sick expecting death (1832), Luisa Carlotta tried to acquire a document forbidding female succession from prime minister Tadeo Calomarde by force and throw it on the fire. When Calomarde tried to save the document, she struck him in the face, upon which he uttered the well known words: \\"Madame, white hands don't offend!\\" When her niece became queen in 1833 with her sister as regent, the rivalry between the sisters worsened and she left Spain for Paris.

These emissions are 0.5787 (± 0.0009) and 0.6531 (± 0.0002) MeV for beta minus and positron respectively and 1.34577 (± 0.00016) MeV for gamma. The main oxidation states of copper are I and II since Cu3+ is too powerful to exist in biochemical systems. Furthermore, copper(I) exists as a strong complex in aqueous solution and is not often seen. Copper(II) forms mononuclear complexes that are paramagnetic and prefers ligands of sulfur and nitrogen. Copper is essential in the human body as both a catalyst and as part of enzymes. Copper is mainly involved in redox reactions throughout the body, but also plays a role in iron transportation in blood plasma. ==Production== Copper-64 can be technically reproduced by several different reactions with the most common methods using either a reactor or an accelerator. Thermal neutrons can produce 64Cu in low specific activity (the number of decays per second per amount of substance) and low yield through the 63Cu(n,γ)64Cu reaction. At the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURR) 64Cu was produced using high-energy neutrons via the 64Zn(n,p)64Cu reaction in high specific activity but low yield. Using a biomedical cyclotron the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu nuclear reaction can produce large quantities of the nuclide with high specific activity. ==Applications== Wilson’s disease Wilson's disease is a rare condition in which copper is retained excessively in the body. Toxic levels of copper can lead to organ failure and premature death. 64Cu is used to study whole body retention of copper in subjects with this disease. The technique can also separate heterozygous carriers and homozygous normals. Assessment of renal perfusion with Cu-ETS Ethylglyoxal bis (thiosemicarbazone) has potential utility as a PET radiopharmaceutical with the various isotopes of copper. 64Cu-ETS has been used for experimental preclinical myocardial, cerebral and tumor perfusion evaluations, with a linear relationship between the renal uptake and blood flow. Renal perfusion can also be evaluated with CT or MRI instead of PET, but with drawbacks: CT requires administration of potentially toxic contrast agents, and if repeated scans are required, CT will expose the patient to even more ionizing radiation. MRI avoids this radiation but is difficult to implement, and often suffers from motion artifacts. Thus, PET scans utilizing copper isotopes offer quantitative measurements and are suitable for use in regional renal perfusion assessments. Bifunctional chelates as copper carriers Dissociation of copper from bifunctional chelates The in vivo metabolism of bifunctional chelates is important for optimal targeting of specific organs or tumors. 64Cu TETA-Octreotide is a chelate that has been shown to bind to the somatostatin receptor. This in turn inhibited the growth of somatostatin-receptor positive tumors in rats. This compound however showed activity in blood, liver and bone marrow. Whether the chelate dissociated and resulted in 64Cu binding to the protein superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat liver was investigated by utilizing a gel electrophoresis assay for the detection of SOD. It was shown that 64Cu did in fact dissociate from the TETA chelator and bound to SOD, and to a lesser extent, other proteins. This is caused either because chelate-biomolecules are not thermodynamically stable or are not kinetically stable. Kinetic stability is more central in the determination of in vivo stability than thermodynamic stability however. To prevent this unwanted dissociation, molecules of higher stability are needed. Investigating methanephosphonate tetraaza macrocyclic ligands Three different compounds of tetraazacyclododecane ligands with methanephosphonate functional groups were synthesized and tested for their in vivo stability. These were all labeled with 64Cu and then studied for their biodistribution in rat organs (liver, kidney, blood and bone). 64Cu-DO2P demonstrated the most efficient clearance through the blood, liver and kidney of all the ligands tested and had similar uptake and clearance in those organs as did Cu-TETA. The 64Cu-DO2P ligand had the highest in vivo stability and thus makes it a strong candidate for copper radiopharmaceuticals. Investigating cross- bridged tetraaza ligands To better understand the in vivo stability of peptide conjugated CB-TE2A and Cu-TETA, cross-bridged monoamides were synthesized and tested for their biodistribution. CB-TEAMA, CB-MeTEAMA and CB- PhTEAMA were all produced. Retention in nontarget tissues such as the liver make full characterization of the peptide difficult, so molecules which clear those organs are necessary. The results showed that CB-TE2A did in fact have good biodistribution and in vivo stability as well as all cross-bridged complexes. Thus, this is evidence in favor of CB-TE2A as a bifunctional chelator without additional modification. Cancer detection with bombesin analogs The Bombesin peptide has been shown to be overexpressed in BB2 receptors in prostate cancer. CB-TE2A a stable chelation system for 64Cu was incorporated with Bombesin analogs for in vitro and in vivo studies of prostate cancer. PET/CT imagining studies showed that it underwent uptake into prostate tumor xenografts selectively with decreased uptake into non target tissues. Other studies have shown that by targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor pancreatic and breast cancer can be detected with PET imagining. Cancer therapy 64Cu-ATSM – copper(II) (diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)) – is being studied as a possible cancer therapy. 64Cu-ATSM (diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)) has been shown to increase the survival time of tumor-bearing animals with no acute toxicity. Areas of low oxygen retention have been shown to be resistant to radiotherapy because hypoxia reduces the lethal effects of ionizing radiation. 64Cu was believed to kill these cells because of its unique decay properties. In this experiment, animal models having colorectal tumors with and without induced hypoxia were administered Cu-ATSM. Cu-ATSM is preferentially taken up by hypoxic cells over normoxic cells. The results demonstrated that this compound increased survival of the tumor bearing hamsters compared with controls. In the control groups, death due to tumor burden occurred within 20 days weeks while animals with a dose greater than 6 mCi of the radioisotope tumor growth was inhibited and survival increased to 135 days in 50% of animals. The results also suggested that multiple doses and a single dose of 10 mCi were equally effective while the multiple dose regimen is safer for non-target tissue. Radiotherapy of cancer cells using 64Cu can be applied in medical research and clinical practice. The advantages of radiotherapy with beta emitters of this energy are that there is enough to do substantial damage to the target cells but the mean range in tissue is less than a millimeter so non target tissues are unlikely to be harmed. In addition, 64Cu is a positron emitter making it a viable PET imaging radionuclide which can give real time images of the physiological processes in the system. These abilities in conjunction enable accurate monitoring of drug distribution and biokinetics simultaneously. Radiotherapeutic efficacy of copper-64 depends highly upon the radioligand delivery to the target cells, so the development of bifunctional chelates is central to development of 64Cu's potential as a radiopharmaceutical. ==See also== *Nuclear medicine *Radioactive tracer *Radionuclide *Radiopharmacology ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Loveland, Walter, David J.

The fingers and toes are long; the fingers are unwebbed whereas the toes have some webbing. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis delicatus is an arboreal frog inhabiting cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. It has been found in bromeliads as well as among leaves on the forest floor. Eggs have been found at the base of the outside leaves of bromeliads growing on the ground. Development is direct: eggs hatch directly as froglets. Population trends of this rare and little-known species are unknown but habitat destruction and degradation are threats to it. Its range includes the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park. ==References== delicatus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Taxa named by Alexander Grant Ruthven Category:Amphibians described in 1917 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis delicatus"},{"id":"12385271","text":"Pristimantis delius is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The church is no longer in existence today. The only remaining part of St. Peter's is its by () cemetery. In its place today stands the Shrine of the Sorrowful Mother, built with funds from the Fisher family of the Fisher Body coachbuilder fame. ==Catholics in Norwalk== St. Peter's was the first Roman Catholic church built in Norwalk. Prior to its construction, the people of Norwalk attended mass at St. Alphonsus, established about 1828, in neighboring Peru.See the St. Alphonsus website. Construction of the church building began in 1840. The church was enlarged in 1842, and finally completed in 1844. There were mainly two different ethnic groups of Catholics in Norwalk prior to the building of St. Mary Mother of the Redeemer Catholic Church and St. Paul Roman Catholic church: the Irish Catholics and the German Catholics. Shortly before the first railroad was built through Norwalk, which was in the early 1850s, there was a large influx of Irish people into Norwalk. They came to work on the railroad. Most of the newcomers settled in the northwest section of town, and attended Mass at St. Peter's. Separate services were held in English and German for the two nationalities attending the church. The English-speaking Catholics wished to have a parish of their own, and so on October 12, 1853 a tract of land was bought on Milan Avenue at what is now the corner of St. Mary's Street and Milan Avenue. As a result, the German Catholics remained at St. Peter's until the congregation grew to such an extent that they could no longer use the church. In the late 1890s they built a new church under the patronage of St. Paul the Apostle. Some Germans remained at St. Peter's. In 1868, these church members built a new St. Peter's on Hester Street, known as the Hester Street Church. This church no longer exists. ==NotesReferences== * Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo Category:Churches in Huron County, Ohio Category:Cemeteries in Huron County, Ohio Category:Norwalk, Ohio ","title":"St. Peter Catholic Church (Norwalk, Ohio)"},{"id":"12385288","text":"Pristimantis diaphonus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

West of the Chattahoochee remained Cherokee territory. Shortly thereafter the land was divided into square land lots of 202½ acres each. In 1833 Ivy, from the Abbeville district of South Carolina, purchased Land Lot 51 of the 14th district of what was then Dekalb County from James Paden for the sum of $225. Ivy built a double log cabin near where the Marriott Marquis hotel now stands at the corner of Courtland and Ellis Street presumably shortly after he acquired the land. At that time DeKalb County included all of what is now Fulton County in which most of Atlanta City limits currently resides and the lot itself is now bounded by Edgewood on the south, Park Pl. and Peachtree on the west, a line south of Ralph McGill on the north and old Fort St. on the east. His land lot was on the northeastern edge of the heart of the original downtown Atlanta. It is presumed that Mr. Paden had not occupied the land previous to selling it to Mr. Ivy. At the time Ivy could not have known that his new real estate acquisition was destined to become the center of a major city. As the driving force behind the growth of the town that eventually became Atlanta was its location as the terminus point of the Western and Atlantic Railroad which was chartered by the State Legislature of Georgia on December 21, 1836. Surveying for the railroad was begun in 1837 and by 1838 the now famous 'zero mile post' marking its termination was placed in Land Lot 78 - just west of Ivy's holdings. ==Death== He was thrown from his horse and killed during the winter of 1841–1842. His estate was valued at $714.67. Ivy Street which is in the immediate vicinity of his cabin was named in his honor and remained so named until late in the 20th century when Ivy Street was renamed Peachtree Center Avenue to honor the newly developed mixed use building complex designed by John Portman. Hardy Ivy Park () in Downtown Atlanta also commemorates Ivy. ==Other early settlers== Even though Ivy and his wife (Sarah Todd Ivy 1782–1886) were the first settlers within the area which was to become downtown Atlanta there were earlier settlers in the immediate vicinity, most notably Sarah Todd Ivy's brother and his wife - Richard Copeland Todd and Martha Todd. The Todd family had settled nearby in 1823, ten years before Hardy Ivy purchased his land. But their landlot was just outside the original Atlanta city limits when the city was incorporated by charter on December 29, 1847. The Todd's land lot (17 of the 14th district, also 202½ acres) encompassed much of what is now known as the neighborhood of Virginia-Highland and is well within the present city limits of Atlanta. One of the oldest known roads in Atlanta 'Todd Road' is clearly indicated on many civil war maps and its route is a direct connection between the Ivy Homestead and the Todd's. A small portion of 'Todd Road' still exists in Virginia Highland. ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * Descendants of Hardy Ivy * Hardy Ivy Cabin Category:1779 births Category:1842 deaths Category:History of Atlanta Category:Pioneers of Atlanta ","title":"Hardy Ivy"},{"id":"12385339","text":"Pristimantis dorsopictus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It is named for \\"Eileen\\", but it is unknown who the person in question actually was. ==Description== Eleutherodactylus eileenae grow to in snout–vent length. The head is wider than the body. The finger and toe tips bear discs. The dorsum bears granules and tubercles, usually including two prominent suprascapular tubercles. The eyelids have prominent granules. The ventrum is granulated. Dorsal color is changeable: light brown, reddish brown, yellowish or dark brown. There are several dorsal patterns: suprascapular \\"W\\", two bands like inverted parentheses [\\")(\\"], large reddish area in the anterior half of the body, flanks darker than the back, and a white or yellow middorsal stripe. Most specimens have a dark inter-orbital bar. The supratympanic fold is highlighted with black. The ventrum is white, but sometimes the throat is slightly brown with a clear medial line. Males have a vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Eleutherodactylus eileenae occur in various types of closed-canopy mesic forests at elevations below . They hide during the daytime in leaf litter, cracks, and holes, and become active by night. They are largely terrestrial, but calling males take perches on rocks and vegetation, typically above the ground, occasionally much higher. However, males guarding egg clutches may call from the ground. The eggs have direct development (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage). Eleutherodactylus eileenae is a common and widespread species. Nevertheless, agricultural development, pollution, and infrastructure development for human settlement and tourism are threats to it. It is present in several protected areas. ==References== eileenae Category:Amphibians of Cuba Category:Endemic fauna of Cuba Category:Amphibians described in 1926 Category:Taxa named by Emmett Reid Dunn Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Eleutherodactylus eileenae"},{"id":"12385369","text":"Niceforonia elassodiscus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae found in Colombia and Ecuador.

It was purchased for Beekeeper L. L.

New oak floors and modern plumbing and heating have been installed. The wooden floors of the basement have been replaced by concrete, and the fireplace is closed; fortunately, the outer walls of the house have gone unaffected. The façade is unique with brick pilasters that support the pediment, creating a dug in panel frame. Each corner of the house is emphasized by brick while the side walls have the same paneled effect as the front, and the side panels are divided through the center through a third pilaster. This unique architectural feature is both aesthetic and economical and is rare sight in the town of Oxford. Over the door is a semi-elliptical fanlight. Rooms inside the cottage are fairly plain, but still exude a comfortable atmosphere. Originally, there were four fireplaces in the house but all remain closed today. Around the house, Langstroth planted apple and American Linden trees to help acquire his bees. Langstroth also planted a formal garden, almost an acre long to help bring in bees.Smith, Ophia. \\"Langstroth, the \\"Bee Man\\" of Oxford.\\" Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 1998: 147–164. Ohio History. Web. 31 Oct. 2011. ==History== The cottage has been used for many functions, ranging from an academic building to a faculty residence. Langstroth Cottage was used for many programs of Miami University, including the Miami University International Office and the Miami University Luxembourg Program Office. Currently, the cottage is temporarily used for office and operations space for the Butler County Regional Transit Authority's Miami University public transit operation. ==Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth== Lorenzo Langstroth grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was the second oldest of eight children. He also attended Yale College, where he found religion, and eventually entered the Yale Divinity School to study for the ministry, where he eventually became Oxford's Presbyterian minister. After finding his love of bees, he married Anne Tucker and they started a family. Unfortunately, Langstroth developed a nervous disorder, which eventually led him to sell his bees. Upon returning to Massachusetts to work on his health, Langstroth started writing his manual Langstroth on the Honeybee. Langstroth was said to have been seasonally depressed and would go months without speaking. His depression only worsened after his wife died which then he would only show love and emotion towards his honeybees. In the last years of his life, he lived with his daughter and her family in Dayton, Ohio. While attending church, Langstroth started preaching and as he said \\"I wish to talk to you this morning about the love of God,\\" he collapsed and died; Langstroth is buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Dayton, Ohio with his gravestone marking \\"The Father of American Beekeeping\\". Sonnet – To Langstroth (Inventor of the Moveable Frame which permitted Beekeepers to rob the hive without sulphuring the bees to death) Since hives in Greece were set on slopes of thyme To win sweet gold for Heroes' cups of mead The gods themselves have shown no kinder deed To Insect or to Man than that of thine! Certain it is no honeyed words of mine Can do thee justice, Langstroth, so I plead For Jove's Hymettus Bees of sacred breed To weave in Attic chorus round thy shrine. Next, Saturn's son, dispatch their golden kin Whom Virgil lauded in Georgic lay! Wontan and Thor send Germans black as sin! Sweet Aphrodite Bees from Paphos Bay! And Ra from perfumed bean-fields by Nile's brim Those scarab Bees that nest in pipes of clay —From Poems of a Bee-Keeper, Everard Stokes. Beekeeping Lorenzo Langstroth, known as the \\"Father of Beekeeping,\\" had a unique way of capturing the essence of his bees through writing letters; these letters revealed his devoted connection to bees. Through his interpretations of bees, he studied the behavior and the equipment used to house them. After discovering many unanswered questions with the current equipment, Langstroth knew he could provide a solution. Langstroth originally was trying to improve the Bevan bar hive because he found that the combs could not be removed and this gave him a huge advantage to create a better hive. Langstroth discovered that the bees kept filling holes necessary to take the hive out with propolis, bee glue, so he came up with a new solution. On his journey to create the perfect frame, Lorenzo found it helpful to write a manual of his findings. His book, Langstroth on the Hive and the Honeybee: A Beekeeper's Manual, became a fundamental teaching mechanism for students of beekeeping. His book is considered a basic text on the skill of beekeeping because it is more of a \\"how to\\" explanation of beekeeping. The book states information related to bees, honey, and beekeeping. Langstroth sees beekeeping \\"in the present state of public opinion, it requires no little courage to venture upon the introduction of a new hive and system of management; but I feel confident that a new era in bee-keeping has arrived.\\" Langstroth viewed bees as holy creatures: \\"Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in 'bees,' and 'God' in every thing\\".Langstroth, Lorenzo. \\"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honeybee.\\" 23 ed. Hamilton, IL: The American Bee Journal, 1927. Print. With Langstroth's love of bees inevitably came his invention of the moveable bee-frame. The moveable beehives solved the problem by providing a space between the frames and the hive walls, bottom, and top cover. The moveable-frame beehive was patented in 1852, No 9300. This invention of the beehive marks the new era of the beehive. Three advantages Langstroth states of the moveable frame are: 1. \\"The scientific beekeeper could examine every comb quickly and easily. The Langstroth hive would be cheap, and the combs could be removed with safety to the bees.\\" 2. \\"The practical beekeeper, who wished an income from his bees, could propagate queens, make artificial swarms, supply destitute hives with honey or brood, and produce honey ready for the market in boxes or in glass tumblers, and he could protect his hives against the bee moth. In short, he could do almost anything he wanted to do with his bees.\\" 3. \\"The farmer could easily procure honey for his own use\\". Front of the cottage in 2011 Italian beekeeping In 1859, Langstroth arranged to start importing Italian Bees from Jan Dzeirzon of Silesia. Langstroth and his son became successful at breeding Italian queen Bees, ultimately selling them at twenty dollars. The term twenty-dollar queens soon became known in America. Using the Italian queens to his advantage, Langstroth bred the foreign bees with the local bees, causing changes in bee color, characteristic, and honey production. All of Langstroth's bees became more obedient and hard-working, producing more honey. Beekeeping today Since Langstroth's invention of the moveable beehive, the Oxford Community celebrates beekeeping through programs and events. One of the most famous local Ohio gatherings took place in 1969 for the summer meeting of the Ohio State Beekeepers' Association Inc. The two-day program featured outstanding lectures, apiary demonstrations, and films for those interested in beekeeping.\\"Beekeepers To Meet At Miami.\\" Oxford Press 24 July 1969: 1. Print. In addition to these activities, participant contests, a benefit auction for the Ohio Honey Bee Queen Program, Karl Maslowski nature films and tours of the Miami University campus were held. In the Spring of 2017, a group of students founded the Miami Apiculture Society. It's the first student organization on campus to continue Langstroth's tradition of beekeeping in Oxford. ==Landmark designation== The Cottage was the second Miami University building to be designated a National Historic Landmark. In order to receive this designation, the building had to go through a three-step process: first includes a preliminary study with an on-site visit and preparation of a recommendation by a staff member of the program; next, an evaluation by the Consulting Committee on National Historic Landmarks; and finally, a submission of nominations approved by the Committee for Designation by the Secretary of the Interior. Since the cottage is a National Landmark, it is eligible for consideration of federal grants-in-aid for historic preservation. The Historical Marker about Langstroth Cottage reads: 'Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, renowned as \\"The Father of American Beekeeping\\" lived in this simple two-story, eight-room house with his wife, Anne, and their three children from 1858 to 1887. Unchanged externally, the Greek Revival cottage features classic brick pilasters and pediments and a fan-shaped front window. In his garden workshop, Langstroth made experimental hives, established an apiary, and on the ten acres which surrounded his home grew buckwheat, clover, an apple orchard, and a \\"honey garden\\" of flowers. From his hives, he shipped Italian queen bees across the United States and around the world. The Langstroth Cottage was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982.'Curry, Crossan Hays. \\"Suggested Marker Text.\\" National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form.

The house was expanded at an unknown time by the addition of a small rear wing as well as a small bracketed roof over the side entrance. In 1976, the Maltby House was recorded by the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation program of the Ohio Historical Society. At that time, it was deemed eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places, and the surrounding neighborhood was considered a likely candidate for National Register historic district designation.

Cincinnati: Clarke, 1879, 221. In November 1868, the mound was quarried for gravel by local residents; this excavation continued until the miners had reached the center of the mound, where they found multiple limestone burial vaults. These vaults were built as squares, on each side; each contained a skeleton that had presumably been placed in a seated position. The vaults were stacked from the mound's floor to a position just underneath its summit; each was separated from others by a small amount of gravel. Eight skeletons were removed from these vaults and sent to the Smithsonian Institution. Findings from the mound have led to the conclusion that it is a work of the Adena culture. Despite the damage done by the amateur excavation, the Mann Mound is still a significant archaeological site and the second largest extant mound in Butler County. It was recorded by an archaeological survey published by J.P.

They are set on a planet named World of Tides that is hit by large fragments of a comet with dramatic consequences: The coasts are hit by gigantic tsunamis, earthquakes alter the landscape, a global climate change ensues - and mysterious magic awakes, that lets monsters appear and dreams become reality. A distinct feature of the Gezeitenwelt is its attempted realism in a fantastic context, which is based on research by the authors with the help of geophysicists, archaeologists, anthropologists and biologists. The series was planned in three groups of four books. After the release of the introductory group, the publisher Piper Verlag offered only to finish the series with one instead of eight more books, which the authors refused. The series rests at the moment (2007). == Authors == The novels are written by four authors sharing the pseudonym Magus Magellan. Magus stands for the magic in the World of Tides, while Magellan represents the element of discovery. The authors are: * Bernhard Hennen * Hadmar von Wieser * Thomas Finn * Karl-Heinz Witzko These authors have among other works contributed intensively to the role-playing game The Dark Eye. == Books == The Gezeitenwelt series was planned to cover a fictitious period of about 50 years divided into three groups. Only the first group has been realized (2007). * Prelude ** Das Geheimnis der Gezeitenwelt (The Secret of the World of Tides)(10/2004) (SC) * 1st group ** Der Wahrträumer (The True-Dreamer) by Bernhard Hennen (10/2002) (HC) / (SC) ** Himmlisches Feuer (Heavenly Fire) by Hadmar von Wieser (03/2003) (HC) / (SC) ** Das Weltennetz (The Worlds' Net) by Thomas Finn (09/2003) (HC) / (SC) ** Die Purpurinseln (The Crimson Islands) by Thomas Finn (04/2004) (HC) / (SC) ** Das Traumbeben (The Dreamquake) by Karl-Heinz Witzko (10/2004) (HC) / (SC) Each book of the 1st group is a self-contained description about the events directly before to some years after the cosmic hit in different parts of the world (only book three and four by Thomas Finn belong together), with some reappearing events and minor characters. The novels won the Deutscher Rollenspiele Preis (German role-playing prize) for best novel in 2003 and 2004. == Illustrations == The maps of the world were designed by Franz Vohwinkel, who became known for his illustrations of games like Settlers of Catan and Magic: The Gathering.

McGuffey House is a historic house museum at 401 East Spring Street, on the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, United States. Built in 1833, it was the home of author and professor William Holmes McGuffey (1800-1873) from then until 1836. It is believed to be the site where he wrote the first four of the McGuffey Readers, widely popular instructional texts used to educate generations of Americans. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. It is now operated by Miami University as the William Holmes McGuffey Museum. ==Description and history== The William H. McGuffey House is located southeast of uptown Oxford, at the southeast corner of East Spring and South Oak Streets. It is a two-story brick structure with a gabled roof, and a two-story wood-frame ell extending behind it. The main roof line has a bracketed cornice in the front, and the side gables are adorned with Gothic style drip moulding. A single-story porch extends across the front, with a flat roof supported by four Tuscan columns, and a spindled balustrade. The main facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the left bay, topped by a transom window. The interior has a restored 19th-century appearance, and includes artifacts generally of that period, as well as items specific to the ownership of William H. McGuffey. The house was built in 1833 for William H. McGuffey, then a professor at Miami University. McGuffey had an abiding interest in public education, and it is here that he began to produce and publish the McGuffey Readers, a series of graded instructional texts. These were hugely popular, selling millions of copies nationwide, and were used by schools as instructional texts into the 20th century. McGuffey only lived here until 1836, when he moved to Athens. The house then went through a succession of owners, before it was acquired by the university and restored as a historic house museum. == See also == *William H.

Is sometimes known as the Grenada frog. It was originally described as a subspecies of Eleutherodactylus urichi (=Pristimantis urichi), but since 1994 it has been recognized as a full species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. Males have a subgular vocal sac. Pristimantis euphronides has a dark brown dorsal surface, and a cream-colored ventral surface, with orange tinting on the rear of its thighs. Its lips are mottled, and its upper iris is bronze. A dark supra-tympanic stripe runs from the corner of its eye to its armpit. Males call around dusk, usually from high perches. Females are usually seen near the ground. ==Distribution and habitat== Distribution of Pristimantis euphronides is limited to central and southeast Grenada at elevations between above sea level. Its natural habitats are rainforests as well as forest edges and montane meadows surrounded by agriculture. The eggs are deposited on the ground and have direct development (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage). Pristimantis euphronides is moderately common in suitable habitat, but its range is small. Moreover, it is threatened by habitat loss primarily caused by urbanization and tourism development, but also by agriculture. The invasive Eleutherodactylus johnstonei represents a potential threat.

Depending on the circumstances, this is referred to as pareidolia, the perception or recognition of a specific pattern or form in something essentially different. It is thus also a kind of optical illusion. When an artist notices that two different things have a similar appearance, and draws or paints a picture making this similarity evident he/she makes images with double meanings. Many of these images are hidden faces or hidden skulls. These illusionistic pictures present the viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: head or landscape, head or objects, head or architecture, etc. Both of them are valid, but the viewer sees only one of them and very often he/she cannot see both interpretations simultaneously. \\"The Organ Player\\" - Pareidolia phenomenon in Neptune's Grotto, Sardinia ==Chance images== There are everyday examples of hidden faces, they are \\"chance images\\" including faces in the clouds, figures of the Rorschach Test and the Man in the Moon. Leonardo da Vinci wrote about them in his notebook: \\"If you look at walls that are stained or made of different kinds of stones you can think you see in them certain picturesque views of mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, broad valleys, and hills of different shapes. You can also find in them battles and rapidly moving figures, strange faces and costumes, as well as an infinite number of things.\\" Francois and Jean Robert collected and published a lot of photos of \\"chance faces\\". ==Hidden faces created by artists== The Mannerist master at the 16th-century imperial Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, Giuseppe Arcimboldo of Milan was probably the best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces. He arranged flowers, vegetables, fruits, shells, scallops and other animals, books and different things on the canvas in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a portrait. His series of The Four Seasons seems to be the first use of this approach and technique. Arcimboldo's composite heads were celebrated and imitated by his contemporaries but they were relatively forgotten until participants in the twentieth-century art movements rediscovered them, bringing them to the attention of art historians. He is considered as forerunner of Dada and Surrealism. Some other famous Renaissance and Baroque artists created hidden faces: *Leonardo da Vinci *Albrecht Dürer *Tobias Stimmer *Hans Holbein the Younger *Matthäus Merian *Anna Maria Sibylla Merian *Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder *Wenzel Hollar *Josse de Momper Salvador Dalí was fascinated by the technique of Arcimboldo and his paranoia-critical method was influenced by the Mannerist painter. For Dalí the Arcimboldo effect was a form of self concealment as well as this exhibitionist painter seemed, all throughout his life of constant posturing, to hide his real self behind the gaudy externals of his behaviour. Larvatus prodeo, \\"I wear a mask,\\" he could have said with Descartes and he used this quotation from the French philosopher for the epigraph of his novel Hidden Faces. Probably his most famous \\"hidden face\\" is Voltaire in his oil painting: \\"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\\". Other Surrealist painters rediscovered the technique of hidden faces in the first part of 20th century: *Max Ernst *René Magritte Istvan Orosz tries to combine the technique of anamorphosis with the hidden faces. Anamorphosis is used for those works of art that were made as distorted and unrecognizable through clever geometrical constructions. But when viewed from a certain point, or through a reflecting object placed upon it, the hidden image appears in its true shape, that is, it goes through retransformation. Orosz made experiments with anamorphoses not only in resurrecting the old technique but to improve and develop it. Instead of having a meaningless distorted image, his intent is to bring sense to the basic anamorphic picture, giving it meaning in itself with its second reading being revealed by viewing it from a different viewpoint such as looking at it through a special mirror. The ambiguous layers coming up by this approach make use of the connection or contrast of the two images within the same picture being independent from each other. There are many other contemporary works using hidden faces: *Shigeo Fukuda *Octavio Ocampo *Sandro del Prete Vertumnus årstidernas gud målad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiffGiuseppe Arcimboldo: Vertumnus, a portrait of Rudolf II (1590 -1591) Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Reversible Head with Basket of Fruit, c. 1590, oil on panel.jpgReversible Head with Basket of Fruit, oil on panel painting by Giuseppe Arcimboldo Bibliotekarien konserverad - Skoklosters slott - 97136.tifGiuseppe Arcimboldo: The Librarian Stimmer.jpgTobias Stimmer: Hidden Portrait of the Pope (1577) Allisvanity.jpg\\"All is Vanity\\" by C.

Badeley made a submission, communicated by Edward Bouverie Pusey opposing any change in the law. ==Gorham judgment== Badeley appeared for Henry Phillpotts, the Bishop of Exeter, before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when George Cornelius Gorham appealed against Phillpotts' refusal to confirm him in the benefice of Brampford Speke. The Privy Council overturned the bishop's ruling, confirming Gorham in his living, and were seen to impose secular over canon authority, causing a great scandal in some quarters. In the summer of 1850, Badeley, Henry Manning and 12 other prominent Anglicans called upon the Church of England to repudiate the views that the Privy Council had expressed on baptism. There was no response and Badeley was one of many when he joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1852. ==Later life== Badeley was assistant counsel to Sir Alexander Cockburn in John Henry Newman's defence when he was prosecuted for libel by Giacinto Achilli in 1852. Badeley frequently advised Newman on legal matters thereafter, advising that Newman reject Charles Kingsley's partial withdrawal of his satirical jibe that Newman cared little for truth and encouraging him to write the Apologia Pro Vita Sua in response. Much of his later practice concerned trusts and charities. In 1865, in the Constance Kent case, he argued, against settled opinion, that the principle of priest–penitent privilege applied in English law. He maintained a lifelong friendship and correspondence with Hope-Scott and his family and Newman dedicated his Verses on Various Occasions to him as gratitude for his support in the Achilli trial. Badeley died on 29 March 1868 at his chambers at 13 Paper Buildings in the Inner Temple. ==ReferencesBibliography== : : : The first edition of this text is available at Wikisource (see ). : ==Further reading== : Category:1800s births Category:1868 deaths Category:19th-century Anglicans Category:19th-century English lawyers Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:Canon law of the Church of England Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Anglicanism Category:English Anglo-Catholics Category:English barristers Category:English Roman Catholics ","title":"Edward Badeley"},{"id":"12385666","text":"Eleutherodactylus griphus is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to Jamaica.

In 1861, he joined the Union Army in the Civil War, during which time he served as a publicity writer and later as adjutant general on Major General John M. Schofield's staff. He advanced from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. On February 24, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Campbell for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on April 10, 1866. John Campbell married Isabella Wunderly daughter of Benjamin Wunderly and Rachel Knettle Wunderly, on February 1, 1872. Campbell died 8 years later. Isabella never remarried and died on September 23, 1923 in Washington D.C.. Both John and Isabella are buried at the Arlington National Cemetery, Washington, D.C. ==Career== Campbell continued to serve under Major General Schofield during the Reconstruction Period, and in Virginia Campbell helped set up senatorial and representative districts. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Governor of Wyoming Territory in 1869 and again in 1873. While Governor, Campbell approved the first law in United States history explicitly granting women the right to vote. The law was approved on December 10, 1869. This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day. In 1875, Campbell served as Third Assistant Secretary of State under Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. Campbell was a member of the Republican Party. Campbell was appointed American Consul at Basel, Switzerland, on December 3, 1877, and resigned on February 4, 1880. ==Death and legacy== Campbell died on July 14, 1880 and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. Campbell County, Wyoming, was named either for him or for Robert Campbell, an early trapper, who was a fur trader associated with William Henry Ashley. ==In popular culture== *Campbell is portrayed by Ed Prentiss in the Lawman episode \\"The Truce\\" (1960), starring John Russell. In the story line, a wanted outlaw, O.C. Coulsen (played by Robert McQueeney) turns himself in to Marshal Dan Troop in hopes that Governor Campbell will grant Coulsen clemency, because Coulsen had saved the governor's life during the American Civil War. Meanwhile, a sheriff in pursuit seeks credit for Coulsen's arrest. The governor informs Coulsen that he must first undergo arrest and trial before there can be any consideration of a pardon. *Campbell is portrayed by Jake Weber, as a main character – the provisional governor of Wyoming and overseer of the Union Pacific Railroad, in Hell on Wheels' fourth and fifth seasons. ==See also== * List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Arlington Cemetery * * The Political Graveyard * Wyoming State Archives * Governor John A.

Their music is notable for its combination of mainstream pop and experimental elements. ==History== Begun primarily as a recording project between Zac Pennington and Jeremy Cooper, the band, originally known as Swastika Girls, went through several line-up changes, all sharing a variety of instrumental duties, and was known for its revolving-door policy to membership, with Pennington the only constant. Other members, like Jherek Bischoff and former touring musician Sam Mickens (both of the band The Dead Science) continued to contribute to the group's recorded output, though neither toured with the band. Following Cooper's departure, Pennington released (((GRRRLS))), the band's vinyl-only debut album on his own Slender Means Society label in 2004. Recorded with the help of Jherek Bischoff and Jamie Stewart (the latter of Xiu Xiu), (((GRRRLS))) featured different mixes of the seven songs on each side of the record. This was followed by the digital-only self-release of their second Christmas-themed EP Christmas with Parenthetical Girls that same year, as well as their second album Safe as Houses (released by Slender Means Society in the United States and Acuarela Discos in Europe), the expanded CD reissue of the (((GRRRLS))) album, and a third self-released Christmas EP A Parenthetical Girls Family Christmas in 2006. A split 7-inch with the band The Dead Science was released by Obsolete Vernacular in 2007. Entanglements, the group's orchestral third album, was released in September 2008 as a split release via Tomlab and Slender Means Society. Beginning in 2010, the band released a series of limited 12\\" EPs which would later be compiled into their 2013 album Privilege. The records were sold through Pennington's Slender Means Society label direct to fans, rather than distributed to record stores. At the end of the cycle, the fifth record came packaged with a box to house all the releases. The release was notable as each record was hand-numbered in the blood of the band number featured on the cover. The first 12\\", entitled Privilege, Pt. I: On Dead And Endearments, was released February 23, 2010 and was numbered in the blood of lead singer Zac Pennington.

Established in the nineteenth century and still in operation in the twenty-first, the farmstead has been named a historic site because of its traditionally built agricultural structures. ==History== The farm was established in the early nineteenth century; while its precise date of establishment appears to be uncertain, it had definitely been formed by 1829, when future journalist Murat Halstead was born there. It has continued in Halstead's family since that time, taking the name of his brother-in-law John Scott, and passing through various relatives descended from Scott. During the late nineteenth century, the farm was used for stock-raising purposes, and accordingly the barn was constructed in 1884 with a trio of concrete silos. Although the operation had been abandoned by 1895,Gordon, Stephen C. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Pumphrey Barn. Ohio Historical Society, 2003-01-09. the farm was purchased in 1900 by relatives of the Scotts, and they reopened it as a dairy farm to raise Jerseys.Gordon, Stephen C. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Pumphrey Milk House. Ohio Historical Society, 2003-01-09. All three historic structures on the farmstead were built between the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth: the granary in 1875,Gordon, Stephen C. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Pumphrey Granary. Ohio Historical Society, 2003-01-09. the barn in 1884, and the milkhouse in 1915. The milkhouse was in use for a comparatively short time, being closed in the 1950s by a health board order, and an electrically powered milking facility was added to the barn at the same time. ==Buildings== Three buildings compose the historic section of the farmstead: a barn, a granary, and a milkhouse. These form a tight complex centered on the barn; the milkhouse is placed to the north, the granary to the east, and a family cemetery to the south. The complex sits above the valley of Paddy's Run, creating a scene that late-nineteenth-century journalists deemed more picturesque than any other farm in Butler County. Barn The barn is a vernacular two-story building, constructed with concrete walls on a concrete slab foundation and covered with a gabled metal roof. The floor plan is that of a simple form of the letter \\"T\\", divided into three bays on the front and six on the side. Inside, the barn relies on wooden frame construction, mixing small and large timbers. Some of the original frame was removed soon after construction, apparently because it interfered with the owner's hay storage needs. New feeding stanchions were installed soon after the farm's reopening in the early twentieth century. Granary One story high, the granary is a wooden frame structure on a foundation of fieldstone and a gabled metal roof. Also built in a \\"T\\" shape, the structure includes corn cribs as well as space for steam-powered grinding machinery, which was installed to simplify the process of preparing grain for consumption by cattle in the barn. The sided exterior comprises seven bays, while the interior framing features unusual timbers: the beams display evidence of being both hewn and sawn, so it appears that the builders reused framing from a previous building. Milkhouse The milkhouse is a smaller single-story rectangular structure with a concrete slab foundation and a gabled metal roof. Only one door pierces the walls, which are built of vermiculated and glazed brown tiles rather than metal or concrete. Inside was originally placed a concrete structure for bulk storage of milk: after milk cans would be placed in the structure, spring water would be poured among them in order to keep the milk cool. ==Preservation== In January 2003, the farm complex was recorded by the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation program of the Ohio Historical Society. Nearly three years later, it was officially named a historic site, being added to the National Register of Historic Places in October 2005; it qualified for designation based on its architecture, which was deemed important because comparatively few changes had been made since the 19th century. The farmstead also includes an archaeological site, designated 33BU85. The entire property embraces , or ½ square mile, although the historic site's boundaries include just . ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1875 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1884 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1915 Category:Archaeological sites in Ohio Category:Barns on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Butler County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio Category:Dairy buildings in the United States Category:Farms in Ohio Category:Grain elevators in the United States Category:Barns in Ohio Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ","title":"John Scott Farm"},{"id":"12385781","text":"Pristimantis huicundo is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae.

Its population is estimated to be 3,104 people living in a total area of 89.382 km². The city belongs to the mesoregion of Sul and Sudoeste de Minas and to the microregion of Andrelândia. The municipality has an average annual median temperature of 21.2°C and the vegetation is predominantly that of the South American Atlantic Forest. With 98% of the population living within the urban area, the city had two health facilities in 2009. The Human Development Index (HDI) of the municipality is 0.736, considered average in relation to the state. The settlement of the municipality first began in the second half of the 19th century, with the construction of a stretch of the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas railway. Notable features of the municipality include the handcrafts it produces and annual events such as the Carnival of Arantina. ==History== Level crossing in Arantina. The area of the current municipality first began to be settled during the 19th century, when the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas (EFOM) railroad was being constructed. The railroad was intended to link the south of Goiás state with the Angra dos Reis municipality in Rio de Janeiro state, passing through Barra Mansa, RJ and operating both passenger and cargo trains. In Arantina there was a junction between the EFOM line and the Barra Line (the name is derived from Barra do Piraí municipality), connecting Bom Jardim de Minas municipality to the Barra Mansa line, now defunct. A small town emerged around the Arantes railway station, then situated in the municipality of Mantiqueira (today Bom Jardim de Minas). For several years the town that is today Arantina belonged to Bom Jardim de Minas. The town was known as Várzea do Paiol. In the current seat of the municipality there was a storehouse to store the corn harvested by farmer Juca Pereira, owner of much of the municipality's land. The town consolidated itself with the manufacturing of ceramics. Given the economic growth, by state law no. 1058 of 31 December 1943, the district of Bom Jardim de Minas was created, which received its name from the railway station. Arantina was emancipated by state law no. 2764 of 30 December 1962, being officially incorporated on 1 March 1963. == Geography == Hilly terrain in the rural zone. The area of the municipality, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is 89.42 km², with 0.3682 km² constituting the urban area. It is situated at a latitude of 21°54'40\\"S and a longitude of 44°15'21\\"W and is 323 km south of Belo Horizonte, the state capital of Minas Gerais. Its neighboring municipalities are Bom Jardim de Minas to the east, Andrelândia to the northwest, and Liberdade to the south. According to the regional division of 2017, instituted by the IBGE, the municipality belongs to the Immediate and Intermediate Geographic Region of Juiz de Fora. Before this time, the municipality was included in the Microregion of Andrelândia and the Mesoregion of South and Southwest Minas.  Terrain and Hydrography  The terrain of the municipality of Arantina is predominantly hilly. Approximately 60% of the territory is covered in hilly areas, while about 30% is more mountainous, and the remaining 10% is generally flat. The highest elevation is 1,379 m found at the Serra do Caxambu and the lowest elevation is 1,030 m at the base level of the Capixingui stream in the Turvo Pequeno river. The central part of the town is at 1,050 m. The territory is covered in various small rivers and streams, principally the Capixingui stream and the Turvo Pequeno river, making up part of the Rio Grande river basin. The Turvo Pequeno divides the municipality, and there are drainage projects for its sub-basin. Much of the water extracted from it is supplied to the towns of Arantina and Andrelândia.  Climate  The climate of Arantina is characterized, according to the IBGE, as tropical (type Cwb according to the Köppen climate classification). It has an average annual temperature of 21.2 °C with dry and cool winters and rainy summers with mild temperatures. The hottest month, January, has an average temperature of 24.1 °C, average high temperature of 29.4 °C and average low temperature of 18.9 °C. The coldest moth, July, has an average temperature of 17.3 °C, with 24.8 °C and 9.8 °C as the average high and low temperatures respectively. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. The average annual precipitation is 1412.9 mm, with August being the driest month when there is only 13.9 mm of rainfall. In December, the rainiest month, the average rainfall is 259.8 mm. In recent years, however, hot and dry days during the summer have become more frequent and it is not rare for the temperature to exceed 28 °C, especially between July and September. In August of 2010, for example, the precipitation in Arantina was 0 mm. During the dry season and long Indian summers in the rainy season, brush fires are commonly recorded in the hills, principally in the rural zone of the municipality, which contribute to deforestation and to the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, harming the quality of the air.  Flora and Fauna  The vegetation of the town is divided into two classes of native ecological formations: the forest (Atlantic Forest) and the open clearings. Exotic vegetation and monocultures also occur. These classes, associated with the rugged topography, result in a diverse vegetation cover. In the Atlantic Forest, trees such as the Tabebuia, Brazilian rosewood, angico, manacá-da- serra, Brazilian pine, and cedar stand out. == Demographics == In 2010, the population of the municipality was calculated by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) to be 2,823 inhabitants. According to the census of that year, 1,415 inhabitants were men and 1,408 were women. Also according to the same census, 2,633 inhabitants lived in the urban zone and 190 in the rural zone. According to statistics divulged in 2018, the municipal population was 2,804 inhabitants. In 2010, according to data from the IBGE census of that year, the racial composition of Arantina was 2,196 white (77.79%), 216 black (7.65%), 1 yellow (Asian) (0.04%), and 410 brown (multiracial) (14.52%). As for the region of birth, 18 were born in the Northeast Region (0.63%), 2,792 in the Southeast Region (98.91%), and 5 in the South Region (0.18%). 2,404 inhabitants were native to the State of Minas Gerais (90.3%) and, of this total, 1,382 were born in Arantina (48.96%). Among the 367 natives of other units of the federation, Rio de Janeiro was the state with the greatest presence at 270 people (9.58%). Following was São Paulo, with 60 residents (2.13%), and Espírito Santo with 6 residents (0.20%). The Human Development Index (HDI) of Arantina is considered medium by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), being a value of 0.697 (the 240th highest in the state of Minas Gerais). Most of the town's indices are close to or above the national average according to the UNDP. The education index was 0.641, life expectancy was 0.834, and the median income was 0.633. According to the IBGE, in the year 2003, the Gini coefficient, which measures economic inequality, was 0.39, with 1.00 being the worst number and 0.00 being the best. In that year, the incidence of poverty as measured by the IBGE was 42.15% with the lower limit of the incidence of poverty being 29.79%, the higher limit of incidence being 27.35%, and the subjective incidence being 36.50%. According to the data of the 2010 census released by the IBGE, the population of Arantina is composed of: 2,553 Catholics (90.42%), 214 Protestants (7.58%), 35 non-religious (1.24%), 7 spiritualists (0.26%), and 0.5% divided among other religions. == Politics and Administration == The administration of the municipality is carried out by executive and legislative powers. The executive power is exercised by the Mayor, aided by his cabinet of secretaries. The current Mayor of Arantina is Francisco Carlos Ferreira Alves, of the Democrats (DEM), elected in the municipal elections of 2016 with 52.14% of the vote and sworn in on 1 January 2017 with Deputy Mayor Adriano by his side. The legislative power, on the other hand, is constituted by the Municipal Chamber composed of nine Aldermen. It is up to this body to draft and vote on laws fundamental to administration and to the executive, especially the participatory budget. In addition to the legislative process and secretary work, there are also active municipal councils, among which are the rights of children and adolescents (created in 1995) and guardianship (2005). Arantina is governed by its organic law, which was enacted on 18 March 1990, and is a term of the district of Andrelândia of the state judiciary first jurisdiction. The municipality possessed, in February of 2019, 2,560 voters according to the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) (Superior Electoral Court), which represents 0.016% of the Minas Gerais electorate. ==See also== * List of municipalities in Minas Gerais Category:Municipalities in Minas Gerais == References == ","title":"Arantina"},{"id":"12385816","text":"Shaw Farm may refer to: * Shaw Family Farms, Wagram, NC, listed on the NRHP in North Carolina * Shaw Farm (Ross, Ohio), listed on the NRHP in Ohio * Shaw Farm (Bayfield County, Wisconsin), listed on the NRHP in Wisconsin ==See also== *Shaw House (disambiguation) ","title":"Shaw Farm"},{"id":"12385817","text":"Pristimantis imitatrix is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It is the site of inhibition for antibiotics such as macrolides, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and the pleuromutilins. It includes the 5S ribosomal RNA and 23S ribosomal RNA. ==Structure== 50S, roughly equivalent to the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells, is the larger subunit of the 70S ribosome of prokaryotes. The 50S subunit is primarily composed of proteins but also contains single-stranded RNA known as ribosomal RNA (rRNA). rRNA forms secondary and tertiary structures to maintain the structure and carry out the catalytic functions of the ribosome. X-ray crystallography has yielded electron density maps allowing the structure of the 50S in Haloarcula marismortui to be determined to 2.4Å resolutionand of the 50S in Deinococcus radiodurans to 3.3Å. The large ribosomal subunit (50S) is approximately twice as massive as the small ribosomal subunit (30S). The model of Hm 50S, determined in 2000 by Nenad Ban and colleagues in the laboratory of Thomas Steitz and the laboratory of Peter Moore, includes 2711 of the 2923 nucleotides of 23S rRNA, all 122 nucleotides of its 5S rRNA, and structure of 27 of its 31 proteins. A cryoEM structure of the 50S subunit from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has been determined. It shares the 50S size/sedimentation rate and the two rRNA count, but its 23S expansion segments have more in common with eukaryotes. A cryoEM reconstruction of the native 50S subunit of the extremely halophilic Archaean Halococcus morrhuae (classified under Euryarchaeota;Stenosarchaea group) is available. The 50S subunit contains a 108‐nucleotide insertion in its 5S rRNA, which at subnanometer resolution, is observed to emerge from a four‐way junction without affecting the parental canonical 5S rRNA structure. Ribosomal RNA The secondary structure of 23S is divided into six large domains, within which domain V is most important in its peptidyl transferase activity. Each domain contains normal secondary structure (e.g., base triple, tetraloop, cross-strand purine stack) and is also highly symmetric in tertiary structure; proteins intervene between their helices. At tertiary structure level, the large subunit rRNA is a single gigantic domain while the small subunit contains three structural domains. This difference reflects the lesser flexibility of the large subunit required by its function. While its core is conserved, it accommodates expansion segments on its periphery. ==Function== 50S includes the activity that catalyzes peptide bond formation (peptidyl transfer reaction), prevents premature polypeptide hydrolysis, provides a binding site for the G-protein factors (assists initiation, elongation, and termination), and helps protein folding after synthesis. Promotes the peptidyl transfer reaction and prevents peptidyl hydrolysis An induced-fit mechanism has been revealed for how 50S catalyzes the peptidyl transfer reaction and prevents peptidyl hydrolysis. The amino group of an aminoacyl-tRNA (binds to A site) attacks the carbon of a carbonyl group of a peptidyl-tRNA (binds to P site) and finally yields a peptide extended by one amino acid esterified to the A site tRNA bound to the ribosomal A site and a deacylated tRNA in the P site. When the A site is unoccupied, nucleotide U2620 (E. coli U2585), A2486 (2451) and C2106 (2063) sandwich the carbonyl group in the middle, forcing it into an orientation facing the A site. This orientation prevents any nucleophilic attack from the A site because the optimal attacking angle is 105 degrees from the plane of the ester group. When a tRNA with a complete[?] CCA sequence at its acceptor stem is bound to the A site, C74 of the tRNA stacking with U2590 (2555) induces a conformational change in the ribosome, resulting in movement of U2541 (2506), U2620 (2585) through G2618 (2583). The displacement of bases allows the ester group to adopt a new conformation accessible to nucleophilic attack from the A site. The N3 (nitrogen) of A2486 (2451) is closest to the peptide bond being synthesized and may function as a general base to facilitate the nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the aminoacyl-tRNA (in the A site). The pKa of A2486 (2451) is about 5 units higher in order to hydrogen bond with the amino group thus increasing its nucleophilicity. The elevation of pKa is achieved through a charge relay mechanism. A2486 (2451) interacts with G2482 (G2447), which hydrogen bonds with the buried phosphate of A2486 (2450). This buried phosphate can stabilize the normally rare imino tautomers of both bases, resulting in an increase in the negative charge density on N3. Helps protein formation After initiation, elongation, and termination, there is a fourth step of the disassembly of the post-termination complex of ribosome, mRNA, and tRNA, which is a prerequisite for the next round of protein synthesis. The large ribosomal subunit has a role in protein folding both in vitro and in vivo. The large ribosomal subunit provides a hydrophobic surface for the hydrophobic collapse step of protein folding. The newly synthesized protein needs full access to the large subunit to fold; this process may take a period of time (5 minutes for beta-galactosidase). ==See also== * Prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit (30S) * Ribosomal RNA * 23S methyl RNA motif ==References== * * * ==External links== * http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/antibiot.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20110227235620/http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~ag_ribo/ag_franceschi/franceschi- projects-50S-antibiotics.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20080206051722/http://www.riboworld.com/antib/50santib- eng.shtml * * Category:Ribosomal RNA Category:Protein biosynthesis ","title":"Prokaryotic large ribosomal subunit"},{"id":"12385835","text":"Pristimantis incomptus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It was the primary home of the eighty-member congregation for some years, but by the 1850s the majority of the members lived southward in far northern Hamilton County, so a new building was constructed near Pleasant Run, and the old building was ultimately abandoned by the congregation. However, it remained in use by others in the community until 1968, either as a church or as a school, and it had come into the possession of Fairfield's historical society by 1980. ==Architecture== A simple weatherboarded building, the chapel was two stories tall with a shallow gabled roof.

Far from qualifying for grand architecture, it qualified because of its simple design: it represented what was once a common country church design, free of ornament and built for functional purposes. By that time, it was one of very few pre-Civil War buildings remaining in Fairfield, which was quickly becoming more and more of an exurb in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. Six years later, the church was recorded by personnel from Butler County's Citizens for Historic and Preservation Services as part of a historic preservation survey, the Ohio Historic Inventory. Noting the church's place among contemporary commercial development, the surveyor observed deterioration in both interior and exterior, and by that time the building was seemingly close to collapse.

Proteins are shown in blue and the single RNA strand in orange. The prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit, or 30S subunit, is the smaller subunit of the 70S ribosome found in prokaryotes. It is a complex of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 19 proteins. This complex is implicated in the binding of transfer RNA to messenger RNA (mRNA). The small subunit is responsible for the binding and the reading of the mRNA during translation. The small subunit, both the rRNA and its proteins, complexes with the large 50S subunit to form the 70S prokaryotic ribosome in prokaryotic cells. This 70S ribosome is then used to translate mRNA into proteins. == Function == The 30S subunit is an integral part of mRNA translation. It binds three prokaryotic initiation factors: IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3. A portion of the 30S subunit (the 16S rRNA) guides the initiating start codon (5′)-AUG-(3′) of mRNA into position by recognizing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a complementary binding site about 8 base pairs upstream from the start codon. This ensures the ribosome starts translation at the correct location. The tightness of the bonding between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the mRNA and the 16S rRNA determines how efficiently translation proceeds. Once the 16S rRNA recognizes the mRNA start codon, a special transfer RNA, f-Met-tRNA, binds and protein translation begins. The binding site of the f-Met-tRNA on the 30S ribosomal subunit is called the \\"D-site\\" This step is required in order for protein synthesis to occur. Then the large ribosomal subunit will bind and protein synthesis will continue. The binding of the large subunit causes a conformational change in the 70S, which opens another site for protein translation. In order to form the translation complex with the 50S subunit, the 30S subunit must bind IF-1, IF-2, IF-3, mRNA, and f-met- tRNA. Next, the 50S subunit binds and a guanosine triphosphate is cleaved to guanosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, thus dissociating the initiation factors and resulting in protein translation. This process is called \\"initiation\\" and is the slowest process of translation. == Structure == The small ribosomal subunit is made up of 16S rRNA and 19 full proteins. There is also one polypeptide chain that consists of 26 amino acids. Conventionally, the rRNA is labeled with \\"H#\\" to indicate the helix number in high resolution images. Proteins are labelled \\"S#\\" to indicate the different peptides involved in rRNA stabilization. S11 and H45 are located near the Shine-Dalgarno binding site, which is also near the IF-3 binding site. Proteins S3, S4, S5, and S12, along with H18, are located near the channel where mRNA is present in the 30S subunit. == Inhibition == The 30S subunit is the target of antibiotics such as tetracycline and gentamicin. These antibiotics specifically target the prokaryotic ribosomes, hence their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in eukaryotes. Tetracycline interacts with H27 in the small subunit as well as binding to the A-site in the large subunit. Puromycin is an inhibitor of ribosomal translation. Pactamycin interrupts the binding in the Shine-Dalgarno binding region in the small subunit, thus disrupting activity. Hygromycin B also interacts with H44 and inhibits the translocation movement that is necessary during protein synthesis. == See also == * Prokaryotic large ribosomal subunit (50S) * Ribosomal RNA * Antibiotics ==ReferencesExternal links== * 16S rRNA, BioMineWiki * http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/antibiot.htm * Category:Ribosomal RNA Category:Protein biosynthesis ","title":"Prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit"},{"id":"12385934","text":"The La Selle dusky frog or Mable's robber frog, Eleutherodactylus jugans, is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

Tytus House is located in Middletown's South Main Street District, on the west side of South Main Street between Yankee Road and 4th Avenue. It is a three- story masonry structure, built out of red brick. It is L-shaped, with a stylistically eclectic set of architectural features that includes rounded arches in the Romanesque style, half-timbered gable ends in the Tudor Revival style, and an eyebrow dormer. The interior is richly decorated with carved woodwork, and has an original chandelier in the dining room. and The house was built in 1865 by John Butler Tytus Sr., owner of a local papermill, and was the lifelong home of his son, John Butler Tytus; it remained in the Tytus family until 1970 when Pat and Jeri Rossi bought the house part and parcel and embarked on renovations for the next 41 years. The younger Tytus was educated at Yale University in the humanities before entering his father's business. After his father died, he eventually landed a job at a steel factory owned by Armco, where he developed skills as an engineer and learned the manufacturing process well. Observing that efficiencies of manufacturing could be realized by being able to continuous feed hot steel through a rolling process, he set about to create such a process in 1921. By 1924 his process was sufficiently developed that the company built a new plant implementing it. The plant was an immediate success, and the process was soon widely adopted by other steelmakers. Tytus's process made possible the rolling of steel in sizes and quantities significantly larger than previous labor-intensive processes, at a significantly higher rate of production. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Ohio ==References== Category:National Historic Landmarks in Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Middletown, Ohio Category:Houses in Butler County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio ","title":"John B.

It is found in the eastern slopes of the Andes of Ecuador and Cordillera Central and eastern Andean foothills in northwestern Peru. The specific name katoptroides is Greek for \\"mirror-like\\" and refers to the similarity of this species to Pristimantis crucifer, but being found on the other side of the Andes. Common name Puyo robber frog has been proposed for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length (SVL). The snout is rounded in dorsal view and moderately long. The tympanum is half-concealed by the well-developed supratympanic fold. The fingers and the toes have large discs at their tips and vague (fingers) or narrow (toes), weakly crenelate lateral keels. Skin is dorsally finely tuberculate and ventrally areolate. The dorsal coloration varies from green to greenish brown with darker brown markings. The belly is white, sometimes with brown fringes. The groin and posterior surfaces of the thighs are deep blue to dark brown, sometimes with orange spots on the edges. The iris is pale yellow with black reticulation. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis katoptroides occurs in montane and submontane cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. It can occur in both primary and secondary forests. Specimens can be found in understorey herbaceous vegetation as high as seven meters above the ground. Development is direct (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). Although considered generally rare, Pristimantis katoptroides is observed with some frequency in eastern Ecuador. Cattle grazing and mining activities can be local threats, but its presence in secondary forests suggests some degree of tolerance to human impacts.

Although modern, scientific psychology is often dated from the 1879 opening of the first psychological clinic by Wilhelm Wundt, attempts to create methods for assessing and treating mental distress existed long before. The earliest recorded approaches were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives.Benjamin, Ludy. (2007). A Brief History of Modern Psychology. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing. Early examples of such psychological thinkers included Patañjali, Padmasambhava,T. Clifford and Samuel Wiser (1984), Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry Rhazes, AvicennaAfzal Iqbal and A. J. Arberry, The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi, p. 94. and RumiRumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p.47. (see Islamic psychology and Eastern philosophy and clinical psychology). In an informal sense, psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as individuals received psychological counsel and reassurance from others. Purposeful, theoretically-based psychotherapy was probably first developed in the Middle East during the 9th century by the Persian physician and psychological thinker, Rhazes, who was at one time the chief physician of the Baghdad bimaristan. In the West, however, serious mental disorders were generally treated as demonic or medical conditions requiring punishment and confinement until the advent of moral treatment approaches in the 18th century. This brought about a focus on the possibility of psychosocial intervention—including reasoning, moral encouragement and group activities—to rehabilitate the \\"insane\\". In the 19th century, one could have ones head examined, literally, using phrenology, the study of the shape of the skull developed by respected anatomist Franz Joseph Gall. Other popular treatments included physiognomy—the study of the shape of the face—and mesmerism, developed by Franz Anton Mesmer—designed to relieve psychological distress by the use of magnets. Spiritualism and Phineas Quimby's \\"mental healing\\" technique that was very like modern concept of \\"positive visualization\\" were also popular. By 1832 psychotherapy made its first appearance in fiction with a short story by John Neal titled \\"The Haunted Man.\\" While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. That area was already being addressed by the developing fields of psychiatry and neurology within the asylum movement and the use of moral therapy. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his \\"talking cure\\" in Vienna, that the first scientifically clinical application of psychology began—at the University of Pennsylvania, to help children with learning disabilities. Although clinical psychologists originally focused on psychological assessment, the practice of psychotherapy, once the sole domain of psychiatrists, became integrated into the profession after the Second World War. Psychotherapy began with the practice of psychoanalysis, the \\"talking cure\\" developed by Sigmund Freud. Soon afterwards, theorists such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung began to introduce new conceptions about psychological functioning and change. These and many other theorists helped to develop the general orientation now called psychodynamic therapy, which includes the various therapies based on Freud's essential principle of making the unconscious conscious. In the 1920s, behaviorism became the dominant paradigm, and remained so until the 1950s. Behaviorism used techniques based on theories of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory. Major contributors included Joseph Wolpe, Hans Eysenck, and B.F. Skinner. Because behaviorism denied or ignored internal mental activity, this period represents a general slowing of advancement within the field of psychotherapy.Alessandri, M., Heiden, L., & Dunbar-Welter, M. (1995). \\"History and Overview\\" in Heiden, Lynda & Hersen, Michel (eds.), Introduction to Clinical Psychology. New York : Plenum Press. Wilhelm Reich began to develop body psychotherapy in the 1930s. Starting in the 1950s, two main orientations evolved independently in response to behaviorism—cognitivism and existential-humanistic therapy.Reisman, John. (1991). A History of Clinical Psychology. UK : Taylor Francis. The humanistic movement largely developed from both the Existential theories of writers like Rollo May and Viktor Frankl (a less well known figure Eugene Heimler) and the Person-centered psychotherapy of Carl Rogers. These orientations all focused less on the unconscious and more on promoting positive, holistic change through the development of a supportive, genuine, and empathic therapeutic relationship. Rollo May, Carl Rogers, and Irvin Yalom acknowledge the influence of Otto Rank (1884-1939), Freud's acolyte, then critic. During the 1950s, Albert Ellis developed the first form of cognitive behavioral therapy, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and few years later Aaron T. Beck developed cognitive therapy. Both of these included therapy aimed at changing a person's beliefs, by contrast with the insight-based approach of psychodynamic therapies or the newer relational approach of humanistic therapies. Cognitive and behavioral approaches were combined during the 1970s, resulting in Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Being oriented towards symptom-relief, collaborative empiricism and modifying core beliefs, this approach has gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. Since the 1970s, other major perspectives have been developed and adopted within the field. Perhaps the two biggest have been Systems Therapy—which focuses on family and group dynamics—and Transpersonal psychology, which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other important orientations developed in the last three decades include Feminist therapy, Somatic Psychology, Expressive therapy, and applied Positive psychology. Clinical psychology in Japan developed towards a more integrative socially-orientated counseling methodology. Practice in India developed from both traditional metaphysical and ayurvedic systems and Western methodologies.Hall, John & Llewelyn, Susan. (2006). What is Clinical Psychology? 4th Edition. UK: Oxford University Press. Since 1993, the American Psychological Association Division 12 Task Force has created and revised a list of empirically supported psychological treatments for specific disorders. The Division 12 standards are based on 7 \\"essential\\" criteria for research quality, such as randomization and the use of validated psychological assessments. In general, cognitive behavioral treatments for psychological disorders have received greater support than other psychotherapeutic approaches. Passionate debate among clinical scientists and practitioners about the superiority of evidence-based practices is ongoing,Wampold, B. E. Ollendick, T. H. King, N. J. (2006). Do therapies designated as empirically supported treatments for specific disorders produce outcomes superior to non- empirically supported treatment therapies? In J.C. Norcross L.E. Beutler R.F. Levant (Eds.), Evidence-based practices in mental health: Debate and dialogue on the fundamental issues (pp. 299-328). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. and some have presented correlational data that indicate that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness and that the therapist, client, and therapeutic alliance account for a larger portion of client improvement from psychotherapy. While many Ph.D. training programs in clinical psychology have taken a strong empirical approach to psychotherapy that has led to a greater emphasis on cognitive behavioral interventions, other training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic orientation. This integrative movement attempts to combine the most effective aspects of all the schools of practice. ==See also== *Abnormal psychology *Clinical psychology *History of psychoanalysis *Mental health *Psychiatry *History of psychology *History of psychiatry ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Henri Ellenberger: The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry, Basic Books, 1981 *Eva Illouz: Saving the Modern Soul: Therapy, Emotions, and the Culture of Self-Help, University of California Press 2008, Psychotherapy Category:Psychotherapy Psychotherapy ","title":"History of psychotherapy"},{"id":"12385965","text":"Eleutherodactylus klinikowskii is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to Cuba.

A fieldstone foundation is covered with concrete on the south side, the main facade. This exposure has five bays with a slightly off center (westerly) entry. Above the door is a three light transom and the windows have gauged brick sills and lintels. On the first floor facade two three over three double hung sash flank the doorway on each side and smaller similar windows are on the second floor above each and the door. A corbeled cornice sits below brick laid on edge giving a saw tooth look. The east and west sides of the building each have interior chimneys rising above the center of the peak of the gables. East and west exposures have little fenestration. The east side has the initials JV centered in the gable wall. A one-story addition on the rear (north) side was added in the Twentieth Century. A screened porch joins the north of this addition to the original smokehouse. Original walnut woodwork remaining on the interior include window sills and reveals, the main stairway and wall paneling. ==History== The John Vaughan House was the first brick building in the Shandon area. Vaughan, a Welsh immigrant, built the house from 1814 to 1816, having made the first payment for the land the house occupies on November 8, 1801. This was the east half of section 25, Morgan Township, Butler County, Ohio. Vaughan and his wife Mary Jones come to Butler County with a group of Welsh settlers that year shortly after another group settled at Colerain Township. The family first built and lived in a log house on the property. To build the present structure a kiln was built and bricks were fired on the premises by James Shaw of Washington County who was brickyard foreman and superintendent of the mortar making. The brick for many of the homes built in the area were supplied by this brickyard and Vaughan's house served as a model for their construction. Vaughan had a hospitable reputation and paid for the passage of many of his fellow Welshmen who settled in the area. He sheltered twenty of them, who had not yet built their own homes, in his house in the winter of 1818–1819. The town church met in Vaughan's barn until a facility was built on land he donated most of. John Vaughan's son William was the first postmaster for Paddy's Run (later Shandon) and from 1831 to 1847 the house served as the Post Office. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1977. ==See also== * Brickwork * Historic preservation * History of Ohio * National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio == References External links== * * Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Houses in Butler County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butler County, Ohio ","title":"John Vaughan House"},{"id":"12386031","text":"Pristimantis latidiscus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

He is described by Hannay as being \\"five foot ten, very thin and active, and as strong as a buffalo [with] pale blue eyes, a face as gentle as a girl's, and a soft sleepy voice.\\" ==About== The origins of Pienaar's character and person in the Richard Hannay novels are that Pienaar is a 'white hunter' and sometime \\"ne'er-do-well\\" whom Hannay met during his time spent in South Africa as a mining engineer, some time before World War I. They formed a very strong bond of comradely friendship forged in moments of extreme danger. Pienaar appears in the following \\"Richard Hannay\\" novels: Greenmantle and Mr Standfast. ==Plots== In \\"Greenmantle\\", Pienaar aids Hannay as an agent who deceives the German authorities in 1915 about the intentions and inclinations of Afrikaners towards the British Empire, and about how important the Middle East is to British interests. Pienaar plays, while unauthorised and gallivanting in Imperial Germany, a slightly deranged but anti-British Boer, who only wants to do harm to the British Empire out of revenge for wrongs done to his people during the Anglo-Boer war (the Second South African War). He is re-united with Hannay by chance at a harbour on the Danube, on the way to Constantinople and Turkey. Near the end of the novel \\"Mr Standfast\\", Pienaar - who joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 and become something of an \\"ace\\" and a hero to the younger pilots although modest and self-effacing as a man, is killed in an aerial collision during an heroic battle with the German air ace \\"Lensch\\" (also portrayed by Buchan as a chivalrous and honourable enemy, for Pienaar met him while in brief captivity previous to this story, and Lensch saw to his well-being.) Lensch, leading a flight of fighter/observers, is carrying back to the German lines the secret of the terrible vulnerability of the Allied lines at that point in early 1918. The event is witnessed by General Richard Hannay on the ground, in his trench lines, a short distance away. Pienaar is buried in the last scene of Mr Standfast, in which Richard Hannay, in the presence of Mary Lamington and John S Blenkiron, reads the valediction for \\"Mr Valiant-for-Truth\\" (from \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\") instead of that for Mr Standfast: as Hannay believes that Pienaar earned that greater salute for his bravery than what he would have otherwise warranted. Pienaar is awarded the VC posthumously, for his action. The reference to \\"Mr Standfast\\", a character from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, is because Pienaar is stated as often comparing himself to that fictional character.Buchan, John. Greenmantle. (London: Penguin Books Ltd, 1997) The plot of The Island of Sheep arises from an incident in South Africa involving Hannay and Pienaar. Pienaar inspires Hannay's character based disguises in The 39 Steps. ==Notes== Pienaar Category:Fictional Afrikaners Pienaar Pienaar Pienaar Pienaar Pienaar Pienaar ","title":"Peter Pienaar"},{"id":"12386046","text":"Sloupnice is a municipality in the Svitavy District (until January 1, 2007, in the Ústí nad Orlicí District) of the Pardubice Region in the Czech Republic.

The municipality is surrounded by five towns: Litomyšl, Ústí nad Orlicí, Česká Třebová, Vysoké Mýto and Choceň. ==Geography== Sloupnice is a linear municipality formed around the east-west road connecting towns Ústí nad Orlicí and Vysoké Mýto. Although the length of the municipality along the road is approximately 6.5 km, the width of municipality is up to 500 m. The bus station in the middle of the municipality is the only open space area that can be considered as a municipality common. The brook of Bílá Labuť flows close to the major road in the lower based two- thirds of municipality. ==Administrative parts== The municipality is made by four administrative parts: Dolní Sloupnice (Lower Sloupnice), with the hamlet of Džbánovec, Horní Sloupnice (Upper Sloupnice), Končiny 1st part and Končiny 2nd part.

Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), white proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) have also been used to propagate PMV and panicum mosaic satellite virus (SPMV), and mechanical transmission can occur to maize and some cultivars of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). ==Classification== Panicum mosaic virus is the type species of the genus Panicovirus, a member of the plant virus family Tombusviridae. Members of Tombusviridae are transmitted as positive sense single-stranded non-enveloped RNA viruses, with an icosahedral capsid.ICTVdB – The Universal Virus Database, version 3 00.074. Tombusviridae PMV itself has a genome of 4,326 nucleotides, encapsulated into 30-nm particles by a capsid protein of 26 kDa. PMV was placed in the genus Panicovirus because of its limited monocot host range and lack of an additional 5'-ORF. PMV is serologically related to Molina streak virus and Maize mild mottle virus. == Satellite panicum mosaic virus == There exists a satellite virus to panicum mosaic virus. Although little is known about the satellite panicum mosaic virus, the pathogen is believed to play a role in the infection process because when combined with panicum mosaic virus, the satellite virus causes symptoms to appear earlier in the growing season and results in a more severe infection.Stewart, C. L. (2014). PANICUM MOSAIC VIRUS COMPLEX AND BIOFUELS SWITCHGRASS. Retrieved 24 October 2016, from http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context;=biosysengdiss Because of the change in disease virulence to the main viral pathogen, panicum mosaic virus and satellite panicum mosaic virus are believed to cause synergistic effects to their hosts. Satellite panicum mosaic virus cannot produce its own replication nor movement proteins, thus it depends entirely on panicum mosaic virus for replication and systemic movement in the host plant.Omarov, R. T., Qi, D., & Scholthof, K. B. G. (2005). The capsid protein of satellite panicum mosaic virus contributes to systemic invasion and interacts with its helper virus. Journal of Virology, 79(15), 9756–9764. ==Pathogenesis and disease characteristics == Panicum mosaic virus is a plant disease that infects monocots by invading through mechanical wounds.Sill, W H Jr; Pickett, R C. (1957). A new virus disease of switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L. Plant Disease Reporter. 41: 241–249. Because panicum mosaic virus pathogen cannot create its own wound in a host plant, the pathogen must survive until a wound is formed by living epiphytically on its future host or in plant debris.Sill, W. H., & Talens, L. T. (1962). New hosts and characteristics of the Panicum mosaic virus. Plant Dis Rep, 46, 780–783. The virus can live up to nine years in infected plant debris. The virus is moved around the environment by wind, rain, and cultural practices such as plowing and mowing. Once the virus has successfully invaded the plant, panicum mosaic virions spread through the plant by producing three proteins (p8, p6.6, and p15) as part of their capsids. The incubation period of panicum mosaic virus is fastest in warm conditions, around 29 to 35 degrees Celsius, and can take as few as 7–18 days. In regard to pathogen composition, there are two characteristic components of panicum mosaic and its related panicum satellite mosaic viruses. One characteristic of the disease is a 42S component which is isometric shaped, 17 nm in diameter, and has not been shown to be infectious by itself.Buzen, F. G., Niblett, C. L., Hooper, G. R., Hubbard, J., & Newman, M. A. (1984). Further characterization of panicum mosaic virus and its associated satellite virus. Phytopathology, 74(3), 313–318. The second characteristic component of panicum mosaic virus is the 109S component which is approximately 30 nm in diameter, also isometric shaped, and has been shown to be infectious. From replication testing, it is believed the 109S component is the panicum mosaic pathogen and the 42S component of the pathogen is the panicum satellite virus because the 109S component replicates independently while 42S cannot replicate without the presence of the 109S component. == Hosts and symptoms ==  St. Augustine grass  Symptoms of St. Augustine Decline Syndrome on St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) are mild green mosaics in addition to mottling and streaking of leaves. In extreme cases, a turf grass crop may experience chlorosis if the disease affects susceptible plants. The disease is spread only through mechanical vectors, such as mowing. At this time, the only method of control for panicum mosaic virus is planting resistant cultivars. In turf grass, the disease is geographically centered around the southcentral and southeastern United States, due to the high prevalence of non-resistant turf species.  Millet  Symptoms of panicum mosaic virus on millet—without its satellite virus—are slight chlorosis and mild stunting. The synergistic effect of panicum mosaic virus and satellite panicum mosaic virus on millet cultivars is rapidly developed chlorotic streaking within several days of inoculating plants. The long-term effects of combined panicum mosaic and satellite panicum mosaic viruses on millet are severe leaf mosaicking, stunting, and failure to set seed.Qi, D., Omarov, R. T., & Scholthof, K. B. G. (2008). The complex subcellular distribution of satellite panicum mosaic virus capsid protein reflects its multifunctional role during infection. Virology, 376(1), 154–164.  Switchgrass  Switchgrass is a native prairie grass that started to be bred for erosion control and forage around a century ago.Wright, L. (2007). Historical perspective on how and why switchgrass was selected as a \\"model\\" high-potential energy crop. Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the 1980s, switchgrass began to be cultivated for biofuels. Over the course of the last three decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of disease research of switchgrass and other energy crops. Similar to its symptoms on millet and turf grass, panicum mosaic virus causes switchgrass to have chlorotic mottling and stunting. Unlike turf grass, there are no resistant cultivars of switchgrass available to be grown. As a result of the lack of resistance in cultivated species of switchgrass, there is a potential danger of developing large scale disease within energy cropping systems. == Management ==  St. Augustine decline in turf grass  The main method of controlling St. Augustine Decline Syndrome is breeding resistant varieties. This method of resistance breeding has been successful in turf grass because it has led to the production of two resistant cultivars of St. Augustine grass, FA-108 and FA-2002 (nicknamed 'Raleigh', and 'Seville').Reinert, J. A., Bruton, B. D., & Toler, R. W. (1980). Resistance of St. Augustine grass to southern chinch bug and St. Augustine decline strain of Panicum mosaic virus. Journal of Economic Entomology, 73(4), 602–604. Aside from resistance genes, another option of managing St. Augustine Decline Syndrome is cultural control by cleaning tools between mowing different properties to prevent the spread of pathogen. A third control option for St. Augustine Decline is to mow turf grass only during dry weather because the infected sap is not able to spread as easily.  Switchgrass and millet  Although a strong strain of the pathogen is economically and aesthetically detrimental, a possible beneficial interaction with a susceptible host by panicum mosaic virus is cross- protection by inoculation of a weak panicum mosaic virus strain. The benefit of inoculation with a weak strain means that the crop will have cross- protection, which means that the crop will not have as extensive of yield loss if the crop is exposed to a more aggressive, virulent strain. One risk that comes with weak strain inoculation is increased susceptibility to other viral strains and pathogens. Additionally, there is a risk that the weak strain could mutate into a more virulent strain. Alternatively, the inoculated weak viral disease might cause synergistic effects if another viral pathogen infects the plant.Fulton, R. W. (1986). Practices and precautions in the use of cross protection for plant virus disease control. Annual review of Phytopathology, 24(1), 67–81. Despite the risks posed by cross-protection of crops using weak strains, the method has proven valuable in the control of several other viruses. Cross-protection appears to be the most promising option in the case of switchgrass because of the lack of resistance genes for pathogen control. ==References== Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Tombusviridae ","title":"Panicum mosaic virus"},{"id":"12386095","text":"Lennie Baker (April 18, 1946 - February 24, 2016) was an American singer and saxophone player for the 1950s rock group, Danny and the Juniors.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. E. locustus has suffered a population decline of more than 80% due to introduced predators and amphibian chytrid disease. Scientists believe amphibian chytrid disease may be exacerbated by climate change - warmer temperatures in dry, moist habitats, causing stress that may lead to greater susceptibility to the disease. ==Description== The locust coqui is a small species, approximately 0.8 inches (20 mm) in snout-vent length. It is brown overall, minutely variegated, with lighter brown or cream colors. A pair of externally concave lines is almost always visible on the back, but a variable-width line along the vertebrae may or may not be present. The eyes are large and protuberant, and the angles at the side of the snout are rounded and indistinct. ==Habits== Like other Eleutherodactylidae, E. locustus does not have interdigital membranes, so is not well adapted to swimming; instead, it has pads on its toes that allow it to adhere to leaves and branches. The species uses internal fertilization – the fertilized eggs undergo direct development. The tadpole stage occurs entirely within the egg, rather than as a free-living tadpole. Thus, a tiny but fully functional froglet hatches directly from the egg. E. locustus females deposit four to six clutches of about 28 eggs each per year, mostly during the rainy season, with a development period of 26 days. Males guard the eggs to keep them moist, and remain in the nest for a few days after they emerge. The call of E. locustus is a short whistle, followed by a series of clicks. ==Habitat== The locust coqui is restricted to the interior uplands of eastern Puerto Rico at elevations of 895 to 3,444 ft (273 to 1,050 m) above sea level. A terrestrial species, it occurs in mesic broadleaf, subtropical, moist lowland or subtropical moist montane forests. Because an unexplained major decline in the abundance of this species has occurred in the last two decades, even in relatively undisturbed forests (such as El Yunque), this animal is rarely seen, but an easily accessible forest location sustains an E. locustus population. On the fern-covered slope above the Big Tree Nature Trail's roadside parking lot, the calls of locust coquis can be heard beginning in the late afternoon, just before sunset.2008 Wildlife Facts – Locust Coqui.

The specific name maculosus is Latin for \\"dappled\\" or \\"spotted\\" and refers to the pale spots on the hidden surfaces of this species. Common name spotted robber frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is narrower than the body. The snout is subacuminate in dorsal view and rounded in lateral view. The canthus rostralis and supra-tympanic fold are evident, the latter obscuring upper edge of tympanum. The fingers and toes bear fleshy lateral keels and rounded discs; toe discs are slightly smaller than those on fingers. Dorsal skin bears some scattered pustules. The dorsum is dark olive-brown to dark brow and has brown markings. The venter is bronze-brown to black. The flanks and the concealed parts of the limbs are black with white spots. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis maculosus occurs in primary forests at elevations from or to above sea level. Individuals have been found on leaves and branches on high or medium strata. The type series was collected from low vegetation (about above the ground) along streams. Pristimantis maculosus is a rare species that has been recorded only in one locality post-2010. It is threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) caused by logging and agriculture. It has been recently recorded in the Río Blanco Forest Reserve, and its range overlaps with the Selva de Florencia National Natural Park. ==References== maculosus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Amphibians described in 1991 Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis maculosus"},{"id":"12386159","text":"Oreobates madidi is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

In the Book of Exodus, Massah is mentioned at the same time as Meribah, in a context which suggests that Massah is the same location as Meribah, but other biblical mentions of Massah and Meribah, such as that in the Blessing of Moses,Massah and Meribah are also referenced in , , and , , and seem to imply that they are distinct locations.Peake's commentary on the BibleCheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica The Biblical text states that the Israelites argued with Moses about the lack of water, with Moses rebuking the Israelites for testing Yahweh, hence the name Massah, which means testing. In an earlier narrative concerning Marah, a similar argument is related, in which Yahweh tested the Israelites; some textual scholars regard this latter episode, which doesn't mention Massah explicitly, as being the Elohist version of the naming of Massah, while the former account, in which the name Massah refers to the testing of Yahweh by the Israelites, is attributed to the Jahwist. During his sermons in Deuteronomy, Moses explicitly calls out the Israelites for tempting the Lord at Massah. Psalm 95,Ps. 95:7-9 a call to worship and obedience, recalls the incident at Massah: > O that today you would listen to his voice! Do not harden your hearts, as at > Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, when your ancestors > tested me, and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. As Psalm 95 indicated, this act of testing and defiance led to the entire generation of Israel forbidden to enter promised land: > For forty years I loathed that generation and said, “They are a people whose > hearts go astray, and they do not regard my ways.” Therefore in my anger I > swore, “They shall not enter my rest.” ==References== Category:Stations of the Exodus ","title":"Massah"},{"id":"12386212","text":"Jim Liddell was an English footballer who played in the Hong Kong First Division League for Hong Kong Rangers FC as goalkeeper between 1973 and 1976. ==External links== * Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Scottish footballers Category:Hong Kong Rangers FC players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Hong Kong First Division League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish expatriate sportspeople in Hong Kong Category:Scottish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Hong Kong ","title":"Jim Liddell"},{"id":"12386218","text":"Peach enation virus is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Comoviridae. ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Peach enation virus *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Nepoviruses ","title":"Peach enation virus"},{"id":"12386220","text":"Peach rosette mosaic virus (PRMV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Secoviridae, infecting peaches and nectarines, and grapevine. ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Peach rosette mosaic virus *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Stone fruit tree diseases Category:Viral grape diseases Category:Nepoviruses ","title":"Peach rosette mosaic virus"},{"id":"12386225","text":"Peanut clump virus (PCV) is a plant pathogenic virus.

The season was regarded as a success; despite the team's slow start in the league, they won their 10th Premier League title (their 17th top division title overall, just one behind Liverpool's then record of 18) and beat Chelsea on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final to claim the European Double. Although they won the 2007 FA Community Shield against Chelsea, the club was not as successful in the domestic cup competitions, losing to eventual FA Cup winners Portsmouth in the Sixth Round, and losing to Coventry City in the Third Round of the League Cup. In February 2008, the club commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, as a result of which eight United players and three members of the coaching staff lost their lives. The club held a memorial service at Old Trafford on 6 February 2008, renaming the tunnel under the South Stand as the \\"Munich Tunnel\\". This was followed on 10 February by the Manchester derby. United took to the field in a retro kit reminiscent of the kit worn by the 1958 team, abandoning squad numbers in favour of a 1–11 numbering system. United's players were also successful on an individual level in the 2007–08 season, with three players in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year, while Cristiano Ronaldo picked up six individual awards, including the Premier League Golden Boot for his 31 league goals. ==Pre-season and friendlies== United began their pre-season in July 2007 with a tour of the Far East where they played Urawa Red Diamonds, FC Seoul, Shenzen FC and Guangzhou Pharmaceutical; they went undefeated throughout the entire tour, winning three matches and drawing one. Their next game took place back at Old Trafford, against Internazionale, followed by trips to Doncaster Rovers and Peterborough United, managed by Alex Ferguson's son Darren. The next two matches were played simultaneously with first team coach Jimmy Ryan taking one squad to Scotland to play Dunfermline, while assistant manager Carlos Queiroz took another group to play Glentoran in Northern Ireland. In January 2008, Manchester United played Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia in a testimonial match for Sami Al-Jaber as part of a mid-season training camp, hosted by the Saudi royal family. United lost the match 3–2. {  - !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F–A !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 17 July 2007 Urawa Red Diamonds A 2–2 Fletcher 47', Ronaldo 52' 58,716 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 20 July 2007 FC Seoul A 4–0 Ronaldo 5', Eagles 18', Rooney 20', Evra 60' 64,000 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 23 July 2007 Shenzhen Xiangxue N 6–0 Giggs 12', Rooney 20', Nani 22', O'Shea 54', Ronaldo 56', Eagles 63' 15,000 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 27 July 2007 Guangzhou Pharmaceutical N 3–0 Rooney 12' (pen.), Nani 43', Martin 53' 50,000 - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 1 August 2007 Internazionale H 2–3 Rooney 18', Adriano 50' (o.g.) 73,738 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 3 August 2007 Doncaster Rovers A 2–0 Gibson 70', Evans 90' 13,080 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 4 August 2007 Peterborough United A 3–1 Eckersley 23', Jones 72', Dong 82'  - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 8 August 2007 Glentoran A 3–0 Campbell 5', Evra 14', Nani 37' 14,500 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 8 August 2007 Dunfermline Athletic A 4–0 Eagles 27', Giggs 35', Rooney (2) 63' (pen.), 85' 11,200 - bgcolor=\\"ffdddd\\" 21 January 2008 Al-Hilal A 2–3 Tevez 25', Ronaldo 33' 70,000 } ==FA Community Shield== In August, League champions United contested the Community Shield against Chelsea, the winners of the previous season's FA Cup.

United lost Wayne Rooney to a foot injury picked up against Reading and Cristiano Ronaldo to suspension after he was sent off for appearing to headbutt Portsmouth's Richard Hughes. A derby defeat to Manchester City saw the club slip into 17th place in the table. Results elsewhere pushed them into the relegation zone for the first time in years. The following week at home to Tottenham Hotspur, Nani scored his first competitive goal for the club to give United their first win of the season. Two more 1–0 victories followed, first against Sunderland, where Louis Saha scored in his first game back from injury, and then away to Everton through a Nemanja Vidić header. Next up were Chelsea, fellow members of the Big Four who had parted company with manager José Mourinho only two days earlier, following a run of poor form, appointing his assistant Avram Grant in his place. Chelsea's poor form continued into their next match, and the Reds claimed a 2–0 victory, goals from Carlos Tevez and Louis Saha coming at the end of each half. After eight games of the season, United had conceded just two goals, three less than at the same point in the previous season. However, the team was having trouble in front of goal, only scoring seven goals in the same eight games. This changed on 6 October, however, when United beat Wigan Athletic 4–0, followed by their 7th and 8th consecutive league wins, both 4–1, against Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, the latter being their fourth consecutive game in which they have scored four goals, the first time in 100 years they had done so. United then travelled to London where they played Arsenal, in a very media-hyped game, which ended 2–2 after a William Gallas equaliser for the Gunners in the last minute of stoppage time. Despite the Arsenal draw, United got back on track by beating Blackburn 2–0 the following week, as Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals in two minutes to secure the win. United's ten-game unbeaten streak in the league came to an end when they travelled to the Reebok Stadium to play Bolton Wanderers, who beat them 1–0 with an early Nicolas Anelka goal. United returned to winning ways immediately, winning their next five games, including one against arch-rivals Liverpool at Anfield, in which Carlos Tevez scored the only goal for a 1–0 win. United then completed a double over Merseyside teams in consecutive weeks with a 2–1 victory over Everton, both goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo, before completing a double over Sunderland in the Boxing Day fixture, winning 4–0. The Sunderland game saw Ronaldo score his ninth goal in his last seven Premier League appearances, to extend his lead at the top of the Premier League scoring table, while United welcomed Park Ji-sung back to the team following a nine-month lay-off with cruciate ligament damage. With Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick unavailable due to a viral infection, Carlos Tevez was given the opportunity to start the game on his return to his old club, West Ham United, on 29 December. United took the lead on 14 minutes thanks to a Cristiano Ronaldo header. Ronaldo had a chance to double the lead with a penalty in the 66th minute, but he blasted the free shot wide of the goal. West Ham capitalised on the error and, 10 minutes later, Rio Ferdinand's brother, Anton, headed home the equaliser. Then, just five minutes later, Matthew Upson scored the winner for the Hammers to complete a trio of headed goals on the day. The loss, combined with Arsenal's 4–1 defeat of Everton later in the day, meant that United finished 2007 in second place, with 18 games still to play. January–March The following game was a hard-fought 1–0 win over Birmingham City with the only goal coming from Carlos Tevez. Sir Alex Ferguson caused a minor controversy after the match, when he claimed that the atmosphere at Old Trafford was like a funeral. He later attempted to repair the damage when praising the away support when United went to Villa Park in the FA Cup Third Round on 5 January. The games against West Ham and Birmingham saw Ferguson endure a two-match touchline suspension, given following his complaints to the referee in the defeat at Bolton Wanderers. The next game was against manager-less Newcastle United and was played immediately after Arsenal had been held to a 1–1 draw by Birmingham City. United went into the game knowing that a win would put them top of the league on goal difference, but after dominating the first 45 minutes the score was still 0–0. However, in the second half, the goals started flowing; Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 49th minute with a free kick under the jumping wall. Carlos Tevez doubled the tally six minutes later, before Ronaldo scored again to make it three in the 70th minute. Rio Ferdinand scored a rare goal in the 85th minute, volleying home from a narrow angle. Youngster Danny Simpson had a couple of chances, but he was denied by some good goalkeeping by Shay Given. Then, in the last two minutes, Ronaldo scored his third for his first ever Manchester United hat-trick, and Tevez made it six in injury time. Newcastle's captain, former Red Alan Smith, earned himself a red card for his protests following the sixth goal. Wayne Rooney got himself on the scoresheet for the first time in three Premier League games the following weekend, scoring the opener in a 2–0 win over Reading. After a goalless first half, Rooney opened the scoring in the 77th minute, before Cristiano Ronaldo notched up his 23rd goal of the season to equal his tally for the previous season. The following game pitted United against Portsmouth at Old Trafford. With Arsenal having beaten Newcastle 3–0 the previous day, the onus was on United to pick up a win and go back to the top of the table. They started well, going 2–0 up within the first 15 minutes, but, despite what Sir Alex Ferguson claimed was one of the best performances of the season, they were unable to score again, and the game finished 2–0. Both goals were scored by Cristiano Ronaldo, who added the brace to the two he scored against Tottenham in the FA Cup the previous weekend, to take his total for the season to 27 goals in all competitions. The next game for the Reds was away to Tottenham. With Arsenal playing and winning again earlier in the day, a win was essential for United to go back to the top of the league. However, Tottenham did their North London rivals a massive favour by going ahead in the 21st minute. They should have gone two up soon after, but a poor shot from Berbatov was saved by Edwin van der Sar. Spurs defended well for the remainder of the game, but conceded a volleyed goal from Tevez, who had been largely anonymous for the entire game, in the last minute. The result meant that United were two points behind Arsenal at the top of the league, but still four ahead of Chelsea, who drew 1–1 with Portsmouth. Seven United players were booked in the game at Tottenham, meaning that the club was handed a £25,000 fine by the Football Association. This was the standard fine for any team that has six or more players booked during a game. However, had the same occurred again in the season, the fine would have been increased to £50,000. The week following the Tottenham game was spent in remembrance of the Munich air disaster, the 50th anniversary of which fell on 6 February 2008. United's home game against Manchester City on 10 February was preceded by a minute's silence in memory of those who died at Munich, and both teams wore special kits for the occasion; United wore a kit similar in design to the kit worn by the 1958 team, devoid of sponsors' logos and the club crest, while Manchester City also wore a kit without a sponsor's logo and with a black ribbon embroidered on the right shoulder. However, on a day intended to be all about the red half of Manchester, the team in blue took the lead after just 24 minutes. They then went 2–0 up just before half time, with debutant Benjani heading for goal. The Reds came out much stronger after the break, but were unable to score until the final minute, when Michael Carrick shot home from 18 yards. The next day, Arsenal beat Blackburn 2–0 to open up a five-point lead at the top of the table. However, the Gunners lead was cut back to three points two weeks later. Arsenal drew 2–2 with Birmingham in the Saturday's early kick-off, providing United with the opportunity to close the gap at the top of the table. They took the chance with great gusto, beating Newcastle 5–1, the second time in the season that a fixture between the two clubs had produced six goals. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring for the Red Devils, before Cristiano Ronaldo doubled the lead just before half-time. He then extended the lead to 3–0 11 minutes into the second half with his 29th goal of the season. Newcastle clawed one back ten minutes from time, but United replied immediately through Rooney, and Louis Saha finished the game off in the final minute with what turned out to be the French player's final goal for the club before being sold to Everton in the summer. The Premier League's top three kicked off simultaneously on 1 March. United were first off the mark, as Owen Hargreaves scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt to put the Reds 1–0 up against Fulham. Chelsea then went 3–0 up against West Ham in the space of five minutes, before Arsenal went 1–0 down to Aston Villa via a Philippe Senderos own goal. United were next to score, Park Ji-sung doubling their lead. Chelsea got a fourth goal in the 64th minute of their match, before a Simon Davies own goal stretched United's lead to three goals. However, just when it looked like United would be returning to the top of the table for the first time in a month, Arsenal snatched a late equaliser to remain a point clear at the top. With 10 games left in the season, United's goal difference seven goals better than Arsenal's, and Chelsea still only six points off the top two, this set up what was billed as one of the closest title races in recent years. Following their exit from the FA Cup the previous weekend, a trip to Pride Park to play bottom-placed Derby County on 15 March looked to be the perfect opportunity for the Red Devils to bounce back and show their title credentials. However, the game did not prove as simple as one would have expected, as United had to work hard for their narrow 1–0 victory. As was the case with many of Manchester United's games in the 2007–08 season, luck was not on their side in the opening exchanges of the game. United goalkeeper Ben Foster, making his debut due to the unavailability of Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak, then staked his claim to the number 1 jersey with a pair of fine saves from Derby striker Kenny Miller. Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be the thorn in Derby's side on a number of occasions, testing former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a curling effort hit with the outside of his foot and a 40-yard free kick. The breakthrough finally came in the 76th minute, Ronaldo scoring a deserved goal from a Wayne Rooney cross. With Arsenal only managing a draw against ten-man Middlesbrough in the day's late kick-off, United's win put them on top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand. That game in hand was played four days later, with United playing host to Bolton Wanderers on 19 March. Man Utd started the game at their usual fast pace, and it took just nine minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo, the team's captain for the day, to find the back of the net after Carlos Tevez's poorly hit bicycle kick was saved. That goal brought Ronaldo level with George Best's record of 32 goals from midfield in a season, but only ten minutes later, the record was broken. Fouled about 10 yards outside the penalty area, Ronaldo set himself up for one of his trademark free kicks; one dipping shot later, the score was 2–0. The tone of the game changed from that point on, as United began to relax into a groove, but, as has happened so many times this season, despite the threat of a high-scoring game, no more goals were to come. Both teams posed threats to the other's goal, with Bolton managing to get the ball into the Manchester United net twice in the second half, only to have the goals ruled out for various reasons, while both Nani and Carlos Tevez wasted as many chances between them as the rest of the United team put together. Nevertheless, the win put United three points clear at the top of the table with eight games left to play. With matches between Manchester United and Liverpool and Chelsea and Arsenal scheduled, 23 March 2008 was dubbed \\"Grand Slam Sunday\\" by Sky Sports. Manchester United kicked off the day's action, knowing that they could put pressure on both Arsenal and Chelsea by winning. However, the Red Devils took a while to get into their stride and Liverpool controlled the first ten minutes. Still, it was United who created the first chance of the game, although Wayne Rooney was unable to beat Pepe Reina after Anderson's through-ball. A few minutes later, Javier Mascherano was booked for a reckless challenge on Paul Scholes. The Argentinian was unimpressed, and continued to contest referee Steve Bennett's decisions as the game went on. The first goal of the game came in the 34th minute, through the most unlikely of goalscorers. After robbing Steven Gerrard of the ball two-thirds of the way up the field, Wes Brown continued his run into the Liverpool box, and found himself on the end of Wayne Rooney's cross, heading past a less than confident Reina. Then, a few minutes before half- time, Liverpool were awarded a free-kick just inside the United half. Believing that Paul Scholes deserved a yellow card for the challenge, Fernando Torres remonstrated with referee Bennett, for which he earned himself a yellow card. Incensed by his teammate's punishment, Mascherano rushed in to make his own protest. The referee, though, was not very receptive to Mascherano's protest, and gave him a second yellow card for dissent, sending him off. With Liverpool down to ten men, Manchester United were now able to control the tempo of the game as they wished. The Red Devils pushed forward in search of a second goal, and Liverpool continued to weather the storm, but, with 10 minutes to go, United finally found the goal they were looking for. Nani, just on as a substitute, took a corner from the left hand side, which Cristiano Ronaldo headed in from seven yards; his first goal against Liverpool. Then, two minutes later, Nani combined well with Wayne Rooney, playing a one-two with the striker, before firing the ball home from 20 yards to make the final score 3–0. The win put United six points ahead of Arsenal with seven games left to play, and meant the Gunners had to win their match against Chelsea later that afternoon. Chelsea, however, came from behind to pull off a 2–1 victory. This propelled Chelsea into second place, five points behind Manchester United. Man Utd's game against Aston Villa was the late kick-off on 29 March, which allowed Arsenal to pull back United's lead in the league to just three points with a 3–2 win over Bolton. This meant that the Red Devils would have to win to restore their six-point lead over Arsenal; and win they did, as they put four goals past Martin O'Neill's side. Villa were first to threaten either goal, but it took just 16 minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo to get the opener, back-heeling the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and past Scott Carson in the Villa goal. Ronaldo then turned provider for the second goal on 33 minutes, Carlos Tevez heading home the Portuguese's cross at the back post. The loudest cheers of the game, though, did not come until after half-time, as Wayne Rooney, who had not scored at Old Trafford since October, bagged a brace. Ronaldo supplied the first, back-heeling the ball to the England striker, who rounded Carson before passing the ball into the net. Ronaldo then provided the assist for Rooney's second, nutmegging an Aston Villa defender to play Rooney in. Heartened by his first goal in six games, Rooney finished the move with a cool shot, beating Carson on his near post. Rooney almost made it a hat-trick a few minutes later, but he was deemed to be marginally offside at the time of Owen Hargreaves' cross. April–May United were chosen to play on the Sunday of the following weekend, allowing the two chasing teams, Arsenal and Chelsea, to close the gap at the top. Arsenal played first, but could only draw with Liverpool, while Chelsea managed a 2–0 victory over Manchester City in the 3 o'clock kickoff. That closed the gap at the top to two points, putting pressure on United to pick up points against Middlesbrough, who are often regarded as one of their \\"bogey teams\\" in recent years. The Red Devils started well, and were 1–0 up within 10 minutes after Ronaldo stabbed home Michael Carrick's square ball across the six-yard box. United continued to make chances, and looked to be coasting to a comfortable victory until Afonso Alves netted his first goal in English football after 35 minutes. The Brazilian bagged his second ten minutes into the second half, and things looked desperate for United. Worse still, after 70 minutes, with United already missing Nemanja Vidić through injury, Rio Ferdinand looked to have picked up an injury himself and was replaced by Gerard Piqué. It was Piqué's fellow substitute, Park Ji-sung, who fashioned the equaliser, though, as he checked back inside Andrew Taylor before squaring the ball to Wayne Rooney, whose deflected shot found its way past Mark Schwarzer in the Middlesbrough goal. United continued to press forward in search of the winner to take the gap at the top of the table back to five points, but almost gave away a goal in the process. Van der Sar capped a solid display by blocking Tuncay's late effort. The Red Devils' next game was against Arsenal the following Sunday, in a six-pointer that would either rule Arsenal out of the title race or bring them right back into it. A United win would put them six points ahead of their nearest league rivals, Chelsea, and nine ahead of Arsenal, and with Chelsea playing the following day, a win was essential to put pressure on the Blues. Arsenal started the match well, and looked to take the game to United through sheer brute force, attacking with pace and power. Indeed, they created the best chances of the half, United's best opportunity falling to Wayne Rooney, who refused to go down under the challenge of Kolo Touré, before seeing his shot saved by the foot of Jens Lehmann in a one-on-one situation. The first half finished goalless, but it was not long into the second half before the crowd saw the first goal of the game. It was a controversial goal, however, as it seemed that Emmanuel Adebayor had played Cesc Fàbregas' cross into the net with his left arm. Nevertheless, referee Howard Webb gave the goal, seeing nothing wrong with it. Just five minutes later, though, United hit back. Michael Carrick played the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where it was handled by William Gallas, and the referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. As expected, Cristiano Ronaldo took responsibility for the penalty, and coolly swept it into the left side of the net. However, he was made to take the kick again as Park Ji-sung was deemed to be encroaching on the penalty area before the kick. Ronaldo was just as successful with his second attempt, burying the ball in the bottom left-hand corner. In an attempt to force the issue by going for the winner, Alex Ferguson brought on Carlos Tevez and Anderson in place of Park and Scholes. The Reds were cutting it fine, as Van der Sar was forced to make two reflex saves from his own defenders, Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand. Tevez then sent a warning shot across the Arsenal bow, shooting narrowly wide from 25 yards. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Patrice Evra was brought down just outside the Arsenal box. With the Arsenal defence expecting a typical Ronaldo free-kick, they were caught off guard when Owen Hargreaves played an immaculate free-kick over the wall, dipping into the bottom left corner of the goal, leaving Lehmann rooted to his goal line. United continued to press, not giving Arsenal an inch, and though Van der Sar was called on to save a header from Nicklas Bendtner, the Red Devils managed to hold onto their lead and extend their lead at the top of the table. Chelsea, now the only team with a realistic chance of stopping United winning the title failed to reduce the lead to three points the following day, only managing a 1–1 draw at home to Wigan Athletic. They followed this up with a 1–0 win over Everton the following Thursday, reducing the lead to two points with just three games remaining, although United now had a game in hand. On 19 April, Blackburn Rovers welcomed Manchester United to Ewood Park, where the Red Devils had only managed to win once in their last eight visits. With Chelsea having beaten Everton two days earlier, United went into the game only two points of ahead of the Blues, which meant that defeat against Blackburn would give Chelsea the opportunity to leapfrog United in the teams' meeting the following weekend. Despite a promising start, United fell behind in the 21st minute thanks to a Roque Santa Cruz goal – his 16th of the season. United had dominated large parts of the match, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Finally, with just two minutes left in normal time, Carlos Tevez headed home from Paul Scholes' flick-on to salvage a crucial point for United in the championship race. If United were to beat Chelsea in their next match, they would then require just one point from their remaining two games to secure the title. If they failed to win at Stamford Bridge, however, they would need to win both of their remaining games. And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea side that had had an extra day to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming off the back of a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be substituted early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first real chance, but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18 yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half- time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor back pass from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech into the corner of the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points. The first of United's last two games was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United got off to a great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a deflected shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were looking to be settling into a rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when he got back to his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30 yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball nestled in the bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to the last day of the season for the first time since 1999. Manchester United went to Wigan on the final day of the season, knowing that they needed only to equal or better Chelsea's result against Bolton in order to be Premier League champions, due to their superior goal difference. Wayne Rooney was named in the United starting lineup despite concerns over his fitness, while Nemanja Vidić made a return to the side for the first time since his concussion against Chelsea. Wigan started the game with an aggressive mentality, closing down the United players at every opportunity. Paul Scholes was booked early on for a tackle from behind on Wilson Palacios, but the Latics then had a penalty shout turned down in the 24th minute, when a Jason Koumas shot appeared to deflect off Rio Ferdinand's outstretched upper arm. Wigan's anguish was then compounded when referee Steve Bennett awarded United a penalty for Emmerson Boyce's foul on Wayne Rooney. Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up to take the penalty, which he converted, equalling Alan Shearer's record for the most goals in a 38-game season with 31 goals. Soon after, Scholes was fortunate not to be sent off when he cynically brought down Wilson Palacios. Steve Bennett chose to keep his cards in his pocket. In the second half, United continued to test the Wigan goal, but goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was up to the task, producing a number of good saves. Paul Scholes was brought down in the box by Titus Bramble early in the half, but the referee was not positioned well enough to be able to give it. With 25 minutes to go, Alex Ferguson brought on Owen Hargreaves to shore up the defence, and Ryan Giggs, who equalled Bobby Charlton's club appearance record with his 758th appearance in a United shirt. Fittingly, it was Giggs who got United's second goal of the game, slotting the ball past Kirkland after Wayne Rooney played him in with a slide-rule pass. A last-minute equaliser by Bolton against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge ensured that United's championship did not have to be decided by goal difference, and it left the Red Devils as the champions of England for the 17th time, just one short of Liverpool's record of 18 titles.

The match was played at Villa Park on 5 January 2008, United winning 2–0 with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. United were given a home draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the Fourth Round and won the game 3–1. After going a goal down to a Robbie Keane strike, United drew level with Carlos Tevez, before Cristiano Ronaldo scored the other two goals; one a penalty after Michael Dawson was sent off for a deliberate handball. The Fifth Round draw was held on 28 January 2008, with United facing the possibility of drawing one of five other Premier League clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. As it was, United drew Arsenal, pitting the current top two teams in the Premier League against each other in the only all-Premier League tie of the round. The match was played on 16 February 2008, with United running out as 4–0 winners, the goals coming from Rooney, Darren Fletcher (2), and Nani. The draw for the Sixth Round took place on 18 February 2008, and drew United at home against Portsmouth. The tie, which was the only all-Premier League tie of the round, was played on 8 March 2008. United went into the game with the prospect of another Treble still on the cards, and started the match full of confidence. However, when the referee, Martin Atkinson, failed to award the Red Devils a penalty in the seventh minute after Sylvain Distin clearly bodychecked Cristiano Ronaldo, it was clear that it was not to be United's day. United continued to produce the better of the chances in the first half – Portsmouth's best effort was a swerving 25-yarder from Pedro Mendes that tested Van der Sar to the extent that the Dutch keeper injured himself and had to be substituted at half-time. United's chances continued to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper only to be tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James before things went from bad to worse for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two- on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had no hesitation in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having gotten back behind the ball before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, but that would have left United without a recognised centre- forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup. {  - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F–A !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 5 January 2008 Round 3 Aston Villa A 2–0 Ronaldo 81', Rooney 89' 33,630 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 27 January 2008 Round 4 Tottenham Hotspur H 3–1 Tevez 38', Ronaldo (2) 69' (pen.), 88' 75,369 - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 16 February 2008 Round 5 Arsenal H 4–0 Rooney 16', Fletcher (2) 20', 74', Nani 38' 75,550 - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 8 March 2008 Round 6 Portsmouth H 0–1  75,463 } ==League Cup== United played their only League Cup game of the season when they lost 2–0 at home to Coventry City, both goals scored by Michael Mifsud. Two players – Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson – made their first team debuts in the match, while a further six players made their first starts of the season. {  - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F–A !Scorers !Attendance - bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" 26 September 2007 Round 3 Coventry City H 0–2  74,055 } ==UEFA Champions League== Group stage United were drawn into a group with Sporting CP, the previous club of Cristiano Ronaldo and new signing Nani, Dynamo Kyiv, and Roma, who suffered a huge 7–1 loss to the Red Devils in the 2006–07 season. United started their Champions League campaign with a 1–0 win against Sporting, which they followed up with another 1–0 win, this time against Roma. United's winning streak in Europe continued when they won their match against Dynamo Kyiv 4–2 in Ukraine, with goals coming from Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo (2). United sealed their place in the knockout stage with a 4–0 win in the return game against Dynamo Kyiv, with goals from Carlos Tevez, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, while Gerard Piqué got his first ever senior goal for the club. The team went into the next game against Sporting knowing that a win would secure top spot for them. However, they went 1–0 down after just 21 minutes through an unexpected goal from Abel Ferreira. It took United another 40 minutes to get an equaliser, as Carlos Tevez scored a scrappy goal in the 61st minute. Just when it looked like United were about to settle for a draw, they won a free kick in the 92nd minute. Up stepped Cristiano Ronaldo, who lashed the free kick into the far top corner of the net to win the match 2–1. That left the final game in the group without consequence, and so Sir Alex took a youthful squad with him to Rome, including six players yet to make their senior debuts for the club. Although none of the six made the starting line-up, it was another of United's youth players, Piqué, who scored the opening goal in the 34th minute. However, the Reds were denied maximum points from the group stage by a 71st-minute goal from Mancini. Nevertheless, the 16 points they did pick up in the six games was the most of any team in the group stage. {  - !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F–A !Scorers !Attendance !Group position - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 19 September 2007 Sporting CP A 1–0 Ronaldo 62' 41,510 2nd - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 2 October 2007 Roma H 1–0 Rooney 70' 73,652 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 23 October 2007 Dynamo Kyiv A 4–2 Ferdinand 10', Rooney 18', Ronaldo (2) 41', 68' (pen.) 42,000 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 7 November 2007 Dynamo Kyiv H 4–0 Piqué 31', Tevez 37', Rooney 76', Ronaldo 88' 75,017 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" 27 November 2007 Sporting CP H 2–1 Tevez 61', Ronaldo 90+2' 75,162 1st - bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" 12 December 2007 Roma A 1–1 Piqué 34' 29,490 1st } Knockout phase The first knockout round draw took place on 21 December, and paired Manchester United with Lyon of France. The last (and only) time United were paired with Lyon was in the group stage of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, in which the away tie finished as a 2–2 draw, while United won the home leg 2–1. The away leg was played on 20 February, and saw Lyon go 1–0 up in the 54th minute, through a Karim Benzema shot that went in off the post. Carlos Tevez rectified the situation in the 87th minute, pulling United level to make sure that the Red Devils were in half-decent shape for the return leg on 4 March. Manchester United started the second leg brightly, probing the Lyon defence for gaps, but to no avail as Lyon gradually fought their way back into the game, knowing they had to score at least once to qualify for the quarter-finals. However, as half-time approached, Wes Brown made an overlapping run, before delivering a cross that found its way to Anderson on the edge of the area. The Brazilian side-footed the ball goalwards, and the ball broke to Cristiano Ronaldo who fired the ball home from an ever-narrowing angle. However, no more goals were to come, Lyon's Kader Keïta coming the closest as he hit the post in the 74th minute. Nevertheless, United qualified for the quarter-finals, the first leg to be played on either 1 April or 2 April. The draw for the quarter-finals, semi- finals and final of the Champions League was held on 14 March 2008. Despite English teams making up half of the numbers in the draw, United were drawn with A.S. Roma. This tie will see the fifth and sixth times that the Red Devils have played against their Italian rivals in the last 12 months; the previous four matches resulted in two wins, a draw and a loss, including United's Champions League record 7–1 win in the 2006–07 quarter-final. The winner of this quarter-final would meet either Schalke or Barcelona in the semi-finals, before facing Arsenal, Liverpool, Fenerbahçe or Chelsea in the final, setting up the prospect of an all-English final. The first leg of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the captaincy and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick was able to take his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half-hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the cushion of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along the floor. On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April. United went into the second leg with a couple of injury concerns in the centre of their defence. Nemanja Vidić was still carrying an injury from the first leg, while Rio Ferdinand had a suspected foot injury that he picked up in the Reds' match against Middlesbrough at the weekend. Nevertheless, Ferdinand was deemed to be fit enough to start the match, and lined up alongside Gerard Piqué in the centre of defence. Mikaël Silvestre also found a place in the starting lineup, making his first start for nearly seven months, following a knee ligament injury, and Gary Neville also made a return to the first team squad, being selected on the bench. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes were left on the bench, as Alex Ferguson obviously had an eye on the following weekend's match against Arsenal. Manchester United started the match brightly, creating numerous opportunities in the first few minutes. However, on the half-hour, the referee Tom Henning Øvrebø awarded the visiting side a penalty for a trip on Mancini by Wes Brown, which Daniele De Rossi stepped up to take. Live action replays however showed no contact between Brown and Mancini. The Italian midfielder blazed the ball over the crossbar, wasting what would end up being Roma's best chance of getting back into the tie. Roma started the second half strongly, creating a couple of chances in the first 15 minutes of the second half, including a Rodrigo Taddei effort that forced a last-ditch block from Mikaël Silvestre. Still, United weathered the early storm and, with 20 minutes of the match to go, put the tie beyond reasonable doubt through Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian powered past a pair of Roma defenders, before playing the ball to Owen Hargreaves on the right wing. Tevez continued his run into the box, before finishing with a glancing header off Hargreaves' inch- perfect cross. The day was made complete in the 81st minute, when Alex Ferguson brought Anderson off to be replaced by Gary Neville, who immediately took over the captaincy, albeit in central midfield, rather than his preferred right-back slot. Neville's every touch was greeted with cheers from the United fans, who had had to wait 13 months for their captain to take to the field again after a succession of injuries. Park Ji-sung had an effort saved late on, but the match was concluded soon after, and United could now look forward to their semi-final first leg away to Barcelona on 23 April. Barcelona were the only team other than United to remain unbeaten in the Champions League up to the semi-finals this season. The win over Roma was the 11th consecutive home victory in the Champions League for United, setting a new record for the competition. Both teams went into the semi-final first leg with identical records in this season's Champions League, each having won eight games and drawn two, while scoring 18 goals and conceding five. United were awarded a penalty three minutes into the game, after Gabriel Milito handled Cristiano Ronaldo's header from a corner. Ronaldo himself stepped up to take the kick, but, despite sending Víctor Valdés the wrong way, smacked his shot against the post. The missed penalty seemed to give Barcelona the extra impetus they needed, and they began to take control of the game. Just before the half-hour, Ronaldo made a break into the Barça penalty area, only to be bodychecked by Rafael Márquez, who made no attempt to get to the ball. Rightfully expecting another penalty to be awarded, the look of dismay on Ronaldo's face was justified when he saw referee Massimo Busacca wave play on. Márquez fouled Ronaldo again just before half time, this time about 25 yards from goal. Márquez was shown a yellow card for his trouble, which meant he was ineligible for the second leg on 29 April, but Ronaldo saw his resulting free kick go just a yard wide of the far post. A number of saves from Van der Sar and a Michael Carrick block kept Barcelona at bay, while Carrick himself came close to scoring at the other end, rippling the side-netting after making space for himself on the left side of the penalty area. The match finished as a scoreless draw, with Barcelona having had the better of the possession, but with the second leg being played at Old Trafford, United had every reason to be confident. During the second leg, Old Trafford hosted a very emotive night in which the home crowd vociferously supported United as they worked to achieve a place in the final. Following a shaky start (including Paul Scholes fouling Lionel Messi on the very edge of the penalty area within the first 45 seconds), United took the lead courtesy of an outstanding goal by Paul Scholes in the 14th minute. Despite surrendering huge swathes of possession to Barcelona, United nearly extended their lead shortly before half time, Nani heading wide from a good cross from Park Ji-sung. The second half of the match saw a challenging Barcelona that simply failed to get a vital away goal, mostly thanks to a very good defensive work by the Red Devils, the game ending 1–0. The win increased the number of consecutive home wins in the Champions League to a record 12, the previous record having stood at 10, and qualified United for their third European Cup final. With Chelsea beating Liverpool in the other semi-final, it set up the European Cup's first ever all-English final, to be played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 21 May 2008. United had the run of the play in the first half of the final, dominating Chelsea in terms of possession, and took the lead in the 26th minute through a Cristiano Ronaldo header off a Wes Brown cross. However, in the last minute of the first half, a ball into the United box was deflected to Frank Lampard, who capitalised on a slip by Van der Sar to equalise for the Londoners. The second half was much more even, but no further goals were scored and the match went to extra time. Midway through the second half of extra time, a large incident involving Carlos Tevez and John Terry kicked off. In the ensuing melée, the referee spotted a slap on Nemanja Vidić by Didier Drogba, and had no hesitation in sending the Ivorian international off. Despite the man advantage, United were unable to find a winner and the match went to penalties. Both teams converted their first two penalties, but then the most unlikely of players missed his – Cristiano Ronaldo, who stepped up with his usual self-confidence, could only stare on as Petr Čech saved his shot. Just when the match looked lost, John Terry stepped up for the Blues, only for his standing foot to give way as he struck his shot and the ball hit the post. This took the match to sudden death penalties, though only two further rounds were required. Ryan Giggs scored United's seventh penalty, meaning that Nicolas Anelka had to score in order to keep Chelsea in the game. His shot, however, was poorly struck, and at the perfect height for United's Dutch goalkeeper to save, granting United their third European Cup title. {  - !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F–A !Scorers !Attendance -

A virus belonging to the potyvirus group known as the peanut green mosaic virus can be observed in the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh, India. Infection can be seen across groundnut, French bean, and soy bean plants. Three virus isolates produced different symptoms within the host. Based on tests performed on Phaseolus vulgaris or green beans, it was concluded that all three strains cause local lesions on inoculated leaves. However, one virus caused a non-systemic infection (NS), another caused systemic mosaic (SM), and the third caused systemic venial necrosis (SN). Infection is predominantly established in young leaflets. NS strains produced light and dark spots on its host, but no effect on growth and leaflet size observed. SM strains produced chlorotic spots and did impair leaflet size and plant growth. SN strains produced severe vein clearing and impaired growth in leaflet and plant size. Various types of antisera work on this virus.Reddy, D. V.

As with other members of this virus family, PeMoV is a flexuous filamentous virus with particles 740-750 nm long. It is transmitted by several species of aphids and by mechanical inoculation. It was first given its name in 1965 when it was isolated from peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) in Georgia, USA. This virus was found to be seed transmitted in this host.Kuhn, C.W. (1965) Symptomalogy, Host Range, and Effect on Yield of a Seed-Transmitted Peanut Virus.Phytopathology 55:880-884. ==Host species== Besides peanuts, this virus is known to infect soybeans (Glycine max), French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), peas (Pisum sativum), and various weed species of Cassia. Since 1964 it has been identified in East Arica and north-east Australia (in bean) and possible Venezuela, Japan, Malaysia and Bulgaria. Given the fact that PeMoV is seed transmissible in peanut, the virus could occur anywhere peanuts are grown. In the United States, for example, a survey done in 1975 found the virus in all states where peanuts were grown.Demski, J. W., Smith, D.H., and Kuhn, C.W. (1975) Incidence and Distribution of Peanut Mottle Virus in Peanut in the United States. Peanut Science 2:91-93. ==Symptoms== The symptoms of this virus in peanuts appear as irregular dark islands on young leaves. The symptoms are not as clear on older leaves and thus can be easily missed even when the virus is in epidemic proportions in the field. In infected plant cells, the virus makes characteristic potyvirus cylindrical inclusions.http://www.freshfromflorida.com/Divisions-Offices/Plant- Industry/Science/Florida-Plant-Viruses-And-Their-Inclusions/Florida-Plant- Viruses-And-Their-Inclusions/Peanut-Mot that are visible in the light microscope with proper staining. ==Disease control== An interesting study of the spread of this virus in Georgia showed that the virus moved from infected peanut plants to nearby soybean fields and was only present in soybeans in areas where peanuts were also grown.Demski, J.W. (1975) Source and Spread of Peanut Mottle Virus in Soybean and Peanut. Phytopathology 65:917-920 Thus, the recommended approach to control this virus in peanuts and other susceptible hosts such as soybean is the planting of PeMoV-free seed. In 2007 PeMoV was reported for the first time to infect Rhizoma peanuts (A. glabrata) in Georgia.Nischwitz, C., Maas, A.L., Mullis. S.W., Culbreath, A.K. and Gitaitis, R.D. (2007) First Report of Peanut mottle virus in Forage Peanuts (Arachis glabrata) in North America, Plant Disease 91:632. http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS-91-5-0632A This plant is propagated by cuttings and is a perennial crop. To avoid spread, growers of this perennial plant will have to maintain virus free stock and destroy infected fields. If this virus spreads in perennial peanuts in the Southern USA, this plant could become a reservoir of the virus and increase its spread to field peanut and soybean via aphid transmission.

It is situated in the south-west part of Kunduz Province and has borders with Qalay-I-Zal District to the north-west, Kunduz District to the north-east, Ali Abad District to the south-east, Baghlan Province to the south and Samangan Province to the south-west. ==Population== The population of Chardara District is 65,100 (2006), accounting for approximately 8% of the population of Kunduz Province. Its ethnic make-up is 55% Pashtun, 25% Tajik, 12% Uzbek and 8% Turkmen. Most of this population lives in villages or farms in the north-west portion of the district along the south-west bank of the Kunduz River. This land is cultivated and accounts for approximately 15% of the area of the Chardara District. The remaining land in the district to the south-west comprises desert highlands that are mostly uninhabitable. ==Geography== The Kunduz River valley is the dominant terrain feature in Kunduz Province, and the river forms a natural north-eastern boundary between Chardara District and Kunduz District. The river, along with a major tributary and derivative canals provide irrigation to the single crop cultivation fields that dominate land usage in the north-eastern portion of Chardara District. The district also has some dual crop fields. ==War in Afghanistan (2001–present)== When the Taliban were ousted from the Kunduz Province in 2001, parts of the Chardara District were badly damaged. The district remained relatively peaceful until 2008, when Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked insurgents, including Uzbeks and Chechens, began reappearing in the northern part of the country. In Kunduz Province, they established their main foothold in Chardara District and are able to operate openly for the most part. Beginning in April 2009, German and Afghan troops based in Kunduz made several attempts to combat the rising presence of militants in the Chardara District. In July 2009, German soldiers launched their biggest military operation since World War II, to displace the militants from the district. Their operations were largely viewed as unsuccessful as the militants were not ousted from Chardara. In September 2009, at least 70 people were killed near Haji Aman in Chardara District when NATO aircraft struck two oil-tankers hijacked by Taliban insurgents. On 17 November 2009 it was reported that 4 security guards were killed in a battle with militants as they attacked Sediqi Construction Company. 1 Militant was also killed.\\" 4 security guards of construction company killed in N Afghanistan\\" Xinhua News.

It is caused by members of the plant virus genus Tobamovirus- otherwise known as the tobacco mosaic virus family. Tobamovirus are viruses that contain positive sense RNA genomes that infect plants. Symptoms of the disease vary depending on the cultivar. Typical symptoms include the chlorosis of leaves, stunting, and distorted and lumpy fruiting structures. The virus is spread by mechanical transmission and infected seeds. Avoidance is the best means of controlling the disease because once a plant is infected it cannot be treated. Only seeds that have been tested and treated for the pathogen should be planted.Plant Pathology Fact Sheet: Pepper mild mottle virus http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00001690/00001 ==History== The origin of PMMoV has been linked to Tomato mosaic virus, as they both reside in the Tobacco mosaic virus family. The Tunisian Journal of Plant Protection brought about the link between PMMoV to ToMV from a French study dating back to 1964. ToMV affects a wide range of Solanaceous crops and a strain of this virus likely mutated into PMMoV. ==Host and Symptoms== rigid rod shape of Tobamovirus Healthy Peppers Pepper mild mottle virus is the major viral pathogen of peppers (Capsicum spp.). The host range of PMMoV include most cultivars and species of pepper (Capsicum spp.). This virus strain does not infect tomato, eggplant, or tobacco; however, other members of the genus Tobamovirus can infect these other hostshttp://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/cv275 PMMoV is one of at least 4 different species of Tobamovirus that infect peppers. The others include Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV). Diseased Peppers This pathogen is known to occur throughout the world and it frequently results in significant crop losses or reductions in both field and greenhouse plantings. The virus has been identified in places like Australia, Japan, China, Taiwan, Europe, and North Africa. Since 1997, PMMoV has been the cause of many major outbreaks in the southeastern states namely Georgia and Florida. Symptoms caused by this pathogen vary based on the specific host cultivar; however, a majority of the symptoms are very similar between the different hosts. Symptoms usually include various degrees of mottling, chlorosis, curling, dwarfing, and distortion of the fruit, leaves, and even whole plants. The symptoms on fruit include: a reduction in size, mottling and color changes, and an obvious distorted and lumpy appearance. Also, many times brown necrotic streaks or splotches can be seen on the leaves and fruit. The symptoms can easily be seen on new growth, and they are far more pronounced if the plant was infected when it was young rather than when it was older. This disease is harmful because of the mild foliar symptoms (chlorosis, necrosis, etc.) and due to this many times the pathogen goes unnoticed until the more evident symptoms on the fruit appear. This is why there are higher yield losses because symptoms only become evident during the fruiting stage right before the crops are supposed to harvested.\\"Peppers, Tomatoes, and Tobamoviruses\\" Plant Pathology Circular No. 400 (2000) http://www.freshfromflorida.com/content/download/11406/144732/pp400.pdf ==Disease Transmission== PMMoV is a rigid rod shaped virus pathogen that can be easily transmitted to healthy plants via mechanical inoculation or contact between plants or another medium that can carry the pathogen such as hands, gloves, and clothing. The virus is commonly found on the outer seed coat and very rarely in the endosperm of seeds of the infected plants. Being seedborne, the virus primarily infects through mechanical contamination during seed transplanting and other agricultural procedures. It enters the plant/seed through microscopic abrasions or wounds. The virus is in vitro, which in this case means it can survive in an isolated environment, and being highly infectious it can easily be transmitted during normal crop maintenance. PMMoV is exceptionally stable and it is known to survive for extended periods of time in plant debris and on greenhouse structures, pots, and horticultural tools. There are no known insect vectors; however, humans can be considered the main vector for this pathogen. ==Environment== This virus is widespread and is found almost anywhere peppers are grown, this is because the virus is most often introduced with the pepper seed. The virus moves long distances on the seed and moves short distances via plant-to-plant contact, handling of plants by contaminated implements and workers aids in the spread of the virus.\\"Pepper Mild Mottle Virus.\\" American Vegetable Grower, 59.9 (2011): 30. Soils with low organic matter content, specifically humus will much more readily promote the adsorption of PMMoV. Specifically, the allophanic clays and iron minerals in these soils will promote the adsorption of PMMoV. Disease incidence has occurred mainly in greenhouse environments and hot, humid environments like southwest and southeast Florida and in regions like North Africa, and Japan. This is an indication of the type of soil that is optimal for the virus; warm or hot and humid. Greenhouses, specifically, are an ideal production environment for rapid spread of the disease. ==Prevention, control and management== Structure of Methyl Bromide- Used until 2005 when it was banned by the Montreal Protocol Up until 2005, the primary means of prevention was a pre-plant treatment of Bromomethane or methyl bromide. The import and production of this fumigation chemical was banned under the Montreal Protocol. A modern organic method of prevention was found by a Japanese study on soil adsorptions role in the adsorption of PMMoV. The study found that increased humus content in a soil will have an inhibitory effect on PMMoV adsorption. As with all plant viruses, but especially with those in the genus Tobamovirus, avoidance is the best means of control. Growers must practice good sanitation procedures and only plant clean seeds. Growers must also use caution when handling plants, plants with abrasions or wounds give the virus an opportunity to enter the tissue of the plant. There are no chemical or biological control methods that can be used to control the disease once the plant is infected. Though often a challenge, accurate identification of PMMoV is key to successful control of the disease. (See reference 7 for a detailed description of control measures for this virus.) Diseased plant material will remain infectious until completely broken down. Tillage, increased irrigation, and high temperatures encourage the breakdown of plant material in the soil. Any infected plant material in the soil can serve as a source of inoculum for subsequent crops so crop rotation should be practiced, if possible. Volunteer peppers and weeds, particularly those in the family Solanaceae (such as nightshades), should be removed to reduce possible sources of infections. Due to the fact that smoke can spread the disease, burial or composting of the diseased plants should be implemented rather than burning. The composted diseased plant remains should not be used on a pepper crop or other Solanaceous crops. ==Importance== Controlling this virus is important for pepper production worldwide, but recent research shows that this plant disease may be transmitted to humans. A French study identified a local source of PMMoV and linked the presence of PMMoV RNA in stool with a specific immune response and clinical symptoms. Although clinical symptoms may be imputable to another co-factor, including spicy food, the data in the study suggested the possibility of a direct or indirect pathogenic role of plant viruses in humans. In an article from the Applied and Environmental Microbiology Journal, it was found that PMMoV could be a potential indicator of fecal pollution. Their results demonstrate that PMMoV is widespread and abundant in wastewater from the United States, suggesting the utility of this virus as an indicator of human fecal pollution. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV in raw sewage, treated wastewater, seawater exposed to wastewater, and fecal samples and/or intestinal homogenates from a wide variety of animals. PMMoV was present in all wastewater samples at concentrations greater than 1 million copies per milliliter of raw sewage. Though there have been no outbreaks in humans, the transmittance of this plant virus to humans has created a discussion on the viability of humans as vectors for plant viruses. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Tobamovirus Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Pepper mild mottle virus"},{"id":"12386330","text":"Pepper mild tigré virus (PepMTV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Geminiviridae.

Reptr. 56 586, 1972 Up until then, the two most important potyviruses infecting peppers in the US were Tobacco etch virus (TEV) and Potato virus Y (PVY). By 1975 it was clear that a third potyvirus, PepMoV (PeMV), was contributing to crop losses in pepper growing areas of the United States. It has also been found in California, New Mexico, Texas, and in Central America (El Salvador) (3). In 2003, it was reported in C. annuum in Japan. This virus infects many species of Solanaceae, including several species of Capsicum (i.e. C. annuum, C. frutescens), Datura spp., Lycopersicon esculentum, Physalis floriana, tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and nightshade (Solanum sp.) (2,4). It was its reaction on C. frutescens (Tabasco pepper) that alerted researchers to the presence of a new virus in peppers. ==Symptoms and Diagnosis== Symptoms of PepMoV on pepper include dark green vein banding, mottle/mosaic, puckered or crinkled leaves, and misshapen fruit. Plants infected early in the growing season can be stunted and the virus can decrease yield significantly. (See pictures of symptoms) Surveys have shown that PepMoV can often occur in mixed infections with TEV and/or PVY so a technique such as ELISA must be used to differentiate these three virus in pepper. Antiserum is available for all three potyviruses, as are primers for PCR tests and sequencing. PepMoV makes two types of inclusions in infected cells, the typical cylindrical inclusions (CI) and an amorphous inclusion (AI). Thus leaf strips stained with the protein stain, OG, and the nucleic acid stain, AA, can be used to identify this virus in pepper. The CI only stains in OG while the AI stains in both stains.

Putin was also Prime Minister for three months in 1999 and served a full term from 2008 to 2012. During Putin's presidency, he has been a member of the Unity party and the United Russia party. He is also affiliated with the People’s Front, a group of supporters that Putin organized in 2011 to help improve the public's perception of United Russia. His political ideology, priorities and policies are sometimes referred to as Putinism (). Putin has enjoyed high domestic approval ratings and in 2007 was Time magazine's Person of the Year. In 2015, he was designated No. 1 in Time 100, Time magazine's list of the top 100 most influential people in the world. In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, he was designated No. 1 on the Forbes list of The World’s Most Powerful People. The Russian economy and standard of living grew rapidly during the early period of Putin's regime, fueled largely by a boom in the oil industry. However, lower oil prices and sanctions for Russia's annexation of Crimea led to recession and stagnation in 2015 that has persisted into the present day. Political freedoms have been sharply curtailed, leading to widespread condemnation from human rights groups. == Overview == The political system under Putin has been described as incorporating some elements of economic liberalism, a lack of transparency in governance, cronyism, nepotism and pervasive corruption. This view has been supported by many, but it has also been characterized as \\"a systemic and institutionalized form\\" by others, notably Boris Nemtsov. Between 1999 and 2008, the Russian economy grew at a steady pace, which some experts attribute to the sharp rouble devaluation of 1998, Boris Yeltsin-era structural reforms, rising oil prices and cheap credit from Western banks. In former Ambassador Michael McFaul's opinion (June 2004), Russia's \\"impressive\\" short-term economic growth \\"came simultaneously with the destruction of free media, threats to civil society and an unmitigated corruption of justice\\". During Putin's first two terms as President, he signed into law a series of liberal economic reforms, such as the flat income tax of 13 percent, reduced profits- tax and new land and civil codes. Within this period, poverty in Russia reduced by more than half and real GDP has grown rapidly. In foreign affairs, the Putin government seeks to emulate the former Soviet Union's grandeur, belligerence and expansionism. In November 2007, Simon Tisdall of The Guardian pointed out that \\"just as Russia once exported Marxist revolution, it may now be creating an international market for Putinism\\" as \\"more often than not, instinctively undemocratic, oligarchic and corrupt national elites find that an appearance of democracy, with parliamentary trappings and a pretense of pluralism, is much more attractive, and manageable, than the real thing\\". In September 2007, American economist Richard W. Rahn called Putinism \\"a Russian nationalistic authoritarian form of government that pretends to be a free market democracy\\" and which \\"owes more of its lineage to fascism than communism\\", noting that \\"Putinism depended on the Russian economy growing rapidly enough that most people had rising standards of living and, in exchange, were willing to put up with the existing soft repression\\". He predicted that \\"as Russia's economic fortunes changed, Putinism was likely to become more repressive\\". After Rahn's remarks, Putin took actions to lessen democracy, promote conservative beliefs and values; and silence opposition to his policies and administration. Russian historian Andranik Migranyan saw the Putin regime as restoring what he viewed as the natural functions of a government after period of the 1990s, when oligopolies expressing only their own narrow interests allegedly ruled Russia. Migranyan said: \\"If democracy is the rule by a majority and the protection of the rights and opportunities of a minority, the current political regime can be described as democratic, at least formally. A multiparty political system exists in Russia, while several parties, most of them representing the opposition, have seats in the State Duma\\". == Putinism == The terms \\"Putinism\\" and \\"Putinist\\" often have negative connotations when used in Western mediaOne of the first recorded usage of the term: .. to reference the Russian government under Putin where , the military- security establishment, allegedly control much of the political and financial power. Many are Putin's personal friends or previously worked with him in state security and intelligence agencies, such as the , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the military. Cassiday and Johnson argue that since taking power in 1999, \\"Putin has inspired expressions of adulation the likes of which Russia has not seen since the days of Stalin. Tributes to his achievements and personal attributes have flooded every possible media\\". Ross says the cult emerged quickly by 2002 and emphasizes Putin's \\"iron will, health, youth and decisiveness, tempered by popular support\\". Ross concludes: \\"The development of a Putin mini cult of personality was based on a formidable personality at its heart\\". == Putin's campaign program == On 31 December 1999, President Boris Yeltsin resigned. Under the Constitution of Russia, the then Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin became Acting President.Putin takes control in Russia. BBC news. 31 December 1999. The day before, a program article signed by Putin \\"Russia at the turn of the millennium\\" was published on the government web site. The potential head of the state expressed his views on the past and problems of the country.\\"The document was prepared by members of Gref’s Centre for Strategic Studies, but we know that Putin carefully went through the draft and added his own comments and corrections. The document thus provides a genuine insight into his thinking\\", Richard Sakwa, \\"Putin: Russia's choice\\", page 52 The first task in Putin's view was consolidation of Russia's society: \\"The fruitful and creative work, which our country needs so badly, is impossible in a divided and internally atomised society\\".Russia between the Millennia, Vladimir Putin (in Russian). The English translation cited per the Appendix of Richard Sakwa's \\"Putin: Russia's choice\\" However, the author stressed: \\"There should be no forced civil accord in a democratic Russia. Social accord can only be voluntary\\". The author stressed the importance of strengthening the state: \\"The key to Russia’s recovery and growth today lies in the state-political sphere. Russia needs strong state power and must have it\\". Detailing on his view Putin emphasized: \\"Strong state power in Russia is a democratic, law-based, workable federal state\\". Regarding the economic problems, Putin pointed out the need to significantly improve economic efficiency, the need of carrying out the coherent and result-based social policy aimed to battle the poverty and the need to provide the stable growth of people's well-being. The article stated the importance of government support of science, education, culture, health care since \\"[a] country in which the people are not healthy physically and psychologically, are poorly educated and illiterate, will never rise to the peaks of world civilisation\\". The article concluded with an alarmist statement that Russia was in the midst of one of the most difficult periods in its history: \\"For the first time in the past 200–300 years, it is facing the real threat of slipping down to the second, and possibly even third, rank of world states\\". To avoid that, there's a need of tremendous effort of all the intellectual, physical and moral forces of the nation because \\"[e]verything depends on us, and us alone, on our ability to recognise the scale of the threat, to unite and apply ourselves to lengthy and hard work\\". As stated in the history course by Russian Doctors of History Barsenkov and Vdovin, the basic ideas of the article were represented in the election platform of Vladimir Putin and supported by the majority of country's citizens, leading to the victory of Vladimir Putin in the first round of the 2000 election, with 52 per cent of the votes cast.History of Russia, 1917–2004, A.S. Barsenkov (RuWiki) and A.I. Vdovin, page 765. (book in Russian) The outline of Russia's foreign policy was presented by Vladimir Putin in his Address to Russia's Federal Assembly in April 2002: \\"We are building constructive, normal relations with all the world's nations—I want to emphasise, with all the world's nations. However, I want to note something else: the norm in the international community, in the world today, is also harsh competition—for markets, for investment, for political and economic influence. And in this fight, Russia needs to be strong and competitive\\". \\"I want to stress that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political. And also taking into account the interests of our partners, above all in the CIS\\".Annual Address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation . Vladimir Putin. 2002. In his 2008 book, the Russian political commentator, the retired KGB lieutenant-general Nikolai Leonov, noted that Putin's program article was barely noticed then and never revisited later—a fact that Leonov regretted, because \\"its content is most important for contrasting against his [Putin's] subsequent actions\\" and thus figuring out Putin's pattern, under which \\"words, more often than not, do not match his actions\\".Н.С. Леонов. Россия 2000–2008. Закат или рассвет? (Russia 2000–2008. Sunset, or Dawn?), Moscow, 2008, page 10. == Sociological data == According to Dr. Mark Smith (March 2003), some of the main features of Putin's regime were the development of a corporatist system by pursuing close ties with business organizations, social stability and co-optation of opposition parties. He determined three main groupings in Putin's early leadership: 1) the siloviki, 2) economic liberals and 3) supporters of \\"the Family\\", i.e. those who were close to Yeltsin. Olga Kryshtanovskaya, who carried out a sociological survey in 2004, put the relative number of siloviki in the Russian political elite at 25%.Mission \\"intrusion\\" is complete! by Olga Kryshtanovskaya, 2004, Novaya Gazeta (in Russian) In Putin's \\"inner circle\\" which constitutes about 20 people, amount of siloviki rises to 58% and fades to 18–20% in parliament and 34% in the government. According to Kryshtanovskaya, there was no capture of power as Kremlin bureaucracy has called siloviks in order to \\"restore order\\". The process of siloviki coming into power has allegedly started since 1996, Boris Yeltsin's second term. \\"Not personally Yeltsin, but the whole elite wished to stop the revolutionary process and consolidate the power\\". When silovik Putin was appointed Prime Minister in 1999, the process boosted. According to Olga: \\"Yes, Putin has brought siloviks with him. But that's not enough to understand the situation. Here's also an objective aspect: the whole political class wished them to come. They were called for service... There was a need of a strong arm, capable from point of view of the elite to establish order in the country\\". Kryshtanovskaya noted that there were also people who had worked in structures believed to be affiliated with the KGB/FSB, such as the Soviet Union Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Governmental Communications Commission, Ministry of Foreign Trade, Press Agency News and others. The work per se in such agencies would not necessarily involve contacts with security services, but would make it likely. Fradkov: jacket over straps, by Olga Kryshtanovskaya. (Moscow News. 3 May 2004. № 8.) Summing up the numbers of official and affiliated siloviki, she came up with an estimate of 77% of such in the power. According to a Russian Public Opinion Foundation 2005 investigation, 34% of respondents think \\"there is a lack of democracy in Russia because democratic rights and freedoms are not observed\\" and also point on the lack of law and order. In the same time, 21% of respondents are sure there's too much of democracy in Russia and many of them point on the same drawbacks as the previous group: \\"[T]he lack of law and order, irresponsibility and non-accountability of politicians\\". According to the Foundation: \\"As we can see, Russians' negative opinions about democracy are based on their dissatisfaction with contemporary conditions, while some respondents think the democratic model is not suitable in principal\\". Considering the modern regime: \\"It is interesting that most respondents think Putin's government marks the most democratic epoch in Russian history (29%), while second place goes to Brezhnev's times (14%). Some people mentioned Gorbachev and Yeltsin in this context (11% and 9%, respectively)\\".Democracy in Russia (population poll), by the Public Opinion Foundation, March 2005. (see also the original version of the report in Russian) At the end of 2008, Lev Gudkov, based on the Levada Center polling data, pointed out the near- disappearance of public opinion as a socio-political institution in Putin's Russia and its replacement with the still-efficacious state propaganda. == Economic policies == On 9 July 2000, while speaking to the Russian Parliament, Putin advocated an economy policyPutin Advocates Strong Russia, Liberal Economy; President Surprisingly Candid In First State of Nation Address which would have introduced a flat tax rate of 13%Russia's Flat-Tax Miracle 24 March 2003. and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. Putin also intended for small businesses to get better treatment under this economic reform package. Under Putin, the old system which included high tax rates has been replaced with a new system where companies can choose either a 6 percent tax on gross revenue or a 15 percent tax on profits. In February 2009, Putin called for a single VAT rate to be \\"as low as possible\\" (at the time it stood at an average rate of 18 percent), which could be reduced to between 12 percent and 13 percent.Putin calls for lower taxes to spur business growth. International Herald Tribune. 8 February 2008. The overall tax burden was lower in Russia under Putin than in most European countries. and == Rising living standards == In 2005, Putin launched National Priority Projects in the fields of health care, education, housing and agriculture. In his May 2006 annual speech, Putin proposed increasing maternity benefits and prenatal care for women. Putin was strident about the need to reform the judiciary considering the present federal judiciary \\"Sovietesque\\", wherein many of the judges hand down the same verdicts as they would under the old Soviet judiciary structure and preferring instead a judiciary that interpreted and implemented the code to the current situation. In 2005, responsibility for federal prisons was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Justice. The most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007.The challenges of the Medvedev era, 2008 Russians at a 2018 event During Putin's government, poverty was cut more than half and real GDP has grown rapidly. In 2006, chief of Business Weeks Moscow bureau Jason Bush commented on the condition of Russian middle class: \\"This group has grown from just 8 million in 2000 to 55 million today and now accounts for some 37% of the population, estimates Expert, a market research firm in Moscow. That's giving a lift to the mood in the country. The share of Russians who think life is 'not bad' has risen to 23% from just 7% in 1999, while those who find living conditions 'unacceptable' has dropped to 29% from 53%, according to a recent poll\\". However, \\"[n]ot everyone has shared in the prosperity. Far from it. The average Russian earns $330 a month, just 10% of the U.S. average. Only a third of households own a car, and many—particularly the elderly—have been left behind\\". At the end of Putin's second term, Jonathan Steele has commented on Putin's legacy: \\"What, then, is Putin's legacy? Stability and growth, for starters. After the chaos of the 90s, highlighted by Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament with tanks in 1993 and the collapse of almost every bank in 1998, Putin has delivered political calm and a 7% annual rate of growth. Inequalities have increased and many of the new rich are grotesquely crass and cruel, but not all the Kremlin's vast revenues from oil and gas have gone into private pockets or are being hoarded in the government's \\"stabilisation fund\\". Enough has gone into modernising schools and hospitals so that people notice a difference. Overall living standards are up. The second Chechen war, the major blight on Putin's record, is almost over\\".Putin's legacy is a Russia that doesn't have to curry favour with the west by Jonathan Steele. The Guardian. 18 September 2007. == Corporatism and state intervention in economy == According to Dr Mark Smith (March 2003), Putin had developed a \\"corporatist system\\" in the sense that under him the Kremlin was interested in close ties with business organizations such as the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Delovaya Rossiya and the trade union federation (FNPR).The Putinite System Dr. Mark A.

According to Andrey Illarionov, advisor of Putin until 2005, Putin policies were a new socio-political order \\"distinct from any seen in our country before\\" as members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators had taken over the entire body of state power, followed an omertà-like behavior code and were \\"given instruments conferring power upon others—membership \\"perks\\", such as the right to carry and use weapons\\". According to Illarionov, this \\"Corporation has seized key government agencies—the Tax Service, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Parliament, and the government-controlled mass media—which are now used to advance the interests of [Corporation] members. Through those agencies, every significant resource in the country—security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial—is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members\\". Members of the Corporation formed an isolated caste and according to an anonymous former KGB general cited by The Economist, “[a] Chekist is a breed ...

Jason Bush, chief of the Moscow bureau of the magazine Business Week has commented in December 2006 on troubling growth of government's role: \\"The Kremlin has taken control of some two dozen Russian companies since 2004 making them public property, including oil assets from Sibneft and Yukos, as well as banks, newspapers, and more. Despite his sporadic support for pro-market reforms, Putin has backed national champions such as energy concerns Gazprom and Rosneft. The private sector's share of output fell from 70% to 65% last year, while public owned companies now represent 38% of stock market capitalization, up from 22% a year ago\\".\\"Russia: How Long Can The Fun Last?\\" by Jason Bush. Business Week. 7 December 2006. On 20 September 2008 and when the late 2000s recession had started to hit the well-being of Russia's top tycoons, the Financial Times said that \\"Putinism was built on the understanding that if tycoons played by Kremlin rules they would prosper\\". Although Russia's state intervention in the economy had been usually criticized in the West, a study by Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition (BOFIT) in 2008 showed that state intervention had had a positive impact on the corporate governance of many companies in Russia as the formal indications of the quality of corporate governance in Russia were higher in companies with state control or with a stake held by the government.Andrei Yakovlev, State-business relations and improvement of corporate governance in Russia Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, 2008 == Other economic developments and assessments == In June 2008, a group of Finnish economists wrote that the 2000s had so far been an economic boon for Russia, with GDP rising about 7% a year and by the beginning of 2008 Russia had become one of the ten largest economies in the world. Russian GDP since the end of the Soviet Union (from 2014 are forecasts) In Putin's first term, many new economic reforms were implemented along the lines of the \\"Gref program\\". The multitude of reforms ranged from a flat income tax to bank reform, from land ownership to improvements in conditions for small businesses. In 1998, over 60% of industrial turnover in Russia was based on barter and various monetary surrogates. The use of such alternatives to money now today fallen out of favour, which has boosted economic productivity significantly. Besides raising wages and consumption, Putin's government has received broad praise also for eliminating this problem.Korhonen et at, The challenges of the Medvedev era Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition, 2008 In the opinion of the Finnish researchers, the most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007. The rise in the overall living standards further deepened Russia's social and geographical discrepancies. In July 2008, Edward Lucas of The Economist wrote: \\"The colossal bribe-collecting opportunities created by Putinism have heightened the divide between big cities (particularly Moscow) and the rest of the country\\". In November 2008, the retired KGB lieutenant-general Nikolai Leonov, in assessing the overall results of Putin's economic policies for the period of 8 years, said that [w]ithin this period, there has only been one positive thing, if you leave aside the trivia. And that thing is the price of oil and natural gas\\".Генерал КГБ Н.С.Леонов: \\"В нашей стране умеют только пилить бабки\\". KGB lieutenant- general Nikolai Leonov's interview. 1 November 2008.

On 29 November 2008, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of Russian Federation (the largest opposition group within Russia with its 13% of seats in the national Parliament), in his speech before the 13th Party Congress lamented that due to \\"heroic efforts\\" of the \\"Yeltsinites\\" the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its \\"historical territory\\" and that Russia faces de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has in his opinion no notable successes to boast of, no clear plan of action and is only focussed on staying in power at all costs.Political Report of the CPRF Central Committee to the 13th Party Congress, by G.Zyuganov. 29 November 2008. To characterize the kind of state Putin had built in socio-economic terms, in early 2008 professor Marshall I. Goldman coined the term \\"petrostate\\" in Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia,Marshall I. Goldman. Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia, Oxford University Press, May 2008. where he inter alia argued that while Putin had followed the advice of economic advisers in implementing reforms such as a 13 percent flat tax and creating a stabilization fund to lessen inflationary pressure, his main personal contribution was the idea of creating \\"national champions\\" and the renationalization of major energy assets. In his June 2008 interview, Marshall Goldman said that in his opinion Putin had created a new class of oligarchs, whom some called \\"silogarchs\\", Russia having come in second in the Forbes magazine list of the world's billionaires after only the United States.Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia. Carnegie Council, Marshall I. Goldman and Joanne J. Myers. 4 June 2008. In December 2008, Anders Åslund pointed out that Putin’s chief project had been \\"to develop huge, unmanageable state-owned mastodons, considered “national champions”\\", which had \\"stalemated large parts of the economy through their inertia and corruption while impeding diversification\\". ==Constitutional Amendments made in 2020== In January 2020, Putin proposed a number of substantial amendments to the Constitution of Russia. To introduce these amendments, he held a referendum. They were approved on 1 July 2020 by a contested popular vote. The amendments had wide reaching impacts, including extending Presidential term limits, allowing the President to fire federal judges, and constitutionally banning same-sex marriage. With Putin’s signing a decree on 3 July 2020 to officially insert the amendments into the Russian Constitution, they took effect on 4 July 2020. == Restoring functionality of government == The concept of \\"Putinism\\" was described in a positive sense by Russian political scientist Andranik Migranyan.What is ‘Putinism’?, by Andranik Migranyan. Russia in Global affairs. 13 April 2004. According to Migranyan, Putin came into office when the worst regime was established: the economy was \\"totally decentralized\\" and \\"the state had lost central authority while the oligarchs robbed the country and controlled its power institutions\\". In two years, Putin has restored hierarchy of power, ending the omnipotence of regional elites as well as destroying political influence of \\"oligarchs and oligopolies in the federal center\\". Boris Yeltsin-era non-institutional center of power commonly called \\"The Family\\" was ruined, which according to Migranyan in turn undercut the positions of the actors such as Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, who had sought to privatize the Russian state \\"with all of its resources and institutions\\". Migranyan said that Putin began establishing common rules of the game for all actors and started with an attempt to restore the role of the government as the institution expressing combined interests of the citizens and \\"capable of controlling the state’s financial, administrative and media resources\\". According to Migranyan: \\"Naturally, in line with Russian traditions, any attempt to increase the state’s role causes an intense repulsion on the part of the liberal intellectuals, not to mention a segment of the business community that is not interested in the strengthening of state power until all of the most attractive state property has been seized\\". Migranyan claimed that oligopolies' view of democracy was set on a premise of whether they were close to the center of power, rather than \\"objective characteristics and estimates of the situation in the country\\". Migranyan said \\"free\\" media, owned by e.g. Berezovsky and Gusinsky, were nothing similar to free media as understood by the West, but served their only economic and political interests while \\"all other politicians and analysts were denied the right to go on the air\\". Migranyan sees enhancement of the role of the law enforcement agencies as a trial to set barriers against criminals, \\"particularly those in big business\\". Migranyan sees in 2004 fruition of the social revolution initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, whose aims were to rebuild the social system, saying that \\"the absolute dominance of private ownership in Russia, recognized by all political forces today, has been the greatest achievement and result of this social revolution\\". According to Migranyan, the major trouble of Russian democracy is inability of civil society to rule the state, underdevelopment of public interests. He sees that as the consequence of Yeltsin's era family-ruled state being unable to pursue \\"a favorable environment for mid-sized and small businesses\\". Migranyan sees modern Russia as democracy, at least formally. While \\"the state, having restored its effectiveness and control over its own resources, has become the largest corporation responsible for establishing the rules of the game\\". Migranyan wonders how much might this influence extend in future. In 2004, he saw two possibilities for the Putin regime: either transformation into a consolidated democracy, either bureaucratic authoritarianism. However, \\"if Russia is lagging behind the developed capitalist nations in regard to the consolidation of democracy, it is not the quality of democracy, but rather its amount and the balance between civil society and the state\\". The report by Andrew C. Kuchins in November 2007 said that \\"Russia today is a hybrid regime that might best be termed “illiberal internationalism”, although neither word is fully accurate and requires considerable qualification. From being a weakly institutionalized, fragile, and in many ways distorted proto-democracy in the 1990s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has moved back in the direction of a highly centralized authoritarianism, which has characterized the state for most of its 1,000-year history. But it is an authoritarian state where the consent of the governed is essential. Given the experience of the 1990s and the Kremlin’s propaganda emphasizing this period as one of chaos, economic collapse, and international humiliation, the Russian people have no great enthusiasm for democracy and remain politically apathetic in light of the extraordinary economic recovery and improvement in lifestyles for so many over the last eight years. The emergent, highly centralized government, combined with a weak and submissive society, is the hallmark of traditional Russian paternalism\\".\\"Alternative Futures for Russia to 2017\\". A report of the Russia and Eurasia Program Center for Strategic and International Studies. November 2007. Page 4. In a 2007 interview with Der Spiegel, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn commented on the Putin regime: \\"Putin has inherited plundered and downtrodden country with demoralized and grown poor majority of the population. And he took on its possible — to be noted, gradual, slow — recovering. These efforts were not right at the moment noticed, not speaking about being appreciated. And can you point on examples in history when measures for recovering strength of governmental management would be benevolently met from beyond the country?\\".Interview of Der Spiegel with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (23 July 2007): Russian translation , partial German version, full German version (paid). According to a 2007 article of Dimitri Simes published in Foreign Affairs: \\"With high energy prices, sound fiscal policies, and tamed oligarchs, the Putin regime no longer needs international loans or economic assistance and has no trouble attracting major foreign investment despite growing tension with Western governments. Within Russia, relative stability, prosperity, and a new sense of dignity have tempered popular disillusionment with growing state control and the heavy-handed manipulation of the political process\\".Losing Russia, originally printed in Foreign Affairs, by Dimitri Simes. November/December 2007. BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article and after describing the \\"scarred decade\\" of the 1990s with \\"rampant hyperinflation\\" harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate like that for a nation in a war, the country turning \\"from superpower into beggar\\", wonders: \\"So who can blame Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided\\".Russia: The beggar becomes the belligerent, by Bridget Kendall. New Statesman. 7 June 2007 == Foreign policy == With Bill Clinton in September 2000 With George W. Bush in July 2001 With Barack Obama in September 2015 With Donald Trump in July 2017 In June 2000, Putin's decree was approved by the \\"Concept of the Russian Federation's foreign policy\\". According to this document, the main objectives of foreign policy are the following: *Ensuring reliable security of the country. *The impact of global processes in order to create a stable, just and democratic world order. *The creation of favorable external conditions for the onward development of Russian. *Formation of the Neighbourhood zone around the perimeter of the Russian borders. *Search agreement and coinciding interests with foreign countries and international associations in the process of solving problems, Russia's national priorities. *Protecting the rights and interests of Russian citizens and compatriots abroad. *Promote a positive perception of the Russian Federation in the world. In a 2010 article in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung dedicated to the participation in the annual economic forum, it was proposed to create a European economic alliance stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon. As steps towards the creation of the alliance indicates a possible unification of customs tariffs and technical regulations, the abolition of the visa regime with the European Union. In August 2013, according to experts the Russian-American relations have reached their lowest point since the end of the Cold War era. The September President Barack Obama's visit to Moscow and his talks with Putin were canceled due to temporary asylum in Russia, a former employee of the CIA Edward Snowden, disagreements on the situation in Syria and the problems with human rights in Russia. Russia has a long history of Anti-Americanism, dating back to the early days of the Cold War. In some of the latest Russian population polls, the United States and its allies consistently top the list of greatest enemies.«Левада-Центр»: главным врагом россияне считают США, Levada-center: Russians consider U.S. as a main enemy.\\"More Russians are sure of the U.S. meddling in their politics than the other way around, poll finds\\". The Washington Post. 7 February 2018. Survey results published by the Levada- Center indicate that, as of August 2018, Russians increasingly viewed the United States positively following the Russia–U.S. summit in Helsinki in July 2018. But only 14% of Russians expressed net approval of Donald Trump’s policies in 2019. According to the Pew Research Center, \\"57% of Russians ages 18 to 29 see the U.S. favorably, compared with only 15% of Russians ages 50 and older.\\" On 11 September 2013, The New York Times published an article by Putin, \\"Russia calls for caution\\". It is written in the form of an open letter to the American people, containing an explanation of the Russian political line against the Syrian conflict. It is also the Russian president warns against President Obama's thesis \\"About the exclusivity of the American nation\\". The article caused a mixed reaction of the world community. In 2013, Putin won the first place in the annual ranking of most influential people in the world by Forbes. In 2014, the result was the same. In September 2015, Putin spoke at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York City for the first time in 10 years. In his speech, he urged the formation of a broad anti-terrorist coalition to combat ISIS and blamed the events in Ukraine on \\"external forces\\", warned the West against unilateral sanctions, attempts to push Russia from the world market and export of color revolutions. For the first time, he also held a meeting with President Obama to discuss the situation in Syria and Ukraine, but in the outcome of the negotiations and despite the persistence of deep contradictions the experts saw a faint hope for a compromise and the warming of relations between the two countries. == Authoritarian bureaucratic state == Russian politician Boris Nemtsov and commentator Kara-Murza define Putinism in Russia as \\"a one party system, censorship, a puppet parliament, ending of an independent judiciary, firm centralization of power and finances, and hypertrophied role of special services and bureaucracy, in particular in relation to business\\". Russia's nascent middle class showed few signs of political activism under the regime as Masha Lipman reported: \\"As with the majority overall, those in the middle- income group have accepted the paternalism of Vladimir Putin's government and remained apolitical and apathetic\\".\\"Russia's Apolitical Middle\\", by Masha Lipman. Washington Post. 4 June 2007. In December 2007, the Russian sociologist Igor Eidman (VCIOM) categorized the Putin regime as \\"the power of bureaucratic oligarchy\\" which had \\"the traits of extreme right-wing dictatorship — the dominance of state-monopoly capital in the economy, silovoki structures in governance, clericalism and statism in ideology\\". Популяры вместо оптиматов. Оппозиция в России может быть только новой и левой. Vremya Novostei № 230 14 December 2007. In August 2008, The Economist wrote about the virtual demise of both Russian and Soviet intelligentsia in post- Soviet Russia and noted: \\"Putinism was made strong by the absence of resistance from the part of society that was meant to provide intellectual opposition\\". In early February 2009, Aleksander Auzan, an economist and board member at a research institute set up by Dmitry Medvedev, said that in the Putin system \\"there is not a relationship between the authorities and the people through Parliament or through nonprofit organizations or other structures. The relationship to the people is basically through television. And under the conditions of the crisis, that can no longer work\\". About the same time, Vladimir Ryzhkov pointed out that a bill Medvedev had sent to the State Duma in late January 2009, when signed into law, will allow Kremlin- friendly regional legislatures to remove opposition mayors who were elected by popular vote: \\"It is no coincidence that Medvedev has taken aim at the country's mayors. Mayoral elections were the last bastion of direct elections after the Duma cancelled the popular vote for governors in 2005. Independent mayors were the only source of political competition against governors who were loyal to the Kremlin and United Russia. Now one of the few remaining checks and balances against the monopoly on executive power in the regions will be removed. After the law is signed by Medvedev, the power vertical will be extended one step further to reach every mayor in the country\\". On 9 July 2020, the popular governor of the Khabarovsk Krai, Sergei Furgal, who defeated the candidate of Putin's United Russia party in elections two years ago, was detained and flown to Moscow. Furgal was arrested 15 years after the alleged crimes he is accused of. Every day since June 11, mass protests have been held in the Khabarovsk Krai in support of Furgal. The protests included anti- Kremlin slogans like \\"Putin resign”, \\"Twenty years, no trust\\", or \\"Away with Putin!\\". == Rehabilitation of the Tsarist imperial and of the Soviet past of Russia ==  Tsarist Imperial Russia  It is claimed that Putin models himself on the Tsar Peter the Great, whose reign is reminiscent of a Russian imperial greatness which the Kremlin is keen to promote. A presidential commission asked Putin in 2003 to grant the request of one of Nicholas II's last surviving relatives to rehabilitate the House of Romanov. Willing to regain the imperial grandeur of Russia, Putin invited the Romanov imperial family to return to Russia in July 2015. According to the presidential commission, this move would represent a significant final step in Russia's journey to embrace its imperial history. An alliance has been forged between the Church and the Kremlin since Putin became President of the Russian Federation. An adherent of the Russian Orthodox Church, Putin has allowed the regaining by the Orthodox Church of much of the importance that the Church had enjoyed in the Russian Empire and has won the enthusiastic support of its religious leaders.  Soviet Union  Some commentators have said that current Putin holds many neo-Soviet views, especially concerning law and order and military strategic defense.Slade, G Deconstructing the Millennium Manifesto: The Yeltsin-Putin Transition and the Rebirth of Ideology . The School of Russian and Asian Studies. 2005. The first politically controversial step made by Putin, then the FSB Director, was restoring in June 1999 a memorial plaque to Yuri Andropov on the facade of the building, where the KGB had been headquartered.Andropov's Legacy in Putin's Foreign Policy. The Jamestown Foundation. 18 June 2004. In late 2000, Putin submitted a bill to the State Duma to use the Soviet anthem as Russia's national anthem. The Duma voted in favor. The music remained identical, but new lyrics were written. In September 2003, Putin was quoted as saying: \\"The Soviet Union is a very complicated page in the history of our peoples. It was heroic and constructive, and it was also tragic. But it is a page that has been turned. It's over, the boat has sailed. Now we need to think about the present and the future of our peoples\\".Answers to Questions at a Press Conference following the CIS Summit . 19 September 2003. In February 2004, Putin said: \\"It is my deep conviction that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems.\\" He went on to say, \\"Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward\\".President Vladimir Putin’s Answers to Questions During a Meeting with His Election Campaign Representatives . 12 February 2004. In April 2005, during his formal address to Russia's Parliament, President Putin said: \\"Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself\\". In December 2007, Putin said in the interview to the Time magazine: \\"Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people\\".Interview with Time Magazine . 19 December 2007. Communist protesters with the sign: \\"The order of dismissal of Vladimir Putin for the betrayal of the national interests\\", Moscow, 1 May 2012 In August 2008, The Economist claimed: \\"Russia today is ruled by the KGB elite, has a Soviet anthem, servile media, corrupt courts and a rubber- stamping parliament. A new history textbook proclaims that the Soviet Union, although not a democracy, was 'an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society'\\". In November 2008, International Herald Tribune stated: > The Kremlin in the Putin era has often sought to maintain as much sway over > the portrayal of history as over the governance of the country.

The role of the > security services seems especially delicate, perhaps because Putin is a > former KGB agent who headed the agency's successor, the FSB, in the late > 1990s. Putin has said that Joseph Stalin's legacy cannot be judged in black and white in 2009. Although Putin's policies have been likened to the Soviet era, he has received a lukewarm response by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF). On the other hand, Roger Boyes considers him more of a latter-day Brezhnev than a clone of Stalin. In August 2014, he rejected Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal to return the Imperial flag and anthem. == State-sponsored global public relations effort == Shortly after the Beslan terror act in September 2004, Putin enhanced a Kremlin-sponsored program aimed at \\"improving Russia's image\\" abroad. According to an unnamed former Duma deputy, there existed a classified article in the RF federal budget that provided for financing measures to this purpose.Кремль пытается скупать западных журналистов, которые улучшат его имидж. NEWSru. 13 September 2004. One of the major projects of the program was the creation in 2005 of Russia Today—a rolling English-language TV news channel providing 24-hour news coverage, modeled on CNN. Towards its start-up budget, $30 million of public funds were allocated.«Честь России стоит дорого». Мы выяснили, сколько конкретно. Novaya gazeta. 21 July 2005.Имидж за $30 млн. Vedomosti. 6 June 2005. A CBS News story on the launch of Russia Today quoted Boris Kagarlitsky as saying it was \\"very much a continuation of the old Soviet propaganda services\\". In 2007, Russia Today employed nearly 100 English-speaking special correspondents worldwide. Russia's deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin said in August 2008 in the context of the Russia-Georgia conflict: \\"Western media is a well-organized machine, which is showing only those pictures that fit in well with their thoughts. We find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion into the pages of their newspapers\\".Russia claims media bias, by Nick Holdsworth. Variety. August 2008. Similar views were expressed by some Western commentators.Western treatment of Russia signifies erosion of reason. Dr. Vlad Sobell. 2007.Interview with David Johnson by the Moscow News. April 2007.

The St. Petersburg Times. 12 August 2008. The public relations efforts notwithstanding, according to an opinion poll released in February 2009 by the BBC World Service, Russia's image around the world had taken a dramatic dive in 2008: forty-two percent of respondents said they had a \\"mainly negative\\" view of Russia, according to the poll, which surveyed more than 13,000 people in 21 countries in December and January. In June 2007, Vedomosti reported that the Kremlin had been intensifying its official lobbying activities in the United States since 2003, among other things hiring such companies as Hannaford Enterprises and Ketchum.Россия наращивает официальную лоббистскую деятельность в США. NEWSru. 5 June 2007. == Paramount leadership or tandemocracy? == The 2008 power-switching operation between Putin and Medvedev was widely seen as a pro forma action after the constitution did not allow Putin to be reelected for a third term in the 2008 presidential election. Both scholars and the Russian population disagree on whether the \\"Putin-Medvedev tandemocracy\\" represented the paramount leadership of Putin, with Medvedev being just a mascot, or if the power was shared. == Criticism ==  Personality cult  Satirical cartoon about Putin's influence on the media In June 2001, the BBC noted that a year after Putin took office, the Russian media had been reflecting on what some saw as a growing personality cult around him: Russia's TV-6 television had shown a vast choice of portraits of Putin on sale at a shopping mall in an underground passage near Moscow's Park of Culture.Private enterprise meets personality cult. BBC. 15 June 2001. In October 2007, some scenes at the United Russia congress caused Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who was allied to Russia within the \\"Union State\\", to recall the Soviet times, complete with the official adoration towards the Communist Party leader and talking to Russia's regional press representatives he said that in Russia Putin's personality cult was being created. Лукашенко обнаружил в России культ личности Путина. (\\"Lukashenko has discovered Putin's personality cult in Russia\\"). 12 October 2007. In 2008, the Paris-based AFP reported that ahead of the December parliamentary and March presidential elections, in which despite being required by the constitution to leave office, Putin was widely expected to find some way to retain power as his personality cult was gathering pace.Putin personality cult gathers pace ahead of election. AFP. 15 October 2007. After Medvedev was elected President in March 2008, United States government-funded Radio Liberty reported that during his eight-year presidency Putin had managed to build a personality cult around himself similar to those created by Soviet leaders. Although there had not been giant statues of Putin put up across the country (like those of Stalin before), he had the honor of being the only Russian leader to have had a pop song written about him: \\"I want a man like Putin\\", which hit the charts in 2002.Russia: Can Medvedev Create Putin-Style Personality Cult?.

In 2006, political scientist Julie Anderson wrote: \\"Under Russian Federation President and former career foreign intelligence officer Vladimir Putin, an 'FSB State' composed of chekists has been established and is consolidating its hold on the country. Its closest partners are organized criminals. In a world marked by a globalized economy and information infrastructure, and with transnational terrorism groups utilizing all available means to achieve their goals and further their interests, Russian intelligence collaboration with these elements is potentially disastrous\\". Russian historian Yuri Felshtinsky compared the takeover of the Russian state by the siloviki to an imaginary scenario of the Gestapo coming to power in Germany after World War II. He pointed out a fundamental difference between the secret police and ordinary political parties, even totalitarian ones, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, i.e. Russia's secret police organizations are wont to employ the so-called active measures and extrajudicial killings, hence they killed Alexander Litvinenko and directed Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives, according to Felstinsky.Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror. Historian Yuri Felshtinsky explains his views on the nature of Putinism on C-SPAN. In April 2006, Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former Middle East specialist at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), presented a list of those who had \\"mysteriously\\" died during Putin's presidency and wrote: \\"Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Russia – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent. [...] There is no historical precedent for a society so dominated by former and active-duty internal-security and intelligence officials – men who rose up in a professional culture in which murder could be an acceptable, even obligatory, business practice. [...] Those who operated within the Soviet sphere were the most malevolent in their practices. These men mentored and shaped Putin and his closest friends and allies. It is therefore unsurprising that Putin's Russia has become an assassination-happy state where detention, interrogation, and torture – all tried and true methods of the Soviet KGB – are used to silence the voices of untoward journalists and businessmen who annoy or threaten Putin's FSB state\\".A Rogue Intelligence State?

One of the leading members of Putin's ruling elite, Nikolai Patrushev, Director of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (August 1999–May 2008) and subsequently Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, was known for his propagation of the idea of \\"chekists\\" as \\"neo-aristocrats\\" ().

During the Soviet period, the Communist Party provided the glue holding the system together. During the 1990s, there was no central organizing institution or ideology.

In concluding her book A Russian Diary (2007), the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya said: \\"Our state authorities today are only interested in making money. That is literally all they are interested in\\".Anna Politkovskaya. A Russian Diary, Vintage Books, London, 2008, p. 300. Such views were shared by politologist Julie Anderson who said the same person can be a Russian intelligence officer, an organized criminal and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: \\"I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement\\".(Congressional Statement of R.

Though his name does not appear in any of the records, the data shows how deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage made members of his close circle fabulously wealthy.Panama Papers: a special investigation: Revealed: the $2bn offshore trail that leads to Vladimir Putin. The Guardian. 3 April 2016. == Ideology == Putin's trip to an annexed Crimea in August 2017 Political scientist Irina Pavlova said that chekists were not merely a corporation of people united to expropriate financial assets as they had long- standing political objectives of transforming Moscow to the Third Rome and an ideology of \\"containing\\" the United States.Badly informed optimists, by Irina Pavlova, grani.ru Columnist George Will emphasized in 2003 the nationalistic nature of Putinism: \\"Putinism is becoming a toxic brew of nationalism directed against neighboring nations, and populist envy, backed by assaults of state power, directed against private wealth. Putinism is a form of national socialism without the demonic element of its pioneer\\".Democracy under siege. George Will. 15 December 2003. According to Illarionov, the ideology of chekists is nashism (\\"ours-ism\\"), the selective application of rights. According to Dmitri Trenin (2004), Head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, the then Russia was one of the least ideological countries around the world: \\"Ideas hardly matter, whereas interests reign supreme. It is not surprising then that the worldview of Russian elites is focused on financial interests. Their practical deeds in fact declare In capital we trust\\". Trenin described Russia's elite involved in the process of policy-making as people who largely owned the country. Most of them were not public politicians, but the majority were bureaucratic capitalists. According to Trenin, \\"having survived in a ruthless domestic business and political environment, Russian leaders are well adjusted to rough competition and will take that mindset to the world stage\\". However, Trenin called Russian-Western relations, from Moscow's perspective, \\"competitive, but not antagonistic\\". He said that \\"Russia does not crave world domination, and its leaders do not dream of restoring the Soviet Union. They plan to rebuild Russia as a great power with a global reach, organized as a supercorporation\\".\\"Russia Redefines Itself and Its Relations with the West\\", by Dmitri Trenin. The Washington Quarterly. Spring 2007. According to Trenin, Russians \\"no longer recognize U.S. or European moral authority\\". He said that \\"from the Russian perspective, there is no absolute freedom anywhere in the world, no perfect democracy, and no government that does not lie to its people. In essence, all are equal by virtue of sharing the same imperfections. Some are more powerful than others, however, and that is what really counts\\".

In February 2007, Arnold Beichman, a conservative research fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in The Washington Times that \\"Putinism in the 21st century has become as significant a watchword as Stalinism was in the 20th\\". Also in 2007, Lionel Beehner, formerly a senior writer for the Council on Foreign Relations, maintained that on Putin's watch nostalgia for Stalin had grown even among young Russians and Russians' neo- Stalinism manifesting itself in several ways.Russia's Soviet Past Still Haunts Relations with West by Lionel Beehner.

In February 2007, responding to a listener's assertion that \\"Putin had steered the country to Stalinism\\" and \\"all entrepreneurs\\" were being jailed in Russia, the Russian opposition radio host Yevgeniya Albats said: \\"Come on, this is not true; there is no Stalinism, no concentration camps—thankfully\\". She went on to say that if citizens of the country would not be critical of what was occurring around them, referring to the \\"orchestrated, or genuine\\" calls for the \\"tsar to stay on\\", that \\"could blaze the trail for very ugly things and a very tough regime in our country\\".\\"Full Albats\\".

Although Putin's policies have been likened to the Soviet era, he has received a lukewarm response by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party (KPRF).Russian Communist leader denounces Putin for US alliance. Roger Boyes considers Putin more of a latter-day Leonid Brezhnev than a clone of Stalin.Roger Boyes considers Putin more of a latter-day Brezhnev than a clone of Stalin.  Putin's ideology as \\"State First\\"  While some might argue that Putin's leadership does not reflect an ideology, Chris Miller has discerned three beliefs which are consistent with Putin's announcements and account for his actions. This three-part ideology must be understood in the context of the history of Russia and of Putin himself. When Putin began his political career, the Soviet Union was unable to effectively collect taxes or provide services in part due to inadequate governmental control of the empire. Putin believed that the government needed to first establish strong centralized control of the empire. To maintain that central control has always been his highest priority. Second, to keep the populace supportive of his government and thus to prevent revolt, Putin believes that the key is rising wages and pensions. In that way, he maintains enough of a popular base that the populace tends to tolerate other problems. Third, economic progress depends heavily on private enterprises but only so long as those enterprises do not interfere with either central government control or rising salaries and pensions. When a private enterprise threatens either belief one or two, then the government takes control of the enterprise so that the enterprise supports beliefs one and two. These three beliefs are not followed without some compromises, but Miller argues that these beliefs help explain the behavior of Putin. == See also == * Putinism * Mafia state * Neo-Sovietism * Putinversteher * Recovery and growth of the Russian economy (1999–2008) * Russian oligarchs * Russian opposition == References  External links == * \\"Putinism: the ideology\\" – 1:20 lecture by professor Anne Applebaum spoken in London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), recorded on Monday 28 January 2013. * \\"Putinism and Russian Protest\\" – 2:00 panel lecture/discussion in University of California Television, published on 29 October 2012. * \\"Can Putin Contain Post-Putinism?\\" – 1:20 lecture at ICDS (International Centre for Defence Studies), published on 28 November 2012. * Haroon, Agha Iqrar. \\"The \\"Putinist Approach\\" and \\"Half hearted\\" European Union—Ukraine is a story of a \\"Love Triangle\\" of a beautiful lady being loved by two men\\" (4 December 2013). - Category:Presidency of Russia Category:History of Russia (1992–present) Category:Russian nationalism Category:Politics of Russia Category:Vladimir Putin Category:Corruption in Russia ","title":"Russia under Vladimir Putin"},{"id":"12386352","text":"The Cerchez is a right tributary of the river Ceair in Romania.Cursuri de apă din județul Constanța înscrise în Cadastrul Apelor din România It flows into the Ceair near Dumbrăveni.

PMTV belongs to family of Virgaviridae, and is the type member of the genus Pomovirus (Potato mop-top virus). The virus was first identified in 1966 by Calvert and Harrison in Britain, and is now reported in many other potato cultivating regions of the world including U.S.A., Canada, China, Pakistan, Japan, South American countries and many parts of Europe. Many disease management systems have been found to be ineffective against the virus, although a combination of sanitation and vector controls seems to work well. == Hosts and symptoms == Tuber fleshAs the name implies, the main host is potato; however, this virus also affects some common vegetable plants and weeds. Some of them include tomato, black nightshade, lambsquarters and ground cherry. The potato mop top virus' primary hosts are plants in the Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae. Potatoes that are infected by PMTV generally show hollow necrotic spots on the inside. This virus shows different symptoms in Europe; for example, the infected plants usually show dark brown necrotic arcs that discolor the tuber's flesh (these symptoms are very similar to those caused by alfalfa mosaic virus). Plants showing no symptoms of PMTV tend to produce larger quantities of infected tubers if they are derived from plants that have shown foliar symptoms in the previous year. == Disease cycle == The spores that PMTV is vectored in can live in the soil for up to 18 years giving the virus a long period of survival. The critical period for infection of S. subterranea and consequently PMTV is earlier in the potato growth cycle, during stolon formation and tuber set, which lasts 3–4 weeks. The disease cycle of PMTV begins with the virus entering the host plant's cell and disassembling its capsid to release the viral RNA into the cell. As a pomovirus, PMTV uses the host plant's machinery for replication and translation which both follow positive-stranded RNA models. After replicates of the viral RNA and of the capsid proteins are made in the cytosol, the virus reassembles itself and exits the cell to infect other cells. Because it is vectored by a protist, it generally appears in cooler and more moist times of the year. The naturally occurring virus has been found to have systemic effects on Nicotiana benthamiana. However, when the gene for TRIPLE GENE BLOCK1 (TGB1), which is a movement factor protein, was silenced, the systemic movement of the virus was hindered. The virus moves through the xylem to infect plants systemically, but can also spread locally through cell-to-cell movement. In host plants, the infected tissues include both leaves and the cytoplasm. It has been shown that PMTV infected seeds are planted, they only partially infect the following generations of plants, showing that its vector, S. subterranea is very important for transmission.Potato Mop Top Virus == Environment == The vector for PMTV, S. subterranea, is a slime mold known to cause powdery scab disease that favors wet and humid conditions, specifically poorly drained soil. In fact, this disease doesn’t occur often in areas with less than 30 inches of rain per year. The chance of disease onset increases in areas that get more than 45 inches of rain per year. Such moist environments helps facilitate the vector's zoospore movement to the infection sites (roots and tubers). It is thought that powdery scab disease development increases when high soil moisture gradually dries out, as this increases zoospore germination. S. subterranea tends to prefer more acidic soil, ranging from pHs of 4.7 to 7.6. S. subterranea thrives in temperate conditions, between 52 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, with the optimal temperature for infection by the vector being 60 degrees. Disease development can also be encouraged by certain agricultural practices. For example, increased use of nitrate or ammonium nitrogen containing fertilizers increases the incidence and severity of powdery scab disease, caused by the PMTV vector S. subterranea . This can be due to the fact that fertilization enhances root growth, which provides a larger amount of tissue that can be infected. == Management == Chemical treatments for field application against viruses are currently not available. This holds especially true for potatoes, because once infected by a virus, they will stay infected for the remainder of their lives. Thus, preventative methods are more viable options. This includes methods such as resistance-breeding, vector management, and crop sanitation. Resistance-breeding, or generating plants that are genetically resistant to pathogen infections, is another option being explored. Generating vector-resistant plants have been proven to be largely unsuccessful for PMTV. This is because plants need to have immunity towards S. subterranea in its tubers, roots, and stolons in order to completely resist infection by the vector and virus. To this date, however, potatoes have been produced with resistant tubers but susceptible roots. Although resistance breeding has not yet provided benefits for commercially available PMTV varieties, there have been some promising results in ongoing research. There are some partially resistant varieties of commercial crop that are available now. An example is NY99, a breeding line that has shown a low incidence of PMTV-infected tubers. Resistance-breeding, if successful, would prevent the virus from starting its pathogenesis. Vector management concentrates its efforts to reduce the level of S. subterranea in the soil as a way to combat the virus. Soil treatments, such as fungicides containing fluazinam, have been shown to be partially effective at reducing numbers of viable S. subterranea spores available to germinate into zoospores. Another form of vector management is crop rotations with brassicas and datura (a weed). Rotating with these plants has shown to produce low levels of S. subterranea in the soil. Proper crop sanitation is achieved by planting certified seed potatoes. It is crucial that these seed potatoes come from production areas that have had no previous contact with either the vector or the virus itself. Further risk reduction can be achieved by properly sanitizing all machinery that has come in contact with soil and plant debris. == Importance == PMTV is a relatively new discovery, having first been reported in Britain in 1966, and then in the U.S. in 2002. The vector S. subterranea, however, has been around for over 150 years, being first discovered in Germany in 1841. It was first discovered in the U.S. in 1913 PMTV can lead to a very significant loss in the yield of potatoes. For example, a study conducted on Scottish seed potatoes showed a yield reduction as great as 67%. The virus also causes spraing and necrosis in the flesh of tubers. These symptoms are mainly morphological defects that yield unaesthetic potatoes which face commercial rejection from processors and packers. If potatoes exported to other countries are found to be infected, it can negatively affect agricultural trading. For example, Maine was quarantined due to its fairly recent outbreaks. In addition to economic losses, the presence of PMTV can also negatively impact the reputation of a country (or region, state, or farm) for other exports. == Genome == PMTV is (+)ssRNA virus with a tripartite genome. The longest segment of PMTV, RNA-rep encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase and replicase subunits. The second segment, RNA-CP codes for virus coat protein (CP), and CP-RT or minor CP, which is produced by translational read-through of the CP stop codon. The third segment, RNA-TGB encodes triple gene block of movement proteins, TGB1, TGB2, TGB3, and 8K protein which is a viral suppressor of RNA silencing. == Pathogenesis == The vector for PMTV is a protist, S. subterranea. As S. subterranea infects the roots of potatoes, the virus is given access to the root cells and starts its habitation of the plant. By taking control of the cell's cellular machinery, the virus can replicate. The virus then moves onto more potato cells and spreads systemically through the plant. The systemic movement of PMTV is facilitated in large by a protein named TRIPLE GENE BLOCK1 (TGB1) which has an internal domain spurring transportation of the virus to neighboring cells, and an N-terminal domain used for long-distance (systemic) travel. This N-terminal domain of TGB1 has shown some promise as a target to limit systemic infection of the pathogen in N. benthamiana, since systemic infection requires an interaction between a molecule called importin-a within the host plant and the N-terminal domain. Of the three positive-sense RNA molecules used by PMTV, there is one thought to code for a virulence factor protein. The other two molecules code for a polymerase and a coat protein both of which are necessary for the survival of the virus. RNA-TGB is a gene with 4 open reading frames (ORFs); the first three overlapping ORFs form an area called the triple gene block. This 3 frame block codes for essential movement factor proteins that facilitate cell-to-cell movement. The fourth ORF codes for another cysteine- rich protein that increases virulence and has some RNA silencing suppressive activity. == References  External links == *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Potato mop-top virus *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Virgaviridae Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Potato mop-top virus"},{"id":"12386375","text":"Potato virus A (PVA) is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Potyviridae. ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Potato virus A *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Potyviruses ","title":"Potato virus A"},{"id":"12386382","text":"Potato virus M (PVM) is a plant pathogenic virus. ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Potato virus M *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Carlaviruses Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Potato virus M"},{"id":"12386386","text":"Waldburg-Scheer was a County ruled by the House of Waldburg, located in southeastern Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

PVY infection of potato plants results in a variety of symptoms depending on the viral strain. The mildest of these symptoms is production loss, but the most detrimental is 'potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease' (PTNRD). Necrotic ringspots render potatoes unmarketable and can therefore result in a significant loss of income. PVY is transmissible by aphid vectors but may also remain dormant in seed potatoes. This means that using the same line of potato for production of seed potatoes for several consecutive generations will lead to a progressive increase in viral load and subsequent loss of crop. An increase in potato plant infection with viruses over the past few years has led to considerable losses to the South African potato industry. The increased rate of infection may be attributed to several factors. These include a marked decrease in the effectiveness and administration of chemicals used in vector control, the use of infected seed potatoes in cultivation, incorrect irrigation and farming methods as well as a lack of a sensitive, rapid and reliable method of detection.Coetsee, J. (2005). Virusse bedreig hele aartappelbedryf, Landbouweekblad, 61637: 44-45. An increase in the average temperature of winters as a consequence of global warming has also led to an increase in aphid numbers, which in turn has led to an increase in viral distribution. ==Potato virus Y hosts, strains and symptoms== Potato illustrating necrotic ringspot disease PVY belongs to the genus Potyvirus, of which it is the type member. Potyvirus is the largest genus of plant viruses, and possibly the most destructive one in potato crops.Ward, C.W. and Shukla, D.D. (1991). Taxonomy of potyviruses: current problems and possible solutions. Intervirology, 32: 269-296. The genus includes more than 200 species that bring about significant losses in the agricultural arena.Jawaid, A. Khan A.J and Dijkstra J. (2002). Plant Viruses as Molecular Pathogens. Food Products Press, The Haworth Press Inc., N.Y. PVY infects many economically important plant species.

Host range, symptomology and serology of isolates of Potato virus Y (PVY) that share properties with both the PVYN and PVYO strain groups. Amer. Pot. J., 73: 309- 314. The level of damage to crop is determined by the strain of PVY infecting the plants, the viral load, the time at which infection occurs as well as the tolerance the host possesses toward the virus.Warren, M., Krüger, K. and Schoeman, A.S. (2005). Potato virus Y (PVY) and potato leaf roll virus(PLRV): Literature review for potatoes South Africa. Department of Zoology and Entomology, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, University of Pretoria. Resistance to PVY infection by hosts is low in many cases. Infection of a potato field with PVY may ultimately result in 10-100% loss in yield. It has been shown that the PVY has different isolates according to the symptoms they induce in various potato plant species.Delgado-Sanchez, S. and Grogan, R.G. (1970). Potato virus Y. CMI/AAB Descriptions of plant viruses. 37: CMI/AAB, Kew, Surrey, England, 4 pp. Extensive biological, serological and molecular variability of PVY isolates makes the classification of isolates as particular strains particularly difficult. Occurrence of a variety of symptoms and the emergence of the necrotic PVYNTN has led to a search for more reliable classification tools than simple serological identification. Traditionally three chief strains of PVY are recognized: PVYC, PVYN and PVYO. PVYC, originally known as Potato Virus C, was the first to be recognized and was identified in the 1930s.Salaman, R.N. (1930). Virus diseases of potato: Streak. Nature, 126: 241. PVYC induces hypersensitive responses in a wide range of potato cultivars. These reactions include the formation of mild mosaic patterns or stipple streak. Unlike the other strains of PVY, some PVYC strains are non- aphid transmissible.Blanco-Urgoiti, B., Tribodet, M., Leclere, S., Ponz, F., Perez dé San Roman, C., Legorburu, F.J. and Kerlan, C. (1998).

(1940) Some notes on suspected variant of Solanum virus 2 (Potato virus Y). This strain was described in tobacco plants growing close to potato plants.Crosslin, J., Hamm, P., Shiel, P., Hane, D., Brown, C. and Berger, P. (2005). Serological and Molecular Detection of Tobacco Veinal Necrosis Isolates of Potato Virus Y (PVYN) from Potatoes Grown in the Western United States. Amer. J. Pot. Res., 82: 263-269. PVYN results in leaf necrosis and mild or even no damage to the tubers. The ordinary strain of PVY is denoted as PVYO. Infection of a potato plant with the PVYO strain results in mild tuber damage and does not cause leaf necrosis.Boonham, N., Walsh, K., Hims, M., Preston, S., North, J. and Barker, I. (2002). Biological and sequence comparisons of Potato virus Y isolates associated with potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease. Pl. Path., 51: 117-126. Both PVYN and PVYO are aphid transmissible and occur in South Africa. In Europe these two strains have been shown to have recombined to form PVYNTN.Boonham, N., Walsh, K., Preston, S., North, J., Smith, P. and Barker, I. (2002).

Whole genome characterization of Potato virus Y isolates collected in the western USA and their comparison to isolates from Europe and Canada. Arch. Virol., 151: 1055-1074. The PVYNTN has been accredited with the ability to induce potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD). Tubers damaged by PTNRD become unmarketable and infection by PVYNTN thus results in a larger economic impact than infection by the other strains. ==Potato virus Y transmission== PVY may be transmitted to potato plants through grafting, plant sap inoculation and through aphid transmission. The most common manner of PVY infection of plant material in the field is through the aphid, and although aphids on their own can directly damage potato plants, it is their role as viral vectors which has the greatest economic impact.Halbert, S.E., Corsini, D.L. and Wiebe, M.A. (2003). Potato virus Y transmission efficiency for some common aphids in Idaho. Amer. J. Pot. Res., 80: 87-91.Radcliffe, E.B. and Ragsdale, D.W. (2002).

In cold climates aphids spend the winter either as wingless aphids giving birth to live young (viviparae) or as eggs. Hosts such as weeds and other crops serve as breeding grounds for these aphids and form a temporary area of colonization before the aphids migrate to the potato fields. In moderate climates, such as in South Africa, aphids are thought to reproduce asexually on weeds, other crops, indigenous plants and garden plants. This means that there are a number of aphids present year-round. The importance in effective and stringent monitoring of aphid populations is stressed in a review by Radcliffe and Ragsdale (2002) as PVY virions are introduced to potato fields almost solely by winged aphids from a virus source outside these fields. Wingless aphids have not yet been linked to the spread of PVY in potato fields.Ragsdale, D.W., Radcliffe, E.B., DiFonzo, C.D. (1994). Action thresholds for an aphid vector of potato leaf roll virus, pp. 99-110. In: Zehnder, G.W., Powelson, M.L., Jansson, R.K. and Raman, K.V. [ed.], Advances in potato pest biology and management. American Phytopathological Society, Minnesota, USA. The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) has been found to be most effective in its role as viral vector,Van Hoof, H.A. (1980). Aphid vectors of potato virus YN. Neth. J. Pl. Path., 86: 159. but others such as Aphis fabae, Aphis gossypii, Aphis nasturtii, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Myzus (Nectarosiphon) certus, Myzus (Phorodon) humuli and Rhopalosiphum insertum are also strongly associated with viral transmission. The Agricultural Research Council-Vegetable and Ornamental Plant Institute (ARC-VOPI) 6 of South Africa identified twenty five species of aphid able to function as PVY vectors.Thompson, G.J. (1997). Study and control of virus disease of potatoes. In: Landbounavorsingsraad Roodeplaat: Aartappelnavorsing 1996/1997. Agricultural Research Council, Pretoria. The efficiencies of some of these aphids to function as PVY vectors were also established (Ragsdale et al., 2001) and were found to vary between the different species. In South Africa, Aphis fabae, Aphis gossypii and Aphis nasturtii are the most common and efficient PVY vectors found in the field. Apart from being classed according to efficiency as vectors, aphids can also be divided into two subgroups, namely colonizing and non-colonizing species. Colonizing aphids are aphids which reproduce and establish themselves on potato plants, specifically, while non-colonizing aphids do not reproduce nor establish colonies on potato plants. Colonizing aphids are better adapted to life on potato plants and are thus generally considered as better PVY vectors than non-colonizing aphids. Noncolonizing aphids do not primarily feed on potato plants but do occasionally feed on them while searching for a more suitable host. Their lower efficiency as PVY vector is cancelled out by the sheer numbers in which they occur.Robert, Y., Woodford, J.A.T. and Ducray-Bourdin, D.G. (2000). Some epidemiological approaches to the control of aphid-borne virus diseases in seed potato crops in northern Europe. Vir. Res. 71: 33-47. Because of this, all aphids present in and around potato fields must be considered as possible vectors and their numbers carefully monitored. Transmission of PVY by aphids occurs in a non-persistent, non-circulative manner which suggests a less intimate interaction between virion and vector than is the case of circulative virions.Gray, S.M. (1996). Plant virus proteins involved in natural vector transmission. Trends Microbiol. 4: 259-264. The fact that the virions are transmitted in a non-persistent fashion means that viral replication does not occur within the aphid vector and that, unless the aphid feeds on infected plants, it loses its ability to infect plants after two to three feedings.Bradley, R.H.E. and Rideout, D.W. (1953). Comparative transmission of Potato virus Y by four aphid species that infect potatoes. Can. J. Zool., 31: 333-341. The virions attach to the aphid stylet in a matter of seconds and may remain infectious for four to seventeen hours.Harrison, B.D. (1984). CMI/AAB Descriptions of plant viruses. Potato leafroll virus 291 (no. 36 revised). www.dpvweb.net/dpv/showdpv.php?dvpno=291.Kostiw, M. (1975). Investigation on the retention of potato viruses M and Y in two species of aphids (Myzus persicae Sulz. and Aphis nasturtii Kalt.). Pot. Res., 18: 637–640. The distance over which the virions can be transmitted is limited due to the short period for which they remain infectious. Although the short life span outside plants inhibits long-distance viral transmission, it does not reduce the transmission efficiency bestowed by the quick rate of viral acquisition and inoculation within a field. Upon entrance into the plant cell, the virus coat protein disassembles and releases its RNA genome. The viral RNA serves as mRNA, and although little is known about the translation thereof, it is believed that the 5’ non-coding region functions as an enhancer of translation.Carrington, J.C. and Freed, D.D. (1990). Cap-independent enhancement of translation by a plant potyvirus 5’ nontranslated region. J. Virol., 64: 1590-1597. The translated mRNA results in a polyprotein which is processed into mature proteins. Each polyprotein is then cleaved into ten different proteins which are believed to be multifunctional. These proteins, along with host proteins, assemble to form a replication complex. This complex performs negative-strand RNA synthesis, using the positive strand of viral RNA as a template. Once the additional RNA copies have been produced, they code for the synthesis of various proteins, as mentioned before, as well as coat proteins. These coat proteins will now enclose the newly formed genomes to give rise to new virions. It has been suggested that enclosure of the newly formed virions is initiated by the interaction of the coat proteins with the 5’terminus and that the coat protein is built up towards the 3’terminus.Wu, X and Shaw, J.G. (1998). Evidence that assembly of a potyvirus begins near the 5’terminus of the viral RNA. J. Gen. Virol., 79: 1525–1529. The entire process of viral replication occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum. These newly synthesized viral particles are subsequently transported through the plasmodesmata to adjacent plant cells via several assisting potyvirus proteins. Distribution of viruses within the plant occurs according to the source-sink relationship between maturing and growing tissues.Talbot, N.J. (2004). Plant-Pathogen Interaction. Blackwell Publishing. CRC Press. Virus concentration throughout the plant is high and this greatly increases the chance of uptake by aphids. Infection of plants by potyviruses can be varied in the symptoms shown. Infection can include veinal necrosis, mosaic symptoms as well as leaf malformation (Boonham et al., 2002). Infected plants that do not show symptoms may have infected canopies and will yield lower quality products than their healthy counterparts. ==Potato – PVYNTN interaction== Since PVYNTN causes great loss in potato production, the research of potato – potato virus YNTN interaction is important. Sensitive potato cultivars respond to PVYNTN inoculation with development of typical symptoms. On inoculated leaves 5 – 7 days after inoculation chlorotic and necrotic ringspots develop. As the virus spreads through the plant the systemic symptoms develop on uninoculated leaves. 10 days after inoculation wrinkles and mosaic chlorosis appear, leading to a palm tree appearance (leaf drop). The viral defense mechanisms of plants will primarily try to restrict the movement of the virus. In failing this, it may attempt to induce cell death in infected tissue, thereby preventing the spread of virions.Bagnall, R.H. and Bradley R.H.E. (1958). Resistance to virus Y in the potato. Phytopathology, 48: 61-120. Although the precise mechanism of disease induction by potyviruses in plants is unknown, it is known that these viruses cause a significant shutdown of host gene expression during viral replication.Bushell, M. and Sarnow, P. (2002). Hijacking the translation apparatus by RNA viruses. J. Cell Biol.,158: 395-399.Pompe-Novak, M., Gruden, K., Baebler, S., Krečič-Stres, H., Kovač, M., Jongsma, M. and Ravnikar, M. (2006). Potato virus Y induced changes in the gene expression of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Physio. and Mol. Pl Path., 67: 237-247.Baebler Š, Krečič-Stres H, Rotter A, Kogovšek P, Cankar K, Kok EJ, Gruden K, Kovač M, Žel J, Pompe-Novak M, Ravnikar M, 2009. PVYNTN elicits a diverse gene expression response in different potato genotypes in the first 12 h after inoculation. Mol Plant Pathol 10, 263-275. Physiological changes in potato plants as a response to PVYNTN infection were intensively studied. At early stages of infection, meaning first 12 hours, photosynthesis related genes, genes involved in perception, signalling and defence response were shown to be differentially expressed. 24 h after inoculation the amount of salicylic acid increased.Krečič-Stres H., Vučak C., Ravnikar M., Kovač M. 2005. Systemic Potato virus YNTN infection and levels of salicylic and gentisic acids in different potato genotypes. Plant Pathol, 54: 441-447 A disruption in gene expression disrupts the normal cellular function of cells which could be the cause of the physical symptoms that the plant demonstrates. At the time of symptoms development, research on interaction between susceptible potato cultivar and PVYNTN showed changes in cytokinin level.Dermastia M., Ravnikar M. 1996. Altered cytokinin pattern and enhanced tolerance to potato virus YNTN in the susceptible potato cultivar (Solanum tuberosum L.) grown in vitro. Physiol Mol Plant P, 48: 65-71 In inoculated leaves showing symptoms modifications in chloroplast structure and size,Pompe- Novak M., Wrischer M., Ravnikar M. 2001.

Peroxidases and photosynthetic pigments in susceptible potato infected with potato virus YNTN. Plant Physiol Bioch 39: 891-898 were detected. At later stages of PVYNTN infection total protein concentration increased in sensitive potato cultivar while no such pronounced changes were observed in tolerant and moderately tolerant potato cultivars.Gruden K., Štrukelj B., Ravnikar M., Herzog- Velikonja B. 2000. A putative virial resistance-connected protein isolated from potato cultivar Santé resistant to PVYNTN infection. Phyton, 40: 191-200 Gene expression studies revealed changes in expression of genes for heat-shock proteins, catalase, β-1,3-glucanase and genes involved in photosynthesis. ==Molecular description of Potato virus Y== Potyvirus virions consist of non- enveloped filamentous structures that are 680 – 900 nm in length and 11 to 15 nm in width.Edwardson, J.R (1947). Some Properties of the Potato Virus Y Group. Florida Agricultural Experiment Stations Monograph Series, 4: 398. Morphologically the potyvirus capsid consists of approximately 2 000 copies of coat protein (CP). The capsid encapsulates a single strand of positive sense RNA which is in the order of 10 kb in length and has a non-translated 5’-terminal region (5’-NTR) as well as a 3’-poly-A tail.Dougherty, W.G. and Carrington, J.C. (1988). Expression and function of potyviral gene products. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol., 26: 123-143.Van der Vlugt, R., Allefs, S., De Haan, P. and Goldbach, R. (1989). Nucleotide sequence of the 3’-terminal region of potato virus YN RNA. J. Gen. Virol., 70: 229-233. The positive sense genome contains a single extended open reading frame and acts directly as mRNA. The 144 nucleotide 5’-NTR is particularly rich in adenine residues and has very few guanine residues. Rather than a conventional cap structure, the 5’NTR is associated with a Viral genome linked protein (VPg) which is said to act as an enhancer of transcription. The 5’-leader sequence has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and cap-independent translation regulatory elements (CIREs).Dallaire, B.J., Charest, P.J., Devantier., Y. and Laliberté, J.-F. (1994). Evidence for an internal ribosome entry site within the 5' non- translated region of turnip mosaic potyvirus RNA. J. Gen. Virol., 75: 3157-3165. The IRES directs cap-independent translation through a mechanism similar to that used by eukaryotes.Niepel, M. and Gallie, D.R. (1999). Identification and characterization of the functional elements within the tobacco etch virus 5' leader required for cap-independent translation. J. Gen. Virol., 79: 897-904. The extended open reading frame encodes for a 350 kDa polyprotein. This polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteases (NIa, HC-Pro and P1) and undergoes co- and post-translational cleavage to yield several multi-functional proteins. These include the following: P1 (P1 Protein), HCPro (Helper Component Proteinase), P3 (P3 Protein), 6K1 (6-kDa Protein 1), CI (Cylindrical Inclusion), 6K2 (6-kDa Protein 2), VPg (Viral Protein genome-linked), NIaPro (Nuclear Inclusion Protein a, Proteinase domain), NIb (Nuclear Inclusion Protein b) and the CP (Coat Protein). ==Diagnostic techniques for detection of Potato virus Y== ELISA In the past, crops were inspected visually to determine whether or not they were disease free. Visual inspection was also used as a basis for seed certification. Determination of viral status through visual inspection is incredibly difficult as the symptoms may be masked or the infection latent. As a result, post season tests and inspections were introduced. These tests involved the cultivation of previously harvested material in greenhouses. The resulting plants were inspected for a more accurate estimate of viral status. Although this method of screening did offer some degree of monitoring of viral presence it was subjective and highly ineffective. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening of crops and seed potatoes replaced visual inspection in the early 1970s. The use of ELISA offered routine diagnostic laboratories a quick, effective and sensitive method of screening for a wide range of potato plant viruses. Detection of pathogens using ELISA relies on the interaction between the antigen and specific antibodies and has become a popular and cost- effective means of routine detection. In an ELISA the solid phase can be coated with the sample of interest containing the antigen.Tijssen, P. (1985). Burdon, R.H.and Knippenberg, P.H. [ed], Laboratory techniques in biochemistry and molecular biology practice and theory of enzyme immunoassays, volume 15, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam. The efficiency to which the antigen binds to the solid phase is dependent on temperature, length of exposure as well as concentration. Solid phases used include nitrocellulose membranes, paper, glass, agarose and polystyrene or polyvinylchloride microtiter plates. Microtiter plates are the most widely used solid phase because they are easy to handle, allow for automation and for analysis using microtiter plate readers. A drawback of these plates is that they are highly absorptive and this increases the incidence of non-specific binding of components used in the ELISA. Non-specific binding to the plates is reduced through the use of buffers containing proteins such as casein and non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20. After coating, excess sample is removed and the plate typically treated with a 1% casein containing solution. Subsequent to this the solid phase is treated with antibodies raised against the antigen of interest. After each incubation step the plate is washed with Tween 20 containing PBS. These washing steps are aimed to wash away any non- specifically bound components.Wilson, K. and Walker, J. (2000). Practical biochemistry: Principles and techniques. (5th ed). The Press Syndicate, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K. Nonspecifically bound components are less strongly bound than the specific bound ones. Detection is achieved either through the addition of an enzyme-coupled antibody or the addition and detection of a biotinylated antibody. In a system using an enzyme-coupled antibody the subsequent addition of an appropriate substrate results in the formation of a colour proportional to the amount of antigen. Alternatively the plate can be coated with antibody followed by incubation with the sample that is to be detected. This, in turn, can be detected as described above and is then referred to as the double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Both of these systems, however, have a disadvantage in that coupling of the enzyme to the antibody may result in steric hindrance which in turn may result in a loss in function of the antibody and/or the enzyme.Blake, C. and Gould, B.J. (1984). Use of enzymes in immunoassay techniques. Analyst, 109: 533-547. This may be overcome through the use of a biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin bridge. In this type of system biotin is coupled to the antibody. The biotin molecule has no influence on the working of the antibodies and is easily detectedusing avidin or streptavidin conjugated to a suitable enzyme. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin which results in even a higher degree of specificity than a system in which the enzyme is coupled directly the antigen. To establish whether or not the antigen is present, a substrate specific for the enzyme used is added. The enzyme then converts the substrate to a coloured product and the colour intensity can be correlated to the amount of antibodies bound and thus the amount of antigen present. A DAS-ELISA has the advantage that it can increase the specificity of the ELISA and reduce the occurrence of non-specific binding. As a result, the DAS-ELISA principle is commonly employed in ELISA’s for the detection of plant pathogens in plant sap without prior purification of the pathogen. The ELISA is considered to be a safe, inexpensive and rapid method for detection of plant viruses. The inexpensive nature and relative simplicity thereof allows for it to be used as a workhorse within the agricultural sector and is used to screen thousands of samples per year. Unfortunately ELISAs are not completely failsafe. Virus levels within potato tubers, which are screened by ELISA for use as seed potatoes, are normally low while the tubers are dormant. ELISA detection of viruses in these potatoes is difficult and absorbance values may fall below the set cut-off value. For this reason, seed tuber screening is performed on sprouting rather than dormant tubers. Although this results in more reliable readings than direct tuber testing, it does delay the certification of seed potatoes.Gugerli, P. and Gehriger, W. (1980). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of potato leafroll virus and potato virus Y in potato tubers after artificial break of dormancy. Pot. Res., 23: 353–359. Another disadvantage of an immuno-based detection method is that changes at the gene level may have an influence on the immunogenicity of the antigen to be detected. In terms of potato plant viruses, mutations within the CP gene may cause the CP to undergo conformational changes rendering antibodies produced against the previously present virus less effective. RT-PCR Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has become a powerful and effective method for detection of potato plant viruses within potato plant material and even dormant potatoes. Only a minute piece of plant material is required for analysis using RT-PCR. Considering the protocol described within this thesis, 0.1 g of plant material is enough for 14 500 separate reactions. During a RT-PCR specific target RNA sequences are amplified exponentially into DNA copies. For this to occur, however, the RNA of the virus must first be transcribed to DNA by means of a reverse transcriptase polymerase. This polymerase synthesizes a DNA strand using the RNA as template. This results in a DNA/RNA complex. For synthesis of a DNA strand from the RNA template only the reverse primer is required since the RNA is a single strand arranged from 5’ to 3’. Subsequently, the newly synthesized DNA strand is used as a template for traditional PCR. Different types of reverse transcriptase polymerases are available to suit different needs and reaction conditions. Reverse transcriptase enzymes commonly used include AMV RT, SuperScript III, ImProm- II, Omniscript, Sensiscript and Tth RT. At the end of the RT step the polymerase enzyme is heatactivated. It could also be that the reverse transcriptase polymerase and DNA polymerase is one and the same enzyme and that the enzyme only requires a DNA polymerase activation step after the RT step. An example of such an enzyme is Tth polymerase. This enzyme has both RNA-dependent reverse transcriptase and DNA-dependent polymerase activity. However, the active center of the DNA polymerase is covered by dedicated oligonucleotides, called aptamers. At temperatures below the optimal reaction temperature of the DNA-dependent polymerase component of Tth remains covered by the aptamers. At these temperatures the Tth enzyme only synthesizes a DNA copy of the RNA template. Once the reaction temperature is raised to 95 °C, the aptamers are removed and the DNA-dependent polymerase component will start to amplify the target sequence. PCR amplification of the DNA target occurs in three steps: denaturation, annealing and extension. Each of these steps occur at a specific temperature for a fixed period of time. Denaturation is normally allowed to occur between 90 and 95 °C and leads to the dissociation of DNA strands. After this the reaction is cooled to between 40 and 70 °C to allow the primers to associate with their respective target sequences. This step is known as the annealing step and is primer specific. The temperature at which the primers anneal is critical. Too high temperatures would not allow the primers to associate with the DNA, resulting in no or poor amplification. Too low annealing temperature would ultimately lead to non-specific binding of the primers and non-specific amplification. Primers bound to the regions flanking the target DNA provide 3’-hydroxyl groups for DNA polymerase catalyzed extension. The most commonly used DNA polymerase is Taq, a thermo-stable enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium, Thermus aquaticus. The DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands along the template strands, using the primers as starting points. During the extension step the strands are amplified beyond the target DNA. This means that each newly synthesized strand of DNA will have a region complementary to a primer. There is an exponential increase in the amount of DNA produced as the three above mentioned steps are repeated in a cyclic fashion. In a traditional PCR these steps might be repeated 20 to 55 times. A problem, however, with PCR amplification is that the temperature required for DNA strand dissociation also results in DNA polymerase denaturation. This is partially overcome by the bioengineering of polymerases which are more thermal stable and have longer half-lives. Even though RT-PCR is technically more difficult to perform and more expensive than ELISA, it has the ability to allow for the detection of low viral loads. RT- PCR is considered to be 102 to 105 fold more sensitive than traditional ELISA.Mumford, R.A., Fisher, T., Elmore, J., Vickers, D., Swan, H., Walsh, K., Barker, I. and Boonham, N. (2004). The development of a routine direct tuber testing method as a rapid and reliable alternative to the traditional growing- on test. 12th EARP Virology Section Meeting Rennes, France, 2004: abstracts of oral presentations and poster presentation. Available: http://www.rennes.inra.fr/eapr2004/abstracts.htm RT-PCR also allows for the detection of several viral targets in the same reaction through the use of several primer combinations. This is called multiplexing. Although multiplexing is technically more demanding than a traditional simplex reaction it allows for a higher throughput in that a single sample can be tested for several viral strains in a single reaction. Primers used for multiplexing are chosen in such a manner that they result in amplicons of various sizes. This allows for post RT-PCR analysis using gel electrophoresis. Although RT-PCR saves time, allows for multiplexing and is more sensitive than ELISA, the reagents and instrumentation needed are expensive and require a higher level of technical expertise. Also, end product analysis using gel electrophoresis is laborious, relatively more expensive, time consuming and does not lend itself to automation. For these reasons the use of RT-PCR for routine screening is not feasible and has not replaced ELISA. It does, however, provide the industry with the opportunity to screen borderline cases, especially in the case of seed potato certification. Quantitative PCR In most traditional PCRs the resulting products are analyzed after the PCR has been completed. This is called end-point analysis and is normally qualitative of nature rather than being quantitative. For this sort of analysis, products are mostly analyzed on an agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide as a fluorescent dye. Direct correlation between signal strength and initial sample concentration is not possible using end-point analysis since PCR efficiency decreases as the reaction nears the plateau phase. Quantitative PCR, however, offers an accurate and rapid alternative to traditional PCR. Quantitative PCR offers the researcher the opportunity to amplify and analyze the product in a single tube using fluorescent dyes. This is known as homogeneous PCR. During a quantitative PCR the increase in fluorescence is correlated with the increase in product. Through the use of different specific, dyes quantitative PCR can be used to distinguish between different strains of a virus and even to detect point mutations. The major advantage of quantitative PCR is that analysis of resulting products using gel electrophoresis is not required. This means that quantitative PCR can be implemented as a high-throughput technique for sample screening. Quantitative PCR has been described for detectionAgindotan, B. O., Shiel, P. J., Berger, P.

The museum itself is housed in the mansion of the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, formally known as Iliou Melathron (, \\"Palace of Ilion\\"). ==History== Façade close-up. The first tries of coin collecting by the state began shortly after the independence of Greece in Aegina. The collection was enriched after excavations, purchases and donations. The museum was founded in 1838, around the same era with the National Archaeological Museum but it was not until many years after and several decrees that became an independent organization. Initially, the collection was a part of the National Library of Greece and was housed at the main building of the University of Athens and later at the building of the Academy of Athens where the collection was first exhibited. In 1946, the collection was moved at the National Archaeological Museum. The organization of the museum became twice independent, in 1893 and 1965.Papyros Larousse Britannica, Athens, 2006 The Iliou Melathron was granted in order to house the collection in 1984 and after a major renovation it finally opened in 1998. ==The Iliou Melathron== The building in 1910 The Numismatic Museum is housed at the Iliou Melathron, a three-storey building on Panepistimiou Street. It was built between 1878-1880 for Heinrich Schliemann and the architect was the then famous Ernst Ziller. At the time of its completion, it was considered to be the most magnificent private residence of Athens. Its design was inspired by the Renaissance Revival movement as well as Neoclassicism, while the interior is influenced by the architecture of Pompeii. As a result, the rooms are decorated with mosaics and murals depicting either themes from the Trojan War or Greek mottos. In 1927, the widow of Heinrich Schliemann, Sophia, sold the building to the Greek State and it was subsequently used as the seat of the Council of State and later the Court of Cassation. View of the interior of the museum. The use of the building as a courthouse caused much damage. After the building was chosen to house the Numismatic Museum, it underwent a major renovation under which the floor mosaics and the murals were restored. Finally, the numismatic collection was inaugurated in the partly restored building in 1998 while the whole collection became viewable in 2007. ==Collections== The collection of the museum contains 600,000 objects, mainly coins but also medals, standard masses, dies, stamps and others, from the 14th century BC until modern times. The collection is arranged in such a way so as to follow the history of coinage. The museum holds a very important collection of coins from the 6th century BC until the 5th century CE like those from the Greek Poleis and the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There also major Byzantine and Medieval collections from Western Europe, the East and the Ottoman Empire. A large portion of the collection is constituted by coins that were found in hoards while the rest comes from the initial collection of Aegina, recent excavations in mainland Greece and donations. The museum houses a library of 12,000 books specialized in the study of coinage. There is also a perfectly equipped conservation laboratory. ==Location and visitors information== The Numismatic Museum is on 12 Panepistimiou Street near Syntagma Square. It is served by the Syntagma metro station.

In the sociology of religion, the most widely used classification is the church-sect typology. The typology states that churches, ecclesia, denominations and sects form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are break-away groups from more mainstream religions and tend to be in tension with society. Cults and new religious movements fall outside this continuum and in contrast to aforementioned groups often have a novel teaching. They have been classified on their attitude towards society and the level of involvement of their adherents. == Church-sect typology == A diagram of the church-sect typology continuum including church, denomination, sect, cult, new religious movement, and institutionalized sect This church-sect typology has its origins in the work of Max Weber. The basic premise is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of sects to the equilibrium maintaining churches. Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn. Many labels are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably. Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics. These differing religions are often classified by sociologists as ideal types. Ideal types are pure examples of the categories. Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually holds as their ideal type categorisation will vary. Nevertheless, the categorisation scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions. Church and ecclesia Johnstone provides the following seven characteristics of churches:Johnstone. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Upper Sadle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall. * Claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate \\"citizenship\\" with \\"membership\\" * Exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition * Are very closely allied with the state and secular powers; frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement * Are extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor * Employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination * Primarily gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks * Allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions The classical example of a church by this definition is the Catholic Church, especially in the past, such as the State church of the Roman Empire. Islam is a church in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, where there is no separation of church and state. The Basic Law of Saudi Arabia states: \\"[The Constitution of Saudi Arabia is] God's Book [the Qur'an] and the Sunnah of His Prophet [Muhammad]\\".The Basic Law - Saudi Arabia Information These nations are ruled under an official interpretation of religious law (Salafi in the case of Saudi Arabia), and the religious law predominates the legal system. Saudi Arabia, however, lacks Johnstone's criteria for an ordained clergy and a strictly hierarchical structure; however, it has the ulema and their Senior Council with the exclusive power of issuing fatwa,\\"Saudi Fatwa Restrictions and the State-Clerical Relationship\\" by Christopher Boucek Carnegie Endowment 27 October 2010 as well as fiqh jurisprudence through the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta. In the Shi'a denominations, there is a professional clergy led by a Grand Ayatollah. A slight modification of the church type is that of ecclesia.von Wiese 1932 Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body. The state churches of some European nations would fit this type. Denominations The denomination lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. A denomination is one religion among many. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations: # similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times # maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of religious pluralism # rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some actively pursue evangelization # accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute # follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression # train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification # accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches # often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society Most of the major Christian bodies formed post-reformation are denominations by this definition (e.g., Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Seventh-day Adventists). Sects Sociologically, a \\"sect\\" is defined as a newly formed religious group that formed to protest elements of its parent religion (generally a denomination). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they often decry liberal trends in denominational development and advocate a return to so-called \\"true\\" religion. Leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio- economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not yet entirely understood. Most scholars believe that when sect formation involves social class distinctions, they reflect an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status. An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth). After their formation, sects can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination. If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve. If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior. The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects. The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an institutionalized sect can result. Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development. They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. Examples include: Hutterites, Iglesia ni Cristo, and the Amish. Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of Lutheranism and Anglicanism). Examples include: Methodists, Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists. An example of an institutionalized sect that did not become a denomination are the Mennonites. ==Cult typology== The concept of \\"cult\\" has lagged behind in the refinement of the terms that are used in analyzing the other forms of religious origination. Bruce Campbell discusses Troeltsch's concept in defining cults as non- traditional religious groups that are based on belief in a divine element within the individual. He gives three ideal types of cults: # a mystically- oriented illumination type # an instrumental type, in which inner experience is sought solely for its effects # a service-oriented type that focuses on aiding others Bruce Campbell discusses six groups in his analysis: Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation. In the late-nineteenth century a number of works appeared that help in clarifying what is involved in cults.Bruce Campbell (1978). \\"A Typology of Cults.\\" Sociology Analysis, Santa Barbara Several scholars of this subject, such as Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) and Bruce Campbell, have noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual - either soul, self, or true self. Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized. There is a major theme in many of the recent works that shows the relationship between cults and mysticism. Campbell highlights two major types of cults - one mystical and the other instrumental. This analysis can divide the cults into being either occults or metaphysical assemblies. Campbell proposes that cults are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual. Other than the two main types, there is also a third type - the service-oriented cult. Campbell states that \\"the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders\\".Bruce Campbell (1978). \\"A Typology of Cults.\\" Sociology Analysis, Santa Barbara.  Classification by origin and development  In standard sociological typology, cults are, like sects, new religious groups. But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group, though this is by no means always the case. The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they do not advocate a return to pure religion but rather promote embracing something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scriptures or new prophecy). Cults are also much more likely to be led by charismatic leaders than are other religious groups, and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult. Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies synthesized from many sources. According to Ronald L. Johnstone, cults tend to emphasize the individual and individual peace. Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations. As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations. Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics. But their closer semblance to denominations than to the cult type allows classifying them as denominations. Sample denominations in the US that began as cults include Christian Science and the Nation of Islam.  Cults or new religious movements  From the second half of the 20th century, some scholars in the social scientific study of religion have advocated referring to cults as new religious movements (NRMs) https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=new+religious+movement%2C+NRM&case;_insensitive=on&year;_start=1800&year;_end=2000&corpus;=15&smoothing;=3&share;=&direct;_url=t4%3B%2Cnew%20religious%20movement%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bnew%20religious%20movement%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BNew%20Religious%20Movement%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2CNRM%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BNRM%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bnrm%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BNrm%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BnrM%3B%2Cc0 \\\\- hoping to avoid the often pejorative and derogatory connotations attached to the word \\"cult\\" in popular language.  Criticism  Religious scholar John A. Saliba Saliba, John S.J. Understanding new religious movements second edition 2003 Altamira Press, book flap notes the many attempts to draw a classification or typology of cults and/or sects, but concludes that the divergences that exist in these groups' practices, doctrines, and goals do not lend themselves to a simple classification that has universal approval. He argues that the influx of Eastern religious systems, including Taoism, Confucianism and Shintoism, which do not fit within the traditional distinctions between church, sect, denomination and cult, have compounded typological difficulties. Saliba, John A., Understanding New Religious Movements, pp.24-5, (2003), Rowman Altamira, Koehrsen shows that the difficulties of classifying religious groups according to the typology even apply to Christian congregations. Single congregations continuously move on the church-sect spectrum. They switch between \\"churches\\" and \\"sects\\", strategically adapting their religious practices to the given context. Koehrsen, Jens, When Sects Become Middle Class. Impression Management among Middle-Class Pentecostals in Argentina, in: Sociology of Religion 78, (2017), pp. 318–339, .  Meta-criticism  Lorne L. Dawson examines the history and future of the church-sect typology in a 2008 article, opining that the typology survives as a useful tool. ==Wallis' distinction between cults and sects== The sociologist Roy Wallis (1945–1990) introduced differing definitions of sects and cults. He argued that a cult is characterized by \\"epistemological individualism\\" by which he means that \\"the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.\\" According to Wallis, cults are generally described as \\"oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant, non-exclusive\\", making \\"few demands on members\\", without possessing a \\"clear distinction between members and non- members\\", having \\"a rapid turnover of membership\\", and are transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the \\"cultic milieu.\\" Wallis contrasts a cult with a sect in that he asserts that sects are characterized by \\"epistemological authoritarianism\\": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, \\"sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation, such as collective salvation, and their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'.\\"Wallis, Roy The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology (1976) available online (bad scan) Wallis, Roy Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect abstract only (1975) ==Cult and/or new religious movements==  Stark and Bainbridge  In 1975, the sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge distinguish three types of cults, classified on the basis of the levels of organizational and client (or adherent) involvement:Saliba, John S.J. Understanding new religious movements second edition 2003 Altamira press, pages 140-141 * Audience cults which have hardly any organization because participants/consumers lack significant involvement. * Client cults, in which the service-providers exhibit a degree of organization in contrast to their clients. Client cults link into moderate-commitment social networks through which people exchange goods and services. The relationship between clients and the leaders of client cults resembles that of patients and therapists. * Cult movements, which seek to provide services that meet all of their adherents' spiritual needs, although they differ significantly in the degree to which they use mobilize adherents' time and commitment. The sociologist Paul Schnabel has argued that the Church of Scientology originated from an audience cult (the readership of Hubbard's book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health and the Astounding Science Fiction article which had preceded it) into a client cult (Dianetics) then into a cult movement (the Church of Scientology).Schnabel, Paul Tussen stigma en charisma: nieuwe religieuze bewegingen en geestelijke volksgezondheid/Between stigma and charisma: new religious movements and mental health Erasmus University Rotterdam, Faculty of Medicine, Ph.D. thesis, Dutch language, (Deventer, Van Loghum Slaterus, 1982), pages 82, 84-88 literal English translation: \\"Scientology is a fully developed innovative cult movement [...] Scientology grew out of a client cult (Dianetic) and an audience cult (Hubbard's books)\\" Dutch original: \\"Scientology is een volledig ontwikkelde innovatieve cult movement [...] Scientology is voortgekomen uit een client cult (Dianetics) en een audience cult (de boeken van Hubbard).\\"  Roy Wallis  The sociologist Roy Wallis introduced a classification system of new religious movements based on movements' views on and relationships with the world at large. citing Roy Wallis The elementary forms of the new religious life. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. 1984, pp. 10-39 * World-rejecting movements view the prevailing social order as deviant and a perversion of the divine plan. Such movements see the world as evil or at least as materialistic. They may adhere to millenarian beliefs. The International Society of Krishna Consciousness (a.k.a. \\"Hare Krishnas\\"), the Unification Church, the Brahma Kumaris and the Children of God exemplify world-rejecting movements. * World-accommodating movements draw clear distinctions between the spiritual and the worldly spheres. They have few or no consequences for the lives of adherents. These movements adapt to the world but they do not reject or affirm it. * World- affirming movements might not have any rituals or any formal ideology. They may lack most of the characteristics of religious movements. They affirm the world and merely claim to have the means to enable people to unlock their \\"hidden potential\\". As examples of world-affirming movements, Wallis mentions Werner Erhard's est and Transcendental Meditation. ==See also== * Anthropology of religion * List of Christian movements * Psychology of religion * Religious denomination * Sect * Sectarianism * Sociology of religion ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Chryssides, George D., \\"New Religious Movements - Some problems of definition\\", Diskus, Internet Journal of Religion, 1997.

PNRSV is found worldwide due to easy transmission through plant propagation methods and infected seed. The virus is in the family Bromoviridae and genus Ilarvirus. Synonyms of PNRSV include European plum line pattern virus, hop B virus, hop C virus, plum line pattern virus, sour cherry necrotic ringspot virus, and peach ringspot virus. == Hosts and symptoms == More subtle patterning indicating rose mosaic virus. All cultivated species of the genus Prunus, which includes plums, cherries, apricots, almonds, and peaches, are susceptible to one or more strains of PNRSV. Hops and rose are also susceptible to infection by the virus. Other susceptible hosts used for diagnosis include Chenopodium quinoa Willd., sunflower (Helianthus annus), and Momordica balsamina. Symptoms on orchard trees can include death of buds and roots, reduced tree survival and uniformity, and increased susceptibility to winter injury. Some common symptoms also include necrotic “shot holes” in leaves or rugosity and mosaic symptoms. In sweet cherries, PNRSV causes reduced leaf size and produces diffused chlorotic rings and/or spots. Generally, symptoms of PNRSV appear in the year following infection, and then becomes symptomless, although some strains cause recurrent symptoms annually. Although adult trees can show recovery from initial symptoms, keeping young trees virus-free is important because the virus can cause long-lasting stunting compared to healthy trees. It is important to note that symptom severity varies due to host cultivar and viral isolate. == Transmission and epidemiology == PNRSV can be transmitted through plant propagation methods, making spread through tree nursery stock and root grafting in orchards problematic. The virus also has been shown to infect and transmit through pollen and seeds. PNRSV has been shown to be transmitted by bees carrying infected pollen into orchards. PNRSV infects all seed parts, therefore infection of seed can occur from an infected pollen grain, ovule, or both. Seed transmission incidence can be different among different species or varieties of hosts; however, host factors that control viral seed transmission are unknown. Cross pollination with PNRSV infected pollen to healthy plants has shown that the virus can also infect the fruit and not just seeds. The virus can also be transmitted by thrips; however, the contribution and importance of thrips transmission is unknown. == Management and control == The most important measure in controlling PNRSV is through planting of certified virus-free trees. Tree nurseries producing propagative material can use thermotherapy (keeping cultures at 38˚ C for at least 20 days), and/or apical meristem cultures to eliminate PNRSV. Prompt removal of infected trees is often recommended as a control strategy, but is not practical for most growers. Field studies have shown that planting of same or similar cultivars near an infected orchard favored earlier infection than when different cultivars were grown, indicating that planting of unrelated cultivars could help slow spread of the virus and allow healthy trees to bear fruit before infection. Genetically engineered resistance may be a possibility for control in the future using RNA interference silencing. ==ReferencesExternal links== * ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Prunus necrotic ringspot virus * Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Bromoviridae Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Prunus necrotic ringspot virus"},{"id":"12386462","text":"1909 view of Yıldız Palace Yıldız Palace (, ) is a vast complex of former imperial Ottoman pavilions and villas in Istanbul, Turkey, built in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was used as a residence by the Sultan and his court in the late 19th century. == Origin == Yıldız Palace, meaning \\"Star Palace\\", was built in 1880 and was used by the Ottoman Empire Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II. The area of the palace was originally made of natural woodlands and became an imperial estate during the reign of Sultan Ahmed I (1603-1617). Various sultans after Ahmed I enjoyed vacationing on these lands and Sultans Abdülmecid I and Abdülaziz built mansions here. In the late 19th century, Sultan Abdülhamid II left Dolmabahçe Palace because he feared a seaside attack on the palace, which is located at the shore of the Bosporus strait. He expanded the Yıldız Palace and ordered the renowned Italian architect Raimondo D'Aronco to build new buildings to the palace complex. When he moved there, the palace became the fourth seat of Ottoman government (the previous ones were the Eski Saray Old Palace in Edirne, and the Topkapı Palace and Dolmabahçe Palaces in Istanbul. == Layout == The palace is a complex of buildings including the State Apartments Büyük Mabeyn, Şale Pavilion, the Malta Pavilion, the Çadır Pavilion, the Yıldız Theater and Opera House, the Yıldız Palace Museum, and the Imperial Porcelain Factory. The Yıldız Palace Gardens are also a popular public site among the residents of Istanbul. A bridge connects the Yıldız Palace with the Çırağan Palace on the Bosporus through this garden.  State apartments  Government officials working for Abdülhamid II had their offices in this building.  Şale Kiosk  Şale Kiosk The sultan's residence was in the Şale Kiosk or pavilion. The building has two floors and a basement and constructed from a mix of wood and stone. It was constructed in three phases. The first part was built in the 1870s and was designed to resemble a Swiss chalet, hence the name Şale. Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle were among the visitors to this part of the palace. The second section was added in 1889 to accommodate Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was the first foreign monarch to visit Constantinople. It was during this phase that the Sedefli Salon Mother-of-Pearl Salon was added. The name derives from the extensive use of mother-of-pearl that covered almost all of its surfaces. There are also detailed painted landscapes on the ceiling. The third section was also built for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1898. The reception chamber was built during this period and remains the most impressive room in the entire Şale Pavilion. There is a single carpet on the floor that has an area greater than 400 square meters and was hand woven by 60 weavers. Elegant features of the chamber include a gilded, coffered ceiling and large mirrors. Abdülhamid II was a skilled carpenter and actually made some of the pieces of furniture that can be found in the Şale Pavilion.  Malta Kiosk  Malta Kiosk The Malta Kiosk, designed by the architect Sarkis Balyan, is a pavilion located in Yıldız Park to the north side of the wall separating Yıldız Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of Çırağan Palace from the Abdül Aziz I period. The origin of the name is not certain: during the Ottoman era certain parts of palaces were called after the names of conquered places or important battles, so this name is given after the Siege of Malta 1565 siege of Malta; a siege that the Ottoman Empire lost to the Knights of Malta. Malta was never conquered by the Ottoman Turks. The trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.  Çadır Kiosk  Çadır Kiosk It was built by Sultan Abdülaziz (1861–76), who used them as prisons. Today it houses a café and restaurant.  Yıldız Theatre and Opera House  Built by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1889, it has stars on its domed ceiling, a reference to the name of the Yıldız Palace, which means Star Palace. Because no one was allowed to have his back to the sultan, the position of the sultan's balcony box meant that the first row seats were never used.  Yıldız Palace Museum  This used to be Abdülhamid II's carpentry workshop and is now used to display art and objects from the palace.  Imperial Porcelain Factory  Yıldız Porcelain Factory Opened in 1895, the factory was constructed to meet the demand of the upper classes for European- style ceramics. The bowls, vases and plates it produced often pictured idealized scenes of the Bosphorus. The building has an interesting appearance in that it resembles a European medieval castle. == Present use == After the Ottoman Empire ended, the palace was used as a luxury casino before being converted into a guest house for visiting heads of state and royalty. Today it is a museum and its gardens can be used for private receptions, such as the Istanbul Antiques Fair at the Silahhane (Armoury) Hall, which usually takes place in November. The Istanbul office of the OIC is also located within the Yıldız Palace. In Our days, in the museum are organized ceramic or porcelain art exhibitions as Yildiz İbram's 'Ottoman Caftans' ceramic exhibition organized between 1 November-1 December 2013 under the auspices of the 135 years of diplomatic relations between Romania and Turkey, creating a nice ambiance in a unique atmosphere and compatibility regarding the historical past of the palace. The palace is in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul. It is no longer open to the public and no longer a museum. It is now used by the president. ==See also== * Yıldız Clock Tower * Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque * Yıldız Park ==Gallery== File:Yildiz Palace and Park 8162.jpgYildiz Palace and Park Şale Kiosk File:Istanbul Yildiz Palace and Park May 2014 8168.jpgYildiz Palace and Park Sedefli Salon (Mother-of-Pearl Salon) File:Istanbul Yildiz Palace and Park May 2014 8173.jpgYildiz Palace and Park Şale Kiosk and garden File:Yildiz Palace and Park 8198.jpgYildiz Palace and Park Malta Köşk File:Yildiz Palace and Park 8208.jpgYildiz Palace and Park Çadır Köşk (Tent Kiosk) == References == * Eyewitness Travel Guides: Istanbul. 124-125 * Points from Turkey == Literature == * Önder Küçükerman, Nedret Bayraktar, Semra Karakaţli.

During his time with Forest he made 257 appearances across all competitions, and won both the Football League and Full Members Cups twice. After retiring from playing, Sutton moved into coaching. In 2015, he was appointed as Forest's first team goalkeeping coach, a position he held until May 2017. ==Playing career== Nottingham Forest (1977–1992) Sutton was born in Hartington, Derbyshire. He began his career at Nottingham Forest in 1977, rising from youth apprentice to become understudy to England international goalkeeper Peter Shilton. He made his first team debut, aged only 19,Steve Sutton: Part 1 at Sporting-Heroes.net in 1980, although he only began to play regularly after Shilton's departure from Forest in mid-1982. Following the departure in turn of Shilton's replacement, Netherlands international Hans van Breukelen, in 1984, Sutton then had to compete with Hans Segers for the No.1 jersey. When Segers sustained an injury in 1985, Sutton became Brian Clough's regular first-choice in goal for Forest until the end of the decade. During this time Sutton was a part of a team with five England international players – including defensive partners Stuart Pearce and Des Walker. Sutton was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster, during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool on 15 April 1989. After playing in two victorious League Cup finals for Forest in 1989 and 1990,Steve Sutton: Part 2 at Sporting-Heroes.net Sutton's position increasingly came under threat from promising understudy Mark Crossley. Sutton was on the bench, but did not appear as a substitute, during Forest's unsuccessful 1991 FA Cup Final appearance against Tottenham Hotspur. Brief loan periods to Coventry and Luton followed later in 1991. On New Year's Day 1992, Sutton was in goal for Luton against Forest when erstwhile teammate Walker scored his one and only career goal, rescuing a last minute point in a 1–1 draw. Forest finally sold Sutton for £300,000 to local rivals Derby County later in 1992. In his thirteen years with Nottingham Forest Sutton recorded 257Where are they now?: J to Z at NottinghamForest.co.uk appearances for the first team, his moustache and lazy right eye making him something of a club icon during the period. Later career (1992–1998) At Derby Sutton again established himself as a regular, if not immediate choice, in the first team. However, gradually his role became that of permanent reserve and in 1996 he was granted a free transfer to Birmingham City. Following only six appearances, at the expiry of his single year contract with Birmingham Sutton joined Notts County as cover for their goalkeeping line up. With no real prospect of regular match selection Sutton was released from his Notts contract after only four months, to join non- league Grantham Town. As a swansong to his career Sutton went out on something of a high. He played in all but one of Grantham's remaining fixtures in the 1997–98 season, with the team ending the year as Southern League Midlands Division Champions.Steve Sutton profile at TheGingerbreads.co.uk ==Coaching and media career== After hanging up his playing gloves Sutton was employed by a number of clubs as goalkeeping coach, including Leeds United and Notts County, before finding his way back to his alma mater, Nottingham Forest, with the arrival of new manager Colin Calderwood in 2006. Until early 2015 Sutton was employed primarily as the club's Youth Academy goalkeeping coach, but he also stepped up to Assistant Coach for the first team during the caretaker managership of Gary Brazil in the latter part of the 2013–14 season. On his arrival, new manager Dougie Freedman, who replaced Pearce in February 2015, promoted Sutton to goalkeeping coach for the Forest first team. In May 2017, Sutton announced his resignation from Forest, and was replaced by Jim Stewart. Following his departure from Forest, Sutton made appearances on BBC Radio Nottingham as a match summariser. ==Honours== ;Nottingham Forest *Football League Cup: 1988–89, 1989–90 *Full Members Cup: 1988–89, 1991–92 ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hartington, Derbyshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Grantham Town F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. non-playing staff Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Association football goalkeeping coaches ","title":"Steve Sutton (footballer)"},{"id":"12386527","text":"Letterkenny Regional Cultural Centre is a cultural centre located in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland.

It made the first recognised powered and sustained flight in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1908. ==Background== In the early years of the twentieth century, the British Army's limited interest in aeronautical matters was largely confined to the use of tethered balloons or kites for artillery observation purposes. Many people did not believe the Wright Brothers' claims of sustained controlled flight, and in 1907 an officially sanctioned experiment at the Balloon Factory, Farnborough, was limited to the building of the Dirigible No. 1 Nulli Secundus, which was the Army's first powered airship, under the supervision of Colonel J.E. Capper, the superintendent of the factory. In addition some highly secret experiments with gliders were being carried out at Blair Atholl in Scotland by J. W. Dunne in collaboration with Capper. In late 1907 the Director of Fortifications, Capper's immediate superior, was persuaded to allow the use of some of the Balloon Factory's resources for the construction of a powered aircraft, to be designed and built by the American Samuel Franklin Cody, who was at that time working with Capper on the Nulli Secundus. ==Development and design== The Army Aeroplane in course of construction The Army Aeroplane No. 1 was a biplane of similar configuration to that designed by the Wright brothers, being a three bay biplane with horizontal control surfaces mounted in front of the wings and a rudder behind; but was larger, with a wingspan of . The aircraft had a long history of alterations, but as first built it had a short square-section wire- braced wood fuselage, with the engine mounted on top in front of the leading edge of the lower wing, with the pilot's seat behind it. A pair of V struts at the front carried two wheels on an axle, and a tailwheel was mounted at the back. This was augmented by small wheels mounted on the leading edge on the lower wingtips. The wings had wooden spars at the leading and trailing edges and had an arrangement for altering the camber when on the ground by means of tensioned wires between the spars.The Cody FlyerFlight28 May 1954 The wings were connected by streamlined interplane struts, some wind-tunnel experiments on strut sections having been carried out at Farnborough. Lateral control was to be achieved using a pair of small ailerons mounted above the leading edge of the lower wing. The forward-mounted elevator was mounted on three sets of bamboo booms attached to sockets on the leading edge of the wings, the lower members sloping steeply upwards so that the surfaces were just below the level of the upper wing. These could be operated in conjunction to act as elevators as well as assisting in the lateral control of the aircraft. A single rectangular rudder was mounted between two booms, the upper attached to the centre of the rear spar and the lower to the rear of the fuselage. A large canvas triangle was stretched between the trailing edge of the upper wing and the end of the upper tail boom. A small fixed vertical surface was also mounted above the upper wing. The engine drove a pair of tractor propellers using a belt drive. Twin radiators were vertically mounted in a V configuration. The original intention had been to use a 50 hp Panhard-Levassor engine, but this proved unreliable when bench tested. Lacking funding for a new engine, Cody had to wait until the 50 hp (37 kW) Antoinette engine which had been fitted to the Nulli Secundus became available. This happened in August 1908, when Cody transferred the engine to his aircraft. ==Operational history== First flight and Army career The first sustained flight in the UK Cody's friend, assistant and biographer G. A. Broomfield would later claim that the first flight took place in May 1908. A. V. Roe was at that time claimed to have flown in June 1908 and Broomfield wanted to give primacy to Cody. Both claims were later disallowed, with Broomfield's claim for Cody being exposed as an outright hoax.Walker, P.; Early Aviation at Farnborough, Vol. II: The First Aeroplanes, Macdonald 1974, Pages 145 ff. Cody carried out taxiing trials of the aircraft during September, briefly leaving the ground on the last of these. The aircraft was then returned to the workshop for the first of a long series of modifications to be made. The small ailerons were removed, a nosewheel added, the radiators moved outboard from their central position to the forward interplane struts, and modifications were made to the booms supporting the elevator. In this form, with a Union Jack flying from the strut between the upper and lower tail booms, the aircraft was presented to the press at Farnborough on 13 October. After further ground trials Cody finally judged conditions suitable for a flight trial on 16 October, and made the first recognised powered and sustained flight in the United Kingdom, which covered only 1,390 ft (424 m). Hops and Flights - A Roll Call of Early Powered Take-Offs]Flight 3 April 1959 The flight of 16 October ended when Cody attempted a turn to avoid trees and a wingtip touched the ground. The resulting crash caused substantial damage, and the rest of the year was spent in repairing it and making major modifications. The gap between the wings was increased from 8 ft (2.44 m) to 9 ft (2.74 m), the booms carrying both sets of control surfaces lengthened, and provision for lateral control made by installing a wing-warping system and fitting differentially-moving surfaces at each end of the elevator. The radiators were moved to the aft interplane struts, the triangle of canvas that had stretched between the trailing edge of the upper wing and the top of the rudder was removed, and the small vertical stabiliser was moved from above the top wing to a position between the centre booms supporting the elevator, and linked to the rudder control. New larger propellers were fitted.Lewis 1962, p. 187 The Army Aeroplane after Cody's first flight On 6 January 1909 this work was complete and testing continued,The British Army Aeroplane 'Flight' 16 January 1909 on this occasion with a number of streamers attached so that the airflow might be observed. More ground trials were made, the ailerons moved to a position in the middle of the aft interplane struts, and the radiators moved forward slightly to adjust the aircraft's trim. In this form Cody made another flight on 20 January covering about and reaching a height of but crashed after a turn, Cody being unhurt.Penrose 1967, p.146. The aircraft was again taken back to the factory for alterations and repairs. The ailerons were discarded and a pair of horizontal stabilisers were fitted in front of the rudder.Penrose 1967, p.148. Cody flew the aircraft again on 18 February, this time landing with no more damage than a burst tyre and a broken rigging wire. Further successful flights were made on 22 February, after which the rear stabilisers were removed and the ailerons repositioned, now being placed on short outriggers trailing from the forward interplane struts, and the front rudder was moved to a position above the elevator. The Army Aeroplane No.1 in January 1909. Note the streamers attached to the wings Despite the fact that Cody's aircraft could now be considered a success, in February 1909 a report by the Aerial Navigation Sub-Committee of the Committee for Imperial Defence had recommended that all government-funded heavier-than air experimentation should stop, leaving development to the private sector.Driver, 1997, pp. 209–11 Funding was to be provided for the construction of airships; official support for anything else was limited to toleration of aviation activities on some government land. If Cody wished to develop the aircraft further he would have to do so at his own expense and not as an employee of the Balloon Factory. Cody's contract, due for renewal that September, was not renewed, but he was allowed to keep the aircraft, now officially surplus to requirements, and to continue to use Laffan's Plain for flight testing.Hare 1990, p. 10 The Army were left with only a set of drawings of the Army Aeroplane No. 1 labelled \\"Top secret\\", possibly the earliest full set of technical drawings for an aircraft.Penrose 1967, p.152. Subsequent use Cody at the Doncaster Aero Meeting Cody's personal relationship with Capper was unharmed, and he continued to operate the aircraft at Farnborough. On 14 May 1909 he made a flight of over a mile between Laffan's Plain and Danger Hill. Later the same day he attempted to repeat the performance at the request of the Prince of Wales, who was observing Army manoeuvres at Aldershot. Unluckily, on takeoff he was caught by a gust as he turned the machine to avoid some troops on the ground, and was forced to land, the aircraft sustaining some damage to the tail. The Prince was nevertheless satisfied, telling Cody of his pleasure at seeing a British aeroplane that could fly.\\"Mr Cody Flies a Mile\\" Flight 22 May 1910 Back in the workshop, Cody made further adjustments, discarding the twin rudders and moving the radiators so that they were now in front of the front interplane struts. The tailwheel was removed and replaced by a substantial skid. In mid- July Cody flew the aircraft again, managing to complete a circular flight of four miles on 21 July, after which he decided to fit a 60 hp E.N.V. Type F engine.Lewis 1962, p 188 Importantly, the position of the pilot and engine were exchanged: the pilots seat now being directly in front of the leading edge of the wing, and the engine above it. The position of the ailerons was also adjusted; the outriggers were removed, the ailerons now being directly mounted on the forward interplane struts. Apart from very minor adjustments, this was the aircraft's final form. It was flown for three miles on 11 August. Cody was initially startled by the experience provided by the new seating position, recording \\"I find my new position in front of the engine has a much more sensational effects on the nerves than the old position, in fact until last night I never knew I had any nerves. I think, however, I shall get over this slight timidness after a few runs\\".Penrose 1967 p. 181 but the aircraft was now performing well and after several flights on 13 August Cody considered it safe enough to take a passenger. The next day this honour went to Capper, and later that day Cody took his wife for a three-mile flight, making her the first woman to fly in an aeroplane in the United Kingdom.Lewis 1962, p.189 On 8 September 1909 he made a flight lasting over an hour, covering around 40 miles (64 km), landing because he was out of fuel.\\"Mr Cody Flies for Over An Hour\\" Flight 11 September 1909 He also flew the aircraft at the Doncaster Flight Meeting in October 1909. Although he did not win any of the prizes on offer, Cody made use of his appearance to publicly take British citizenship on 28 October, and promptly entered his name for the Daily Mail prize for the first British aircraft to make a circular flight of over a mile.Three Blank Days Flight 30 October 1909 However, the Doncaster meeting had not been sanctioned by the Royal Aero Club, and so any flights made there could not be officially ratified, and the prize was eventually won by J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon on 30 October. In January Cody had hoped to win the £1,000 prize offered by Sir William Hartley for a flight between Manchester and Liverpool, which had to be made before 26 January. Although he took the aircraft to Aintree, his attempt was prevented by fog.Aviation News of the Week- Mr Cody Flies Again, Flight 29 January 1910 After this flight Cody concentrated his efforts on the new aircraft he was building, the Cody Michelin Cup Biplane. ==Nomenclature== Originally Cody's aircraft was officially called the Army Aeroplane No. 1. After the War Office stopped supporting Cody's experiments, it was simply referred to as the Cody Flyer or the equivalent. Any attempt to describe its various forms as the Cody 2 and so forth run the risk of confusing this aircraft with subsequent aircraft built by Cody, and were certainly not used in contemporary sources. Subsequent aircraft tend to be referred to as \\"Mr Cody's new aeroplane\\", subsequently being known by his most notable achievement in the aircraft, as in the Cody Michelin Cup Biplane. To further confuse matters the name \\"Cody Cathedral\\" is indiscriminately used both for this aircraft and for the 1912 Cody V also known as the \\"Military Trials Biplane\\". ==Replica== A full-size replica was built in 2008 by a large team of volunteers at the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust. It was not designed to be flown, but attempted to reproduce faithfully the materials and construction of the original. ==SpecificationsSee also== * List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft ==References== Notes Bibliography *Driver, Hugh The Birth of Military Aviation.

Their importance to the local economy and in local history is commemorated by Bilbie Road in Chew Stoke and in the village sign. ==Bell making== The Bilbie family produced more than 1,350 bells, which are hung in churches all over the West Country. The oldest bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in St Andrews Church, Chew Stoke. Supplies of the tin and copper used to make bell metal were probably obtained from brass foundries in Kelston and Bristol. The metal was melted in a wood-burning furnace to over and then poured into a mould made from loam, or foundry mud, from the River Chew. Legend suggests the Bilbies were wild looking men with long hair who could scarcely read or write, who would never cast a bell except when it was a full moon, midnight, and conditions were perfectly still. It is suggested that the reason Chew Stoke has criss-cross roads is because a sort of bypass was constructed, so that silence needed for making bells would not be disturbed by travellers on horseback or by carriages passing the foundry. ==Church bells== Church bells the Bilbies produced include: * St. Nicholas, Abbotsbury * Church of St John, Axbridge * St Michael and All Angels, Bampton * St Andrews, Banwell * St. George's, Beckington * St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol * St Andrews Church, Chew Stoke * St John the Baptist, Keynsham * All Saints Church, Corston * St Andrews, Cullompton * St John the Baptist Parish Church, Glastonbury * St Giles Church, Leigh-on-Mendip * Church of St. John the Baptist, Lustleigh * Parish Church of Marwood, North Devon * St Margaret's, Northam, Devon * Sherborne Abbey * Old Church, Uphill, Somerset * All Saints, Wraxall * All Saints, Wrington * St John the Baptist, Yeovil * Church of St Peter, Zeal Monachorum ==Clock making== A Long Case clock by John Bilbie on display at King John's Hunting Lodge, Axbridge Edward Bilbie is thought to have learnt the clockmaking trade from Edward Webb, who died in 1694. Bilbie started casting bells in 1698, and it is highly probable that he was making clocks by this time. Around this time Bristol was one of the most important centres for clock making outside London. This was in part due to the strong brass founding industry which had developed in response to a healthy export demand and the abundant supply of the raw materials – copper and zinc – in the west. In the late 17th century the clock making industry thrived in the Chew Valley of Somerset thanks to Thomas Veale, Edward Webb and Edward Bilbie, whose clock making was conducted alongside their bell-founding work. Such a concentrated effort resulted in a distinctive local style of lantern clock. Their clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They produced mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but they also made high quality eight-day movements with additional features such as indicating the high tide at Bristol docks. These were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases that now command the highest prices. ==Family members== Several generations of the family were involved in the business. Edward Bilbie I (1666–1724) It is not known how Edward Bilbie learnt to cast bells, but it is clear that he cast his first bell in 1698 for St Andrews Church in Chew Stoke. In the period from 1698 to 1723, Edward was responsible for the casting of 67 bells for churches all over Somerset. Edward Bilbie II (1694–1726) The eldest son of Edward I learnt bell making from his father, but died only a few months after him and never had the chance to produce his own work. Thomas Bilbie (1702–1778) Edward I's younger son Thomas took over the bell and clock making businesses in 1725, completing contracts already agreed, and traveling further for new ones. One of his largest commissions was for the \\"Great Bell\\" at Yeovil which was recast from to . In 1742 he gained a contract to cast bells for the church at Cullompton, Devon. In 1746 he set up a bell making foundry there known as the \\"West of England Church Bellfoundry\\" so that he could expand the business south and west of Somerset, and reduce the transportation problems from the original foundry. Between 1725 and 1768 he was responsible for 350 bells in churches in Somerset, Devon, Bristol, Dorset and Gloucestershire, with one in Caernarfon in Wales. Edward Bilbie 1716 – 1786 Edward Bilbie continued the family bell founding tradition, making several bells, including one for the Church of St Peter in Catcott, Somerset. Thomas Bilbie II of Cullompton (1727–1780) Following his father Thomas's creation of the second foundry in Cullompton, Thomas II or Thomas Bilbie Junior cast bells for most of the churches in Devon, providing a total of 237 between 1754 and 1780. Abraham Bilbie (1729–1773) Abraham took over the business in Chew Stoke from his father Thomas for five years, during which time he was responsible for 35 bells including rings of six for South Wraxall, Winscombe and Portishead. William Bilbie (1730–1789) William was the third son of Thomas and was in charge of the Chew Stoke foundry from 1775–1790, during which time he produced 79 bells. John Bilbie of Axbridge (1736–1767) John Bilbie had a workshop in Axbridge where he made longcase clocks. An example can be seen in the King John's Hunting Lodge Museum. Edward Bilbie IV (1766–1796) Edward Bilbie made longcase clocks which were known for their engraved decoration to the dial centre. Thomas Webb Bilbie (1758–1829) and James Fear Bilbie (1763–1819) Thomas and James were unable to adapt the business and compete with increasing competition. The Chew Stoke bell foundry declined, casting 25 bells between 1791 and 1811. Thomas Castleman Bilbie of Cullompton (1758–1813) Thomas Castleman Bilbie was the fourth generation of bellfounders and continued the business in Cullompton, casting 198 bells between 1781 and 1814. ==References== Category:Bell foundries of the United Kingdom Category:History of Somerset Category:English clockmakers Category:English families ","title":"Bilbie family"},{"id":"12386638","text":"Hervé Bugnet (born 24 August 1981) is a retired French footballer who played as a striker. ==External links== * * Profile at L'Équipe Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:French footballers Category:France youth international footballers Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:FC Martigues players Category:LB Châteauroux players Category:Le Havre AC players Category:Montpellier HSC players Category:Dijon FCO players Category:Lucena CF players Category:Chamois Niortais F.C. players Category:Thonon Évian F.C. players ","title":"Hervé Bugnet"},{"id":"12386662","text":"The Ceair is a left tributary of the river Urluia in Romania.Cursuri de apă din județul Constanța înscrise în Cadastrul Apelor din România It flows into the Urluia near Tufani.

In 1983, İPRAŞ and three other publicly owned refineries were brought into state control under the Tüpraş umbrella.

According to the hypothesis, certain episodes in Njáls saga and Þorsteins saga Síðu-Hallssonar drew on this lost saga. There is no external evidence of this saga's existence, though it was postulated by the Icelandic scholar Einar Ólafur Sveinsson, who edited Njál's saga in 1954. He believed it could have been written as early as the 1190s and used by the author of Orkneyinga saga, who wrote in about 1200. A controversial approach by the Irish academic Donnchadh Ó Corráin has attracted notice. He believed that the likely date of composition of the original Brjáns saga was around 1100, when Magnus Barelegs posed a threat to Irish interests (Clarke et al., 1998, p. 449). He believed that the hypothetical saga was written in Dublin in response to the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib as the Hiberno-Norse Dubliners' way of saying that they were loyal to the descendants of Brian. He uses a reference to Brian in Þorsteins saga Síðu-Hallssonar as evidence for the saga's existence: \\"The earl thanked him for his words. After that they traveled to Ireland and fought with king Brian, and there many remarkable events happened at the same time as is said in his Saga.\\" ==See also== *Brian Boru ==References== * Howard B.

NFHiB runs as a 'not for profit', voluntary group established to support and help any individual or group who is experiencing a problem relating to ‘Neighbours From Hell’ (NFH). ==About Neighbours From Hell in Britain== NFHiB provide information and support with neighbour conflict and are actively involved in advocating for change in the legislation and procedures that currently relate to neighbour conflict. The site has gathered recognition during the last 5 years, and has featured in the media. Neighbours From Hell in Britain has also made submissions to the Home Office 'Anti–Social Behaviour, Fifth Report of Session 2004–05' regarding Anti-Social Behaviour. Neighbours From Hell in Britain is also regularly referred to by UK GovernmentDefra, UK Noise: Links' (11 September 2006)Home Office, Crime Reduction - Neighbour Noise, a guide for the public' (2006) Departments, UK Local Authorities and Police Forces within their official literature. NFHiB has developed an agenda based on the experience and knowledge of NFHiB Forum members; its motto is 'Support for all, which is free for all'. No mandatory charges are asked for and the site exists via personal funding and voluntary donations from members and visitors. According to Neighbours From Hell in Britain, the most common forms of neighbour-orientated nuisance stem from issues around Noise, Anti-Social Behaviour, Harassment, Bullying, Boundary Problems and more frequently with Car/Vehicle Parking issues. ==May 2006 Survey== Over 1000 participants, questioned in an online survey conducted by NFHiB during May 2006, indicated that problems with Noise (21.82%) were the highest source of neighbour disputes, followed by issues around Anti-Social Behaviour (14.30%), Harassment (9.75%) and Boundary Problems / Car Parking Issues both sharing the same 4.27% of survey respondents problems. == NFHiB Forum Community == The Neighbours From Hell in Britain online forum community is presented on NFHiB and forms the basis of much information exchange and advice, largely via member-to-member based support. A large and more general 'NFH: What's your story?' area for more complex neighbour from hell situations and issues also exists; and a specific area which covers the laws of Scotland which often differ regarding nuisance neighbour legislation. The forum is led and moderated by a team of 'Topic Leaders' who are part of the 'NFHiB Support Team' and are the 'official face' of the community. == Interviews == NFHiB has conducted online interviews and obtained exclusive question and answer sessions with notable individuals. These have included Louise Casey of the Home Office 'Respect Task Force' Interview with Louise Casey, Co-ordinator of Home Office 'Respect Task Force' (May 2006) and Frank Field, MP, during 2004.Interview with Frank Field (2004) ==References== Category:Internet properties established in 2002 Category:British websites Category:Political organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Neighbours from Hell in Britain"},{"id":"12386835","text":"Abington Park, in the Abington district of Northampton, has lakes, aviaries, and a museum, as well as trees and grassy open spaces. ==Origins== Elizabeth Bernard, granddaughter of William Shakespeare, lived in the Manor House in the mid-seventeenth century The park contains the ruins of the former village of Abington, the site of a medieval manorhouse with a mill attached, mentioned in the Domesday book in 1086. The Abington gallows used for the five hangings in 1612 following the Northamptonshire witch trials, amongst the first in England to use trial by ducking stool, are believed to have been situated at the crossroads in Abington Park. The village was enclosed and depopulated when the manor was enlarged and parklands created by the Thursby family in the late 17th century. Parishes: Abington ==Abington Park Manor House== The museum was originally a manor house built at the turn of the 16th century. The Great Hall, now called the Oak Room because of its oak panelling, dates back to 1500. It was once home to William Shakespeare's granddaughter, Elizabeth Bernard née Elizabeth Hall, who was buried in 1670 in the adjacent late 12th- century church of St Peter and St Paul. Her second marriage was to Sir John Bernard or Barnard, the MP for Huntingdon from 1660, who successively enlarged the house in the 1660s. It passed to the Thursby family in 1669 and was further enlarged and remodelled in the classical Georgian style between 1738 and 1743 by William Thursby. While owned by the Thursbys, the actor David Garrick planted a mulberry tree in the grounds in 1778, in recognition of his friendship with Anne Thursby. In 1821, during repairs to the church, all but the main tower of the church was blown down in a storm; the Thursbys rebuilt the main body of the church, which retains few of its original features. In 1841 the manor was sold and its contents auctioned off. It was converted into a lunatic asylum in 1845, directed first by Thomas Octavius Prichard and later his cousin Thomas Prichard. The asylum was closed in 1892, when the Manor House and grounds were donated to Northampton Council. In 1994 the house was reopened as a museum after a complete restoration. The museum features displays about the social history of Northamptonshire (including a costume collection) and its military history (including artefacts from the Northamptonshire Regiment). The Museum of Leathercraft is also based in the house. ==The Park== Abington Park Abington Park has a bandstand which is suitable for hosting a selection of brass band, concert band, folk or jazz music. It was the venue for the annual 'Folk in the Park' festival until it moved to Delapré Park. The park also contains two lakes and a model boating lake, connected by a stream. The largest of the lakes was remodelled in the 1920s. There is also a play park, a cafe, tennis courts, outdoor table tennis, and a rose garden, as well as the church of St Peter and St Paul. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Abington Park Museum *Museum of Leathercraft Category:Buildings and structures in Northampton Category:Tourist attractions in Northampton Category:Regimental museums in England Category:Fashion museums in the United Kingdom Category:Local museums in Northamptonshire Category:Museums established in 1899 Category:1899 establishments in England Category:Parks and open spaces in Northamptonshire ","title":"Abington Park"},{"id":"12386843","text":"Allison Taylor is a fictional character portrayed by Cherry Jones on the TV series 24. The first female President of the United States within the 24 universe and a Republican, she took office in the TV movie, 24: Redemption and served in Season 7 and Season 8. ==Concept and creation== Cherry Jones was the first major casting addition to the seventh season. Jones was cast as Taylor when the program's producers contacted her agent; she had no prior experience of 24, as she said in an interview, \\"It was the last thing in the world [she] saw coming\\".Hillary Will Be Soooo Jealous \\"It’s time to go back to an idealized president—a well-articulated and idealized president,\\" said Howard Gordon. \\"[Her] greatest flaw is her idealism. And I think that's a fun part to play. What happens when somebody's idealism butts up against the realpolitik of the world? But she's a very human character, and I think a very strong president and aspirational in the kind of way David Palmer was.\\" \\"It is an heroic administration. Cherry Jones plays the president brilliantly,\\" he continued. Cherry Jones described her character as nothing like Hillary Clinton, and instead described her as a combination of Lyndon Johnson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Golda Meir, and John Wayne, however she would have similar opinions to Barack Obama.‘24’ Star Cherry Jones on Playing the President and What She Thinks of Meryl Streep in ‘Doubt’ Jones said of her portrayal of Taylor as making her look exhausted, commenting that the job of President has a way of sucking the life out of people. She hopes that her portrayal of Taylor might convince the American public that a woman can be president,Cherry Jones is model president similar to the way that Dennis Haysbert's portrayal of David Palmer apparently helped Obama's election.The US election in figures Jones has said that Taylor is \\"an honorable, courageous, upright kind of gal [and] very much her own person. [...] The president makes a very bold move, which then sets off the cataclysmic events\\" that the US has yet to experience. ==Characterization== Prior to her election as president, Taylor was a U.S. Senator, and defeated the incumbent President Noah Daniels in the election. Given Cherry Jones's characterization of President Taylor, that would make her a Republican, since Daniels was vice-president in the administration of Democrat Wayne Palmer. ==Appearances== Redemption Taylor is shown preparing for her Inauguration as the President and preparing to take office after Noah Daniels. Season 7 Shortly after Taylor's inauguration, her son, Roger, died under mysterious circumstances. A thorough investigation concluded that Roger, who worked in the private financial sector, committed suicide. She was later informed that Roger had been fingered by the federal government for insider trading, and killed himself shortly before being indicted. According to her chief of staff, a political ally of the President covered it up. While Taylor was able to cope with Roger's death and effectively continued her executive duties, the First Gentleman, Henry Taylor, did not take Roger's death very well, and struggled mightily with its aftermath. On Day 7, Taylor is preparing to send U.S. troops into Sangala to stop a genocidal campaign by the regime of General Benjamin Juma. During Day 7 as the US is threatened by Iké Dubaku, one of Juma's Colonels, she stands her ground throughout and refuses to withdraw US forces from Sangala despite pressure from her advisers and even after Dubaku uses the CIP device to crash two airliners into each other, inflicting hundreds of casualties. Furthermore, still after her husband Henry Taylor was kidnapped and threatened with execution by Dubaku's men, Taylor refused to order US forces to withdraw from Sangala. Later after the threat from Dubaku had subsided, General Benjamin Juma lead a team of commandos to attack the White House, taking Taylor and many other White House personnel hostage. Taylor is forced under duress to deliver a live speech via the internet apologising for the US invasion of Sangala, during which Bill Buchanan sacrifices his life as part of the rescue operation which eventually ends the hostage situation against Taylor and the White House. Taylor later offers her previously estranged daughter, Olivia, a position on her administration as an adviser much to the dismay of Ethan Kanin, Taylor's Chief of Staff. As the events of the day unfold, Ethan Kanin is forced to resign after Jack Bauer is framed for the murders of Senator Mayer and Ryan Burnett, one of the US-based co-conspirators as Kanin had authorized Bauer to be freed from custody to continue the investigation. As a result, President Taylor makes Olivia Taylor her acting Chief of Staff. She orders an airstrike on the Starkwood compound after Tony Almeida locates the bioweapon canisters, but is forced to abort when Hodges discovers the strike and threatens to deploy the missiles. She indirectly authorizes a deniable covert operation however, allowing Tony to destroy the canisters before the missiles could be launched. After the Starkwood threat is averted and Jonas Hodges was taken into custody, she decides to offer Hodges an immunity and witness protection deal in exchange for information about the other co- conspirators. This leads to her daughter, the Acting Chief of Staff, Olivia, to order Hodges' assassination as revenge for Roger's death. This is later discovered and President Taylor is faced with the dilemma of either covering Olivia's crime up or turning her in to the authorities, decides the latter, stating that she swore an oath when she became President of The United States to uphold the constitution. This leads to her husband filing for a divorce, and in Season 8 she is no longer married. Season 8 President Taylor is in New York at the UN to sign a peace treaty with President Omar Hassan of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan. During the turmoil that would visit the day, she built a great rapport and deep trust and friendship with President Omar Hassan and his family. Following Hassan's assassination by IRK extremists who threatened New York with a dirty bomb and the assassination of President Omar Hassan, President Taylor called upon former president Charles Logan to assist in keeping the negotiations on-track. She is persuaded by Logan to cover-up Russian involvement in the day's events, and to lock-down Jack Bauer to stop him revealing it; when Bauer escapes all law-enforcement agencies are given \\"shoot to kill\\" orders in Taylor's name via President Charles Logan. Also at Logan's behest, she allows CTU mole Dana Walsh to be secretly tortured for the location of an incriminating data file she made and arrests journalist Meredith Reed to stop her publishing the story. When new IRK president Dalia Hassan learns of the cover-up she threatens to withdraw from the negotiations. Taylor responds by threatening to declare war and use the full might of the US military (strongly implied to include nuclear retaliation) on the country if the treaty is not signed. During the season finale, Taylor has a moral epiphany and refuses to sign the peace treaty at the last moment as the last signee. She reveals the cover-up and the lengths many have gone to maintain it that day. She realizes that she betrayed her own moral fiber and guiding light. As the season progressed she insulated herself from others – much like is seen with Charles Logan before his fall from the presidency. He is also the \\"poison\\" that fatally sickens the Taylor administration. Citing her role in the cover-up, Taylor also plans to resign from office, surrender herself to the Attorney General and face whatever consequences there are for her actions. She also cancels Logan's order for Bauer to be murdered, but advises him to flee the country as both Americans and Russians will be after him for his actions. Taylor and Chloe both promise to buy him as much time as they can, but neither are sure how long he will have. It is believed that Taylor's vice president Mitchell Hayworth concluded her term after her resignation. ==Critical reception== Ken Tucker describes the character played by Cherry Jones as \\"Hillary Clinton if there was no Obama\\" and adds that this \\"fresh character...mingles nicely with familiar faces\\".Ken Tucker, “24: Mondays, 9 p.m., premiering Sunday, Jan. 11, at 8 p.m.,” Entertainment Weekly 1030 (January 16, 2009): 56.

In 1899 Doyne discovered colloid bodies lying on Bruch's membrane that appeared to merge, forming a mosaic pattern that resembled a honeycomb. Afterwards this disorder was referred to as \\"Doyne's honeycomb choroiditis\\". Today this condition is known to be a rare hereditary form of macular degeneration that results in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Other names for the disorder are: \\"macular drusen\\", \\"malattia leventinese\\", \\"dominant radial drusen\\" and \\"Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy\\". In 1889, he was the first physician to describe angioid streaks, a disorder that affects Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid.

A level within the game The development title was Roadrunner Rescue, and it was inspired by the better-known Lode Runner. Freddy--the player's character--was supposed to rescue the roadrunners in the park before the maintenance robots-run-amok disposed them. There was a crude program for editing mazes, but it wasn't in the shipped version, at least partly because IBM felt it made the game too much like Lode Runner. ==Development== The game is written mostly in compiled BASIC v1.0, with a few assembly modules linked in for graphics, sound, and keyboard support. This can be confirmed by looking at the executable. The assembly module(s) for graphics were included largely for performance, and included rudimentary sprite support. The keyboard support received careful attention, due to negative experiences with games that dropped keystrokes. Most of the game-play timing was based on the PC's system clock (the 18.55 Hz ticker), making it relatively independent of CPU speed. ==References== Category:1984 video games Category:Platform games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Freddy's Rescue Roundup"},{"id":"12386899","text":"Historical AS Roma positions in Serie A This is a list of seasons played by A.S.

The phrase \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" is particularly applicable to data mining and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting in out-of-range values (e.g., Income: −100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes), and missing values, etc. Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. Thus, the representation and quality of data is first and foremost before running any analysis.Pyle, D., 1999. Data Preparation for Data Mining. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Los Altos, California. Often, data preprocessing is the most important phase of a machine learning project, especially in computational biology. If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, then knowledge discovery during the training phase is more difficult. Data preparation and filtering steps can take considerable amount of processing time. Data preprocessing includes cleaning, Instance selection, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. The product of data preprocessing is the final training set. Data pre-processing may affect the way in which outcomes of the final data processing can be interpreted. This aspect should be carefully considered when interpretation of the results is a key point, such in the multivariate processing of chemical data (chemometrics). ==Tasks of data pre-processing== *Data cleansing *Data editing *Data reduction *Data wrangling ==Data mining== The origins of data preprocessing are located in data mining. The idea is to aggregate existing information and search in the content. Later it was recognized, that for machine learning and neural networks a data preprocessing step is needed too. So it has become to a universal technique which is used in computing in general. From a users perspective, data preprocessing is equal to put existing comma-separated values files together. Data are usually stored in files. The CSV format was mentioned already but it's possible that the data are stored in a Microsoft Excel sheet or in a json file. A self-created script is applied to the file. From a technical side the script can be written in Python and in R (programming language). The reason why a user transforms existing files into a new one is because of many reasons. Data preprocessing has the objective to add missing values, aggregate information, label data with categories (Data binning) and smooth a trajectory. More advanced techniques like principle component analysis and feature selection are working with statistical formulas and are applied to complex datasets which are recorded by GPS trackers and motion capture devices. ==Semantic data preprocessing== Complex problems are asking for more elaborated analyzing techniques of existing information. Instead of creating a simple script for aggregating different numerical values into one, it make sense to focus on semantic based data preprocessing. Here is the idea to build a dedicated ontology which explains on a higher level what the problem is about. The Protégé (software) is the standard tool for this purpose. A second more advanced technique is Fuzzy preprocessing. Here is the idea to ground numerical values with linguistic information. Raw data are transformed into natural language. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Online Data Processing Compendium *Data preprocessing in predictive data mining. Knowledge Eng.

On 21 April 1896, his father had been recognised as a dynast of the house as Prince Sizzo of Schwarzburg, having previously lacked succession rights due to his parents' morganatic marriage.House Laws of Schwarzburg In 1909 the two Schwarzburg principalities were united in a personal union under Prince Günther of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. This followed the extinction of the elder Sondershausen branch, at which point Friedrich Günther became second in line to the united principality, following Sizzo. But the German Revolution prompted Prince Günther to abdicate on 22 November 1918, thereby ending the rule of the House of Schwarzburg. After Prince Günther's death on 16 April 1925, Sizzo succeeded as head of the deposed princely House of Schwarzburg until his own death on 24 March 1926, which left his son Friedrich Günther as the head of the family and claimant to the throne of the Principality of Schwarzburg. ==Marriage== Prince Friedrich Günther was married on 7 April 1938 at Heinrichau (present-day Henryków, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Silesia) to Princess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1911–1988), eldest daughter of William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. The marriage proved short- lived and less than a year later on 1 November 1938 they were divorced, without children.Willis, Daniel A., The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain, Clearfield Company, 2002, p. 715. ==Death and succession== Following Friedrich Günther's death in 1971 in Munich the male line of the House of Schwarzburg became extinct. Historically the Schwarzburg principalities could descend by semi-Salic primogeniture: in the event of the extinction of all male dynasts (as happened with the death of Prince Friedrich Günther) females were, prior to abolition of the Principality of Schwarzburg in 1918, eligible to inherit the throne. Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg (1898–1984), the only sibling of Prince Friedrich Günther, by her 1925 marriage to Count Friedrich Magnus zu Solms-Wildenfels (1886-1945), was the mother of Friedrich Magnus (b. 1927), the sixth Count zu Solms-Wildenfels to bear that name and to head the Wildenfels cadet branch of the House of Solms. Neither of the latter's two sons, Michael (b. 1949) and Konstantin (b. 1950), nor his younger brother, Albrecht (b. 1929), have children. Another interpretation of the succession to the principality of Schwarzburg in the event of the extinction of males of its Sondershausen and Rudolstadt branches was put forth by the German jurist, Hermann Schulze in 1883.Schulze, Hermann. Hausgesetze der regierenden deutschen Fürstenhäuser, vol. 3. Mauke. Iena, 1883, pp. 321-39. (German) He noted that inter-dynastic inheritance pacts contracted by semi- sovereign vassals of the Holy Roman Emperors remained legally enforceable in the German Empire after the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire itself in 1806, and conferred rights on male heirs superior to those of female heirs inheriting by semi-Salic primogeniture. In 1433 Count Heinrich of Schwarzburg and his son entered a pact with Botho, Count of Stolberg whereunder, if the Schwarzburg male line became extinct then Stolberg and the Counts of Hohenstein would share the majority of the Schwarzburg territories. With the extinction of the House of Hohenstein the houses of Schwarzburg and Stolberg renewed the pact on 28 January 1594. Philipp, 5th Prince zu Stolberg- Wernigerode (born 1967) is the seniormost male descendant by primogeniture of Botho of Stolberg.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser XVI. \\"Stolberg\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2001, pp. 321, 323. . Phlilipp's first marriage in 2001 to Countess Caroline von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (b. 1971) ended in a divorce.

The programme was agreed and announced on 12 November 1995 at Millbrook Resort, near Queenstown, New Zealand, at the conclusion of the fourteenth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Millbrook introduces compulsory adherence to the Harare principles, and, in enforcing them, includes aspects of both carrot and stick approaches. The programme encourages the membership to empower the Commonwealth Secretariat to provide incentives for upholding the core political values of the Harare Declaration: democracy, rule of law, and good governance. However, the programme also allows the Secretariat to employ bilateral and multilateral punishments against intransigent members. For serious or persistent offending countries, suspension and expulsion from the Commonwealth altogether are permitted. The programme cites an unconstitutional coup d'état against a democratically elected government as a particularly serious violation. To help monitor and enforce adherence to the Harare Declaration, Millbrook established the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which has the responsibility to examine cases of potential breaches and to recommend appropriate action to be taken by the Secretariat. Convened by the Secretary-General and consisting of Foreign Minister (or equivalent) of eight members, the composition, terms of reference, and operative functions of CMAG are reviewed every two years under the programme. ==FootnotesExternal links== * Full text of the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme Category:History of the Commonwealth of Nations Category:1995 documents Category:Otago Category:1995 in international relations ","title":"Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme"},{"id":"12387036","text":"The Bassa vah alphabet.

This house was used as a set in the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Grafton is a ghost town, just south of Zion National Park in Washington County, Utah, United States. Said to be the most photographed ghost town in the West, it has been featured as a location in several films, including 1929's In Old Arizona--the first talkie filmed outdoors--and the classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The nearest inhabited town is Rockville. ==History== The site was first settled in December 1859 as part of a southern Utah cotton-growing project ordered by Brigham Young (see Utah's Dixie). A group from Virgin led by Nathan Tenney established a new settlement they called Wheeler. Wheeler didn't last long; it was largely destroyed on the night of January 8, 1862 by a weeks-long flood of the Virgin River, part of the Great Flood of 1862. The rebuilt town, about a mile upriver, was named New Grafton, after Grafton, Massachusetts. The town grew quickly in its first few years. There were some 28 families by 1864, each farming about an acre (0.4 hectare) of land. The community also dug irrigation canals and planted orchards, some of which still exist. Grafton was briefly the county seat of Kane County, from January 1866 to January 12, 1867, but changes to county boundaries in 1882 placed it in Washington County.Bradley, p.100. Flooding was not the only major problem. One particular challenge to farming was the large amounts of silt in Grafton's section of the Virgin River. Residents had to dredge out clogged irrigation ditches at least weekly, much more often than in most other settlements. Grafton was also relatively isolated from neighboring towns, being the only community in the area located on the south bank of the river. In 1866, when the outbreak of the Black Hawk War caused widespread fear of Indian attacks, the town was completely evacuated to Rockville. Continued severe flooding discouraged resettlement, and most of the population moved permanently to more accessible locations on the other side of the river. By 1890 only four families remained. The end of the town is usually traced to 1921, when the local branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was discontinued. The last residents left Grafton in 1944. A United Press news item dated May 23, 1946, stated that the town was purchased by movie producer Harry Sherman as a film location site. He bought it from William Russell, 80, a descendant of the co-founder, and one the town's three current inhabitants.United Press, \\"Utah Town Purchased As Film Location Site\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 24 May 1946, Volume 52, page 2. ==Restoration== In June 1997, the Grafton Heritage Partnership was organized to protect, preserve, and restore the Grafton Townsite. With cooperation from former Grafton residents, the Utah State Historical Society, the BLM, the Utah Division of State History, and others, the old church, Russell Home, Louisa Foster Home, the Berry fence in the cemetery, and John Wood home were restored, with new windows, doors, roofing and other structural enhancements to represent the period in which they were built. In addition, of farmland were purchased, on which agricultural operations are performed to enhance the farming appearance. The site is under 24-hour surveillance. The partnership is currently looking for a live-in caretaker to oversee the preservation of the townsite.

Another more basic conversion from the DH.4 was the Nine-Hour Cruiser which retained the open cockpit with room for two passengers behind but had an increased fuel load. ==Specifications (KT Cabin Cruiser)See alsoReferences== * Category:1920s United States civil utility aircraft Cabin Cruiser Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1921 ","title":"Dayton-Wright Cabin Cruiser"},{"id":"12387135","text":"Pickle Wars is an MS-DOS platform game created in 1993 by Karen Crowther (now Karen Chun) through Redwood Games and published by MVP Software. The script was written by Ellen Beeman. A planet gets invaded by aliens (mainly pickles). The player (alternating between playing a man and a woman) goes on a journey to find hidden weapons. The player needs to collect all the SaladShooters in the level to pass through the exit door. The player can then shoot salad at the aliens, and the aliens will faint. Junk food and pickles are collectible for points, and carrots are for health. ==Story== There were three episodes. The first of three episodes, entitled \\"Invasion of the Pickle People\\" was shareware. The other two episodes are purchasable. Bobby Prince composed the music. Episode I: Invasion of the Pickle People The peaceful planet of Arcadia, inhabited by humans, is attacked by pickles who want to take over the planet. Arcadia has no weapons because there has not been any need for centuries. It becomes Dave's quest to go and find a hidden \\"Depository\\" of weapons. He finds an old crazy man named Lord Geric who knows of a doomsday device. A character named Linda also comes to find hidden weapons, and becomes playable for the second half of the episode. Dave and Linda eventually find all of the secret weapons. The pickles decide to interrogate one of the humans, and grab Linda in a jar before she reveals the information she has found to Dave. Episode II: Escape from the Pickle Planet Linda's escape from the Pickle Planet. Episode III: The Search for the Doomsday Machine The pickles get a hold of the doomsday machine and arm it. Dave and Linda must do their best to save Arcadia. == Legacy == As MVPSoft ended the sale of the game around 2009, they offer the registered game version as freeware download.registered on mvpsoft.com \\"Free downloads of registered versions - The registered versions for some of our titles are available for free download at pub.mvpsoft.com/attic/registered.

The R-390 had done its job so well that the Corps decided continued use of this type of receiver necessitated an improved, reduced-cost version. There are many references to the R390A in the open literature during this period; a picture of the receiver appeared in the May 1959 issue of the amateur radio magazine QST. Total production of the R-390A (as determined by the high serial numbers noted) is over 55,000 units. Initial production started in 1955 and ran through approximately 1970, and then was restarted in 1984 by Fowler Industries for Avondale Shipyards. Manufacturers and their approximate production numbers are: * Collins Radio Company 6,363 * Electronic Assistance Corp 15,338 (includes Dittmore Freimuth marked radios) * Capehart 4,242 * Motorola 14,873 * Stewart Warner 6,631 * Amelco/Teledyne/Imperial 7,958 (these companies were related through acquisitions) * Fowler Industries 5 Companies which made spare modules, but not whole sets were Communications Systems Corp., Clavier Corp. and Hacking Labs. ==Design== The R-390A is a general coverage radio receiver capable of receiving amplitude modulated, code, and frequency shift keying signals. Its tuning range is from 500 kilohertz to 32 megahertz, in 32 one-megahertz bands. The circuit is the superheterodyne type, double conversion above 8 MHz, below which triple conversion is used. It employs 23 vacuum tubes (6AK6 x 3, 5654 x 2, 12AU7/5814A x 4, 26Z5W x 2, 3TF7 x 1, 6BA6/5749W x 6, 6C4/6100 x 3, 6DC6 x 1, 0A2WA x 1), a larger than normal count for most general-coverage receivers. The receiver weighs 85 pounds and can be operated on 120 volt or 240 volt supplies. It fits neatly into a 10.5 inch-tall standard 19 inch equipment rack.Operator's Manual: Radio Receiver R-390A/URR.. Headquarters, Department of the Army; 1989. p. 3–.Field and Depot Maintenance Manual: Radio Receiver R-390A/URR.. Headquarters, Department of the Army; 1990. Tuning of the R-390A's radio frequency and intermediate frequency front end is synchronized by means of an ingenious mechanical system of racks, gears, and cams. When the front panel tuning controls are rotated, this system raises and lowers ferrite slugs in and out of the receiver's tuning coils. This ensures that all front- end circuits are tracked, meaning all circuits are tuned to the correct frequency to maintain excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The receiver's construction is modular for easy servicing. Each major area of the receiver is contained in easily removable subassemblies, and these can be repaired or replaced as needs be. Though the R-390A is mechanically and electrically complex, alignment and servicing were designed to follow simplified procedures published by the Signal Corps. ==Use== The R-390A was deployed to most branches of the US military and remained in general use through the 1980s. The last major update to its documentation was in 1984. As the military procured newer receivers, many R-390As were released to surplus while others were destroyed. Some receivers were retained by the services, however, when they found that the R-390A's vacuum tube circuitry could easily survive an electromagnetic pulse. There are reports, possibly apocryphal, that R-390A receivers are still in use aboard U.S. Navy submarines since the receiver can withstand the strong radio frequency fields found aboard ship. Many of the R-390As that exist today are in the hands of vintage amateur radio collectors and amateur radio operators who contend that few modern solid state communications receivers can equal its performance. There is a wealth of information, both printed and electronic, devoted to R-390A restoration and maintenance, as the R-390A is widely considered an example of the best of vacuum tube technology. ==See also== *ART 13 transmitter *ARC-5 *BC-348 *BC-654 *Collins Radio *Hammarlund super pro *National HRO *Vintage amateur radio *75A-4 and KWS-1 ==ReferencesGeneral references== *Rippel, Chuck.

However, when transferred to the genus Eleutherodactylus, its name became a secondary homonym of Eleutherodactylus fuscus. The current name, Eleutherodactylus maurus, is a replacement name (nomen novum) created to remedy this situation. ==Description== Specimens in the type series measured in snout–vent length. The overall coloration is dark brown. The dorsum bears scattered pustules. The tympanum is small and inconspicuous. The forearms are slender and hands relatively small. The tips of the two outer fingers are expanded and truncate. Male advertisement call is a single \\"peep\\" given at long intervals. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are pine forests with abundant rocks and leaf-litter. The specimens in the type series were collected from two locations at elevations of above sea level. They were found at night calling from the tops of rocks and off the ground in small bushes, or in one case, in the daytime under a rock.

It is found in the Sierra Tapirapecó in the Amazonas state of Venezuela (the type locality) as well as in the adjacent Amazonas state of Brazil (where the range is known as Serra do Tapirapecó). The specific name memorans is derived from the present participle of the Latin memoro (=\\"to relate or recount something\\") and refers to an airplane crash that the expedition witnessed in the jungle below the campsite. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. The head is narrower than the body (more so in females) and longer than it is wide. The snout is rounded or bluntly pointed in dorsal view and rounded in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct and vertically elongated. The fingers and toes have terminal discs but no webbing. Skin on the dorsum is tubercular. Ground color is usually brown, but individuals were reddish or orangish or even dark greenish brown. There are vague, black markings, including a bar between the eyes, and in many individuals, a W-shaped mark behind the head. Some specimens may have scattered, small, pale yellow spots. The ventrum is gray, sometimes with pale spots. Males have a large subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call consists of 1–4 loud \\"tinks\\". Males seem to answer their neighbors' calls with similar calls, that is, two-note call would trigger a two-note call. The dominant frequency is 2480–2760 Hz. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are montane forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals have been found in dense ridge-top forest where males were calling both day and night, in low vegetation in a stream-side forest at night, and on the ground in a forest bordering a river. Calling activity suggested an abundant population at the ridge-top site, even though individuals were difficult to locate. Development is direct, without free-living larval stage. No major threats to this species are known. It occurs in the Parima Tapirapecó National Park, Venezuela. ==References== memorans Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1997 Category:Taxa named by Charles W.

The BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, which is headed by Mahant Swami Maharaj, is a global spiritual organization within the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism. The mandir was built in 18 months and consists of 24,000 pieces of hand-carved Italian carrara marble, Turkish limestone and Indian pink stone. The mandir is the largest of its kind in Canada and was constructed according to guidelines outlined in ancient Hindu scriptures. The grounds spread over 18 acres and in addition to the mandir, include a haveli and the Heritage Museum. The mandir is open daily to visitors and for worship. In July 2017, the temple celebrated its 10-year anniversary. ==Mandir and daily rituals== The temple is a type of 'Shikarbaddha' mandir, built according to principles laid out in the Shilpa Shastras, Hindu texts prescribing standards of sacred architecture. Within the mandir, murtis (sacred images of the deities) have been installed in different shrines. The central shrine holds the murti of Swaminarayan, with Gunatitanand Swami to his left, together worshipped as Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj. Similarly, different shrines hold murtis of major ancient Hindu deities such as Radha and Krishna, Sita and Rama, Shiva and Parvati, Vishnu and Lakshmi, Ganesha, Hunuman as well as the lineage of BAPS gurus who are Swaminarayan's spiritual successors. Once the divine has been invoked in a murti, it becomes an embodiment of the Divine. Accordingly, Swaminarayan swamis (Hindu monks) offer devotional worship to the deities throughout the day. Before dawn, they awaken the deities by singing morning hymns (prabhatiya). The deities are then bathed and offered food and garments depending on the time of the day and season. Food that has been offered to the deities is considered sanctified. These holy offerings are distributed to the devotees as prasadam. Throughout the day, aarti, a ritual where devotees sing the glory of Swaminarayan while a lighted wick is circulated before the murtis, is performed five times a day and named mangala aarti, shanagar aarti, rajabhoga aarti, sandhya aarti and shayana aarti, respectively. During midday, lunch is offered. In the evening, dinner is offered. Finally, the swamis put the murtis to rest by adorning them with night garments. == Haveli == The mandir's cultural center is referred to as the haveli because of its traditional Indian architectural style. The haveli is defined by an intricately carved wooden façade. Inside the haveli is a courtyard surrounded by teak and rosewood columns. The columns are characterized by motifs ranging from mythological stories, the sun and moon, and animals such as peacocks and elephants. The cultural center serves various functions. The assembly hall provides space for weekly congregations. Classrooms are used for youth cultural, religious and educational activities, which include music lessons, Hindu scripture classes and career development seminars. A full-size gymnasium is used for youth sports activities and dining after Sunday evening assemblies. A food shop provides visitors and members with an assortment of vegetarian snacks. There is a living quarters for the swamis who perform daily rituals in the mandir. Heritage Museum The Heritage Museum houses the Understanding Hindu Dharma Exhibition, which aims to provide visitors with a foundation of the key tenets of Hinduism. It walks visitors through a culture and faith with origins in antiquity, beginning with an explanation of the origins of Hinduism and continuing to an explanation of the role of Hinduism today. It also showcases the role that Indo-Canadians have played in developments in the fields of art, architecture, science, democracy, education, culture, pluralism and spiritual values. ==Construction== On 23 July 2000, in the presence of Pramukh Swami Maharaj, devotees performed the shilanyas, or first stone-laying, ceremony on the future site of the Toronto shikarbaddh mandir. Construction continued in various phases, beginning with the haveli and culminating in the opening on the shikharbaddh mandir. The haveli was officially opened on 18 July 2004. At that time, the congregation held a Vishvashanti Mahayagna for world peace and family unity. Community leaders and representatives of various faith-based organizations were present for the event. Before the haveli was built, the congregation held weekly assemblies at a hari mandir in Etobicoke, Toronto. The final phase of construction was completed in 2007. The official opening of the mandir was held on 22 July 2007 in the presence of Pramukh Swami Maharaj. Then-Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, then-Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty and then-Mayor of Toronto David Miller, were in attendance at the opening. The opening of the mandir was the culminating event in a three-day festival. The festival included a nagar yatra, or parade of the deities and devotees, through Toronto that displayed traditional Indian folk dances and music, in addition to a ceremony that brought together devotees to pray for world peace. Construction of the complex benefited largely from donations and volunteer efforts. This service is viewed by contributing members as a form of devotion. BAPS devotees believe that seva, or \\"selfless service,\\" can be offered physically, monetarily or through prayer. Seva is understood by devotees to be service volunteered to the community while holding God in remembrance. Estimated to be built with a total cost of $40 million the temple is an architectural wonder. Its walls, pillars and ceiling consist of intricately crafted designs and statues as per ancient Hindu traditions from India. On a sunny day it looks like a sparkling crystal palace. During construction all 24,000 of its parts were first shipped to India, where they were carved and polished by skilled craftsmen then they were all numbered and shipped to Toronto, where more than 400 volunteers helped to assemble them bringing the temple to life.Thousands drawn to temple's dazzle, July 23, 2007, Accessed on 20 Aug 2017, Toronto Star In all 434 pieces were used to make up the ceiling of the front entrance alone. The temple is made following ancient Indian Vedic techniques with no steel skeleton holding it up, all of its walls are load- bearing. The construction of the temple was completed relatively quickly transforming the barren field into a temple. The first stones were purchased less than three years before its inauguration but the actual construction time was only 18 months, it was funded entirely by donations. == Events == In July 2017, the 10th anniversary of the mandir was celebrated in the presence of Mahant Swami Maharaj, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Toronto Mayor John Tory. == Community and fundraising == Annual gala The BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir of Toronto previously held a gala each year to raise awareness, funds and support for various charities. Beneficiaries have included the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, the Heart and Stroke Foundation and charities that supported rebuilding efforts in light of natural disasters that occurred in Haiti and Japan. Walkathons Alongside BAPS centres throughout North America, the BAPS mandir in Toronto holds an annual walkathon in support of various charities. Participants work to raise funds for BAPS Charities initiatives and local beneficiaries. In 2010, BAPS Charities Canada announced a pledge of $100,000 over five years for the SickKids Research and Learning Tower in Toronto. International Women's Day celebrations The mandir hosts an annual conference in March in support of International Women's Day. Members of the community gather for the conference, to share ideas for the positive development of future generations of women. On 30 March 2013, the 6th annual conference was held. The theme was \\"Timeless Traditions: Celebrate the Past and Cultivate the Future\\". The conference focused on understanding and communicating the glory of Hindu traditions and preserving them in order to help nurture future generations. In 2011, the conference was themed, \\"Honoring the Past, Envisioning the Future.\\" The program highlighted the role of women in India's history and the present opportunities and challenges that face females in the Indian diaspora. The conference also commemorated the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. In 2010, the conference, themed \\"Nurturing Families, Shaping Communities\\", aimed to highlight the fundamental role women play in shaping Canada. The Honorable Diane Finley, Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, spoke about Canadian Government initiatives that support women and their families. Health fairs and lectures BAPS Charities organizes an annual health fair and related lectures throughout the year. BAPS Charities (formerly BAPS Care International) is a humanitarian service organization that originated from BAPS with a focus on serving society. These events are free and open to the public and promote early detection and prevention techniques to support the wellness of communities. The 7th annual Health Fair was held on 14 October 2012. Various community organizations such as the Ontario Dental Association, Sick Kids Foundation, William Osler Health System, the Heart and Stroke Foundation, South Asian Diabetes Association and the Alzheimer's Association contributed to the event. Doors Open Toronto From 2005 to 2009, the mandir participated in the annually held event, Doors Open Toronto. This two-day event is intended to allow the public an opportunity to visit and learn about architecturally, historically, culturally and socially significant buildings in Toronto. There are over 100 such buildings on display annually. During the period in which the mandir participated, volunteers provided guided tours throughout the mandir and museum. == Gallery == File:BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Toronto.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir exterior 5.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir front.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir exterior 6.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir dome 1.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir domes 1.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir exterior 1.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir carving exterior 1.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir carving exterior 2.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir carving exterior 3.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir arch.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir carving exterior 4.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir carving exterior 5.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir interior 1.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir interior 2.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir interior 3.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Mandir interior 4.jpg File:BAPS Toronto Murti 1.jpgBhagwan Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami File:BAPS Toronto Murti 2.jpgPramukh Swami Maharaj File:BAPS Toronto Murti 3.jpgNeelkanth Varni/Swaminarayan ==ReferencesExternal links== ;Organization information *BAPS Website *BAPS Charities – The Spirit of Service *BAPS Children's Website *Thousands drawn to temple's dazzle, July 23, 2007, Accessed on 20 Aug 2017, Toronto Star ;Mandirs and monuments *Swaminarayan Akshardham, New Delhi *Swaminarayan Akshardham, Gandhinagar Gujarat *BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London *Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Houston *Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Chicago *BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Sanstha Chino Hills, California *BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Toronto, Ontario Category:Swaminarayan temples Category:Religious buildings and structures in Toronto Category:Etobicoke Category:Hindu temples in Canada Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Ontario ","title":"BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto"},{"id":"12387313","text":"Yunganastes mercedesae is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It is a part of the 71st Flying Training Wing. The squadron was established as a medium bomber unit on Bolos, Marauders, and later B-25 Mitchells. It became a heavy bomber squadron in February 1944, and was later equipped with B-29s and B-47s before being inactivated in 1963. Just under thirty years later, it was reactivated as a flying training squadron. ==History== World War II B-24s from the 33d Bombartdment SquadronNearest aircraft is Consolidated B-24L-5-CO Liberator serial 44-41538. This plane was named \\"Round Trip Ticket\\". Consolidated B-24J Liberator serial 44-40366 was named \\"Gypsy\\" and later renamed \\"Slightly Dangerous\\". Established as a GHQ Air Force medium bomber squadron in 1940 as a result of the buildup of the Army Air Corps after the breakout of World War II in Europe. It trained with a mix of Douglas B-18 Bolos and Martin B-26 Marauders. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron was transferred to the West Coast, flying anti-submarine patrols from Muroc Army Air Field, California from December 1941 to the end of January 1942. It was then assigned to the new Fifth Air Force, originally based on the Philippines, leaving the B-18s at Muroc. By the time the squadron arrived in the theater the situation on the Philippines was desperate, and the squadron was based in Australia. From there it attacked Japanese targets on New Guinea and New Britain. In October 1943 the B-26 Marauders were joined by North American B-25 Mitchells, and for the rest of the year the group continued to operate in support of Allied troops on New Guinea. In February 1944 the unit was redesignated as a heavy bomber squadron, and was assigned long range Consolidated B-24 Liberators, built by Ford and optimized for long range bombing missions in the Pacific. With its new heavy bombers the group attacked targets on Borneo, Ceram and Halmahera, among them the crucial oil fields of the Netherlands East Indies. In September 1944 the squadron moved its attention to the Philippines, attacking targets on Leyte. It moved onto Leyte on 15 November 1944. From then until August 1945 it flew against targets on Luzon, as well as supporting the campaign on Borneo and even ranging out as far as China. Finally, on 15 August 1945 the unit moved to Okinawa, from where it flew a number of armed reconnaissance missions over southern Japan to make sure the surrender terms were being obeyed. Most of the squadron's personnel were demobilized after the war; the squadron being reassigned to the Philippines where it's B-24s were sent to reclamation and it became a paper unit. The squadron was redesignated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress squadron on Okinawa in 1946, receiving former Eighth Air Force B-29s originally deployed from the United States for the planned Air Offensive as part of the Japanese Campaign. Became part of Twentieth Air Force, and flew training missions in and around Okinawa until being made non-operational in 1948. Cold War bombardment Assigned to Strategic Air Command in 1948, receiving B-29s and operating from Smoky Hill Air Force Base, Kansas; later from March Air Force Base, California. Took part in SAC deployments and exercises. In 1950 was part of the Fifteenth Air Force SAC contingent of non-nuclear-capable B-29 units deployed to Okinawa due to the breakout of the Korean War. Flew combat missions over North Korea during 1950, returning to the United States in October. Upon return to the United States, trained with second-line B-29s for training and organization. Replaced the propeller-driven B-29s with new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1953, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in late 1962; Inactivated in early 1963 when the last aircraft was retired. Pilot training The squadron was reactivated under Air Training Command as a flying training unit in 1990. Inactivated in 1992; Reactivated in 1998 as part of Air Education and Training Command. As Vance AFB is a Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (JSUPT) location, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps aviators as well as Air Force and Air National Guard pilots train there.

R. Millar) Serglige Con Culainn (), also known as Oenét Emire () is a narrative from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. It tells of a curse that fell upon the warrior Cú Chulainn as a result of his attacking otherworldly women, and his eventual recovery by reluctantly agreeing to give military aid to those he had wronged. His developing relationship with one of the Otherworldly women, Fand, occasions his wife Emer's \\"only jealousy.\\" ==Literary and historical value== In the assessment of Myles Dillon, ::The story of Cú Chulainn's visit to the Other World has a special claim on our attention, because of its long descriptions of the Irish Elysium, here called Mag Mell 'the Plain of Delights', and also for the quality of the poetry which makes up almost half of the text. In some of the poems one recognizes the tension and grace which were later so finely cultivated in the bardic schools, and the moods of sorrow and joy are shared by the reader; the content is not sacrificed for the form ... The scene between Cú Chulainn and his wife after he has given the magic birds to the other women (§6) and the humorous account of Lóeg's conversation with Lí Ban (§14) are instances of the sudden intimacy in these Irish stories...Dillon, Myles (ed.). Serglige Con Culainn. Mediaeval and Modern Irish Series 14. Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1953. p. ix. Available from CELT. ==Origins and manuscripts== The story survives in two manuscripts, the twelfth-century Book of the Dun Cow and a seventeenth-century copy of this manuscript, Trinity College, Dublin, H. 4. 22.Dillon, Myles (ed.). Serglige Con Culainn. Mediaeval and Modern Irish Series 14. Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1953. p. xi. Available from CELT. It is clear, however, that the Book of the Dun Cow combined two different versions of the text: parts are in the hand of the main scribe of the manuscript (referred to by Dillon as Recension A), but parts have been erased and rewritten, or leaves removed and replaced, by a scribe with a different hand, apparently copying from a now lost manuscript known as the Yellow Book of Slane (referred to by Dillon as Recension B). This scribe may have made further additions of his own. Precisely how much of our surviving text belongs to each source has been the subject of debate. The material judged to derive from Recension B exhibits linguistic features pointing, amongst later ones, to the ninth century, while the language of A seems to be eleventh-century.Myles Dillon, ‘On the Text of Serglige Con Culainn’, Éigse, 3 (1941–2), 120–9; (ed.), Serglige Con Culainn, Mediaeval and Modern Irish Series, 14 ([Dublin]: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1953), xi–xvi; Trond Kruke Salberg, ‘The Question of the Main Interpolation of H into M’s Part of the Serglige Con Culainn in the Book of the Dun Cow and Some Related Problems’, Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie, 45 (1992), 161–81, esp. 161–2. A has long been considered the more conservative version of the story nevertheless, but John Carey has argued that B is the earlier version.John Carey, ‘The Uses of Tradition in Serglige Con Culainn’, in Ulidia: Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Ulster Cycle of Tales, Belfast and Emain Macha, 8–12 April 1994, ed. J. P. Mallory and Gerard Stockman (Belfast: December, 1994), pp. 77–84, at 81–3; Joanne Findon, A Woman’s Words: Emer and Female Speech in the Ulster Cycle (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1997), 145–46. The combination of material leads to some inconsistencies and incoherence in the story, prominently an apparent shift from calling Cú Chulainn's wife Ethne Ingubai to calling her Emer. ==Plot summary== The Ulster hero Cú Chulainn is with other men in Muirtheimne, hunting birds by the water. A number of the men kill two birds for their wives, so the women may wear feathers on each shoulder of their gowns. When all the women but Emer have birds, Cú Chulainn becomes determined to kill the largest, most beautiful birds for her. The only birds still in the sky are indeed the largest and most exotic-looking, but the two seabirds are linked by a golden chain and sing a magical sleeping song. Emer recognizes that this means they are from the Otherworld and tells Cú Chulainn not to kill them. He attempts to do so anyway, but only manages to strike one of the birds on the feathers of her wing, damaging her wing, but not inflicting a mortal wound. Cú Chulainn falls ill, and lies unconscious and feverish next to a standing stone. In his fevered state he sees two women approaching. They are Fand and Lí Ban, whom he assaulted while they were in bird form. They have horsewhips and beat him almost to death. He lies ill in bed for nearly a year, until Lí Ban returns, asking him to come to Mag Mell and help Fand defeat her enemies in a battle there. In exchange for his military aid, Fand will agree to heal him of his illness. Cú Chulainn refuses, but his charioteer, Láeg, agrees to go. At this point, the story is interrupted by Cú Chulainn suddenly giving a long series of advice to his foster-son Lugaid Réoderg, the newly chosen king of Tara. This material is part of the genre of tecosca ('precepts, instructions') and, in Dillon's estimation, 'can hardly belong to the story in its original form'.Dillon, Myles (ed.). Serglige Con Culainn. Mediaeval and Modern Irish Series 14. Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1953. p. x. Available from CELT. However, Cú Chulainn's uncharacteristic wisdom here can be understood as a beneficial side-effect of his magically inflicted illness.John Carey, ‘The Uses of Tradition in Serglige Con Culainn’, in Ulidia: Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Ulster Cycle of Tales, Belfast and Emain Macha, 8–12 April 1994, ed. J. P. Mallory and Gerard Stockman (Belfast: December, 1994), pp. 77–84; John T. Koch, 'Serglige Con Culainn', in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005), pp. 1607-8. On his return, Láeg, with the help of Emer (who berates her husband for choosing his pride over his health) manages to convince Cú Chulainn to accompany him to Fand's lands. In Mag Mell he joins the battle, and helps defeat Fand and Lí Ban's enemies. Fand agrees to sleep with him, but this is discovered by Emer, who confronts Fand, accompanied by a troop of women armed with knives. After much discussion both women recognize the other's unselfish love, and request that Cú Chulainn take the other. Fand decides that since she already has a husband, Manannán mac Lir, Emer should stay with Cú Chulainn so she will not be left alone. Cú Chulainn and Fand are both heartbroken, however. Fand asks Manannán to shake his cloak of mist between her and Cú Chulainn, ensuring that they will never meet again. The druids give Cúchulainn and Emer a potion of forgetfulness, and they forget the entire affair. The text closes with a statement generally attributed to scribe who altered the manuscript text (sometimes omitted from translations), that 'that is the disastrous vision shown to Cú Chulainn by the fairies. For the diabolical power was great before the faith, and it was so great that devils used to fight with men in bodily form, and used to show delights and mysteries to them, as though they really existed. So they were believed to be; and ignorant men used to call those visions síde and áes síde'.Alaric Hall, Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity, Anglo- Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007; pbk repr. 2009), p. 143. ==Cultural references== Augusta, Lady Gregory included a Victorian version of the story in her 1902 collection Cuchulain of Muirthemne. Gregory's version was loosely adapted by William Butler Yeats for his 1922 play The Only Jealousy of Emer. The Pogues titled the opening track of their 1985 album Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash \\"The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn\\" after the tale. ==Bibliography== Manuscripts *Lebor na hUidre (LU) fol. 43a-50b (+H) (RIA) *H 4.22, fol.

Dorsal coloration is brown to reddish brown, rarely pale green with darker markings. The ventral surfaces mostly black, but the undersides of the legs are orange or red. There is a cream or yellow blotch on the lower flank/groin. The anterior surfaces of the thighs are reddish-orange. Males have a subgular vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis myops occurs in vegetation close to the forest floor (no higher than above the ground) in primary forest and forest edges at elevations of above sea level. They have cryptic coloration and are very easy to overlook. This species is threatened by habitat loss caused by the cultivation of crops and livestock farming, as well as chemical pollution from spraying of the crops. The presumed range of this species overlaps with some protected areas. ==References== myops Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Amphibians described in 1998 Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis myops"},{"id":"12387396","text":"Ischnocnema nasuta is a species of frog in the family Brachycephalidae.

Until a population was found in Bertioga in 2006, the species was only known from the brief species description published in 1925 and a single specimen collected in the 1980s. ==Description== Males measure and females, based on just three specimens, in snout–vent length. The head is wide with a short, rounded snout. The eyes are large and prominent. The fingers and toes are unwebbed. The dorsal colouration consists of dark brown background with lighter or darker brown blotches. Males differ from females by having bright yellow mottling on the inguinal region and hidden areas of hindlimbs, whereas in females this mottling is bright orange. The belly light brown belly at night and deeply dark brown during daytime. The iris is silver with a yellowish copper band. The dorsal skin is shagreen with tubercles or warts. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitat is Atlantic forests. Calling males are usually found perching on trees or shrubs, sometimes as high as above the ground. A couple in amplexus was spotted on the leaf litter. At the time of the latest assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there was not enough information on this species to assess its conservation status. The species occurs in the Serra do Mar State Park, and the Bertioga population is within a private reserve. ==References== nigriventris Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Adolfo Lutz Category:Amphibians described in 1925 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Ischnocnema nigriventris"},{"id":"12387417","text":"The Anselme Payen Award is an annual prize named in honor of Anselme Payen, the French scientist who discovered cellulose, and was a pioneer in the chemistry of both cellulose and lignin. In 1838,Payen A., Memoire sur la composition du tissu propre des plantes et du ligneux, Comptes Rendus, 7: 1052-1056, (1838). he discovered that treating successively wood with nitric acid and an alkaline solution yielded a major insoluble residue that he called \\"cellulose\\", while dissolved incrustants were later called \\"lignin\\" by Frank Schulze.Schulze F., Beitrage zur Kenntniss des Lignins, Chemisches Zentralblatt, 21:321-325 (1857). He was the first to attempt separation of wood into its component parts. After treating different woods with nitric acid he obtained a fibrous substance common to all which he also found in cotton and other plants. His analysis revealed the chemical formula of the substance to be C6H10O5. He reported the discovery and the first results of this classic work in 1838 in Comptes Rendus. The name \\"cellulose\\" was coined and introduced into the scientific literature next year, in 1839.Payen A., Composition de la matière ligneuse, Comptes Rendus, 8: 51-53, (1839). Anselme Payen Award Recipients The Anselme Payen Award, which includes a medal and an honorarium given by the American Chemical Society's Cellulose and Renewable Materials Division, to honor and encourage \\"outstanding professional contributions to the science and chemical technology of cellulose and its allied products\\".http://cell.sites.acs.org/anselmepayenaward.htm The Anselme Payen Award is an international award and any scientist conducting cellulose and cellulose related research is eligible for nomination. Selection of the awardee is based upon an evaluation of the nomination packages submitted on behalf of potential awardees. These documents are individually ranked by a panel of nine judges who are appointed by the current Chair-Elect and are unknown to each other. Three judges rotate off the panel each year. The identity of all members is known only to the Chair of the awards committee who compiles the results. After the awardee accepts, the Chair of the Awards Committee announces the winner at the next Spring ACS meeting. The awardee for that year is honored at the following Spring ACS meeting at a Symposium and Banquet. The award bears the year the winner was announced. It is presented the following year to allow time for organization of the Symposium and Banquet.http://www.esf.edu/cellulose/apa.htm ==Recipients== {  - ! Year !! Awardee !!

He served as Archbishop of Cincinnati from 1982 to 2009. ==Early life and education== Daniel Pilarczyk was born in Dayton, Ohio, the only child of Daniel Joseph and Frieda (Hilgefort) Pilarczyk. After receiving his early education at Our Lady of Mercy and St. Anthony parochial schools, he attended Sacred Heart Latin School. At the age of 14, he entered St. Gregory Seminary in Cincinnati. In 1953, he was sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, from where he obtained a Licentiate of Philosophy (1956) and Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1960). His mother died in 1955, and his father remarried a Marie Scothorn. ==Priesthood== Pilarczyk was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian on December 20, 1959. He remained in Rome for his postgraduate studies, and earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the Urban College in 1961. Upon his return to the United States, he became assistant chancellor of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and a curate at St. Louis Church. He then taught Latin and Greek at his alma mater of St. Gregory Seminary from 1963 to 1974. During this time, he received a Master's degree from Xavier University in 1965. He became rector of St. Gregory Seminary in 1968; at the age of 31, he was the youngest man to be named to that position. He later earned a Ph.D. from the University of Cincinnati in 1969. ==Episcopacy== Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati On November 12, 1974, Pilarczyk was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati and Titular Bishop of Hodelm by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 20 from Archbishop Joseph Bernardin, with Archbishop Nicholas Elko and Bishop James W. Malone serving as co-consecrators. From 1974 to 1982, he served as director of Archdiocesan Educational Services and chairman of the Archdiocesan Commission on Education. He also served as chairman of the governing board of St. Rita School for the Deaf from 1977 to 1982. He once said, \\"Education means development, growth. When God creates us, He doesn't quite finish it. He lets us do some of the finishing touches. That's what education is. It's a wonderful gift. The ability to become educated ... [is] a wonderful gift which sometimes people overlook or misuse.\\" Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he became a member of the Committee on Doctrine in 1976 and chairman of the Committee on Education in 1978. Archbishop of Cincinnati He was appointed Archbishop of Cincinnati—succeeding Joseph Cardinal Bernardin who had been named Archbishop of Chicago—on October 30, 1982. Archbishop Pilarczyk served as vice president (1986–1989) and president (1989–1992) of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. During Pilarczyk's tenure there were cases of sexual abuse which were covered up. In 2003, Pilarczyk pleaded no contest to five misdemeanor counts of failing to report felonies and admitted facts that constituted guilt; the archdiocese was found guilty of failing to report its crimes, and the judge said that church leaders had placed self-preservation ahead of their moral duty to minister to the victims.Cleveland Plain Dealer: Cincinnati archdiocese found guilty of cover- up, 21 November 2003 In October 2008, Bishop Dennis Marion Schnurr of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, was named by Pope Benedict XVI as Pilarczyk's coadjutor archbishop. This means Schnurr served as the auxiliary bishop and chief vicar general to Pilarczyk, but unlike other auxiliary bishops that had served, he had the right as coadjutor to immediately succeed him as archbishop when Pilarczyk retired. On August 12, 2009, Pilarczyk officially handed in his resignation on his 75th birthday, as mandated by the Vatican. It was formally accepted by Pope Benedict XVI on December 21, 2009 (the day after he celebrated both 50 years as a priest and 35 years as a bishop). He was immediately succeeded as Archbishop of Cincinnati by Coadjutor Archbishop Schnurr. ==After retirement== Pilarczyk continued to be involved in the Greater Cincinnati community, specifically with the growth of the Archdiocese in multiple counties. He expressed a fondness for preaching and worked to address what he considered misconceptions regarding Catholicism. In January 2006, his book entitled Being Catholic: How We Believe, Practice, And Think was published. Pilarczyk wrote at least 12 books on the Catholic faith. After years of declining health, he died on March 22, 2020. His funeral mass, which was streamed online and closed to public attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was held in St. Peter in Chains Cathedral on March 27, 2020. ==See also== * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops ==ReferencesExternal links== * Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati official website *12 Questions With Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk from Local 12 News, Cincinnati, Ohio. * *\\"Cincinnati archdiocese convicted for failing to report sex abuse\\" from BNET Research Center Category:Archbishops of Cincinnati Category:1934 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Writers from Dayton, Ohio Category:American Roman Catholic archbishops Category:20th- century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:American people of Polish descent ","title":"Daniel Edward Pilarczyk"},{"id":"12387426","text":"Eleutherodactylus nitidus is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

Stephan Mardigian, who had been working as a Butcher in Toledo, Ohio, USA, saved enough money to bring the family to the United States in October 1914, on the eve of the Armenian Genocide. Stephen Mardigian's first order of business, once settled was to ensure for his children, the best educational opportunities and benefits that America had to offer, and which had been denied to his people in Turkey. Edward Mardigian became an excellent student, and couldn't seem to surround himself with enough books to satisfy his thirst for knowledge, particularly for the automotive industry and technology. ==Education and career== Losing his mother at the age of 12 was very difficult for young Edward, but was not enough to slow him down, and by the age of 15 he joined his brothers at the Ford Motor Company, enrolling in the Trade School in Highland Park, MI. He entered the industrial field as a tool and die designing apprentice student. He graduated in 1928 with excellent marks and was offered a great position with Ford Motor Company in Detroit. In 1930 Mardigian left Ford Motor Company and joined Chrysler Corporation, which allowed him to attend night classes at the Detroit Institute of Technology and Wayne State University, where he soon would earn the equivalent of a high school diploma and the training of a mechanical engineer. By 1933 he had the knowledge, education and passion to begin an exciting and successful career. In that year, Mardigian accepted the position of Assistant Chief Tool Designer with Briggs Manufacturing Company. In 1934 Briggs sent Mardigian to London, England to supervise the first major tooling program at their Dagenham plant, and in 1936 he returned to the United States to head up the process and estimating department, which he would lead through the difficult and early part of the second World War. Mardigian left Briggs in 1943 and formed a tool and die company called Oakman Engineering Co., and the following year bought a major stake in Northern Engineering Co. These two companies would later enter the production realm and become known as the Mardigian Corporation. ==Philanthropy== Armenian Community In 1984 Mr. Mardigian helped assure the future of the then forming Armenian Assembly of America by making a contribution to that organizations endowment fund. Helen Mardigian is a life Trustee of the Armenian Assembly of America. Armenian Church The Helen and Edward Mardigian Institute is a highly successful training program for educators, particularly for Sunday School teachers without a professional education background. The program helps them reach out to children by providing on-going training, inspiration, and encouragement free of charge to local Sunday School staffs across the Eastern Diocese. The program takes place bi-annually at the Diocesan Center in New York City and at the St. Nersess Armenian Seminary. The Mardigian Institute was founded in 1978 and has trained more than 350 Sunday School educators. The program is organized by the staff of the Diocese’s Department of Youth and takes small groups of around 10 students at a time for 1 week courses which include demonstrations, lectures and discussions of Christian faith. Along with Alex and Marie Manoogian, Edward and Helen Mardigian were major benefactors of St. John's Armenian Church in Southfield, MI. Academia In 1987, Helen and Edward Mardigian donated $500,000 to the Armenian Research Center endowment and $350,000 to an endowment for the campus library. Pleased with the work of the Armenian Research Center and with the generosity of the Mardigians towards the University, which has extended beyond their original contributions, the then Chancellor of the Dearborn campus, William A. Jenkins, recommended to the President of The University of Michigan, at that time Harold Shapiro, that the University name the campus library the Edward and Helen Mardigian Library. This the Regents did the following year. Medicine The University of Michigan In 1996, a $3 million gift from the Mardigian Foundation in honor of the late Detroit-area industrialist and philanthropist Edward Mardigian and his wife, Helen, helped in the construction of the U-M Comprehensive Cancer Center and Geriatrics Center Building. In recognition of the family foundation’s generosity, the building’s lobby was named the Edward Mardigian Memorial Lobby. “We have always believed in sharing,” Helen Mardigian said in announcing the gift. “We have always wanted to do something for the Hospital. Edward would be very pleased.” The Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital Funded by a $1 million donation from the Edward Mardigian Family, the Mardigian Family Surgery Center at the Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital provides a comfortable and bright waiting area for family members, flooded with the warmth of daylight from the skylights above. The area features a children’s playroom and a business center with computer access and health care information. To enhance patient privacy, coaster pagers, similar to those used in restaurants, summon waiting family members to the postsurgery consultation with the surgeon. Art, Culture and History Opened in 1979, the Edward and Helen Mardigian Museum of Armenian Art and History of Jerusalem is located in a 200-year-old building that once housed the Armenian Patriarchate’s Theological Seminary, The Mardigian Museum of Armenian Art and Culture present a picturesque overview of Armenian history, religion and cultural heritage. Exhibits include historical and religious artifacts, many brought to Jerusalem by pilgrims, including hand-woven rugs, a collection of Armenian coins, huge copper cauldrons crafted by Armenian smiths, colorful tiles from the world-famous Kutayha district, and a map of the ancient world printed in Armenian. There is also a replica of Gutenberg's original printing press, the first to be established in Jerusalem in 1833. ==Awards== The Armenian Students' Association of America awarded Mr. Mardigian the Sarafian Award for Good Citizenship in 1986. ==External links== *Origins of the Armenian Assembly of America *Engagement Announcement, Siran Hovnanian and Robert Mardigian, New York Times, July 19, 1981 *Mardigian Donates $875,000 to the University of Michigan *Mardigian Foundation donates $3,000,000 to the University of Michigan *Mardigian Foundation donates $3,000,000 to the University of Michigan *Edward Mardigian Family Surgery Center, Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI *Past recipients of the Armenian Professional Society Grant *Armenian Museum of Art and History - Jerusalem Category:American people of Armenian descent Category:Ottoman emigrants to the United States Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Armenian engineers Category:20th-century American engineers Category:People from Constantinople Category:Wayne State University alumni Category:1907 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Detroit Institute of Technology alumni ","title":"Edward Mardigian"},{"id":"12387439","text":"Austin Knight may refer to: * Austin M.

It is endemic to Hispaniola and known from the Massif de la Hotte, Massif de la Selle, and Sierra de Baoruco, occurring in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is named after James W. Norton who accompanied Albert Schwartz in his 1974 expedition to Hispaniola and collected the holotype. ==Description== The five adult males in the type series measure in snout–vent length. The colouration is green with darker green, irregular blotches. These blotches become nearly diagonal laterally. The fore- and hindlimbs have subcircular blotches; the thighs have three bars. The male advertisement call is a series of about five rising glissando trills, ending in a semi-whistle. ==Habitat and conservation== The species' natural habitats are sinkhole caves in upland broadleaf forest and forest remnants at elevations of above sea level. Males are calling from tall vegetation and rocks. Once considered locally not rare, Eleutherodactylus nortoni is now uncommon and assessed as \\"critically endangered\\". It is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging and agriculture. It is known from the Pic Macaya and La Visite National Parks in Haiti and from Sierra de Bahoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic, but habitat degradation is occurring in these areas too. ==References== nortoni Category:Endemic fauna of Hispaniola Category:Amphibians of the Dominican Republic Category:Amphibians of Haiti Category:Amphibians described in 1976 Category:Taxa named by Albert Schwartz (zoologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Spiny giant frog"},{"id":"12387446","text":"Eleutherodactylus nubicola is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to Jamaica.

It is endemic to extreme northern Ecuador. Its type locality is the west slope of volcano Chiles in the Carchi Province and it is only known from the Páramos del Angel and Chamizo at elevations of asl. It range might extend to adjacent Colombia. Common name Carchi robber frog has been coined for this species. They have pale hands and feet, as if wearing gloves and socks—hence the specific name ocreatus, which is Latin and means \\"wearing leggings\\" or \\"booted\\". ==Description== Pristimantis ocreatus is a small species: based on four males and two females, males measure and females in snout–vent length. Dorsum and upper flanks are dark brown. Some individuals have a reddish-brown mid-dorsal stripe or broad dorsal band. Most individuals have pale orange spots along dorsolateral folds. Flanks and venter are black with white spots. Hands and feet are white (except for outer edges). Iris is blue-gray. Skin of dorsum bears low ridges and finely areolate, subconical warts on the flanks. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Pristimantis ocreatus are sub-páramo and páramo habitats, but it can also occur in secondary forest. It is a fossorial species. The type series was collected under rocks and clumps of dirt by day. In Páramos del Angel it shares its habitat with the larger Pristimantis curtipes and Pristimantis thymelensis. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture and wood extraction. Burning in 2002-2003 may have extirpated this species from Páramos del Angel. ==References== ocreatus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Endemic fauna of Ecuador Category:Páramo fauna Category:Amphibians described in 1981 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis ocreatus"},{"id":"12387471","text":"Ischnocnema octavioi is a species of frog in the family Brachycephalidae.

The play was essential to Nil Vidroha, better known as the Indigo Revolt of February–March 1859 in Bengal, when farmers refused to sow indigo in their fields to protest against exploitative farming under the British Raj.Nildarpan (play by Mitra) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia It was also essential to the development of theatre in Bengal and influenced Girish Chandra Ghosh, who in 1872 would establish the National Theatre in Calcutta (Kolkata), where the first play ever commercially staged was Nildarpan. Nil Darpan ==Critical summary== The play was received with mixed results upon its release. It was translated by Michael Madhusudan Dutta and published by Reverend James Long, for which he was sentenced to prison and charged with sedition.Internet Archive: Details: Nil darpan, or, The indigo planting mirror : a drama > I present \\"The Indigo Planting Mirror\\" to the Indigo Planters' hands; now, > let every one of them, having observed his face, erase the freckle of the > stain of selfishness from his forehead, and, in its stead, place on it the > sandal powder of beneficence, then shall I think my labour success... It is evident from this wish that it was a piece meant to raise a voice among the elite intellectuals of Kolkata so that the farmers' revolt would be integrated with the urban thinkers. Unlike the Sepoy Revolt, the Indigo Revolt was effectively a revolt integrating the whole population of Bengalis with no distance kept between the several classes of society, which can be attributed to the effort by Mitra, Rev. James Long, and Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Indian literature has a long-standing tradition of drama writing. For almost a millennium the only form of literature other than odes was drama. The distinction of Sanskrit drama by luminaries like Kalidasa was strong enough to keep audiences absorbed for centuries. But a dawn was coming by the mid-1800s in Bengal where the Bengal Renaissance saw the rise in western education and ideas, and therefore the styles of new forms of literature were seeping in.Бенгальская литература // Литературная энциклопедия. Т. 1. — 1930 (текст) For example, Ram Narayan Tarkaratna (1823–1885) had already left the Sanskrit tradition and started writing social realism. The drama is markedly different from the earlier dramas of that period; notably, the first modern drama written in Bengali by Ram Narayan still had the old sadhu bhasa, the artificial Sanskritised dialect of modern Bengali as the writing medium. The characters in the drama are the villagers and the indigo planters who have the money and the law in their hand. == Characters == ; Male characters * Gokul Chunder Basu, a rich farmer.

It was also important in development of the chalit bhasa, or colloquial dialect, which is free of the Sanskrit-influenced sadhu bhasa. == The trial of Nil Darpan == The proceedings of the trial of Reverend Mr. James Long first appeared in the second Edition (India) of the English version of the play, Nil Darpan (also transliterated as Neel Darpan or Nil Durpan). It included all the relevant documents and comments of the Indian and British newspapers. It was published in 1903 by Messrs A. N. Andini and Co., Calcutta. Mr. Kumud Bihari Bose compiled it under the title: \\"The Trial of the Rev. James Long and the Drama of Nil Durpan,\\" subtitled \\"Indigo Planters and all about them.\\"Editorial note to Nil Durpan, ed. Sudhi Pradhan, p. ii. The play dealt with the upheaval between the indigo planters and Indian ryots in different parts of Bengal, Bihar, and U.P. This conflict gave rise to the rift and division between the different classes of the society and between the different sections of the government as well. == Background of the trial of the play Nil Darpan == James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the government unjustly and oppressively treated the indigo cultivators. His view concurred that of with Dinabandhu Mitra, who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan (the original Bengali play was written by him) and published anonymously in Dhaka in 1860. Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861. Long brought it to the notice of W.S. Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with Lieutenant Governor Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and to print a few copies to be circulated privately among friends. After the discussion, Seton-Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English. Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long. Long, as the editor, cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play. When the translation was complete, Seton-Karr ordered the printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant's wish of a few copies. Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press, to print five hundred copies, and the cost came to around Rs. 300. It was published in April or May 1861. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out the copies in official government envelopes that had the heading: \\"On her Majesty's Service\\".Oddie, p. 119 The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo workers. It naturally offended the establishment so much that the Anglo-Indian press started raising propaganda against the publisher and the translator. One of the leading newspapers named The Englishman and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer C. H. Manuel. The words mentioned in Long's introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was \\"plain but true\\". This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements. Counsel (acting on Long's advice) named Long as the one responsible, as Long had given Manuel a copy of the play for publication. The planters filed for only nominal damages, even as they had decided to prosecute Long for libel in a criminal suit. Friday, 19 July 1861 was fixed as the first date for the trial and it lasted from then to 24 July at the Calcutta Supreme Court. It was regarded as the first \\"state trial of India under the Empire\\". Mr. Peterson and Mr. Cowie were prosecuted. Mr. Eglinton and Mr. Newmarch appeared on behalf of the defendant. Sir Mordunt Wells presided as the judge. It is true that it becomes difficult to censor any literary work when it becomes so available in the public domain. That is why it became very urgent to find out the list of people who had the books after its printing. The issue of finding out the list was the concern for the first day of trial on 19 July 1861. The list submitted at the trial contained the number of copies that had been issued was said to be two hundred and two. The agenda for the days of 20 to 24 July was to justify the two counts brought against James Long. The first count referred to libel or a supposed libel against the two leading newspapers named the Englishman and Hurkaru published in Kolkata. These two papers were alluded to in the preface of the play Nil Durpan: > The Editors of two daily newspapers are filling their columns with your > praises; and whatever other people may think, you never enjoy pleasure from > it, since you know fully the reason of their so doing. What surprising power > of attraction silver has! The detestable Judas gave the great preacher of > the Christian religion, Jesus and others, into the hands of Odious Pilate > for the sake of thirty rupees; what wonder then, if the proprietors of two > newspapers, becoming enslaved by the hope of gaining one thousand rupees, > throw the poor helpless of this land into the terrible grasp of your > mouths.See to the \\"Preface\\" of Nil Durpan, by James Long, ed. by Sudhi > Pradhan, p. xi Being aggrieved, Mr. Brett, the managing proprietor and formerly joint editor of the Englishman, brought a criminal prosecution against James Long. He claimed that the implied meanings of the allusions were defamatory because the extract indicates they wrote for reward from the indigo planters and not otherwise. The second count, which concerned the interests of the society at large, was the alleged libel against that portion of the community called the indigo planters of Lower Bengal. Sir Mordunt Wells accused Long of slandering European women in Nil Durpan: the question of shame was brought up through the episode of a woman riding on horseback with the magistrate of the zillah through the village, as well as injuring the reputation of every European in the country by calling them Planter or Civilian or Soldier. The fictitious characters named Mr. Wood and Mr. Rose in the play represent the indigo planters. This also became a reason for attacking Long. == Bibliography == *Dinabandhu Mitra: Nil Durpan or the Indigo Planting Mirror, translated by Michael Madhusudan Dutt, edited by Sudhi Pradhan and Sailesh Sen Gupta (Calcutta: Paschimbanga Natya Academy, 1997) *Geoffrey A.

Common names Casillon robber frog (sic — the type locality is spelled \\"Castillon\\") and Macaya burrowing frog have been proposed for it. ==Description== Adult males measure on average in snout–vent length and can reach ; females are unknown. The snout is protruding in profile. The canthus rostralis is well defined. The supra-tympanic fold is prominent and hides the upper edge of the tympanum. The fingers and toes have expanded tips; toes are unwebbed but fingers have indistinct lateral ridges. The dorsum is dark brown to pale brown, almost tan, and has darker spotting. There are black supra- tympanic markings. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are tropical closed forests at elevations of above sea level. It is a fossorial species. Males call from shallow, underground chambers, and also the eggs are laid underground. However, one individual was found on herbaceous vegetation about 1 m above the ground. Calling males can be found quite close to each other (about 1 m apart). Eleutherodactylus parapelates is threatened by habitat loss: its range is suffering from severe habitat destruction, primarily due to logging for charcoal production by local people and by slash- and-burn agriculture. Part of its range overlaps with the Pic Macaya National Park, but the park is not managed for conservation. It was formerly moderately common in suitable habitat but has now largely disappeared. ==References== parapelates Category:Frogs of Haiti Category:Endemic fauna of Haiti Category:Amphibians described in 1987 Category:Taxa named by Stephen Blair Hedges Category:Taxa named by Richard Thomas (herpetologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Eleutherodactylus parapelates"},{"id":"12387568","text":"Pristimantis pardalis is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Sir Robert Henry Meade (16 December 1835 - 8 January 1898) was a British civil servant and the Head of the Colonial Office between 1892 and 1897. ==Life== Meade was the second son of the 3rd Earl of Clanwilliam and Lady Elizabeth Herbert. Clanwilliam, an Irish peer, had served as Private Secretary to Lord Castlereagh and subsequently as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Meade was educated at HarrowThe Harrow School Register, 1801-1893 (Longmans, Green & Co, 1894), at page 174 and at Exeter College, Oxford. He formed a close and affectionate relationship with his mother’s brother, Sidney Herbert. In 1859, he sat the examination for the Foreign Office, which he entered as a third class clerk. The work of a junior clerk in the Foreign Office at the time was tedious, consisting mostly of the copying of confidential documents, but the hours were short (11.00 am to 5.00 pm) and the holidays long. Meade escaped this routine in 1860, when he was chosen to accompany Lord Dufferin on his mission to Syria as Commissioner, and again in 1861-1862, when he accompanied the Prince of Wales on an Eastern tour. Following his return, he was in attendance on the Queen during her visit to Coburg later in 1862. In June 1864, Meade was appointed as Private Secretary to Lord Granville. In 1868, Meade followed Lord Granville to the Colonial Office, then briefly to the Foreign Office when Granville became Foreign Secretary in 1870; but Meade returned to the Colonial Office in 1871 as Assistant Under-Secretary, becoming Permanent Under-Secretary in 1892. In December 1896, he fell and broke his leg, an injury from which he never recovered: it forced his retirement in March 1897 and he died soon after, in January 1898. Lord Ripon, the Liberal Colonial Secretary between 1892 and 1895, wrote to him in 1895: Edward Hamilton wrote in his diary on the occasion of Meade’s death: “He had great personal charm and throughout his extraordinary fateful life his pluck never failed him.” ==Family== Meade married, first, Lady Mary Elizabeth Lascelles (the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Harewood), who died in 1866. Their daughter, Mary, died in 1897. He married, secondly, Caroline Georgiana Grenfell (the daughter of Charles William Grenfell MP), who died in 1881. They had one son, Charles Francis Meade (1881–1975). ==References== ;Attribution ==Sources== *Unknown author, Robert Meade 1835-64: The Early Years of a Victorian Civil Servant *http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/clanwm.htm *\\"Death Of Sir Robert Meade\\", The Times, London, 10 January 1898, page 9 ==External links== * Category:Permanent Under-Secretaries of State for the Colonies Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Members of HM Foreign Service Category:Private secretaries in the British Civil Service Category:Principal Private Secretaries to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of Exeter College, Oxford Category:1898 deaths Category:1835 births ","title":"Robert Henry Meade"},{"id":"12387597","text":"Eleutherodactylus patriciae is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, at elevations of asl.

It is endemic to Guadeloupe and known from the Basse- Terre. Common name Grand Cafe robber frog has been coined for it (type locality is near \\"Grand Café\\"). ==Etymology== The specific name pinchoni honors Robert Pinchon, French priest and professor who settled in Martinique in 1945 and assisted Albert Schwartz on his expeditions. ==Description== Eleutherodactylus pinchoni is a small frog: males measure and females in snout–vent length; the smallest gravid female was . The snout is acuminate. The tympanum is visible and almost circular. The fingers are long, slender, and unwebbed, but have moderately well-developed discs. The toes are of moderate length and have vestigial webbing. The dorsum is very finely granular. Dorsal coloration is rich, dark wood brown, with variable patterning displaying four basic types. The most common pattern is a pair of relatively broad dorsal chevrons and—usually—a diagonal flank bar from each end of the second chevron into the groin. Some specimens also have two chevrons, but the posteriormost of which cuts off a middorsal patch of reddish-brown pigment in the sacral area. Instead of chevrons, some specimens have a pair of reddish- brown dorsolateral stripes. Finally, some frogs have a pair of dorsolateral lines as well as an irregular pale median dorsal stripe. The ventrum is orange, but this color may be almost completely obscured by overlying dark brown mottling, blotches, or stipples. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Eleutherodactylus pinchoni are mesic forests and rainforests at elevations of asl. It also survives in secondary forest. It is a terrestrial frog. Males call from the ground or low vegetation, and the eggs are laid on the ground and on bromeliads. Forest habitat suitable for Eleutherodactylus pinchoni is small in area and continues to decline in quality. It is also threatened by pollution from pesticides used in banana plantations, introduced predators (particularly rats, cats and mongooses), and the introduced frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei that appears to be displacing it. ==References== pinchoni Category:Amphibians of the Caribbean Category:Vertebrates of Guadeloupe Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Albert Schwartz (zoologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Eleutherodactylus pinchoni"},{"id":"12387700","text":"Dihydroxymalonic acid is an organic compound with formula C3H4O6 or HO-(C=O)-C(OH)2-(C=O)-OH, found in some plants such as alfalfa and in beet molasses.

His parents were natives of Staffordshire, as were his two younger brothers William and Joseph. The family moved to the United States when he was two years old. They settled in Buffalo, New York. His father died in 1825, and his mother returned to England by herself, in hope of obtaining some property that she believed owned to her. She died in England in 1827 and George, at the age of 10, became an orphan with his brothers. During the next four years he had to provide for himself and his younger brothers. Then he attempted to return to England to recover the property his mother failed to secure. He had to work for his passage to England, and find employment once he got there. He did not reclaim the property and had to work for his passage back to the United States. When he returned, he decided that he would focus on his education, hoping that it would help him gain what he could not through inheritance. He studied one year at Carysville Collegiate Seminary, a year at Aurora Seminary, and two years at French's Collegiate Institute in Geneva, New York. During these four years he taught school as well, and did any other work he could find. He then took up the study of law, with the intention of making it his life profession. He studied with the Hon. George P. Baker in Buffalo, New York. He assisted in Baker's office and was bookkeeper for Dr. Chapin—whom he lived with—to meet his expenses during that time. ==Career== In the spring of 1838, Greene moved to the Territory of Iowa. In Davenport, Iowa he was employed by David J. Owen, who was making a geological survey of the territory. He spent six months surveying, which helped him gain a better knowledge of the lands. After this, he moved to Ivanhoe, Iowa and taught school while continuing his law studies. In 1840, he was admitted to the bar in Iowa City, Iowa. He moved to Marion, Iowa, and began practicing law. That year, he was chosen to represent Cedar, Jones, and Linn counties in the Council of the Third Legislative Assembly as a Democrat. He was re-elected to the following year to the Fourth Legislative Assembly. In 1845, he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, and became the editor of the Miners' Express. In Dubuque he began practicing law again, this time in partnership with J. J. Dyer. Greene's law practice was so successful that he was appointed to be a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court in 1847, to fill the vacancy left by Justice Thomas Stokeley Wilson. He served from November 1, 1847 to January 9, 1855. He was also the reporter of the Supreme Court, so he compiled the decisions of the court in the four-volume G. Greene Reports. In 1849, he became one of the founders of Cedar Rapids, Iowa by surveying and laying out the site of the town. He began living in Cedar Rapids in 1851. He also contributed to the financial development of the city. During the Panic of 1857 he was connected with the management of nine banks in the city. In 1859, Greene formed a law partnership with Cyrus Bently in Chicago, Illinois. He practiced law and lived there for five years. In the winter of 1864 he moved to McGregor, Iowa and helped his brothers build the McGregor Western Railroad. During this time, and several years later, he helped build the Rockford, Rock Island & St. Louis Railroad. He returned to Cedar Rapids after this, and began practicing law with Judge Dudley and his son-in-law A. S. Belt. The firm represented the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. Greene continued to be involved with railroads, and became president of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Minnesota Railroad, which he took an active part in building. When the railroad went bankrupt it was purchased and operated under the name Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railroad. He constructed several smaller railroads in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Kansas. In addition to being a successful lawyer and business man, Greene founded the Grace Episcopal Church, donated the grounds for the church and rectory, and also served as the warden of it. He served as president of the board of trustees of Coe Collegiate Institute, which was later renamed Coe College. In 1872, he changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican. Greene was also a mason and was first Past Master of Crescent Lodge #25, Cedar Rapids (1851–52). He died in his home in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on June 23, 1880, and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery. ==Placenames== * Greene Square Park, Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene's Opera House, Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene Brothers’ Store, town's first major department store, Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene Residence Hall at Coe College, Coe's first Board President, Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene mansion, now part of Mount Mercy College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene Avenue NE, between I and J Avenue NE Cedar Rapids, Iowa * Greene, Iowa ==Family== On May 30, 1838, Greene married Harriet Merritt. Harriet was from Buffalo, New York and was the daughter of Jesse Merritt and Harriet Hilton. They had four children: George W. (b. April 4, 1839), Susan H. (b. March 3, 1841), Mary Ely (b. June 7, 1843), and Edward Merritt (b. March 29, 1845). George W. and Mary Ely died as infants. Harriet died in Dubuque on April 25, 1850; Greene remarried on January 25, 1855 to Frances R. Graves, who was from Cooperstown, New York. Her parents were Clavin Graves and Fanny Carlisle. They had eight children: Calvin G. (b. February 18, 1856), Fanny C. (b. January 19, 1858), George (b.

More information about the Dy’vorians’ Association may be found at: Dynevor Revisited. ==History== The school opened in 1883 and moved to Dynevor Place in 1894 where it could accommodate 500 pupils. In 1907 it became Swansea Municipal Secondary School. In 1930 it changed its name to Dynevor School and from 1942 it was known as Dynevor Secondary Grammar School. In September 1971 it became a comprehensive school which amalgamated with Llwyn-y-Bryn Girls' School in 1978. Dynevor School History at Dynevor Revisited.

Its vernacular English names are upland coqui, mountain coqui, and Puerto Rican robber frog. It is found in the Toro Negro State Forest and other similar mountainous regions.Bosques de Puerto Rico: Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro. Hojas de Nuestro Ambiente. July 2008. [Publication/Issue: P-030] Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Retrieved 29 July 2013. ==History and nomenclature== The history of this species is quite complex, just as that of the common coquí (Eleutherodactylus coqui). In 1927 Eleutherodactylus portoricensis was described as the Puerto Rican coquí and it was classified as a species that lived only in Puerto Rico and which is different from species that live in other Caribbean islands. As such, it was classified as a new species (Schmidt, 1927). From 1927 to 1966 the nighttime CO-QUI sound was thought to correspond to a species of coquí that lived in the entire Island, in high elevations as well as in lower elevations alike (Schmidt, 1928; Thomas, 1966). However, in the winter of 1964-65, Richard Thomas becomes aware that this sound was produced not by one, but by two species. In 1966 this researcher publishes an article in which he establishes that the sample that Schmidt used to describe Eleutherodactylus portoricensis corresponded to a species that lived only in the higher elevations and which is today known as the coquí de montaña. Of the 16 species of coquíes in Puerto Rico, this is the ninth species classified (Thomas & Joglar, 1996). There is no other scientific name for this species. The common name in Spanish is coquí de la montaña. However, there are other common names. In his catalogue of vertebrates in Puerto Rico, Vélez (1977) uses the common name \\"coquí montaño de Puerto Rico\\" and in English \\"Puerto Rico mountain coqui”. In his book on the herpetofauna of Puerto Rico, Rivero (1978) uses the name \\"coquí de montaña\\".Coquí de la Montaña (Eleutherodactylus portoricensis). Proyecto Coqui. 10 February 2009. Retrieved 8 August 2013. ==Habitat== Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is one of the only two species to actually emit the sound \\"coqui\\", the other one being the common coqui. Above its eyes, this species has a white half-moon, and in its belly, it has dark-brown spots. These characteristics make it easy to identify. ==See also== *Fauna of Puerto Rico *List of amphibians and reptiles of Puerto Rico ==References== portoricensis Category:Amphibians of Puerto Rico Category:Endemic fauna of Puerto Rico Category:Amphibians described in 1927 Category:Taxa named by Karl Patterson Schmidt Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Eleutherodactylus portoricensis"},{"id":"12387754","text":"Eleutherodactylus principalis is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

Starting in the 1900s, Deuter Sport provided the Bavarian Royal Mail with post sacks and mail bags. The company expanded in 1905 from producing linen weaving, sackcloth, freight, car and horse blankets to also include a department that offered tent rentals. In 1910, there was a high demand for products from the military. Deuter Sport began manufacturing satchels, backpacks, knapsacks, belts, mess tents and store tents for the military. Starting in 1919, Deuter sport expanded once again and began manufacturing suitcases, backpacks, tents, and truck canopies. At this time, the needs of the tent rental section of the company exceeds its 10,000 sq meter space. It is owned since 2006 by Schwan-Stabilo. ==Environmental Efforts== Deuter Sport commits to be environmentally friendly. The Deuter Drecksack (rubbish bag) is a bag used to carry trash. The bag is very light and very easy to carry and is made out of recycled material. For every Drecksack sold, Deuter donates €1 to the Bergwaldoffensive, an association for the protection of the forests in the Bavarian alps.http://www.bergwald- offensive.de/projekt/bergwald-partner.html (in German); retrieved 20 February 2015 There have been approximately 23,000 Drecksacks sold to date.http://award.ispo.com/en/Winner-2013/Marketing/Multichannel/Deuter-Sport- GmbH-Co.-KG/ Retrieved 20 February 2015 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Deuter official website * Deuter GB UK official website * Deuter USA US official website Category:1898 establishments in Germany Category:German brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1898 Category:Mountaineering equipment manufacturers Category:Sportswear brands ","title":"Deuter Sport"},{"id":"12387759","text":"Eleutherodactylus probolaeus is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to the La Romana Province, Dominican Republic, at elevations of asl.

In 2003, Klassen was voted a member of the B.C. Lions All-Time Dream Team, at defensive tackle, as part of the team's 50th season anniversary celebration. On July 19, 2007, he was inducted onto B.C. Lions Wall of Fame at BC Place Stadium as a part of the 1985 Grey Cup championship team. He died from cancer in 2016.http://www.cfjctoday.com/article/551791/former-bc-lions-standout-rick- klassen-dies- age-57http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theprovince/obituary.aspx?n=richard- danny-klassen&pid;=183105524 == College career == Klassen was recruited by Simon Fraser University as a running back from Sardis Secondary School, Chilliwack, B.C., and played his four years of college football with the Clan. Klassen chose to play his football at SFU because, during the 1970s, it was considered the best football school in Canada and has produced over 160 football players who have gone on to play pro football. In his freshman year, Klassen served as the Clan's backup running back, behind all-star Rick House but, during off-season training between his freshman and sophomore year, he went from 195 to 225 pounds and was immediately switched to the Clan's offensive line. He spent the rest of his three years at SFU at offensive guard. == Early CFL career == Klassen was drafted in 1981 as an offensive guard by the British Columbia Lions as a territorial draft pick. Eight games into the 1981 CFL season, head coach Vic Rapp saw Klassen's potential on the defensive side of the ball and he switched him to defensive tackle after defensive lineman Rick Goltz suffered a season-ending injury. In the 1981 Western Semi-Final, his first ever CFL playoff game, Klassen picked up three sacks against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and helped the Lions win 15-11 in an upset at Winnipeg Stadium. The next week in Edmonton, Klassen played in his first ever Western Final. B.C. almost pulled off the unbelievable but fell short against the Edmonton Eskimos dynasty, as Warren Moon hit Brian Kelly for a late touchdown to beat the Lions, 22-16. Klassen played at the defensive tackle position until the 1983 season, when newly hired head coach Don Matthews put him at rush end in his 3-4 defense. In 1984, however, when Matthews, former Edmonton defensive co-ordinator, traded for James \\"Quick\\" Parker from the Eskimos, Klassen again switched positions. He was put back inside at defensive tackle, where he stayed for the rest of his CFL career. In June 1983 he retired from football due to a contract dispute, but returned nine-days later.Lions' Klassen ends retirement == Career highlights == Klassen played in two Grey Cup games during the B.C. Lions' glory years in the mid-1980s, where he played the two best games of his CFL career. His first Grey Cup experience came in 1983 when the Lions hosted the championship game during the first year of BC Place's existence. That year, the Lions hosted the Western Final for the first time since their 1964 Grey Cup championship and beat Winnipeg, 39-21. In the 71st Grey Cup, the Lions built up a 17-7 half- time lead but, unfortunately, weren't able to maintain the lead, eventually losing to the Toronto Argonauts 18-17 in front of 59,345 fans at BC Place. Klassen was a force at defensive end during the 1983 Grey Cup, earning 2.5 sacks and the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian. Two years later, Klassen was given another shot at winning the Grey Cup. B.C. got back to the Grey Cup in 1985 in what might be considered the greatest Lions team in club history. The team breezed through the 1985 CFL season, finishing with a club-record 13-3 mark to finish first place in the West Division and host their third consecutive Western Final. The Leos dominated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers at BC Place, winning it 42-22. In the 73rd Grey Cup, B.C. continued its dominance against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats en route to a 37-24 victory at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, ending a 21-year drought. Klassen again played an outstanding game at defensive tackle, pressuring and sacking Hamilton quarterback Ken Hobart twice during the game to earn what would be his only Grey Cup championship, however his heroic effort at Olympic Stadium was overshadowed by the play of James \\"Quick\\" Parker, who was named the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player on Defence. Klassen finished his CFL career second all-time in Grey Cup sacks with 4.5, only behind Tyrone Jones. The next two years, the B.C. Lions were close again but weren't able to get past the Edmonton Eskimos in the 1986 and 1987 Western Finals, losing 41-5 at Commonwealth Stadium in 1986 and 31-7 at BC Place in 1987. In the years following their 1985 Grey Cup victory, the Lions faced some hard times off the field and Klassen soon found himself in Saskatchewan. General Manager Bob Ackles left the Lions in 1986 for a job with the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys and the team proceeded to hire Joe Galat as its new General Manager. After a 3-game losing streak midway through the 1987 CFL season, Don Matthews was fired as the Lions head coach by Galat and replaced by Larry Donovan. In 1988, after spending the first seven seasons of his career with B.C., Klassen was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders during the off-season after Galat was hired. Klassen spent one season in Regina, where he helped bring Saskatchewan out of its dark years and led the Roughriders to an 11-7 record and their first home playoff game since 1976. Saskatchewan was beaten by Klassen's old team, the B.C. Lions, 42-18 in the Western Semi-Final and the Roughriders had yet to host a home playoff before hosting Calgary in the Western Semifinal during the 2007 CFL season. Klassen returned to his home in B.C. for his final two season with the Lions. He announced his retirement after the 1990 CFL season. == References == Category:1959 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Chilliwack Category:Players of Canadian football from British Columbia Category:Canadian football defensive linemen Category:Simon Fraser Clan football players Category:BC Lions players Category:Saskatchewan Roughriders players Category:Grey Cup champions ","title":"Rick Klassen"},{"id":"12387866","text":"Pristimantis rhodostichus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The Parmalat bankruptcy hugely affected Football team AC Parma, in which Parmalat was the major shareholder. == 2003 ==  December 2003  December 19 – Bank of America states that Parmalat does not hold nearly $5B in liquid assets for the company as Parmalat reported in September 2003. Bank of America disavows the document released by Parmalat's Bonlat Financing Corp unit claiming over €4B are being stored by an affiliate of the company in the Cayman Islands. The bank promptly notifies Grant Thornton that no such account exists. The Milan Stock Exchange halts trading of Parmalat shares. December 23 – Bank of America lawyers claim the document proclaiming Bank of America holds Parmalat assets is a forgery. December 24 – Parmalat files bankruptcy. S&P; rates Bank of America's exposure as \\"significant, but manageable\\". Investigators put Parmalat's debts as high as $12.8B. == 2004 ==  January 2004  January 12 – Luca Sala, former head of the Italian corporate finance division, denies wrongdoing and maintains that he did not aid Parmalat executives in sustaining the price of Parmalat securities despite knowing the state of its finances. Prosecutors believe the executives constructed a series of shell companies and used forged documents to conceal losses and divert cash. Sala was linked to a $500M Parmalat bond issued by Bank of America and other banks. January 26 – Hoefer & Arnet stock analyst Dick Bove rates Bank of America's stock as a strong buy, but warns that \\"very disturbing signs are emerging that Bank of America’s internal discipline has broken down\\". He believes that the bank's estimated $274M exposure to the scandal, $244 million of which is locked in loans and letters of credit, could have been prevented. January 29 – Bank of America files a petition to close the Irish financing unit of Parmalat, known as Eurofood IFSC Ltd. \\"to protect its interests as a creditor to Eurofood\\". Bank of America is owed more than $3.5M by Eurofood at this time.  February 2004  February 24 – For the first time Bank of America, along with Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS AG, and several Italian banks, becomes a formal target of the Italian investigation surrounding the Parmalat bankruptcy. February 24 – Three of Parmalat's U.S. affiliates, Parmalat USA Corp., Farmland Dairies, and Milk Products of Alabama, file for bankruptcy protection with combined assets of $414.4M and combined debt of $316.5M. February 27 – Luca Sala admits to and offers to forfeit most of the $27M he misappropriated in a kickback scheme at Parmalat, but still maintains the bank was unaware of his improprieties. The SEC travels to Italy to assist Italian officials in deciphering American involvement in the collapse of Parmalat.  March 2004  March 5 – Parmalat seeks $618 million from U.S. banks in order to recover assets from creditors under an Italian claw back law known as \\"revocatoria\\". This law enables insolvent companies to seize assets counterparts received during transactions with them, going back up to five years. At this point, Parmalat's debt is believed to be upwards of $17 billion. March 18 – An Italian judge is asked by prosecutors to order 29 executives and three companies to stand trial on four separate charges. Three executives from Bank of America, Luca Sala, Luis Moncada, and Antonio Luzi, are included in the order. In addition to Bank of America, the Italian affiliates of Deloitte & Touche and Grant Thornton are also ordered to court. Prosecutors believe Bank of America should have been aware of the financial problems at Parmalat when it issued €1.2B, or nearly $1.5B, in Parmalat bonds over the preceding seven years. A fast-track trial was sought, but an Italian court denied expediting proceedings.  May 2004  May 24 – Creditors file a $10B class- action lawsuit against former auditors and banks of Parmalat in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Charges include \\"fraudulent activity and giving misleading information\\". Hermes, a British pension fund holding more than 2% of Parmalat shares, and Deminor, a European shareholder rights group representing Parmalat bondholders, headed the suit.  October 2004  October 7 – Parmalat sues Bank of America for $10B in damages, as it had in July 2004 against Citigroup and in August 2004 against Deloitte & Touche and Grant Thornton. October 19 – Parmalat investors name Bank of America as a defendant in an $8B class-action suit in New York. A previous class-action suit filed on behalf of Parmalat investors was joined into this new suit. October 29 – Bank of America asks an Italian court to include itself as a co- plaintiff in the case against 32 executives, auditors, and lenders in a Milan courtroom, despite the ongoing investigation into Bank of America's involvement in the Parmalat collapse. Bank of America denies any wrongdoing in the matter and is considering filing its own countersuit against Parmalat.  December 2004  December 17 – Bank of America, still being sued for a combined $18B by Parmalat and its investors, is named as one of Parmalat's creditors to the tune of $163M. This means Bank of America can take part, as all creditors can, in a debt-for-equity swap under Parmalat's restructuring plan. This makes Bank of America a shareholder in the company when it emerges from bankruptcy. == 2005 ==  January 2005  January 25 – An Italian court bars Bank of America from claiming damages resulting from Parmalat's bankruptcy. The bank may still file as a damaged civil party if a future trial occurs.  July 2005  July 14 – The $8B class-action lawsuit brought in Manhattan federal court on behalf of Parmalat investors is dismissed. Judge Lewis Kaplan's 74-page decision asserts that Bank of America did not know Parmalat was in financial trouble and thus could not profit off the company's downturn. The judge did not dismiss claims included in the suit against Citigroup, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA, or Credit Suisse First Boston.  August 2005  August 2 – Luca Sala is arrested by Italian authorities for his involvement in the bankruptcy when he was head of Bank of America's Italian corporate banking division and after he became a consultant at Parmalat in 2003. August 9 – A U.S. judge rules Parmalat can proceed with its $10B suit against Bank of America on charges of aiding and abetting break of fiduciary duty and looting of the company. The suit was propelled forward despite Bank of America's protest that a company cannot be sued for fraud by the company perpetrating the fraud in question. Judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed the protest because the precedent called into question was an application of New York law. August 18 – After 16 days, Luca Sala is released from pre-trial custody in Italy after it was determined that he could no longer tamper with evidence. The current charges against him stem from $63.5M in siphoned funds from Parmalat to private accounts. Sala denies stealing the money, instead claiming he earned some of it in commissions from insurance and private-placement contracts he handled for Parmalat.  November 2005  November 28 – Three Cayman Islands-based companies sue Bank of America for its role in the collapse of Parmalat. Charges include financial improprieties including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, & breach of fiduciary duty. The suit claims Bank of America generated millions of dollars in fees and interest when it orchestrated financial transactions designed to disguise Parmalat's insolvency. The claim seeks nearly $1B from Bank of America, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu & Grant Thornton.  December 2005  December 20 – Bank of America is granted the ability to join other plaintiffs in an Italian lawsuit against Parmalat. This is possible due to the condition that Bank of America is entitled to treatment as a damaged party in any civil suit as set forth on 2005-01-25. == 2006 ==  February 2006  February 10 – After amending the lawsuit brought by Parmalat investors against former auditors and banks of the bankrupt company, Judge Lewis Kaplan gives the OK for Bank of America to be sued for its role in helping Parmalat commit securities fraud. The suit centers around a $300M loan made to Parmalat's Brazilian subsidiary and a 2001 change to an insurance policy for Parmalat Venezuela. Bank of America states that it \\"believed it was dealing with a strong, honest, and profitable company and had no knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Parmalat and its senior management\\".  March 2006  March 30 – Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York has ruled Bank of America may seek up to $1B in damages from Parmalat. The ruling allows Bank of America to claim Parmalat committed fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and other illegal acts. == 2007 ==  March 2007  March 26 – Some of the counterclaims brought by Bank of America against Parmalat, including racketeering and North Carolina deceptive-trade practices laws are dismissed by Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York federal district court. \\"Bank of America’s counterclaims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, securities fraud, and civil conspiracy…will go forward\\", stated Bank of America spokesman Timothy Gilles, \\"…and they are significantly more important than the secondary claims that were dismissed.\\"  June 2007  June 22 – U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York grants a permanent injunction against claims by creditors, including Bank of America. It came as a defeat for bondholders and their $868M in claims. The injunction will not apply outside the U.S. or to any Parmalat affiliates or subsidiaries not restructuring under Italian bankruptcy law. June 25 – Bank of America representatives in Milan, Italy release a statement claiming the bank lost $450M from the Parmalat collapse.  July 2007  July 6 – An Italian judge ordered Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and UBS AG to stand trial in January 2008. The specific charges against Bank of America are in connection with an Italian law through which a company can be charged for not having proper governance controls in place to prevent illegal actions by employees. Specifically, Bank of America's accountability is held to its inability to prevent three former employees from market rigging. July 27 – A U.S. Federal bankruptcy judge in New York dismisses claims by foreign investors that the bank knew the Italian company was in financial dire straits and profited from that information. This decision effectively limits the lawsuits to Parmalat investors who reside in the United States. This verdict also is extensible to Citigroup Inc., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Grant Thornton. The $10B suit brought by former Parmalat CEO Enrico Bondi is still being disputed at this time.  August 2007  August 10 – U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York dismisses suits against Bank of America, Credit Suisse, and Grant Thornton brought by two U.S. subsidiaries of Parmalat, Parmalat USA Corp and Farmland Dairies. This extends the former ruling against Parmalat to include its domestic subsidiaries. August 12 – U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan subsequently dismisses the lawsuit brought against Bank of America by Parmalat investors. Kaplan stated that a Supreme Court ruling earlier in the year \\"made plain that investors must show reliance upon a defendant’s own deceptive conduct before that defendant, otherwise a secondary actor, may be found primarily liable\\" and the suit failed to meet that standard. == 2009 ==  January 2009  January 13 – Bank of America is acquitted in an Italian court of all charges drawn from activities prior to April 2002. There was not a law prior to this time which dictated the administrative responsibilities of a corporation. Charging Bank of America for actions (or lack thereof) prior to enactment of the law would thus be a case of ex post facto.  July 2009  July 28 – Bank of America agrees to pay $100M to settle the original $10B lawsuit brought by Parmalat, its subsidiaries, and its investors. The settlement contains both a cash and non- cash component. Bank of America admitted no wrongdoing in settling the case.  October 2009  October 2 – Bank of America provides settlement payment to Parmalat in the amount of US$98.5M. == References == Bankruptcy Category:Bankruptcy Category:Corporate crime Category:Corporate scandals ","title":"Parmalat bankruptcy timeline"},{"id":"12387927","text":"Eleutherodactylus rubrimaculatus is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

Pristimantis scopaeus is a dwarf species: adult males in the type series were first mistaken for juveniles of Pristimantis simoteriscus, which itself already is a small species. The specific name scopaeus is Latinization of the Greek skopaios, meaning \\"dwarf\\". ==Description== Adult males measure in snout–vent length. The snout is subacuminate in dorsal view. No tympanum is visible. Skin of the dorsum is nearly smooth. The dorso-lateral folds are ill-defined. The flanks and venter are coarsely areolate. The fingers have lateral keels and small discs as well as ventral pads. The toes have no webbing, lateral keels, nor discs but have ventral pads. In preserved specimens, the dorsum is brown, with most specimens having slightly darker mottling. The canthal–supra-tympanic stripe is dark brown, and labial bar runs just in front of eye. A living specimen was pale brown with black dorso-lateral spots, black heels and elbows, and with dark brown transverse line on thighs and shanks. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis scopaeus occurs in sub-páramo and páramo habitats at elevations of above sea level. It has also been recorded from pastureland. It is a species that is threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture activities and cattle grazing, in particular burning of the habitat to facilitate growth of grasses.

Common name Colan Mountains robber frog has been proposed for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure in SVL; adult females are unknown but a subadult female measured in SVL. The snout is moderately long. The tympanic annulus is distinct. The fingers and toes bear discs but neither webbing nor lateral fringes. Skin is dorsally finely tuberculate. Coloration in pale gray at night and brown with darker marking by day. The venter is gray while the throat is yellow; both are heavily flecked with gray. The iris is dull bronze with median, horizontal red-brown streak. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis serendipitus occurs in tropical montane forests at elevations of above sea level. Calling males have been recorded at night on leaves of low herbaceous plants in highly disturbed, humid, upper montane forest. Female and juveniles have been found on a bush near a stream and in leaf-litter in humid montane forest. Presumably, as in other Pristimantis, development is direct (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). It is threatened by habitat loss caused by selective logging and agriculture.

Despite his friendship with Eleftherios Venizelos, he sided with King Constantine I during the National Schism. Following Venizelos' victory in 1917, he was imprisoned until 1920. In the 1920 elections he was again elected to Parliament. In 1922 he served twice briefly as Minister for National Economy, in March–April and from May until the outbreak of the 1922 Revolution in September. In between, he headed the Greek delegation to the talks at Genoa aimed at resolving the ongoing Greco-Turkish War.

He was the first indigo planter of Bengal. He started cultivation at Taldanga and Goalpara near Chandannagar (Hooghly).With the Nawabs of Bengal under British power, indigo planting became more and more commercially profitable because of the demand for blue dye in Europe. It was introduced in large parts of Burdwan, Bankura, Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, and Jessore (present Bangladesh). The indigo planters persuaded the peasants to plant indigo instead of food crops. They provided loans, called dadon, at a very high interest. Once a farmer took such loans he remained in debt for his whole life before passing it to his successors. The price paid by the planters was meagre, only 2.5% of the market price. The farmers could make no profit growing indigo. The farmers were totally unprotected from the indigo planters, who resorted to mortgages or destruction of their property if they were unwilling to obey them. Government rules favoured the planters. By an act in 1833, the planters were granted a free hand in oppression. Even the zamindars sided with the planters. Under this severe oppression, the farmers resorted to revolt. The Bengali middle class supported the peasants wholeheartedly. Bengali intellectual Harish Chandra Mukherjee described the plight of the poor farmer in his newspaper The Hindu Patriot. However the articles were overshadowed by Dinabandhu Mitra, who depicted the situation in his play Nil Darpan.His play created a huge controversy which was later banned by the East India Company to control the agitation among the Indians. ==The revolt== The revolt started from the villages of - Gobindapur and Chaugacha in Krishnanagar, Nadia district, where Bishnucharan Biswas and Digambar Biswas first led the rebellion against the planters in Bengal ,1859. It spread rapidly in Murshidabad, Birbhum, Burdwan, Pabna, Khulna, and Narail. Some indigo planters were given a public trial and executed. The indigo depots were burned down. Many planters fled to avoid being caught. The zamindars were also targets of the rebellious peasants. Mongolganj Indigo Kuthi in North 24 Parganas The revolt was ruthlessly suppressed. Large forces of police and military, backed by the British Government and the zamindars, mercilessly slaughtered a number of peasants. British police mercilessly hanged great leader of indigo rebels Biswanath Sardar alias Bishe Dakat in Assannagar, Nadia after a show trial. Some historians opined that he was the first martyr of indigo revolt in undivided Bengal. In spite of this, the revolt was fairly popular, involving almost the whole of Bengal. The Biswas brothers of Nadia, Kader Molla of Pabna, and Rafique Mondal of Malda were popular leaders. Even some of the zamindars supported the revolt, the most important of whom was Ramratan Mullick of Narail. ==The effect on the British rulers in India== The historian Jogesh Chandra Bagal describes the revolt as a non-violent revolution and gives this as a reason why the indigo revolt was a success compared to the Sepoy Revolt. R.C. Majumdar in \\"History of Bengal\\"Majumdar, R. C. The Government in 1860 enacted the Indigo Act, according to which no planter could be forced to cultivate indigo against his will. The History of Bengal goes so far as to call it a forerunner of the non-violent passive resistance later successfully adopted by Gandhi. The revolt had a strong effect on the government, which immediately appointed the \\"Indigo Commission\\" in 1860. In the commission report, E. W. L. Tower noted that \\"not a chest of Indigo reached England without being stained with human blood\\". Finally, the British government formed the Indigo Commissionin 1860 due to Nawab Abdul Latif’s initiative with the goal of putting an end to the repressions of indigo planters(by creating the Indigo Act 1862). ==Cultural effects== Dinabandhu Mitra's 1860 play Nil Darpan is based on the revolt (was published from Dhaka) . It was translated into English by Michael Madhusudan Dutta and published by Rev. James Long. It attracted much attention in England, where the people were stunned at the savagery of their countrymen. The British Government sent Rev. Long to a mock trial and punished him with imprisonment and fine. Kaliprasanna Sinha paid the fine of Rs 1000 for him. The play was the first play to be staged commercially in the National Theatre in Kolkata.

In 1693 he became administrator of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1689 he was extraordinary-ambassador to the English court and became Fellow of the Royal Society. In his free time, he was cartographer, maritime writer, and an authority on shipbuilding. His books on the subject are important sources on Dutch shipbuilding in the 17th century. Furthermore, he was an expert on Russian affairs. He was the first to describe Siberia, the Far East and Central Asia in his study Noord en Oost Tartarye [North and East Tartary].The Witsen Project. ==Early life== Nicolaes Witsen was born in Amsterdam, the son of Cornelis Jan Witsen, burgomaster, head bailiff and administrator of the Dutch West India Company. In 1656 Nicolaes went with his father to England, where he was introduced to Oliver Cromwell's children.Gebhard Jr, J.F. (1881) Het leven van Mr Nicolaes Cornelisz. Witsen. In March 1662 Nicolaes Witsen held a disputation at the Amsterdam Athenaeum Illustre, in which he argued against the influence of comets on the welfare of all earthly things, possibly influenced by his nephew Joannes Hudde. In 1664 and 1665 Nicolaes made an embassy to Moscovia with the envoy Jacob Boreel. By boat, they went to Riga, then Swedish, and overland to Novgorod and Moscow. There he met with Andrew Vinius, who became his life long friend, sending him maps and objects. The talks with czar Alexis of Russia about a monopoly on tar were no success. Witsen wrote in his diary that no-one there was occupied with art or science. Witsen visited the Patriarch Nikon and made notes on the worship of icons, interested in his name saint (and patron saint of Amsterdam), saint Nicholas. He studied law at Leiden University, but became more interested in languages and maps. In the 1666–1667 Witsen travelled to Rome and met with Cosimo III de' Medici in Pisa. In Paris, he met the scientist Melchisédech Thévenot.ПУТЕШЕСТВИЕ В МОСКОВИЮ НИКОЛААСА ВИТСЕНА In 1668 he travelled to Oxford. In 1674 he married Catherina Hochepied. Four children were born, not surviving childhood. ==Shipbuilding== Witsen wrote \\"Aeloude and hedendaegsche Scheepsbouw en Bestier\\" in 1671, which quickly became seen as the standard work on the subject. Even an anatomist like Steno read the book. The technique Witsen describes is shell-first, and not frame-first. The book is not easy to read, because of misty wording and the chaotic structure, but has a lot of interesting engravings, made by himself. It can be compared with Doctrine for Naval Architecture by fellow-shipbuilder Anthony Dean, a mayor of Harwich and also a mentor of Peter the Great.Hoving, A.J. (1994) Nicolaes Witsens Scheeps- Bouw-Konst Open Gestelt, p. 28. It led to a correspondence between him and Peter the Great on modernising the Imperial Russian Navy, then backward by Western European standards. This led to an order for warships from Amsterdam shipyards in return for an ukase (negotiated by Witsen) on Dutch-Russian trade, guaranteeing to supply the Republic with grain, wood, talc, tar and skins. In 1697 Witsen organised a four-month training period for the tsar at the Dutch East India Company shipyards during his Grand Embassy, with the Tsar staying in Jacob J. Hinlopen's house and being taken by Witsen among many others to meet the botanist and anatomist Frederik Ruysch.Driessen, J. (1996) Tsaar Peter de Grote en zijn Amsterdamse vrienden. In cooperation with Amsterdams Historisch Museum, p. 40. ==Cartography== Map of Tartary (Land of the Tartars) After 20 years' study, Witsen published the first map of Siberia in 1690. This map represented the world from Nova Zembla to as far away as China. Witsen had discussed with the tsar the trade routes to Persia via the Caspian Sea and to China via Siberia. In 1692 he published a compendium titled \\"Noord en Oost Tartarye\\", describing Siberia and the surrounding areas, though without literary references. He consulted classical authors and Arabic medieval writers as well as his learned contemporaries in Europe. The second enlarged edition, a bulky book, also written in the 17th century Dutch, presents a rather complicated mixture of various texts with encyclopaedic details. It appeared in 1705 and was reprinted in 1785. In this book, Witsen gave an account of all the information available to the Europeans at that time about the northern and eastern parts of Europe and Asia, and also about the Volga area, Crimea, Caucasus, Central Asia, Mongolia, Tibet, China, Korea and the neighbouring parts of Japan. In the text, for instance, we find lists of 900 Georgian and 700 Kalmyk words and illustrations of the writing systems of Tibetan, Manchu and Mongolian languages. Witsen provides word lists and other data on more than 25 languages.Graaf, T. de, & B. Naarden. 2007. Description of the Border Areas of Russia with Japan and Their Inhabitants in Witsen's North and East Tartary. In: Acta Slavica Iaponica 24, pp. 205–220. For the article see this link In 1692 Witsen received the diary of Maarten Gerritsz Vries, who had explored the coast of Sahkalin in 1643, and it was never seen again. ==Mayor and Maecenas== In 1688, Witsen was visited and invited more than once to discuss William III's proposed crossing to England, but he had great doubts and did not know what to advise. William Bentinck called him the most sensitive man in the world.When Witsen was invited for the first time to see the prince, Witsen started to cry and fell on his knees, according to his personal archive, but could not refuse. In: Kok, J. (1744) Vaderlands Woordenboek, p. 251. Of the other three burgomasters – Jean Appelman (a merchant trading with France), Johannes Hudde and Cornelis Geelvinck – Geelvinck openly opposed the enterprise and Appelman was not trusted by the prince and thus was not informed. After the crossing went ahead, Witsen went to London in the next year to find a way of meeting the costs of 7,301,322 guilders the city of Amsterdam had incurred in supporting it. William offered to knight him as a baronet, but the modest Witsen refused.Kok, J. (1744) Vaderlands Woordenboek, p. 251-2. Already in his youth Witsen started to collect Siberian curiosities and artworks, gathering corals, lacquer, books, paintings, weapons, porcelain, insects, seashells, stuffed animals and precious stones into his house on Herengracht on the Golden Bend. As mayor, he was a patron of the arts and sciences and maintained contacts with German scholars, such as Leibniz. He corresponded with Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, discovering tiny creatures under his microscope. In 1698 Willem de Vlamingh offered him two seashells from New Holland (Australia) and Witsen offered the drawings to Martin Lister.Smit, P & A.P.M. Sanders & J.P.F. van der Veen (1986) Hendrik Engel's Alphabetical List of Dutch Zoological Canbinets and Menageries, p. 306. Witsen, who had invested in the journey, was disappointed that the men had been more interested in setting up trade than in exploring.Heeres, J.E. (1899) The part borne by the Dutch in the discovery of Australia 1606–1765, p. XVI, 83. Witsen tried to introduce coffee plants from Batavia via Amsterdam to countries in South America. Boerhaave estimated that Witsen had put together a collection of more than 1500 paintings of plants that came to be known as the Codex Witsenii and were for the greater part of plants growing in and around the Cape Peninsula.South African Botanical Art – Marion Arnold et al. (Fernwood Press, 2001) These passed into the custody of Caspar Commelin, Professor of Botany at the Athenaeum Illustre and working in the Hortus Botanicus. After Commelin's death, they were passed to Johannes Burman, inspiring him to produce Rariorum africanarum plantarum in 1738-9. On Burman's death in 1779, his effects passed to his son, Nicolaas Laurens Burman. After his death in 1793, his effects, including the Codex, were sold by auction in 1800, disappearing from the records. Witsen had contact with the painter Jan de Bray over a plan to improve the city's water supply, and helped the artist Cornelis de Bruijn, who needed contacts in Egypt and Russia – indeed, it was probably Witsen who encouraged De Bruijn to make drawings of Persepolis, to show to the Royal Society.Sancisi-Weerdenburg, H. (1998) Cornelis de Bruijn, Voyages from Rome to Jerusalem and from Moscow to Batavia, p. 45. Allard Pierson Museum, Amsterdam. Hutton 2001. p. 32. 46 persons dedicated books to Witsen, including several by Olfert Dapper, one by the brother of Johan Nieuhof (including descriptions of Chinese shipbuilding), one by Jan van der Heyden on his invention of the fire hose and by the pharmacist Hermanus Angelkot jr. and Pieter Langendijk. He helped Maria Sybilla Merian to publish her prints with plants and insects from Surinam. Witsen was also interested in religion but in an ecumenical way: his interests stretched to \\"saint Confucius\\" as he called him (based on his analysis of a Han dynasty Chinese mirror in his collection), as well as to shamanism. The minister famous for attacking witch-hunts, Balthasar Bekker, was his friend. Witsen died in Amsterdam and was buried in Egmond aan den Hoef, not far from his country house, called \\"Tijdverdrijf\\" (=to pleasurably pass time). Peter the Great was present when Witsen died and said he lost a great friend. ==Works== * N. Witsen, Moskovische Reyse 1664–1665. Journaal en Aentekeningen (Ed. Th.J.G.

The term can also refer to landscaping of housing estates, business parks, etc., in which there are no defined property boundaries, such as hedges, fences or walls. Open-plan office designs are generally promoted as improving collaboration, but moving from cubicles to open workspaces (e.g., tables with no visual barriers) actually results in dramatically fewer face-to-face interactions among staff and reduced productivity. In residential design, open plan or open concept (the term used mainly in Canada)Definition of open-concept at Dictionary.com describes the elimination of barriers such as walls and doors that traditionally separated distinct functional areas, such as combining the kitchen, living room, and dining room into a single great room. ==Homes== Many pre-industrial homes were huts that consisted of a single room, but this was usually small. Already in the Middle Ages, however, there were some single- room hearth-heated hall houses, for example in England, that were large enough so they could develop into multi-room houses. Multi-room houses however didn't become popular until later when the country industrialized, as a result of which more people could afford them. In the 1880s, small public rooms of the home with specific functions began to be replaced by larger rooms that fulfilled multiple uses, but kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms remained enclosed private spaces. Larger rooms were made possible by advances in centralized heating that allowed larger spaces to be kept at comfortable temperatures. Frank Lloyd Wright was one of the early advocates for open plan design in houses, expanding on the ideas of Charles and Henry Greene and shingle style architecture. Wright's designs were based on a centralized kitchen open to other public spaces of the home where the housewife could be \\"more hostess 'officio', operating in gracious relation to her home, instead of being a kitchen mechanic behind closed doors.\\" Not having a dividing wall between the kitchen and a combined living-dining room became more popular especially in the United States in the 1970s. A home with this type of layout has one or more large, open rooms that function as multiple rooms within a single living space. The most common design is a great room that combines the kitchen, dining room, and living room into one shared space. Such floor plans usually work well in homes with a smaller area, while larger homes have more leeway to work with when integrating great rooms into a floor plan.http://www.casedesign.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-open-floor-plans/ The removal of interior walls increases views and allows sunlight from windows in the exterior walls to spread throughout the house. In the late 2010s, disapproval of the open plan design has become more common. Complaints about open plan designs include that they make it more difficult for different people to engage in different activities and make it difficult to hide clutter or a dirty kitchen.People in open-concept homes are realizing the walls were there for a reason Walls are useful to contain noise and smells and to provide privacy, and small rooms are more efficient to heat and cool (especially when kitchen appliances are in use).The Case for Rooms A follow-on trend among relatively wealthy homeowners is to build a second \\"mess kitchen\\" where the actual activity of food preparation takes place, while entertaining happens in a clean kitchen that is part of the open concept space.The new home trend: two kitchens == Office spaces ==  Development of open-plan workspace types  Prior to the 1950s open-plan offices mostly consisted of large regular rows of desks or benches where clerks, typists, or technicians performed repetitive tasks.Duffy, F. (1997). The new office. London Conran Octopus Such designs were rooted in the work of industrial engineers or efficiency experts such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford. In the 1950s a German team named Quickborner developed the office landscape, which used conventional furniture, curved screens, large potted plants, and organic geometry to create work groups on large, open floors. Office landscape was quickly supplanted by office-furniture companies which developed cubicles based on panel-hung or systems furniture. Many terms (mostly derisive) have been used over time for offices using the old-style, large arrays of open cubicles. An increase in knowledge work and the emergence of mobile technology during the late 20th- century led to an evolution in open-plan offices.Gillen, N. M. (2006). \\"The Future Workplace, Opportunities, Realities and Myths: A Practical Approach to Creating Meaningful Environments.\\" In J. Worthington (Ed.), Reinventing the Workplace (2nd ed., pp. 61–78). Oxford: Architectural Press.Davis, M. C., Leach, D. J., & Clegg, C. W.

Ford (Eds.), International Review of Industrial and Organizational Psychology (Vol. 26, pp. 193–235). Chichester, UK: Wiley. Many companies have started experimenting with designs which provide a mix of cubicles, open workstations, private offices, and group workstations. In some cases, these are not assigned to one particular individual, but are available to any employee of the company on either a reservable or \\"drop-in\\" (first come, first served) basis. Terms for this strategy include hoteling, \\"alternative officing\\"Cornell study and \\"hot desking\\". Michael Bloomberg used a team-oriented bullpen style – where employees can see and hear each other freely, but desks are grouped into teams – at his media company Bloomberg L.P. and for his staff while Mayor of New York CityNagourney, Adam. \\"Bloomberg Vows to Work at Center of Things\\", New York Times (in office: 2002–2013).  Evaluation  A systematic survey of research upon the effects of open-plan offices found frequent negative effects in some traditional workplaces: high levels of noise, stress, conflict, high blood pressure and a high staff turnover. The noise level in open-plan offices greatly reduces productivity, which drops to one third relative to what it would be in quiet rooms. New technologies like voice-activation and mobile phones also decrease effectiveness in the open-plan setting. Although promoted as a way to encourage collaboration and increase the group's collective intelligence, open-plan offices result in a dramatic reduction in face-to-face interactions, as employees turn to digital communication, such as sending e-mail messages. Open-plan offices have frequently been found to reduce the confidential or private conversations which employees engage in, and to reduce job satisfaction, concentration and performance, whilst increasing auditory and visual distractions. Open-plan offices have been found to elevate the risk of employees needing to take time off for sickness. Health considerations such as COVID-19 may militate against working in open-plan offices. The interior design of open-plan offices has been found as one of the key elements where occupants' high satisfaction scores and perceived productivity were observed. A human-centered approach to design is crucial to open-plan offices, along with providing workers with a variety of space that support activities when mitigating issues in such environments == See also == * Panopticon == References == Category:Interior design Category:Human resource management ","title":"Open plan"},{"id":"12388224","text":"Pristimantis tribulosus is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae.

October. 2006. Web. 2 March. 2010. The females have a light line across the eyelids and usually have “white dots along the face, flanks, forelimbs, and thighs.” The Eleutherodactylus species do not have webbed feet. These frogs, especially the dwarf coqui, have individual, finger-like feet, with round, disc-like toes. E. coqui is often referred to as the “coqui,” which originates from its distinctive call. The “coqui” frogs are known for the unusual sounds they make. “The call of the dwarf coqui has been compared to the sound of a fingernail being dragged across the teeth of a comb or the winding of a watch.” ==See also== *Fauna of Puerto Rico *List of endemic fauna of Puerto Rico *List of amphibians and reptiles of Puerto Rico ==Sources== Category:Eleutherodactylus Category:Endemic fauna of Puerto Rico Category:Amphibians of Puerto Rico Category:Amphibians described in 1904 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Dwarf coqui"},{"id":"12388263","text":"Pristimantis unistrigatus (common name: striped robber frog, in Spanish cutín de Quito) is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The specific name uranobates is derived from Greek ouranos and bates, meaning \\"one who haunts the heavens\\". This refers to \\"the lofty habitat of the species in the Los Nevados district of Colombia\\". Common name Caldas robber frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is wider than the body. The snout is rounded. The canthus rostralis and supra-tympanic fold are prominent, the latter obscuring upper edge of tympanum. The fingers bear narrow lateral fringes and rounded discs. The toes are long, have lateral fringes, and bear discs that are twice as large as the finger ones. Dorsal skin is shagreened and has some scattered warts. The dorsum is reddish-brown and has darker brown markings and cream to orange dorsolateral folds, but the actual pattern is polymorphic. The flanks have brown to black bars on dirty cream to orange-brown ground color. The throat is gold to dull copper-brown, while the venter is greenish-yellow and has brown spots or reticulation. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis uranobates occurs in cloud forests and paramos at elevations of above sea level. It is very common on low vegetation by roads and streams. During the day, they can be found under rocks and logs, whereas at night they climb to vegetation, mostly no higher than half a metre above the ground. This species is very common and adaptable. No major threats to it are known, although chytridiomycosis remains a potential threat.

In 1858 he married Miss Mary Christian Law, the granddaughter of Dr George Henry Law, formerly Bishop of Bath and Wells. An estimated 2,000 people attended his funeral at Gwennap where he was buried in the family vault. His residence was at Goonvrea in the parish of Perranarworthal and the family seat was at Tregullow near Scorrier House. Sir Frederick bequeathed all his real and personal estate to his widow (estimated at under £160,000) and the large freehold property, of Tregullow to his heir, Sir William Williams, 3rd Baronet, of Tregullow. An Order of the High Court of Justice required the lease of the Prince of Wales Quarry at Trewarner Down in the Manor of Tintagel, which was owned by the deceased, to be sold at auction on 30 August 1880. The quarry included the only beam engine in north Cornwall, which hauled stone from the pit and drained the quarry. The beam engine was expensive when installed in July 1871 for £1,590 4s. ==Cornish Bank== Sir Frederick Williams was a major shareholder of the Cornish Bank with a one-third share. The Cornish Bank \\"closed its doors\\" on Saturday, 4 January 1879, following persistent rumours, that following his death, his property and resources would be withdrawn from the bank. The bank issued a circular on 27 December 1878 in an attempt to dispel the rumours claiming they were making arrangements to replace Sir Frederick's share of the capital. One rumour was that Sir Frederick was overdrawn on his account by £80,000 and consequently, the creditors became alarmed and there was a run on the Bank on Wednesday, 1 January. The bank had branches in Falmouth, Penryn, Redruth and Truro with the first one established in either 1770 or 1771 in Boscawen Street, Truro. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:1830 births Category:1878 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Cornwall Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Truro Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 Category:UK MPs 1868–1874 Category:UK MPs 1874–1880 Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies ","title":"Sir Frederick Williams, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"12388316","text":"Eleutherodactylus verruculatus is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

The iris is pale copper to reddish-copper, with thick black reticulation. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis viejas occurs in sub-Andean forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals can be found under bushes, in forest edge, secondary forest, and in open areas in forests. It is nocturnal. Breeding occurs through direct development (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage). Pristimantis viejas is a common and adaptable species that seems to benefit from a degree of disturbance to forest habitats. It is not facing any significant threats. ==References== viejas Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Amphibians described in 1999 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis viejas"},{"id":"12388338","text":"Pristimantis vilarsi (common name Rio Uaupes robber frog, in Spanish ranita selvatica común) is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is found in the upper Amazon basin in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. Dorsal skin is shagreened and has scattered small warts, but ventral skin smooth. The tympanum is prominent and vertically oval. The snout is subacuminate to acuminate in dorsal view, but round in vertical profile. The canthus rostralis is distinct and angular. Fingers and toes bear discs (enlarged on fingers III and IV and toes IV and V) but have no webbing. Males have vocal slits. There are three color patterns: (1) dorsum greenish gray, light to dark brown, without pattern or with very small black spots, (2) strongly patterned dorsum with brown to olive background and bearing a \\"W\\" mark between the shoulders, as well as diagonal dark brown stripes across the body and limbs, and (3) an intermediate form showing light to dark brown dorsum with indistinct bars, with or without the W between the shoulders, and sometimes with a lichen-like pattern. All forms have dark brown canthal and supratympanic stripes. ==Habitat and conservation== Pristimantis vilarsi lives in the leaf litter of lowland rainforests at elevations of above sea level ( in Colombia). During the night they can be found on low plants, leaves, rocks, mossy walls, and on the ground. Males call at night. The egg deposition site is unknown. It appears to tolerate some disturbance of its habitat. It is a common species whose range overlaps with several protected areas. ==References== vilarsi Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1941 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pristimantis vilarsi"},{"id":"12388346","text":"Pristimantis vinhai is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Schofield has served a long career as an advertising professional, journalist, creative arts festival director, and trustee of arts and cultural organisations. ==Biography== Schofield was born in Brewarrina, New South Wales, the son of a football- loving publican. (Which football code is unclear, but it is likely to have been rugby league, based on the location and era.) He was educated at Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham and commenced his first job in 1949, as a 14-year-old, in the haberdashery department of Grace Brothers, an Australian store chain. He entered journalism in the 1970s at the Sunday Australian, which folded into the Sunday Telegraph. He also contributed to numerous other publications including The Australian, Vogue, The Bulletin and The Sydney Morning Herald for two decades. In 1984, Schofield established The Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide with co-editors David Dale and Jenna Price; and remained editor until the ninth edition was published in 1993. He was the artistic director of the Melbourne International Arts Festival between 1993 and 1996. In 1997 he assumed responsibility as artistic director of the Sydney Festival (between 1998 and 2001), and conjointly held the position as artistic director of the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Paralympics arts festivals. In 2010, Schofield took on the role of a judge on the Australian adaptation of the cooking program Iron Chef. He has variously served on the boards of Sydney Symphony Orchestra (inaugural Chairman from 1996 to 2000), the Centennial Park Trust, the National Trust of Australia (NSW), and as a Trustee of the Powerhouse Museum, the Dame Joan Hammond Foundation, Melbourne's Old Treasury Building, and the Sydney Opera House Trust. ==Personal life== Schofield met Anne while he was directing plays at the Sydney University Dramatic Society. Anne went to London to marry him in 1962, but after daughter Nell was born in 1963 they returned to Australia. In 1965 the twins Emma and Tess were born.Pearls of wisdom Retrieved 9 October 2016. Schofield and his wife separated after 19 years. Schofield came out in 2015, and stated \\"many gay men would envy me for the fact that I've been able to have children.\\"Mark Dapin: Baroque and bogans battle over the menu at lunch with Leo Schofield, Sydney Morning Herald, 4 April 2015. ==Controversy== In 1989 Schofield and John Fairfax and Sons Limited were parties to the Blue Angel defamation case. In a review of the meal published in The Sydney Morning Herald in 1984, Schofield compared a lobster dish as \\"...close to culinary crime\\". He wrote it had been \\"...cooked until every drop of juice and joy in the thing had been successfully eliminated... leaving a charred husk of a shell containing meat that might have been albino walrus\\". A damages award of 100,000 plus interest was made against Schofield and Fairfax when it was found that they had defamed the Blue Angel restaurant. In 2015, after Schofield failed to secure increased funding for the Hobart Baroque Festival, he attacked Tasmania in the Sydney press; calling the island state's leaders and residents who had previously funded his music festival \\"dregs, bogans and third-generation morons\\". Schofield's comments were widely refuted and condemned by leading Tasmanian and Australian arts figures, as well as political leaders. Schofield's views were derided by celebrated Tasmanian author, Bradley Trevor Greive, as “churlish, gauche and unforgivably small”, with numerous arts commentators describing Schofield's remarks as highly offensive, petulant, unbecoming and divisive. Tasmanian Premier, Will Hodgman released an official statement promoting Tasmania's commitment to the arts and his government's \\"support [of] exceptional events and festivals\\". Hodgman also stated that \\"Leo Schofield's comments [were] derogatory, ignorant and right out of step with what the vast majority of people are saying about Tasmania.\\" Schofield later claimed to be taking anti-depressants and drinking excessively. In an article published on the Tasmanian Times website, Schofield said he was deeply sorry for his \\"ill-considered, intemperate and inelegant remarks\\" for which he apologized unreservedly. Schofield later relocated the Baroque Festival to Brisbane where, according to Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania, who accused Schofield of \\"blatant mistruths\\", the Queensland-based festival program received exactly the same amount of funding that prompted Schofield's embarrassing public outburst against Tasmania. The 2016 Brisbane Baroque festival opening night was picketed by an informal Tasmanian pro-arts performance group, known as \\"Leo's Bogan Brigade\\", who used the media attention focussed on Schofield's negative remarks as a positive opportunity to promote young and emerging Tasmanian artists. ==Bibliography== * ==Awards== * 2000 appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to the arts, particularly the Sydney Festival and the Melbourne Festival, as a fundraiser and administrator, and to environmental and heritage conservation * 2001 awarded the Australian Government Centenary Medal for outstanding service to the Australian arts, culture, heritage and food industry * 2002 made a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government ==ReferencesExternal links== * National Portrait Gallery, Canberra * University of New South Wales * Bronte House * Melbourne International Arts Festival Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian art directors Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:Recipients of the Centenary Medal Category:Restaurant critics ","title":"Leo Schofield"},{"id":"12388349","text":"Map of the island of Wolin Wisełka (German Neuendorf) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wolin, within Kamień County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-western Poland.

He was a founding member of the Association of Greek Art Critics, AICA-Hellas, International Association of Art Critics. His oeuvre includes buildings and urban planning in Athens and the entirety of Greece—including several schools and a playground in Filothei, Athens. == Life and work == He was born in Piraeus by parents of Chiot descent. He inherited his talent in painting from his father, who was had an aptitude in the arts. In 1906, he became the first student of Konstantinos Parthenis, a distinguished Greek painter, while he was studying at the National Technical University of Athens civil engineering, graduating in 1908. He then continued his studies in Paris and Munich, in sculpture and drawing. In Paris, he attended architecture classes at Ecole des Beaux Arts (Paris). Pikionis was back then introduced to the work of Paul Cézanne and became friends with Giorgio de Chirico.Dimitris Pikionis, 1887-1968 (2000) by Alberto Ferlenga, The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, (59), 1, 126–128 Some Greek painters of the time, such as Georgios Bouzianis and Periklis Giannopoulos, were influential figures during these formative years. He returned to Greece and after the Balkan Wars, he started studying and working in architecture during which period, he began shifting his focus on the study of the modern Greek architecture. In 1921, he undertook a lecturer position at the 'Morphology' department at the National Technical University of Athens where he stayed until 1923. In 1925, he received a permanent position in the department of decoration as a professor. Between 1930-1935, he co-published with his good friend, the painter Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas the magazine '3ο Μάτι' (translated as '3rd Eye') where he published many of his texts. The magazine collaborated with many artists and academics, such as Stratis Doukas, Takis Papatsonis, Sokratis Karantinos and others. His first important work was Moraitis house in Tzitzifies (1921-1923). In 1932, upon the completion of the Elementary School in Pefkakia of Lykavittos, he came to the realisation that his works were not satisfactory and changed his aesthetic perceptions. All of his subsequent architectural works were based on the idea of bridging universalism with regionalism. In the 1940s and 1950s, his architectural creation was limited to designs for graves. However, in the following period, from 1951 to 1957, he was involved in many projects. Among them is the formation of the archaeological site around the Acropolis and Philopappou hill, perhaps his most important work, and the tourist pavilion of St. Demetrios Loubardiaris, seeking its ideal. In 1958, after 35 years of NTUA as a professor, he retired. In 1966 he was elected a full member of the Academy of Athens. He has been often described as a critical regionalist and sometimes as a European modernist.Prospects For a Critical Regionalism (1983) Perspecta 20, 147–162 In 1933, Pikionis with other Greek architects signed the Athens Charter, a manifesto of the modernist movement which published later by Le Corbusier. However he didn't embrace completely the new movement. The leitmotif in his work has been, according to architecture historians, the epiphany, the contrast between bleached marble and sodden soil. He died in Athens on 28th of August 1968. == Legacy == Although he actually built few buildings, Pikionis is revered for the landscaping work in pedestrian areas around the Acropolis of Athens, a work done in the 1950s. Utilizing rough- finished marble in various shapes that appear irregular, yet are strictly geometric, and incorporating expertly chosen local fora on his terraces and steps, Pikionis' work has astounded visitors to the area and remains highly thought of ever since. He utilized similar techniques in creating the children's playground of the municipality of Filothei, an affluent Athens suburban area. == Notable works == * Lycabettus School * Moraitis House, Tzitzifies, 1921-1923 * Kotopouli Theatre, 1932 * Primary School of Pefkakia, 1932 * Experimental School of Thessaloniki, 1933 * Landscaping of the Acropolis of Athens surrounding area, 1954–57 * Filothei playground, 1961–64 * Hotel Xenia, Delphi * City Hall of Volos, Volos * Pourris House, Athens view == References  External links == * Pikionis works * Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Greek architects Category:Greek art critics Category:Greek academics Category:Greek painters Category:Greek expatriates in Germany Category:National Technical University of Athens alumni Category:National Technical University of Athens faculty Category:Members of the Academy of Athens (modern) Category:People from Piraeus ","title":"Dimitris Pikionis"},{"id":"12388361","text":"Diasporus vocator, sometimes known as Agua Buena robber frog after its type locality, Agua Buena, in Golfito canton of Costa Rica, is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae.

Common names Rosario red-legged frog and Zug's robber frog have been coined for it. Eleutherodactylus erythroproctus was originally described as a subspecies of Eleutherodactylus zugi, and is sometimes still treated as such. ==Description== Eleutherodactylus zugi is a small species: adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rather acute. The tympanum is visible and larger in females than in males of the same size. The fingers and toes are short and have no webbing. The dorsum is warty, including a raised middorsal line. The throat and the venter are smooth. There are three basic color patterns. The first type has a dark brown to tan middorsal zone that is bounded by a broad yellow or orange dorsolateral stripe. The second type has a pair of dorsolateral stripes that end dorsally, and a thin middorsal line. The third type has a mottled dorsum, without indications of dorsolateral bands or stripes. ==Habitat and conservation== Eleutherodactylus zugi occurs in mesic broadleaf forests at elevations of above sea level. The type series was collected from wet shrubs few inches above the ground, and under less wet conditions, under palm trash and other debris. At night they may climb on moist rocks. The eggs are deposited on the ground. Development is direct, without free-living larval stage. Eleutherodactylus zugi is a rare species with a restricted range.

Released theatrically on July 5, 1954, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal- International. ==Plot synopsis== Woody Woodpecker is driving in town singing, only to come across a Used Car Row where Buzz Buzzard is the Honest Injun, (actually Dishonest Injun), one of several car dealers with proprietorships on Used Car Row. Resorting to deliberate sabotage in order to attract business, Buzz causes Woody Woodpecker to wreck his car when he drives by. Since Woody is now in need of a car, Buzz is more than happy to show the woodpecker around the lot. Woody has a hunch that something screwy is going on, but Buzz promises that his cars are clean (one exception is when a skunk leaves a car). While showing Woody a certain car, Buzz tries to trick Woody by playing a record of hot-rod sound effects under the hood. Unfortunately for Buzz, the plan backfires when the phonograph flips the record to the other side and plays animal sound effects, causing the car to go crazy. The out-of-control vehicle runs over Buzz and destroys several other cars as well. Buzz, angered by Woody for destroying his cars and laughing at him, decides to get even with the woodpecker by rejuvenating Woody's car (via a Car Rejuvenator) and selling it back to him. Woody realizes that it is his own car and tries to drive it away but, Buzz hooks the car and demands $1,000 for the car. Outraged, Woody puts Buzz through the Car Rejuvenator, which places a car's body on the buzzard, and Woody rides the half-car-half-buzzard off the lot. ==Songs== At the opening of the cartoon, Woody sings the same song he sang at the beginning of The Screwdriver in 1941. Also, at the end of the short, Woody sings the last two lines of the song he sang at beginning of both Woody Woodpecker and The Loan Stranger. :KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK :So I'm crazy, but what, what, what can I do? :So are you!

Yount (whose younger brother is Hall of Famer Robin Yount) holds the unique distinction of being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) history to appear in the official record books without ever actually having faced a batter. In his only major league appearance—on September 15, 1971—he had to leave the game during his warm-up pitches due to injury.Kepner, Tyler. \\"Padres Count on a Career .200 Hitter to Guide Them to Contention,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, May 1, 2016. ==Early career== Yount went to Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, and was a fifth round draft pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft. He impressed in the Carolina League in both 1968 and 1969 (he had a 2.25 ERA in 1969), and was invited to spring training at the major league camp in 1970 and 1971. After a strong stint with the Astros' AAA affiliate in Oklahoma City, Yount was called up on September 2, 1971. Before he could join the big-league club, however, he had to serve a week-long stint in the military, which he later claimed tightened up his elbow. ==Houston and beyond== With the Astros trailing the Atlanta Braves 4–1 in the Astrodome on September 15, 1971, Yount was summoned to pitch the ninth inning. While warming up, however, Yount's elbow began to stiffen. \\"I went to the mound and took a couple of tosses,\\" he later said, \\"but (the elbow) continued to hurt, so I came out.\\" MLB rules state that any pitcher announced as being in the game must face at least one batter, except in case of injury. Since he was announced, Yount was credited for having played that one game, even though he did not actually face a batter.Link to Yount's MLB player page Yount is one of 31 pitchers—including Hall of Fame batter Stan Musial—to pitch at least one game in the majors with zero innings pitched; that is, they did not retire a batter. In addition, Yount is the only pitcher in major league history to be credited with zero batters faced. Yount went back to the bench, then back to the minors. In spring training in 1972, he was one of the last players cut. Yount continued to play in the Astros organization until the end of the 1973 season. At the end of spring training, 1974, he was traded along with another minor leaguer to the Milwaukee Brewers for outfielder Wilbur Howard. He was briefly in camp with his younger brother Robin, who was trying to make the squad as a rookie, but was quickly sent back to the minors. The elder Yount retired after eight minor league seasons in 1976, later becoming a successful real estate developer in Arizona. ==Younger Younts== Larry's son Austin Yount was drafted in the 12th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008. He had a solid year with the rookie-league Ogden Raptors that year, batting .301.Austin Yount minor league stats His average slipped to .257 with Odgen in 2009, however, and plummeted to .152 in 2010. In 2011, Austin Yount played for the Winston-Salem Dash, a Class A affiliate in the Chicago White Sox organization, where he batted .214; he has not appeared on a pro baseball roster since. Meanwhile, Larry's nephew (and Robin's son) Dustin Yount played ten years in the Orioles and Dodgers organizations (and was a teammate of Austin's at Inland Empire in 2010), but never made it past AA ball, with a career batting average of .261. ==Bibliography== *Tellis, Richard, Once Around The Bases, Triumph Books, Chicago, 1998, pp. 279–284. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Houston Astros players Category:Greensboro Patriots players Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Peninsula Astros players Category:Columbus Astros players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Burlington Bees players Category:Thetford Mines Miners players Category:Navegantes del Magallanes players Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Sportspeople from Houston Category:William Howard Taft Charter High School alumni Category:American real estate businesspeople ","title":"Larry Yount"},{"id":"12388501","text":"The Mount Tucuche tree frog (Flectonotus fitzgeraldi) is a species of tree frog in the family Hemiphractidae.

It is endemic to southeastern Brazil and found in Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and São Paulo states. The species is named after Émil Goeldi, Swiss zoologist who worked in Brazil. Fritziana goeldii may be locally threatened by habitat destruction but over most of its range it is a common species with a large total population, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==Description== Fritziana goeldii is a small, slender frog; females are long and males are slightly smaller. The snout is pointed, the eyes are large, and there are adhesive discs on the tips of the fingers and toes. The upper parts of the head and body are some shade of pale grey or brown, blotched and streaked with darker colour. ==Distribution and habitat== Fritziana goeldii is endemic to southeastern Brazil, where it is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Espírito Santo. Its natural habitat is forest at altitudes between sea level and about above sea level, but it is an adaptable species, able to live anywhere that there are trees and the epiphytic bromeliads in which it breeds. ==Ecology== This frog lives among vegetation a few metres above the ground, mostly in and around bromeliads. Breeding is a lengthy affair; while the couple are in amplexus, the female secretes quantities of mucus which the male whips into foam with his legs and spreads on the female's back. Here it forms a sticky pad onto which the male presses the fertilised eggs. A clutch of eggs may number nine to twenty or so, and the pad soon hardens. After about nineteen days, the female detaches the eggs and places them in the water- filled hollow of a bromeliad. Here they soon hatch, and undergo metamorphosis a few days later into juvenile frogs. ==References== goeldii Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Amphibians described in 1895 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Fritziana goeldii"},{"id":"12388509","text":"Lillie Goldsmith Cowen (often Mrs. Philip Cowen) (1851 in London, England - 1939 in New Rochelle, New York) was the first woman to translate the Haggadah into English. Cowen, who descended from a family of Jewish-Irish scholars, emigrated to the United States when she was eleven months old. There she grew up and married her second cousin Isaak Goldsmith (Goudsmit) who died in 1876. In 1887, she remarried to Philip Cowen, who was the first publisher of the Jewish weekly newspaper The American Hebrew. She worked with him on publishing the paper until 1906, when he retired. In 1904, she published the Cowen Haggadah, which was first American English adaptation of the haggadah to be published for a mass audience.Guber, Rafael. \\"Did you know?

Jewish Telegraphic Agency. 7 April 1935. Retrieved from Jewish News Archive, 3 October 2012. Up until then, all American traditional Haggadot had used translations based on those created by David Levi and Isaac Levi (London). In the preface to the Cowen Haggadah Lillie writes: \\"At a Seder service given to a number of friends, their wives and older children, the thought occurred to me that the service was marred because of typographical blunders, bad grammar, and mis-translations which abounded in the books used, and, as I knew, in all the books obtainable in this country. I determined, therefore, if the Lord spared me, to issue in the near future a Haggada which would not cause derision among the younger generation but which would be read with interest and with reverence.\\" In the publisher's introduction we find: \\"In \\"Who Knows\\" some liberty has been taken with numbers eight and nine, in view of the fact that this part of the service is especially designed for the children.\\" and indeed, if we look at this section we find: \\"Q: Who knoweth Eight? A. Eight? I know: There are the Eight lights of Hanuka. Q: Who knoweth Nine? A. Nine? I know: Nine was the day in Ab when the holy city was twice destroyed., wherefore a fast was observed. Lillie Cowen was not the first to shy away from the traditional phrase \\"Nine months of pregnancy\\". The Victorian Rabbi/Rev. A.A.Green had already censored this term in his 1897 \\"Revised Hagada\\" under the auspicious of Chief Rabbi Adler. He had come up with the idea that there are 9 festivals in the Jewish year. Lillie's \\"solution\\" to use the 9th of Av instead, can be traced back to much older \\"Ashkenazi\\" translations e.g. in the 1712 Amsterdam Haggadah. However, whereas all the men before her had found it only necessary to censor the nine months of pregnancy, she as a women felt the need to censor the eight days of circumcision as well. ==NotesSources== *Goldman, Yosef.

It is found on the Amazonian slopes of Andes in southern Colombia and Ecuador. ==Description== Gastrotheca andaquiensis is a large member of its genus with a snout–vent length of . The head has a rounded snout, a slightly projecting upper lip, a large pit below each nostril, and bluntly-pointed horn-like appendages above the eyes. The tympani are ovoid and prominent. The body is robust, with a granular skin and a mixture of larger and smaller granules. There is a deeply-sunk slit opening in the scapular region of the back leading into a brood pouch. There are spines on the heels and both fingers and toes are equipped with adhesive discs. In general, males are brown and females are green, but there is considerable variation between individuals, and a part-grown male has been observed which was pale green suffused with bronze. The irises are pale green, the tongue and interior of the mouth are blue, and the discs on fingers and toes are jade green. ==Distribution and habitat== Gastrotheca andaquiensis is endemic to Colombia and Ecuador on the eastern foothills of the Andes. It is an arboreal frog occurring in cloud forest in foliage near water where there are trees with plenty of epiphytic growth. Its altitudinal range is between about . ==Ecology== This species is called a marsupial frog because the female carries the eggs and developing froglets in the pouch on her back. About ten large eggs are laid in a clutch and after fertilisation, the male assists the female to insert them into her pouch. Here they develop directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening tadpole stage, eventually hopping away from their mother. ==Status== This frog has a wide range and is a moderately common species in at least parts of its range. The main threats it faces include habitat loss from livestock grazing and crop cultivation but its range includes a number of protected areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\", because any decrease in population size is likely to be at too slow a rate to justify classifying it in a more threatened category. ==References== andaquiensis Category:Frogs of South America Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1976 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Gastrotheca andaquiensis"},{"id":"12388543","text":"Gastrotheca angustifrons is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae.

They are an electric current or potential which originates when an electrolyte is driven by a pressure gradient through a channel or porous plug with charged walls. The first observation of the streaming potential is generally attributed to the German physicist Georg Hermann Quincke in 1859. ==Applications== Streaming currents in well-defined geometries are a sensitive method to characterize the zeta potential of surfaces, which is important in the fields of colloid and interface science. In geology, measurements of related spontaneous potential are used for evaluations of formations. Streaming potential has to be considered in design for flow of poorly conductive fluids (e.g., gasoline lines) because of the danger of buildup of high voltages. The streaming current monitor (SCM) is a fundamental tool for monitoring coagulation in wastewater treatment plants. The degree of coagulation of raw water may be monitored by the use of an SCM to provide a positive feedback control of coagulant injection. As the streaming current of the wastewater increases, more coagulant agent is injected into the stream. The higher levels of coagulant agent cause the small colloidal particles to coagulate and sediment out of the stream. Since less colloid particles are in the wastewater stream, the streaming potential decreases. The SCM recognizes this and subsequently reduces the amount of coagulant agent injected into the wastewater stream. The implementation of SCM feedback control has led to a significant materials cost reduction, one that was not realized until the early 1980s.http://www.waterhouse- bc.ca/Theory%20of%20the%20Streaming%20Current%20Monitor.pdf In addition to monitoring capabilities, the streaming current could, in theory, generate usable electrical power. This process, however, has yet to be applied as typical streaming potential mechanical to electrical efficiencies are around 1%. ==Origin== Adjacent to the channel walls, the charge-neutrality of the liquid is violated due to the presence of the electrical double layer: a thin layer of counterions attracted by the charged surface. The transport of counterions along with the pressure-driven fluid flow gives rise to a net charge transport: the streaming current. The reverse effect, generating a fluid flow by applying a potential difference, is called electroosmotic flow. ==Measurement method== A typical setup to measure streaming currents consists of two reversible electrodes placed on either side of a fluidic geometry across which a known pressure difference is applied. When both electrodes are held at the same potential, the streaming current is measured directly as the electric current flowing through the electrodes. Alternatively, the electrodes can be left floating, allowing a streaming potential to build up between the two ends of the channel. A streaming potential is defined as positive when the electric potential is higher on the high pressure end of the flow system than on the low pressure end. The value of streaming current observed in a capillary is usually related to the zeta potential through the relation:\\"Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena\\", International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Technical Report, published in Pure Appl.Chem., vol 77, 10, pp.1753-1805, 2005 (pdf). :I_{str}=-\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{rs}\\\\epsilon_0 a^2 \\\\pi}{\\\\eta} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P}{L} \\\\zeta . The conduction current, which is equal in magnitude to the streaming current at steady state, is: :I_c= K_L a^2 \\\\pi \\\\frac{U_{str}}{L} At steady state, the streaming potential built up across the flow system is given by: :U_{str}= \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{rs}\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\zeta}{\\\\eta K_L} \\\\Delta P Symbols: *Istr \\\\- streaming current under short-circuit conditions, A *Ustr \\\\- streaming potential at zero net current conditions, V *Ic \\\\- conduction current, A *εrs \\\\- relative permittivity of the liquid, dimensionless *ε0 \\\\- electrical permittivity of vacuum, F·m−1 *η - dynamic viscosity of the liquid, kg·m−1·s−1 *ζ - zeta potential, V *ΔP - pressure difference, Pa *L - capillary length, m *a - capillary radius, m *KL \\\\- specific conductivity of the bulk liquid, S·m−1 The equation above is usually referred to as the Helmholtz- Smoluchowski equation.

The show was initially presented by David Jensen and Kevin Sharkey. The first edition was transmitted across the ITV network on Tuesday 9 June 1987, introducing Erasure performing \\"Victim of Love\\". Subtitled as The Network Chart Show, The Roxy was based on the weekly chart compiled for Independent Local Radio which was broadcast on Sunday afternoons across ILR stations every Sunday afternoon from 5pm, in competition with BBC Radio 1's own chart show. Whereas The Tube featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, The Roxy concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart - and although The Tube won a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Tyne Tees' Newcastle studios for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the long-established BBC counterpart, Top of the Pops, produced from London. The programme also suffered from not having a fixed network timeslot and for a short time, an industrial dispute which affected live studio performances. After just ten months on air, The Roxy aired its final edition on Tuesday 5 April 1988. By this point, some regional stations aired the programme around midnight like Anglia, TVS and Thames while Grampian, Scottish, and Yorkshire opted out entirely. The demise of The Roxy also signalled the end of major live music TV production at Tyne Tees, which asides The Tube, had also spanned series such as Alright Now, Razzmatazz and Check it Out. The company also produced coverage of Queen's concerts at Wembley and the Milton Keynes Bowl and co-produced U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky. ==References== Category:1980s British music television series Category:1987 British television series debuts Category:1988 British television series endings Category:British music television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV (TV network) original programming Category:Pop music television series Category:Television shows produced by Tyne Tees Television Category:Television series by ITV Studios ","title":"The Roxy (TV series)"},{"id":"12388671","text":"The molecular formula C5H6 may refer to: * Cyclopentadiene * Cyclopropylacetylene * [1.1.1]propellane * Cyclopentyne ","title":"C5H6"},{"id":"12388673","text":"NFL Tour is an arcade football video game.

There does not yet appear to be any significant medical benefit from doing this. ==Theory== The theory behind contrast bath therapy is that the hot water causes vasodilation of the blood flow in the limb or body followed by the cold water which causes vasoconstriction, increasing local blood circulation. Additionally, the lymph vessels contract when exposed to cold, and relax in response to heat. The lymph system, unlike the circulatory system, lacks a central pump. By alternating hot and cold, it is believed that lymph vessels dilate and contract to \\"pump\\" and move stagnant fluid out of the injured area and that this positively affects the inflammation process, which is the body's primary mechanism for healing damaged tissue. One study showed that fluctuations in intramuscular temperature were lower than those caused by a hot bath alone. Other studies indicate that thermal stress seems to positively influence the immune system. A pair of studies published in 1994 and 1997 by William Myer and colleagues at Brigham Young University investigated this claim using needle-mounted thermometers placed just under the skin and 1 cm deep into the calf muscle. In both studies the subjects underwent a 20-minute contrast routine, starting with heat and alternating with cold every four minutes. The 1994 study used two whirlpool baths, while the 1997 study used hot packs and ice bags. In both cases, Myer et al. found that, while the contrast therapy caused fluctuations in skin temperature, muscular temperatures did not change significantly during the contrast therapy. The body likely was able to divert blood flow so that the deep muscle temperature was maintained at a fairly constant level. Having this assumption about contrast therapy overturned forced researches to look for other possible mechanisms. ==Treatment== Contrast bathing can be used to reduce swelling around injuries or to aid recovery from exercise. It can also significantly improve muscle recovery following exercise by reducing the levels of blood lactate concentration. For any injury presenting with palpable swelling and heat, and visible redness - such as a strain/sprain - contrast baths are contraindicated during the acute inflammation stage. Acute inflammation begins at the time of injury and lasts for approximately 72 hours. ==Effectiveness in athletic recovery== The current evidence base suggests that contrast water therapy (CWT) is superior to using passive recovery or rest after exercise; the magnitudes of these effects may be most relevant to an elite sporting population. There seems to be little difference in recovery outcome between CWT and other popular recovery interventions such as cold water immersion and active recovery. In a review on immersion therapy in general, Ian Wilcock, John Cronin, and Wayne Hing suggest that most of the benefits of contrast therapy are from the hydrostatic pressure from the water, not the variations in temperature. ==See also== *Ice bath ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172155/http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/injury- recovery-and-conditioning Category:Physical therapy ","title":"Contrast bath therapy"},{"id":"12388718","text":"Gary Barta (born 4 September 1963) is the current athletic director at the University of Iowa. He succeeded Bob Bowlsby on 1 August 2006, when Bowlsby stepped down after 15 years as Iowa's athletic director to take the same position at Stanford University. Before coming to Iowa, Barta was the athletic director at the University of Wyoming from 2003 to 2006. In early 2005, Barta was a finalist for the athletic director position at Arizona State University. Prior to serving as the athletic director at Wyoming, Barta served as an administrator in the athletic departments at the University of Washington and University of Northern Iowa. ==Early life== Barta was born on 4 September 1963, and grew up in the Minneapolis area. == Education == Barta earned his bachelor's degree from North Dakota State University (NDSU). While at NDSU, he was a member of the Bison football teams that won the NCAA Division II Football Championship in 1983, 1985, and 1986. == Personal life == He and his wife Connie, a native of Waterloo, have two children. ==Career== Barta became the director of athletics at the University of Iowa on 1 August 2006. He has spearheaded numerous upgrades to existing athletic facilities and the construction of many new facilities, including the expansion of the administrative office complex at Carver–Hawkeye Arena, the expansion of the wrestling training facility, and the building of new practice gyms and weight training facilities at the Carver–Hawkeye Arena. Other upgrades include improvement of the sound system, scoreboard and video boards at Kinnick Stadium, construction of the Hoak Family Golf Complex, and building both the P. Sue Beckwith Boat House and the Campus Recreation and Aquatic Center in partnership with the university's department of recreational services. In the fall of 2014, the new Stew & LeNore Hansen Football Performance Center was completed, which includes the new Richard O. Jacobson Football Operations Center and a new 120-yard indoor practice field. Also in late 2014, a new artificial baseball playing surface was installed at Duane Banks Field. In 2016, new video scoreboards were installed at the Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Barta has hired numerous new head coaches during his tenure, including Mark Hankins and Tyler Stith (men's golf); Ross Wilson (men's tennis); Todd Lickliter and Fran McCaffery (men's basketball); Rick Heller (baseball); Joey Woody (track & field); Sharon Dingman and Bond Shymansky (women's volleyball); Steve Pitzker and Andrew Carter (women's crew); Dave DiIanni (women's soccer); Katie Dougherty and Sasha Schmid (women's tennis); Megan Menzel (women's golf); Lisa Cellucci (field hockey); and Marla Looper (softball). Iowa's NACDA Director's Cup Big Ten Rankings By Year under Barta: 2006-07: 11th(out of 11); 2007-08: 11th(out of 11); 2008-09: 10th(out of 11); 2009-10: 11th(out of 11); 2010-11: 9th(out of 11); 2011-12: 12th(out of 12); 2012-13: 12th(out of 12); 2013-14: 12th(out of 12); 2014-15: 10th(out of 14); 2015-16: 13th(out of 14) In February 2016, the President Bruce Harreld extended Barta's contract through 30 June 2021. The new contract includes $4.6 million in guaranteed compensation with an increase each in annual base salary, annual deferred compensation, and annual bonuses. In October 2017, it was revealed that Barta has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He notified the university that he will be taking an extended leave of absence until he is able to recover. Barbara Burke took over the athletic director responsibilities while Barta received treatment. Controversy while at Iowa In 2010, a former member of the women's crew, Margaret Krusing, filed a lawsuit against the University of Iowa for permanent disabilities she received as a result of participating in a team-training program that was poorly supervised by medical and athletic training personnel. The two sides settled the lawsuit for $300,000 in October 2013. The athletic department had also previously agreed to pay $60,000 to Krusing by keeping her on her athletic scholarship after she left Iowa to finish her degree at Marquette University. In November 2012, Peter Gray, associate director of athletic student services, resigned from University of Iowa after an internal investigation accused him of sexually harassing male student-athletes. Gray was also accused of giving football tickets to someone outside the university in exchange for nude photographs. He also had pictures on his work computer that were considered \\"suggestive in nature\\", including a picture of the men's swimming team he used as a screen saver and two showing individuals engaged in sexual acts with toys or stuffed animals. On 6 November 2013, athletic department accountant, Kathleen Willier, was fired after an audit showed $66,000 of department funds were not accounted for. The funds were cash payments from ticket sales for the Hawkeye Express commuter train used to transport fans to and from Kinnick Stadium for home football games On 4 August 2014, Barta fired field hockey coach, Tracey Griesbaum, following what he said were allegations from a group of former players who complained that Griesbaum had been verbally abusive to them, and had created an atmosphere of intimidation within the program. This led to a vocal outcry from many current and former players and other supporters who called for the immediate reinstatement of Griesbaum as the head coach. The Iowa Board of Regents and then University of Iowa President Sally Mason refused to hear or consider any appeal to the dismissal. This led to four current and former field hockey players filing, on 28 January 2015, a formal Title IX Civil Rights complaint to the U.S Department of Education. After an initial inquiry, the US Department of Education informed the University of Iowa on 22 May 2015, that it will conduct a formal investigation to determine if gender bias was a factor in the firing of Griesbaum and other female coaches at Iowa.NCAA.com, \\"Iowa terminates contract of head field hockey coach Tracey Griesbaum.\\" 5 Aug. 2014. https://www.ncaa.com/news/fieldhockey/article/2014-08-05/iowa- terminates-contract-head-field-hockey-coach-traceyHarty, Pat. \\"Outcry over the firing of Iowa field hockey coach.\\"5 Aug.2014.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa/2014/08/05/iowas- dismissal-of-field-hockey-coach-rankles-ex-players/13633495/ On 5 May 2016, a story by Annie Brown of the Center for Investigative Reporting was published on the organization's Reveal website and carried on its radio program. Brown said the names of those who made the allegations were never revealed. She sought to find them. Reaching out to 60 of Griesbaum's former players, \\"hoping to find one who complained or thought the allegations of verbal abuse or forcing athletes to play injured were justified. Twenty-four agreed to speak, but none had anything negative to say about Griesbaum,\\" Brown reported. The story noted that Barta has fired 5 female coaches since becoming athletic director, but when pressed by Brown, Barta declined to discuss the number of females at the university, saying the issue is a national problem. On 27 July 2015, Griesbaum filed a formal civil rights complaint against the University of Iowa with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission. This was the first step required by Iowa law to ultimately file a civil lawsuit regarding her termination. On 24 January 2016, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission announced their findings in the Griesbaum complaint and indicated that she has a \\"reasonable possibility\\" of proving that gender or anti-gay discrimination played a role in her firing. Griesbaum filed a civil lawsuit against the University of Iowa on 7 March 2016. On 4 November 2015, former associate athletic director, Jane Meyer, filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the University of Iowa, the Board of Regents, and the State of Iowa. This was a result of being reassigned from the department of athletics in anticipation of her domestic partner's, Tracey Griesbaum, anticipated lawsuit against the athletic department for wrongful termination. On 27 January 2016, the athletic department agreed to a $200,000 settlement in a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by former women's assistant track coach, Michael Scott. Scott had been hired on an interim basis but was passed over for the permanent position due to a university mandate that a female be hired for the position. When Barbara Burke became Iowa deputy athletic deputy director in 2017, USA Today noted \\"she was promoted to the No. 2 position in the University of Iowa athletic department the same week the department went on trial for discriminating against a female ex- employee.\\"http://www.hawkcentral.com/story/sports/college/iowa/2018/01/02/over- qualified-but-overlooked-iowa-deputy-ad-barbara-burke-brings-steady- leadership-iowa-while-hopin/970197001/ In 2017, NPR featured Barta in \\"A man's game: Inside the inequality that plagues women's college sports.\\" It noted that there was a growing concern that \\"at Iowa, female coaches were losing ground. Barta had forced out five female coaches in six years. The place that was once a model for gender equity was starting to look a lot like the rest of the country.\\" NPR noted, \\"Barta replaced two of the five female coaches he ousted with men – and paid those men 25 percent more than their female predecessors. For the three he replaced with other women, he paid those women 13 percent less, according to public salary data. By comparison, when Barta replaced male coaches with other men, he paid the new male coaches 10 percent more.\\" This decision to replace female coaches with men has not led to success on the playing fields. \\"While women's teams earned 27 Big Ten titles during Grant's 27-year tenure, they have earned only four in the 10 years since Barta took over – three out of the four from the field hockey team under Tracey Griesbaum.\\" Nevertheless, Barta told NPR that his desire is \\"to hire the absolute very best, most qualified person available.\\" On why he has replaced female coaches with men, he said, \\"It's a national phenomenon, not just a problem at Iowa. Are we nationally concerned that there aren't enough women coaching women's sports? The answer is yes,\\" Barta said. \\"But 50 percent is higher than the state average, it's higher than the Big Ten average and it's higher than the national average.\\" Finally, NPR noted that while the number of women coaches continues to drop at the school and across the nation, \\"for Barta, things are looking up. At the beginning of 2016, Iowa rewarded him with a five-year contract extension and will boost his base pay from $400,000 to $550,000. It also increased his annual deferred compensation to $250,000 and his potential bonuses. His colleagues around the country have been equally impressed. The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics named him an athletic director of the year for 2015-16.\\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/a-mans-game-inside-the-inequality- that-plagues-womens-college-sports ==Awards== On 2 March 2016, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) announced that Barta was one of four athletic directors from the Football Bowl Subdivision of the NCAA to receive the Athletic Director of the Year Award. == References External links== * Iowa profile Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Iowa Hawkeyes athletic directors Category:North Dakota State Bison football players Category:Wyoming Cowboys and Cowgirls athletic directors Category:Sportspeople from Minneapolis Category:College Football Playoff Selection Committee members ","title":"Gary Barta"},{"id":"12388730","text":"Ulrika Karlsson.

He is known as a strong supporter of Israel, and a promoter of greater understanding between Judaism and Christianity.Carroll James, \\"In Appreciation of Irving Greenberg\\" == Biography == Greenberg attended Yeshiva Beis Yosef, where he was ordained in 1953. At the same time he attended Brooklyn College, where he received a B.A. in history, summa cum laude; he earned a M.A. and PhD. in American history from Harvard University in 1960. He served as the Jewish chaplain of Brandeis University, the rabbi of the Riverdale Jewish Center, an associate professor of history at Yeshiva University, and as a founder, chairman, and professor in the department of Jewish studies of the City College of the City University of New York.Beliefnet, \\"Rabbi Irving Greenberg: Beliefnet Columnist\\" He is on the faculty of the Open Orthodox Yeshivat Chovevei Torah.Rabbi Irving (Yitz) Greenberg, yctorah.org/staff He has also served as the President of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership. He is married to the Orthodox Jewish feminist writer Blu Greenberg. In 2020, Greenberg joined the faculty of Yeshivat Hadar as the Senior Scholar in Residence. == Thought == Greenberg's thought involves reading current Jewish history through use of traditional Jewish categories of thought. He has written extensively about the Holocaust and about the historical and religious significance of the State of Israel. He learned Jewish thought from Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. He has taught extensively, and a number of well-known scholars, including Rabbi Joseph Telushkin and Michael Berenbaum, consider him their mentor. Greenberg espouses the concept of \\"Tikkun Olam\\" (repairing the world) as humanity working, as co-creator with God, in improving the world. He sees the Jewish people's covenant with God as enjoining them to set an example for the moral edification of mankind. Another concept is his idea that the image of God in all humans implies that each person has \\"infinite value, equality, uniqueness\\".p. 387, \\"Seeking the Religious Roots of Pluralism: In the Image of God and Covenant\\" in Journal of Ecumenical Studies 34:3 (Summer 1997). According to Greenberg, that means that there is no absolute truth or correct religion: \\"Part of every truth is the fact that an image of God is speaking it; that is to say, a being of infinite value, equality, and uniqueness is speaking it.\\"p. 390, ibid. Only part of his post-Holocaust theology has been published.Wrestling with God, Oxford University Press 2007 Greenberg sees the Holocaust as a seminal event in Jewish history, which should be seen as the \\"breaking of the covenant\\" between God and the Jewish People. It is also latest stage in God's tzimtzum from the world. According to Greenberg, the Holocaust drives home the point that the fate of the world is in humanity's hands. If there can be such a strong evil in the world as manifest in the Holocaust, there can also be realized in the world the most incredible good. == Controversy == Greenberg's theological views have been harshly criticized by Orthodox rabbis Avrohom Gordimer and David Berger.http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/berger.pdf In the 1980s, Greenberg was involved in a controversial debate with the late Rabbi Meir Kahane. == Works == * Cloud of Smoke, Pillar of Fire: Judaism, Christianity, Modernity After the Holocaust (1976) * The Third Great Cycle of Jewish History (1981) * Voluntary Covenant (1982) * The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays (1988) * The Ethics of Jewish Power (1990) * Judaism and Christianity: Their Respective Roles in the Divine Strategy of Redemption (1996) * Covenantal Pluralism (1997) * Living in the Image of God: Jewish Teachings to Perfect the World (1998) * For the Sake of Heaven and Earth: The New Encounter Between Judaism and Christianity (2004) * Sage Advice - Commentary on Pirkei Avot (2016) == References  External links == * Rabbi Irving Greenberg - website * Articles by Yitz Greenberg on the Berman Jewish Policy Archive @ NYU Wagner * \\"Irving Greenberg and a Jewish Dialectic of Hope\\" by Michael Oppenheim, from Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, Vol. 49, No. 2 * Lecture by Greenberg at Boston College Category:1933 births Category:20th-century rabbis Category:21st-century rabbis Category:American Orthodox rabbis Category:Christian and Jewish interfaith dialogue Category:City College of New York faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Holocaust theology Category:Jewish American writers Category:American Jewish theologians Category:Philosophers of Judaism Category:Living people Category:Modern Orthodox rabbis Category:Yeshiva University faculty Category:United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Category:Jewish ethicists ","title":"Irving Greenberg"},{"id":"12388787","text":"The Organization for Understanding Cluster Headaches (O.U.C.H.) was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that assisted cluster headache sufferers and their families by providing information and emotional support.

In 1902, the west facade facing State Street was remodeled and another floor was added, reflecting the reorientation of commercial activity from Lake to State Street. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1975, and was later designated a Chicago Landmark on January 28, 1983. The Page Brothers Building stands next to the Chicago Theatre, another Chicago Landmark whose marquee is a Chicago cultural and physical landmark that commonly appears in film, television, artwork, and photography. ==See also== *Chicago Landmark *Christian Specht Building ==Notes== Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1872 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Chicago Landmarks ","title":"Page Brothers Building"},{"id":"12388821","text":"The SIG MP310 is a submachine gun manufactured in Switzerland, developed from SIG's earlier wood stock MP46 design.

According to the 2011 census, there were 57,900 Croats in Serbia or 0.8% of the country's population. Of these, 47,033 lived in Vojvodina, where they formed the fourth largest ethnic group, representing 2.8% of the population. A further 7,752 lived in the national capital Belgrade, with the remaining 3,115 in the rest of the country. Croatian, a standard variety of Serbo-Croatian, is listed as one of the six official languages of Vojvodina, autonomous province located in the northern part of the country which traditionally fosters multilingualism, multiculturalism and multiconfessionalism. Some people of Croat ethnic descent have held high positions in Serbia, such as prime minister, deputy prime minister and speaker of the National Assembly. ==History== During the 15th century, Croats mostly lived in the Syrmia region. It is estimated that they were a majority in 76 out of 801 villages that existed in the present-day territory of Vojvodina.Károly Kocsis, Saša Kicošev: Changing ethnic patterns on the present territory of Vojvodina During the 17th century, Roman Catholic Bunjevci from Dalmatia migrated to Vojvodina, where Šokci had already been living. According to some opinions, Šokci might be descendants of medieval Slavic population of Vojvodina where their ancestors might lived since the 8th century. According to other opinions, medieval Slavs of Vojvodina mainly spoke ikavian dialect. Between 1689, when the Habsburg Monarchy conquered parts of Vojvodina, and the end of the 19th century, a small number of Croats from Croatia also migrated to the region. Before the 20th century, most of the Bunjevac and Šokac populations living in Habsburg Monarchy haven't been nationally awakened yet. Some of their leaders (like Ivan Antunović, Blaško Rajić, Petar Pekić, Pajo Kujundžić, Mijo Mandić, Lajčo Budanović, Stipan Vojnić Tunić, Vranje Sudarević, etc.) worked hardly to awake their Croatian or Yugoslav national feelings. Commemorative plaque in Petrovaradin, suburb of Novi Sad (\\"To Tomislav, first Croatian king. Citizens of Petrovaradin.\\") According to 1851 data, it is estimated that the population of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, the historical province that was predecessor of present-day Vojvodina, included, among other ethnic groups, 62,936 Bunjevci and Šokci and 2,860 Croats.Dr Dušan J. Popović, Srbi u Vojvodini, knjiga 3, Novi Sad, 1990. Subsequent statistical estimations from the second half of the 19th century (conducted during Austro-Hungarian period) counted Bunjevci and Šokci as \\"others\\" and presented them separately from Croats (in 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, 70,000 Bunjevci were categorized as \\"others\\").Juraj Lončarević: Hrvati u Mađarskoj i Trianonski ugovor, Školske novine, Zagreb, 1993, The 1910 Austro-Hungarian census also showed large differences in the numbers of those who considered themselves Bunjevci and Šokci, and those who considered themselves Croats. According to the census, in the city of Subotica there were only 39 citizens who declared Croatian as their native language, while 33,390 citizens were listed as speakers of \\"other languages\\" (most of them declared Bunjevac as their native language). In the city of Sombor, 83 citizens declared Croatian language, while 6,289 citizens were listed as speakers of \\"other languages\\" (mostly Bunjevac). In the municipality of Apatin, 44 citizens declared Croatian and 7,191 declared \\"other languages\\" (mostly Bunjevac, Šokac and Gypsy). In Syrmia, which was then part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, according to the 1910 census resultsA magyar szent korona országainak 1910. évi népszámlálása; Budapest 1912 Croats were a relative or absolute majority in Gibarac (843 Croats or 86.46% out of total population), Kukujevci (1,775 or 77.61%), Novi Slankamen (2,450 or 59.22%), Petrovaradin (3,266 or 57.02%), Stari Slankamen (466 or 48.19%), Hrtkovci (1,144 or 45.43% ) and Morović (966 or 41.67%). Other places which had a significant minority of Croats included Novi Banovci (37.70%), Golubinci (36.86%), Sremska Kamenica (36.41%), Sot (33.01%), Sremska Mitrovica (30.32%), Sremski Karlovci (29.94%) and Ljuba (29.86%). In 1925, Bunjevac- Šokac Party and Pučka kasina organized in Subotica the 1000th anniversary celebration of the establishment of Kingdom of Croatia, when in 925 Tomislav of Croatia became first king of the Croatian Kingdom. On the King Tomislav Square in Subotica a memorial plaque was unveiled with the inscription \\"The memorial plaque of millennium of Croatian Kingdom 925-1925. Set by Bunjevci Croats\\".Mario Bara: Hrvatska seljačka stranka u narodnom preporodu bačkih Hrvata (The Croatian Pesants Party in the national movement of Bačka Croats), p. 63 Besides Subotica, memorial plaques of King Tomislav were also revealed in Sremski Karlovci and Petrovaradin. In 1990s, during the war in Croatia was persecution of Croats in Serbia during Yugoslav Wars, members of Serbian Radical Party organized and participated in the expulsion of the Croats in some places in Vojvodina. The President of the Serbian Radical Party, Vojislav Šešelj is indicted for participation in these events.Vojislav Seselj indictment According to some estimations, the number of Croats which have left Serbia under political pressure of the Milošević's regime might be between 20,000 and 40,000.Hrvatska nacionalna manjina u Srbiji The birth house of ban Josip Jelačić was bought from private owners by the Serbian state and given as a gift to the Croatian minority In 2020 the birth home of ban Josip Jelaćić built in the 18th century and located in Petrovaradin, was bought by the Republic of Serbia from private owners. It was later reconstructed and given as a gift to the Croatian community. ==Demographics== The number of Croats in Serbia was somewhat larger in previous censuses that were conducted between 1948 and 1991. However, the real number of declared Croats in the time when these censuses were conducted may have been smaller because the communist authorities counted those citizens who declared themselves Bunjevci or Šokci as Croats. Today, most members of the Šokci community consider themselves Croats, while large part of the Bunjevci population see themselves as members of the distinct Bunjevci ethnicity, while smaller part sees themselves as Croats. Saint Lawrence the Martyr Catholic Church in Sonta The largest recorded number of Croats in a census was in 1961 when there were 196,409 Croats (including Bunjevci and Šokci) in the Socialist Republic of Serbia (around 2.57% of the total population of Serbia at the time). Since 1961 census, the Croat population in Serbia is in a constant decrease. This is caused by various reasons, including economic emigration, and ethnic tensions of the Yugoslav wars during the 1990s, more specifically the 1991-1995 War in Croatia.

Sanctioned on August 7, 2006 by former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and subsequently implemented on September 22, 2006, the law is an important contribution to an international movement of criminalizing violence against women. The name of the law is an homage to the Brazilian activist Maria da Penha Maia, a former victim of domestic violence. == Background == Violence against women, specifically domestic violence, remains a pervasive issue in Latin America. Domestic violence can be defined as, “physical, sexual, and verbal aggression…typical of sexism and a way to strengthen men's power within the household, especially if they feel economically insecure.” According to the Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, 66% of Brazilian men have perpetrated violence against a woman in his community and 70% of Brazilian women identified as having experienced some form of violence in a public space before the age of 24. In early 2017, an in-depth examination of gender based violence in Brazil determined that only a quarter of women who experience violence by the hands of an intimate partner report incidents to the authorities. Despite strong statistical evidence supporting widespread violence against women in Brazilian households, few legal initiatives existed in Brazil to challenge this systematic violence against women. Until 2009, domestic abuse could be dismissed by the court if the woman was not deemed to be “honest.” In 2006, with intense media focus on the high-profile case of Maria da Penha, the Brazilian government created the Maria da Penha Law (named in da Penha's honor) in an attempted response to international criticism. Over the course of her 23-year marriage, Maria da Penha was domestically abused by her husband, resulting in da Penha becoming paraplegic after two murder attempts. Following these events, da Penha, along with the Center for Justice for International Law (CEJIL) and the Latin American Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM), spent the next twenty years fighting her husband through the Brazilian legal system; da Penha filed a complaint with the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, emphasizing the need for the state to intervene in combating gender based violence in the country. == Components of the law == The Maria da Penha law aims to reduce domestic violence mainly by increasing punishment for domestic abuse offenders, increasing the maximum detention time from one to three years, establishing domestic violence courts and requiring Brazilian authorities to institute 24 hour shelters for victims of household domestic abuse. The law specifically states that domestic violence between same-sex partners and domestic abuse perpetrated by woman towards a man in a heterosexual relationship also constitute punishable crime. Additionally, the law provides protective measures to the victim, empowering judges to temporary restraining orders. In February 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Maria da Penha law, ruling that prosecutors “may bring domestic violence cases regardless of whether the victim presses charges or not.” ==Implementation==  Supportive response  Celebrating 12 years of Lei Maria da Penha in 2018: Prof. Noëlle Silva, Prof. Flávia Biroli (Mercosur Women's Forum), Emília Fernandes (Brazilian Women's Union) and Vanja Andrea Reis dos Santos With the implementation of the Maria da Penha Law, Brazil arguably has one of the most progressive pieces of legislation addressing domestic violence in Latin America. According to the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada), the Lei Maria da Penha has had a positive impact in reducing domestic violence against women in Brazil, with their study showing a 10% decrease in projected domestic homicides rates since 2006. While statistical evidence supports the positive impacts of the law in Brazil, many in Brazil still feel more must be done to address high levels of domestic violence in the country.  Critical response  Those critical of the effectiveness of the law point to failures in the law's implementation. Speaking to these concerns, Brazil director at Human Rights Watch, Maria Laura Canineu said, “ The Maria da Penha law was a major step forward, but more than a decade later, implementation remains woefully inadequate throughout much of the country.” More specifically, these shortcomings include the failure of police to follow procedure when a woman reports an incident of violence, the practice of demanding women undergo invasive medical procedures to prove abuse, the lack of a private space for the victim to share a testimony, and the failure to carry out protection orders against offenders. Additionally, political turmoil in Brazil has defunded many government programs protecting domestic violence victims, specifically women of color from low socio-economic classes who are already denied access to adequate health and legal services. This is also observed in limited access to the special units established by the law; most special units are located only in major Brazilian cities, isolating women in rural areas of the country and causing them to travel long distances for help. In addition to the logistical issues that remain, the culture of machismo in Brazil continues to stand as a major barrier for women seeking justice. \\"Crimes that occurred inside the house are, in general, consider less serious than those committed in the public sphere. The cultural acceptance of domestic violence aggravated this problem.” da Penha herself has been outspoken and critical about the effectiveness of the law, stating, “The problem is not the law but in its application…” ==See also== * Domestic violence in Brazil * Women's police stations ==References External links == * Brazil's Observatory of Gender Equality [In Portuguese] Category:Brazilian legislation Category:2006 in Brazil Category:Violence against women in Brazil Category:Brazilian family law Category:LGBT rights in Brazil ","title":"Lei Maria da Penha"},{"id":"12389046","text":"Anna Ella Carroll (August 29, 1815 – February 19, 1894) was an American politician, pamphleteer and lobbyist. She was born in to a very wealthy and prominent family in her state and city: her great-grandfather was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the last surviving signers and a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and later in the new Congress of the United States, her father was the Governor of Maryland from 1830–1831, and her mother was the daughter of a Baltimore physician. She was also the eldest of eight children. She played a significant role as an adviser to the Lincoln presidential cabinet during the American Civil War (1861-1865). She also wrote many pamphlets criticizing slavery. She died on February 19, 1894, at the age of 79. ==Early life== Anna Carroll was born in 1815 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland into a prominent upper-class, religiously mixed Catholic-Protestant family. Her father was Thomas King Carroll, a planter who served as Maryland governor in 1830; he owned a tobacco plantation in Somerset County. The eldest of eight children, Anna was educated and trained by her father to be his aide. She was likely tutored in the law by him. This allowed her access into the male world of politics. Anna contributed to her family's income by establishing a girls' school at their home of Kingston Hall. Little is known about her life between the ages of twenty and thirty-five. ==1850s political career== Carroll entered the national political arena in the 1850s, following her father's appointment as Naval Officer for the District of Baltimore by Whig President Zachary Taylor. Shortly thereafter, Taylor died and Carroll's commission was signed by Millard Fillmore. In 1854, Carroll joined the American Party (the Know Nothing Party) following the demise of the Whigs. At the time much political realignment was going on nationwide. The same year the Republican Party was formed. The Southern pro-slavery Democrats took over control of their party's leadership in Congress due to the defeat of many Northern Democrats following the passage of the unpopular Kansas–Nebraska Act in May. In Maryland, large numbers of immigrants, largely Irish and German Catholics, had flooded into Baltimore during the Great Famine in Ireland and the 1848 Revolutions in Germany. They took work in the port and railroad yards. Due to this rapid increase in population density, there was competition with free people of color for housing and jobs; street crime became a problem and relief rolls rose. At the same time, planters were a strong force in the state; many Catholic and Episcopalian planters resided on the Eastern Shore, which continued as primarily agricultural. In 1853, the Maryland Know Nothing party was formed, initially from three nativist groups. Yet beginning in February, it took in large numbers of striking laborers from the ironwork's factory in Baltimore, whom the Democratic Party had refused to support. In opposing the pro-slavery Democrats, the Know Nothings became a powerful, but divisive, party in the state. They were pro-Union, pro-labor, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant. Along with other reformers, Anna Carroll campaigned by writing against urban machine corruption, crime, and what was perceived as the political threat of the power of the Catholic Church. In Maryland the Catholic planter/urban vote could combine to establish a pro-slavery state government. In 1856, the Whig Party split nationally into Northern and Southern factions due to the slavery issue. During the 1856 presidential election, Carroll supported and campaigned on behalf of Fillmore, the Know Nothing candidate. Carroll wrote many articles and pamphlets and she toured the Northeast on his behalf. Considered a moderate, Fillmore carried the state of Maryland, his only victory in the election. For the 1856 campaign, Anna Carroll published two party books that greatly extended her political and press contacts: The Great American Battle, or, The Contest Between Christianity and Political Roman-ism and The Star of the West, and influential pamphlets such as \\"The Union of the States\\". The former book was a virulent criticism of the political influence of the Roman Catholic Church under the papacy of Pius IX (see anti-clericalism). In 1857 Carroll was the chief publicist for Governor Thomas H. Hicks of Maryland; he credited his victory to her writings. In 1858, she took up the cause of former Congressman John Minor Botts, a Unionist from Virginia, in his presidential bid. She published a series of articles in the New York Evening Express newspaper on the 1860 candidates under the pseudonym \\"Hancock.\\" Others over time appeared in the influential National Intelligencer, among other venues. ==Secession role== With the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Carroll freed her slaves. She began to work to oppose the secession of the Southern states and helped keep Maryland loyal to the Union. Lincoln's election set off the secession movement, which began with South Carolina's exit on December 20, 1860. The first six states to secede were those that held the largest number of slaves. In February 1861, the Confederate government was formed in Montgomery, Alabama. During this time Carroll was advising Governor Thomas H. Hicks on compromise efforts in the Congress. After Virginia seceded, she sent him intelligence on Confederate plans that might have resulted in a coup d'état of Washington, D.C., had Maryland seceded. During the summer of 1861, Carroll wrote a political pamphlet in response to a speech given on the floor of the senate by the Hon. John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. He had argued that Lincoln had acted in violation of the Constitution by mustering state militias into service following the bombardment of Fort Sumter, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and imposing martial law and a naval blockade. In her reply pamphlet, which was widely circulated by the Lincoln administration, Carroll made informed legal arguments, later used by Attorney General Edward Bates, stating that Lincoln had acted in accordance with the Constitution. She noted that, as the chief enforcement officer of the nation, Lincoln could use all his powers to enforce federal law in the Southern states. Those powers included his role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.Janet L. Coryell, Neither Heroine Nor Fool: Anna Ella Carroll of Maryland (Kent, OH: Kent State University Press), 55–64. Under an agreement made with the government, by 1862 Carroll had produced three more war powers pamphlets that presented able constitutional arguments supporting the federal government's actions. Governor Hicks wrote that her documents did more to elect a Union man as his successor than \\"all the rest of the campaign documents together.\\" ==Wartime role== Carroll shows war plans to Lincoln and his cabinet in this imaginative 1918 drawing by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In the fall of 1861, Carroll traveled to St. Louis to work with secret agent, Judge Lemuel Dale Evans, who had been appointed by Secretary of State William H. Seward to assess the feasibility of a Union invasion of Texas. Carroll worked on her second war powers paper at the Mercantile Library. She also gathered information from the head librarian, who was the brother of Confederate General Joe Johnston. She took military matters into her own hands when she initiated an interview with a riverboat pilot, Capt. Charles M. Scott, about the feasibility of the planned Union Mississippi River expedition. Scott told her that he and other pilots thought the advance ill-conceived because there were many defensible points on the Mississippi River that could be reinforced. It could take years just to open up the river to navigation by trying to broach those points. Carroll questioned Scott about the feasibility of using the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers for a Union invasion of the South. Scott provided Carroll with technical navigation details. Based on this information, Carroll wrote a memorandum to Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott and Attorney General Edward Bates in late November 1861, advocating that the combined army-navy forces change their invasion route from the Mississippi to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. Meanwhile, in St. Louis, Major General Henry W. Halleck was planning the same movement without Lincoln's knowledge. Upon learning that Confederates were possibly sending reinforcements west from Virginia, Halleck ordered Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote to immediately move on Fort Henry and Fort Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in a telegram dated January 30. Scott was dispatched to the Midwest to mobilize reinforcements for Halleck on the night of January 29. On February 6, Fort Henry fell to Foote's gunboats and on February 13, Fort Donelson fell to Grant's and Foote's combined forces. These comprised the first two \\"real victories\\" of the Civil War for the Union, as Gen. William Sherman wrote later. At the time Carroll's role in the effort was kept secret. Immediately following the war, she gave credit for the plan to Capt. Charles Scott in a letter printed in a leading Washington newspaper.Anna Ella Carroll, \\"Captain Charles M. Scott: Plan of the Tennessee Campaign,\\" National Intelligencer, April 12, 1865. Years later, Assistant Secretary of War Scott and Senator Wade testified to her critical role before Congress. The signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by Francis Bicknell Carpenter, 1864. Showing the empty chair, believed by some to be an allusion to Carroll. During the remainder of the war, Carroll worked with Lincoln on issues pertaining to emancipation and colonization of American slaves. She and Aaron Columbus Burr lobbied him to establish a colony of freedmen in British Honduras, today Belize. Although Carroll had freed her own slaves, she lobbied Lincoln against issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. She feared that this action would cost the support of Southern Unionists and resistance to the Union would be stiffened. But, she wrote that Lincoln did have the constitutional right to free the slaves as a temporary war measure under his power as commander-in- chief, since the proclamation would help cripple the organized forces of the rebellion. Yet the measure was not a transfer of title and would have to be suspended once the war emergency ended. To free the slaves required a constitutional amendment. ==Postwar life and death== In the postwar years, Carroll traveled with Lemuel Evans to report on his role in the Texas constitutional convention to draw up a new state constitution. She was active in the Republican Party in Maryland and continued her political writing career. After 1870, however, she had to devote much time to trying to gain payment for $5,000 which she insisted that the government still owed her for her wartime publications. She went through twenty years of congressional hearings. Every military committee but one voted in her favor, but no bills passed the Congress. She filed a claim in the United States Court of Claims in 1885, but was denied. Justice J. Nott wrote that the documents she used to back up her claim were \\"impressive\\" but \\"valueless as blank paper\\" because \\"they establish no judicial fact.\\"Anna Ella Carroll v. United States, 20 Court of Claims 426 (Court of Claims 1885), 429–431. Despite the rulings against her claim—or, more likely, because of those negative rulings—Carroll received support from women's and suffrage organizations. The suffragists commissioned a biography of her in 1891 by Sarah Ellen Blackwell. Anna Ella Carroll died of Bright's disease, a kidney ailment, on February 19, 1894. She is buried at Old Trinity Church, near Church Creek, Maryland, beside her parents and other members of her family. The epitaph on her grave reads, \\"A woman rarely gifted; an able and accomplished writer.\\" In 1959, the state historical society unveiled a monument to Carroll with the words, \\"Maryland's Most Distinguished Lady. A great humanitarian and close friend of Abraham Lincoln. She conceived the successful Tennessee Campaign and guided the President on his constitutional war powers.\\" The gravestone was inscribed with 1893 as the year of her death, but a Washington, D.C., death certificate lists the correct death year of 1894. Surviving letters in her writing exist from that year before her death. ==Later evaluation== Well into the 20th century, Carroll was hailed as a feminist heroine whose contributions were denied because of her sex. Some scholars, however, have attempted to discredit her tale, arguing that she was more a \\"relentless self-promoter\\" than the \\"woman who saved the Union,\\" as novelists, playwrights, and suffragists called her. Carroll had condemned the Emancipation Proclamation and recommended colonization of blacks. Yet research published in 2004 unveiled new sources, primarily Maryland political histories and Lincoln administration records, that analyze the Maryland Know Nothing party in a new progressive light. These materials generally support (but slightly diminish) Carroll's role in the Tennessee River campaign. A plan nearly identical to Carroll's was printed in the New York Times two weeks prior to the date Carroll said she sent her plan to the War Department in Washington; a similar version was printed in late December. Original sources found in Carroll's papers, housed in the Maryland State Archives, remain problematic as source material. Many of them, purportedly from leading politicians of the time, are in her handwriting, a distinctive scrawl. ==See also== * Carroll family ==NotesReferences== * *Janet L.

Electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) is a transducer for non-contact acoustic wave generation and reception in conducting materials. Its effect is based on electromagnetic mechanisms, which do not need direct coupling with the surface of the material. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMATs are particularly useful in harsh, i.e., hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMATs are suitable to generate all kinds of waves in metallic and/or magnetostrictive materials. Depending on the design and orientation of coils and magnets, shear horizontal (SH) bulk wave mode (norm-beam or angle-beam), surface wave, plate waves such as SH and Lamb waves, and all sorts of other bulk and guided-wave modes can be excited.R.B. Thompson, Physical Principles of Measurements with EMAT Transducers,Ultrasonic Measurement Methods, Physical Acoustics Vol XIX, Edited by R.N. Thurston and Allan D. Pierce, Academic Press, 1990B.W. Maxfield, A. Kuramoto, and J.K. Hulbert, Evaluating EMAT Designs for Selected Applications, Mater. Eval., Vol 45, 1987, p1166 Innerspec Technologies After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, boiler and pressure vessel industries, in which they are typically used for nondestructive testing (NDT) of metallic structures. ==Basic components== There are two basic components in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet and the other is an electric coil. The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called bias magnetic field. The electric coil is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20 kHz to 10 MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a tone-burst signal. The electric coil with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the test material is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the test material through the interaction of the two magnetic fields. == Transduction mechanism == There are two mechanisms to generate waves through magnetic field interaction. One is Lorentz force when the material is conductive. The other is magnetostriction when the material is ferromagnetic.  Lorentz force  The AC current in the electric coil generates eddy current on the surface of the material. According to the theory of electromagnetic induction, the distribution of the eddy current is only at a very thin layer of the material, called skin depth. This depth reduces with the increase of AC frequency, the material conductivity, and permeability. Typically for 1 MHz AC excitation, the skin depth is only a fraction of a millimeter for primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum. The eddy current in the magnetic field experiences Lorentz force. In a microscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the electrons in the eddy current. In a macroscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the surface region of the material due to the interaction between electrons and atoms. The distribution of Lorentz force is primarily controlled by the design of magnet and design of the electric coil, and is affected by the properties of the test material, the relative position between the transducer and the test part, and the excitation signal for the transducer. The spatial distribution of the Lorentz force determines the precise nature of the elastic disturbances and how they propagate from the source. A majority of successful EMAT applications are based on the Lorentz force mechanismB.W. Maxfield and Z. Wang, 2018, Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers for Nondestructive Evaluation, in ASM Handbook, Volume 17: Nondestructive Evaluation of Materials, ed. A. Ahmad and L. J. Bond, ASM International, Materials Park, OH, pp. 214–237..  Magnetostriction  A ferromagnetic material will have a dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called magnetostriction. The flux field of a magnet expands or collapses depending on the arrangement of ferromagnetic material having inducing voltage in a coil and the amount of change is affected by the magnitude and direction of the field.Masahiko Hirao and Hirotsugu Ogi, EMATS For Science and Industry, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003 The AC current in the electric coil induces an AC magnetic field and thus produces magnetostriction at ultrasonic frequency in the material. The disturbances caused by magnetostriction then propagate in the material as an ultrasound wave. In polycrystalline material, the magnetostriction response is very complicated. It is affected by the direction of the bias field, the direction of the field from the AC electric coil, the strength of the bias field, and the amplitude of the AC current. In some cases, one or two peak response may be observed with the increase of bias field. In some cases, the response can be improved significantly with the change of relative direction between the bias magnetic field and the AC magnetic field. Quantitatively, the magnetostriction may be described in a similar mathematical format as piezoelectric constants. Empirically, a lot of experience is needed to fully understand the magnetostriction phenomenon. The magnetostriction effect has been used to generate both SH-type and Lamb type waves in steel products. Recently, due to the stronger magnetostriction effect in nickel than steel, magnetostriction sensors using nickel patches have been developed for the nondestructive testing of steel products. ==Comparison with piezoelectric transducers== As an ultrasonic testing (UT) method, EMAT has all the advantages of UT compared to other NDT methods. Just like piezoelectric UT probes, EMAT probes can be used in pulse-echo, pitch-catch, and through- transmission configurations. EMAT probes can also be assembled into phased array probes, delivering focusing and beam steering capabilities.Gao, H., and B. Lopez, \\"Development of Single-Channel and Phased Array EMATs for Austenitic Weld Inspection\\", Materials Evaluation (ME), Vol. 68(7), 821-827,(2010).  Advantages  Compared to piezoelectric transducers, EMAT probes have the following advantages: # No couplant is needed. Based on the transduction mechanism of EMAT, couplant is not required. This makes EMAT ideal for inspections at temperatures below the freezing point and above the evaporation point of liquid couplants. It also makes it convenient for situations where couplant handling would be impractical. # EMAT is a non-contact method. Although proximity is preferred, a physical contact between the transducer and the specimen under test is not required. # Dry Inspection. Since no couplant is needed, the EMAT inspection can be performed in a dry environment. # Less sensitive to surface condition. With contact-based piezoelectric transducers, the test surface has to be machined smoothly to ensure coupling. Using EMAT, the requirements to surface smoothness are less stringent; the only requirement is to remove loose scale and the like. # Easier for sensor deployment. Using piezoelectric transducer, the wave propagation angle in the test part is affected by Snell’s law. As a result, a small variation in sensor deployment may cause a significant change in the refracted angle. # Easier to generate SH-type waves. Using piezoelectric transducers, SH wave is difficult to couple to the test part. EMAT provide a convenient means of generating SH bulk wave and SH guided waves. Challenges and disadvantages The disadvantages of EMAT compared to piezoelectric UT can be summarised as follows: # Low transduction efficiency. EMAT transducers typically produce raw signal of lower power than piezoelectric transducers. As a result, more sophisticated signal processing techniques are needed to isolate signal from noise. # Limited to metallic or magnetic products. NDT of plastic and ceramic material is not suitable or at least not convenient using EMAT. # Size constraints. Although there are EMAT transducers as small as a penny, commonly used transducers are large in size. Low-profile EMAT problems are still under research and development. Due to the size constraints, EMAT phased array is also difficult to be made from very small elements. # Caution must be taken when handling magnets around steel products. ==Applications== EMAT has been used in a broad range of applications and has the potential to be used in many others. A brief and incomplete list is as follows. # Thickness measurement for various applicationsM Gori, S Giamboni, E D'Alessio, S Ghia and F Cernuschi, 'EMAT transducers and thickness characterization on aged boiler tubes', Ultrasonics 34 (1996) 339-342. # Flaw detection in steel products # Plate lamination defect inspection # Bonded structure lamination detectionS Dixon, C Edwards and S B Palmer, 'The analysis of adhesive bonds using electromagnetic acoustic transducers', Ultrasonics Vol. 32 No. 6, 1994.H.

Hengist and Horsa landed near here in 410AD, and St Augustine in 597. There is evidence to show that the area of Cliffsend Village was inhabited Since ancient times. Excavations prior to a housing development at Cliffs End Farm in 2003/2004 revealed artefacts and a burial site dating to the Bronze Age. Pegwell Bay Country Park is located here. Also on permanent display on the cliff top at Pegwell Bay is a replica of the Viking longship Hugin, which sailed from Denmark to Thanet in 1949 to celebrate the 1500th anniversary of the invasion of Britain, the traditional landing of the two men, and the betrothal of Hengist's daughter, Rowena, to King Vortigen of Kent. The Hugin was offered as a gift to Ramsgate and Broadstairs by the Daily Mail for preservation. ==Amenities== The village has a petrol station and convenience store on the former A256. The village formerly had a small family run convenience shop and sub post office in Cottington Road, which closed in about 2001 and was redeveloped. Following the closure a shop run by volunteers and a privately run post office opened in the village hall. The shop closed in 2017 and the post office became part time, being staffed by the postmaster from nearby Minster. The village has a golf club, St Augustine's GC and did have one pub, the Sportsman Inn. The pub closed permanently in April 2017 for redevelopment. The village is the site of several local tourist attractions, including 'The Viking Ship', which is a restored replica Viking Ship similar to that which landed on the site during the invasion of Hengist and Horsa. The ship sits on the cliff top, on open grass. This overlooks Pegwell Bay nature reserve and the now disused Ramsgate Hoverport. On a clear day, visitors can see a large expanse of east Kent to the West, Sandwich, Deal, and the northern tip of the French Coast. To the east, the cliffs curve round into the nearby town of Ramsgate. Though the village has no hotels itself, both Ramsgate (2 km) and Minster (4 km) have numerous facilities. The Anglican parish church of St Mary is in Foads Lane. Originally a Methodist church it was rented by the Church of England from the early 1930s, eventually being bought in 1956. ==Governance== Cliffsend is part of the electoral ward called Cliffsend and Pegwell. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,703. ==Notable residents== Although a small area with an accordingly low population, Cliffsend has had a number of notable residents. * The best known of these, in the public eye, is Jefferson Hack who lived in Beech Grove for much of his childhood and early adult life. * Another notable couple in the acting and entertainment world are Melanie and Martina Grant who spent their childhood living with their mum in Walmer Gardens. * For a small village, Cliffs End has been lived in by two accomplished jewellers/artists: **Jeweller Barry Carthew lived north of the train line in his childhood. **Artist and Jeweller, Fraser Wallin, who now lives in Whitstable spent his childhood in Beech Grove (just a few doors from his good friend Jefferson Hack). * Historically, Augustine of Canterbury briefly lived in the Cliffs End area around the year 597. ==Transport== The village is between the A299, the end of the Thanet Way, and the A256, which meet at the Lord of the Manor roundabouts to the east of the village. The village is divided into two by the Canterbury to Ramsgate railway line, with the nearest stations being Minster to the west and Ramsgate to the east both at Manston Airport or 'Kent International Airport' is to the north of the village, with the East end of the runway preventing the village expanding northwards. The airport partially closed in May 2014. At the south east corner of the village are the remains of Hoverlloyd's cross-channel hoverport. Vehicle and passenger carrying hovercraft were operated here from 1969 until 1982. The New East Kent Access Road intersects the village at the same point as the railway line, though here it is in a tunnel, so the effect on the village is minimal. Both the A299 and A256 have been diverted onto new roads in this scheme; the former A299 and A256 remain in place to serve the village. Access from the new road to the village can be gained from the Thanet Intersection southwards, from Ebbfleet Roundabout eastwards, from the Sevenscore roundabout along Cottington road, and at Cliffsend roundabout heading eastwards. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Villages in Kent Category:Civil parishes in Kent Category:Populated coastal places in Kent ","title":"Cliffsend"},{"id":"12389089","text":"Utricularia multifida, commonly called pink petticoat or fairy aprons, is a terrestrial carnivorous plant that belongs to the bladderwort genus, Utricularia, of family Lentibulariaceae.Taylor, Peter.

The present house, which dates from the late 16th century with 17th-century additions, was originally built by Robert Elmhirst. His son Richard Elmhirst, who sided with the Royalists, constructed the fortifications in 1642 at the beginning of the English Civil War. It was extensively renovated in 1934. The house is built in ashlar, with a stone slate roof in two storeys to an H-shaped plan. The older wing is timber framed. ==History== The first specific reference to land at Houndhill appears in a lawsuit of 1556, but it is not known when the land was acquired or when the first house was built there. However, the first known reference to the family of Elmhirst living in the district appears in the Rockley Manor Court Rolls of 1340 (The Manor of Rockley adjoined the Manor of Worsbrough) when Roger Elmhirst was fined four pence for allowing his two horses to stray into the meadow of the Lord of the Manor. When Richard Elmhirst was involved in a lawsuit following his father's death in 1618 he deposed that: \\"Houndhill and Elmhirst are both copyhold and had been demised to his ancestors for twelve descents last past.\\" Tower at Houndhill Richard Elmhirst inherited Houndhill in 1626 after the lawsuit following his father’s death. During this period Richard was employed by Sir Thomas Wentworth who made him Deputy Collector of Recusant Rents in York. Siding with King Charles I, Richard fortified Houndhill (probably in 1642) by constructing two towers and an incomplete surrounding wall. Tradition has it that Houndhill was taken rather easily by Sir Thomas Fairfax in the summer of 1643: \\"On Sir Thomas coming in person to demand the surrender of Houndhill, Elmhirst immediately complied with this demand, and would have been killed by some of the soldiers, but Sir Thomas, who had a kindness for him, prevented it.\\" In 1645 Richard had to face Cromwell’s sequestrators to reveal his wealth. After a lengthy and contested enquiry he was ordered to pay a fine of £666, which was finally paid in 1650. Richard died in 1654 leaving a wife and nine children. It appears that Richard was granted the Elmhirst Arms in 1647, well before Dugdale’s visitation in 1665, which confirmed Richard's right to bear arms. When Richard’s son, also Richard Elmhirst, died in 1673 some of his land passed to his brother William, but Houndhill and the rest of his wealth passed to his daughter Elizabeth who married John Copley. Houndhill subsequently passed into the ownership of Capt F.W.T.V.Wentworth. In 1932 Alfred O Elmhirst negotiated the re-purchase of Houndhill on behalf of his brother, the noted philanthropist Leonard Knight Elmhirst. Houndhill then underwent substantial restoration. In 1950 it was gifted by Leonard Elmhirst to A.O.Elmhirst who lived at Houndhill from 1932 until his death in 1995. Their brother was Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst, Commander-in-Chief Royal Indian Air Force and Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey. Houndhill and its surrounding farmland suffered from severe coal mining subsidence for most of the 20th century although the family benefited from the mining royalties paid during the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. In 1972 the character of the valley below Houndhill was changed when the M1 motorway was routed through it. The house and the surrounding land remain in the possession of the family which can now record continuous ownership of land in Worsbrough for more than 20 generations. ==Elmhirst family== Details of the family appear in Burke’s Landed Gentry although the pedigree in that book is incomplete as it does not show Richard Elmhirst (1738–1805) who was the third son of Thomas Elmhirst (1692–1769). Richard’s son Philip (1781–1866) was a Midshipman on HMS Africa (1781) at the Battle of Trafalgar for which he was granted 2000 acres of land near Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. He was joined there by his brother Joseph, who had eight children. Some of that land is still owned by Elmhirsts who are very numerous in Canada. So far as is known, all living Elmhirsts are descended from Thomas Elmhirst (1649–1696) an Alderman and merchant of Boston, Lincolnshire, England. ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:Country houses in South Yorkshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in South Yorkshire Category:Buildings and structures in Barnsley Category:Tourist attractions in Barnsley ","title":"Houndhill"},{"id":"12389117","text":"The Child's Bath (or The Bath) is an 1893 oil painting by American artist Mary Cassatt. The subject matter and the overhead perspective were inspired by Japanese Woodcut prints.Painting profile from the Art Institute of ChicagoArt Access at the Art Institute of Chicago. It shows dignity in motherhood and has a style similar to that of Degas. It was bought by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1910, and has since become one of the most popular pieces in the museum.Lisa Stein. \\"The Art Institute has compiled its 'greatest hits.' We asked art experts to expand that list of 11 to include other treasures.\\" Chicago Tribune. 18 April 2003. == Description == The genre painting depicts a mother bathing a young child: an everyday scene that is \\"special by not being special\\".Janes, Karen Hosack. Great Paintings. New York: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2011, 179. It is signed to the lower left \\"Mary Cassett\\". The woman is sitting on oriental carpet, with the child on her knees. The child has a white cloth swathed around its abdomen, and the woman is wearing a dress with strong vertical stripes of green, pink and white. The woman holds the infant firmly and protectively around its waist with her left hand while the other hand carefully washes the child's bare limbs in a basin of water, resting on the floor beside a jug decorated with a floral pattern. The chubby left arm of the child braces against the mother's leg, while its other hand grips the child's own right thigh. The mother's right hand presses firmly but still gently on the child's right foot in the basin, mimicking the child's own pressure on her thigh. In the background are floral patterns of painted furniture and wallpaper. To indicate depth, Cassatt painted the faces to recede into space. The paint strokes are layered and rough, creating thick lines that outline the figures and stand them out from the patterned background. The hand of the artist is evident through the roughness of the strokes and can be better viewed from a distance. == Influences == Cassatt was heavily influenced by some of her fellow Impressionist peers, especially Edgar Degas. The first Impressionist painting to make it back to the United States was a pastel by Degas in 1875 that she purchased. Cassatt began to exhibit with the Impressionists in 1877, where she met other fellow Impressionists such as Claude Monet and Berthe Morisot. She was struck by the Japanese ukiyo-e woodcut prints exhibited at the Beaux-Arts Academy in Paris in 1890, three years before painting The Child's Bath. Cassatt was drawn to the simplicity and clarity of the Japanese art, and the skillful use of blocks of color, such as the c.1801 print \\"Woman Washing a Baby in a Tub\\" or by Kitagawa Utamaro. She worked on a series of prints inspired by the Japanese works in the next few years, with cropped subjects, a flattened perspective and decorative patterns. This 1893 painting can be viewed as a culmination of that work. The unusual perspective of the painting, viewing the foreshortened subjects from above, was inspired by Japanese prints and Degas. \\"Japanese printmakers were more interested in decorative impact than precise perspective.\\"Janes, Karen Hosack.

The nave is clerestoried, with Lean-to aisles and a lower chancel The two-story southeast vestries were added in 1897 by E. S. Prior, and the southwest tower was added in 1909 by W. D. Caröe. The ground story of the tower is ashlar dressed, while the top stage mixes Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic styles. Architectural historian John Newman observes the interplay between the smooth and textured surfaces of the tower as being \\"typical\\" of Caröe. The tower ends in a recessed tiled pyramid roof. In the east of the chancel there is stained glass of the Nativity, and in the west of the nave a stained glass representation of Te Deum, installed in 1910 by G. J. Hunt.

One notable feature of the document is the inclusion of libel as a crime. ==History== Previous penal codes The first penal law in independent Brazil was the imperial Criminal Code of 1830, issued on December 16, 1830 and approved by Emperor Pedro I. The General Assembly determined that any offense or voluntary omission to the Code was to be considered a crime. The Criminal Code of 1830 was in force during the Empire. After the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, a new penal code was created on October 11, 1890, followed by a new constitution in 1891. This penal code was in effect during the First Republic and most of the Vargas Era. Current penal code In 1934, a new constitution was enacted under President Vargas. This was followed by the creation of a new penal code, the one currently in use, on December 7, 1940. After the end of the Vargas Era in 1945–46, a new constitution was created, but the Penal Code of 1940 was not abolished. There was an unsuccessful attempt to replace it with a new one in 1969, during the military government. A large reformation of the Code was proposed in 1973 and successively postponed until it was revoked in 1978. Another commission for a large reform of the Code was formed in 1980.

A station opened at Emerson Street in North Malden then or soon thereafter. The village was then sparsely populated; the station building also served as the post office and sometimes a churchroom. In 1850, the new development around the railroad prompted North Malden to split from Malden to form the town of Melrose. The station was quickly renamed Melrose as well. Historically the primary station in Melrose, it has always been supplemented by nearby Wyoming Hill station and Melrose Highlands station. The original station was on the east side of the tracks; it was replaced by a newer station on the west side and converted for use as a freight house. Neither station building is extant, though sections of the platform roofs remain as shelters. The MBTA, formed in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service, began funding Reading Line service on January 18, 1965. As with the other two MBTA rail stations in Melrose, it would have become a station on the Orange Line extension north to Reading, had that project not been cancelled due to lack of funding.

Owned by Gray Television, it is a sister station to ABC affiliate WHSV-TV (channel 3) and low-powered dual NBC/CW+ affiliate WSVW-LD (channel 30). The three stations share studios on North Main Street/US 11 in downtown Harrisonburg, and operate a newsroom in Fishersville, serving Staunton, Waynesboro, and Augusta County. WSVF-CD's transmitter is located atop Massanutten Mountain. There is no separate website for WSVF-CD; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WHSV-TV. Even though WSVF-CD has a digital signal of its own, the low- power broadcast range only covers the immediate Harrisonburg area. Therefore, the CBS-affiliated CD2 feed is simulcast in 16:9 widescreen standard definition on WHSV's fifth digital subchannel in order to reach the entire market; this signal can be seen on UHF channel 20.5 (or virtual channel 3.5 via PSIP) from a transmitter atop Elliott Knob west of Staunton. ==History== The Valley's Fox The Fox affiliation currently seen on WSVF-CD began on October 26, 2006 with the launch of WHSV-DT2, a standard definition subchannel of WHSV-TV. The subchannel's launch gave the Shenandoah Valley its first full- time Fox affiliate; until then, WTTG, the Fox owned-and-operated station in Washington, D.C., served as the area's default Fox affiliate, though WHSV was a secondary Fox affiliate from 1994 through 1996. To this day, WTTG continues to be carried on Comcast systems in the Shenandoah Valley. During the late summer and early fall of 2006, WHSV underwent major technical upgrades to make way for the creation of WHSV-DT2. A large receiving tower was built behind its Harrisonburg studios to accommodate the additional satellite receiver needed for the Fox venture. In March 2007, WHSV-DT2 was added to Comcast systems in the market on digital channel 705. Eventually, it moved to the current location on channel 192. The OTA high definition feed of WSVF-CD1 is available on channel 213. Broadcast license What is now WSVF-CD was started in 1996 as W25CC, operating on channel 25 as the Staunton and Waynesboro translator for WAZT-LP, a Woodstock-based religious independent station. It changed its call letters to W25AZ in 1997 and WAZM-LP in 2000, and upgraded to class A status in 2002 (as WAZM-CA). However, WAZM was all but invisible in the market because the area's cable companies wouldn't carry it. Cable and satellite are all but essential for acceptable television in the Shenandoah Valley, even more so because nearly all of this market is in the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. In April 2012, then-owner Jones Broadcasting announced it was selling WAZM-CA to Gray Television. Gray changed its callsign to WSVF-CA on June 4, 2012. On June 1, 2012, Gray Television applied for and was granted a Notification of Suspension of Operations Request from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as Jones Broadcasting had no digital facilities built, and Gray preferred to relaunch the station as a digital-only operation clear of WAZM-LP's history (though it retains the license's previous history and FCC facility ID number). WAZM-CA's analog signal, operating at 21,900 watts, completely missed the major cities in the market, including its city of license. However, WSVF's digital signal covers virtually all of the market, and extends as far southeast as the adjacent market of Charlottesville. On July 17, 2012, Gray Television signed an affiliation agreement with CBS for WSVF-LD and two other low-powered stations WECP-LD in Panama City, Florida, and WIYE-LP in Parkersburg, West Virginia. As a result, WSVF-LD became the CBS affiliate for the Shenandoah Valley in October 2012. It is the first time CBS programming has been seen on a Shenandoah Valley station since WHSV-TV (then WSVA-TV) dropped CBS programming in 1963; since then, WUSA in Washington, D.C. had served as the default CBS affiliate for the Shenandoah Valley. However, CBS programming is aired on the station's second digital subchannel, while the Fox programming previously seen on WHSV-DT2 airs on WSVF's primary channel. This is to provide a high-definition signal for Fox network programming to the Shenandoah Valley; technical limitations do not allow any of WHSV's subchannels outside of the main ABC signal to air in high definition. WSVF is the second full-time terrestrial network affiliate in the area; WHSV has had the market more or less to itself since it signed on in 1953. In February 2013, WSVF's class A status was transferred from the former analog channel 25 signal to the digital station. Due to WSVF's link to WHSV, the same FCC must-carry rules that kept it off cable now forced its addition. The must-carry rules also give full-powered stations the option of retransmission consent, which allows these stations to request compensation from cable systems as a condition of carrying them. In this case, Gray has the right to require cable systems to carry WSVF as part of the compensation for carrying WHSV. In early 2013, Gray won FCC permission to move the station's license to Harrisonburg. ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect !

Known on-air as The Valley's Fox 10 O'Clock News, the show can be seen for thirty minutes from a secondary set at the North Main Street facility. Although it features additional reporters seen on WHSV, the show maintains a dedicated news anchor and reporter. The broadcast primarily features news anchor Gloria Balding, meteorologist Aubrey Urbanowicz, and reporter Tim Wronka (also fill-in news anchor). MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate WHSV-DT4 simulcasts the prime time newscast. Even if the program is delayed or preempted on WSVF, it still airs in the regular time slot on WHSV-DT4. Simulcasts of some local newscasts seen on WHSV-TV are included on the WSVF-CD2 schedule. More specifically, WHSV's two-hour weekday morning newscast, and its weeknight at 5 and nightly 6 p.m. news broadcasts are not seen on WSVF-CD2. In lieu of a locally-produced weekday morning news program, the station airs CBS' late night news program CBS Overnight News and a double-run of the CBS Morning News between 5 and 7 a.m. The station does not carry any newscasts produced by WHSV-TV that are exclusive to the station. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Virginia Category:Television channels and stations established in 2006 SVF-CD Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:Gray Television Category:Fox low-power network affiliates ","title":"WSVF-CD"},{"id":"12389252","text":"Abbott–Page House is a historic house located on Mason Road, 2.5 miles northeast of Milan, Ohio.

She accepts, and Woody goes off to prepare for their date. Meanwhile, Buzz calls Winnie up to ask her to the sock hop, only to find she is already going with Woody. However, Winnie agrees that if Woody does not show up, she will go with Buzz. Buzz gets himself ready for the date, and beats Woody to Winnie's house. As Buzz and Winnie dance, Woody comes through the door and gets into a fight with Buzz. Winnie tells them to stop or she will not go with either one of them.

Woody and Winnie make it to the sock hop, where they hear a singer sing. Winnie likes the guy's singing, but Woody does not care for it. As Woody and Winnie dance, Buzz shows up and succeeds in disposing of Woody. The buzzard then takes Winnie to a drive-in restaurant to buy her a soda and a banana split for himself. Woody, dressed as a waitress, gives Buzz an explosive banana split.

Its teeth have re-evolved after being absent for over 200 million years, challenging Dollo's law. Re-evolution of teeth in the lower jaw may have been made easier because the frogs have teeth in their upper jaw so there was already a biochemical pathway for developing teeth after 200 million years, unlike, say, birds. Biochemically, this may be an example of a suppressor of a regulatory gene disappearing. Males measure and females in snout–vent length. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Gastrotheca guentheri are tropical moist forests. These frogs are nocturnal and live on vegetation, including arboreal bromeliads. This species is declining in abundance. One cause of the declines is habitat loss, but the species has also declined within suitable habitat in Ecuador, possibly because of climate change or chytridiomycosis. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Discover life: Hylidae - Treefrogs *Breathing Space: Gastrotheca guentheri guentheri Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1882 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger ","title":"Gastrotheca guentheri"},{"id":"12389324","text":"The Helena's marsupial frog (Gastrotheca helenae) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae.

Necro, he performs vocals in the rap rock band OPM, which is also signed with Subnoize. ==Biography== Early career Big B was born Bryan Mahoney in Upland, California and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. He started out in a Las Vegas-based band, 187. He was an original member of the bands Spade Brigade and OPM, as well as one of the co-founders of Controversy Sells. Suburban Noize Records Deal The Kottonmouth Kings met Big B through freestyle motocross events. DJ Bobby B, D Loc, and Richter occasionally met Twitch, Scummy, Metz, and Dawes, who were good friends with Big B. Bobby B, Loc and Richter praised Big B and his band OPM to the Subnoize leaders, including Daddy X. Subnoize listened to OPM and were very pleased, but unfortunately, the band was already signed to a major label; Atlantic. After enjoying the label, Big B decided to sign a deal. Within a week he met Mellow Man Ace and Bronek while in the studio. Ace from Ice-T's camp attended the Sub Noize office and heard some of Big B's work in which he expressed his interest in the artist. This ultimately resulted in Big B's debut solo album under Suburban Noize Records known as High Class White Trash. Since then, Big B has released multiple albums, including three with OPM. He has also collaborated with The Dirtball and Subnoize Souljaz. In addition, he was featured on the track \\"Keep It Simple\\" for Blaze Ya Dead Homie's album, Clockwork Gray. Big B and The Dirtball also collaborated on an all-exclusive song called \\"Check Royalty\\" for the \\"When There's No More Room In Hell Volume 1\\" compilation which was put out on SugarDaddy Records, an independent label fronted by the band Wolfpac's front man Daddy Long Legs. In 2009, Big B released a duet with Scott Russo from Unwritten Law called \\"Sinner\\", which peaked at #23 on Billboard's Alternative Songs. It also received radio play. Big B has been an underground heavyweight since he debuted on the scene with ‘High Class White Trash’ in 2004. However, he made his presence known in the mainstream in 2009 when his single “Sinner”, which featured Scott Russo from Unwritten Law, exploded in the Alternative Rock radio format and became the anthem for that summer, garnering heavy airplay from the world-famous KROQ amongst others. Big B has become known for his raw and honest style, likening him to a modern-day Johnny Cash yet blending in his own elements, namely hip- hop, alternative rock, country and even a laid-back reggae vibe. ‘Good Times and Bad Advice’, Big B's latest album, sees the Las Vegas rebel build upon the success of his smash previous effort ‘American Underdog’ and touts some of the industry's biggest names as featured artists – Everlast, Cisco Adler (Shwayze, Whitestarr) and Scott Russo. Continuing to expand his image to diverse audiences, Big B has also entered into a partnership with Madison Square Garden to feature the album's title track in the legendary venue's summer advertising campaign. Big B has also been a regular cast member on the A&E; television series INKED, focusing on his work at the Hart & Huntington Tattoo Company in Las Vegas alongside his friend and freestyle motocross icon Carey Hart. INKED became one of the most viewed television shows in A&E;'s history and brought Big B an entirely new fan base. In 2007, he also was one of the must see acts on last years Vans Warped tour. The Suburban Noize Outlaw will continue to expand his career and push musical boundaries while also staying true to his underground roots. With touring already planned alongside groups such as The Expendables, Everlast and Kottonmouth Kings, Big B also plans to remain a road dog and bring his high-energy live show to fans across the globe. The hard-hitting lyricism, anthemic choruses and catchy guitar-infused beats of this record will captivate fans of such diverse artists as Eminem to Sublime and Unwritten Law to Willie Nelson. ==Discography== Studio albums {  - ! # !!

Once a common species, it is threatened by severe habitat loss. Snout–vent length of Gastrotheca riobambae is about . It has a broad, depressed body. Skin is smooth above but granulated below. Within this genus, the males transfer the eggs from the female's cloaca to their dorsal pouch till they reach development at the tadpole stage. It takes approximately five to six weeks that the eggs stay in the female's pouch. Once they reach the stage as tadpoles, they continue their development in water, and go through metamorphosis in a few weeks time. Gastrotheca riobambae are sometimes kept as pets. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Images at ARKive Category:Gastrotheca Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Endemic fauna of Ecuador Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1913 ","title":"Andean marsupial tree frog"},{"id":"12389417","text":"Birchrunville is an unincorporated community, little more than a woodland crossroads in West Vincent Township in northern Chester County, Pennsylvania.

It is restricted to an area of 10km2 at an elevation of 2,400 to 2,600, the type locality being at 22°21′S, 44°44′W at a location known as Alto Itatiaia. H. bradei is found among stones, mulch, and terrestrial bromeliads, in which it breeds through direct development. H. bradei may already be extinct in the wild because it has not been recorded in the wild for several decades.“Itatiaia Highland Frog Photos and Facts.” Arkive.org == Description == It is a small frog that has an olive-brown skin color with irregular dark patches around its body. The belly of the frog is a cream color, and the tips of the frog's hands are a bright yellow. It has a large, wide head with an oval body and a rounded snout. It has short limbs, and has large eyes that face forward. The Highland frog's eyes have diamond-shaped pupils. The female frogs are slightly larger than the male frogs. The length of their snouts have been recorded up to 3.7 centimeters. == Distribution and habitat == Itatiaia highland frogs are a terrestrial species. They are often found under mulch, leaves, and stones in open grasslands or sparse forests. They have also been known to live in burrows and other shaded places. They are also known to live in shrublands in moist areas. As the name suggests, they are found in the highlands of the Itatiaia Mountains in Brazil. They are found at elevations of around 2,100 to 2,600 meters above sea level. They were frequently found there up until the 1970s, but have not been seen since 1976. Because of this, they are believed to most likely be extinct.“Itatiaia Highland Frog  Holoaden Bradei.” EDGE of Existence == Threats == Highland frogs are classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List. The species has been impacted by multiple factors leading to their possible extinction. Highland frogs have been reported to be affected by extreme frosts. It's believed that the species has been reduced so much because of tourist activities and wildfires. More possibilities leading to their extinction include disease, pollution, and climate change. The extreme change in temperature has led to the rapidly decreasing population. == Ecology == Although very little information about the reproduction of highland frogs is available, it is believed that they breed by direct development. They lay their eggs under mulch and leaves, and a parent will guard the eggs. If threatened, the parent highland frog will raise itself on its forelimbs, and hiss at the potential predator to try to make it go away. The offspring, however, bypasses the larval stage and becomes a miniature adult when it hatches from its egg. ==References== bradei Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Bertha Lutz Category:Amphibians described in 1958 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Holoaden bradei"},{"id":"12389517","text":"Amicalola Falls in Dawson County, Georgia, USA The waterfalls of northern Georgia, U.S., are a prominent feature of the geography of that region, as well as a major focus of tourism and outdoor recreation.

It can carry either a Rafael Samson or a Kongsberg Protector (RWS) Remote Controlled Weapon Station, and has a new Omega ballistic computer (Slovenian Fotona-made digital ballistic computer). It has an electric cupola, giving it ability to fire at multiple targets in fast sequence, and a new SDZ defence suite protects the crew from biological, chemical and nuclear strikes. The M-84D night vision capability is provided by advanced thermal imaging sensors and cameras providing the tank with night fighting capability as well as ability to see through fog, in shade, and during a storm, i.e. greatly reduced visibility. It is equipped with the latest Racal communication suite, which now comes as standard on all new M84D and M84A4 tanks. The M-84A4 and M-84D have an operational range of 700 km and a maximum speed of 65 km/h. Improvements and new auto loader have increased efficiency by 15%, meaning 9 shells per minute instead of 8 shells per minute. The M-84D is a second version of the upgraded tanks. It has also chains on the back of the tank to protect the engine and has SLAT armour around the ammunition to prevent an ATG or a shell from hitting it. M-84D received few additional upgrades, turret basket was added to provide extra space for extra ammunition and to provide increased armour protection. Turret basket has additional slat armour, which adds additional armour to the exterior of the tank. M84D and M84A4 are to receive 12.7mm Kongsberg Protector Remote Weapon Stations which are to be integrated on to all M84D and M84A4 tanks. M-84D will also feature LIRD-4B - Laser irradiation detector and warner and LAHAT anti tank missiles. == Difference between the M-95 Degman and M-84D == The M-84D is a direct successor of the M-84A4, while the M-95 Degman is a revision of a project codenamed M-90 Vihor (which had two prototypes built). M-90 Vihor was a Yugoslav prototype, made by cooperation of 30 companies from all Yugoslav republics. At the emergence of civil war and break-up of Yugoslavia, Croatian authorities seized two prototypes, which have been renamed to M-95 Degman, after the war ended. While the first prototype was fully assembled (though missing some electronics and loading system), the second prototype had only its body assembled. After the war, the second prototype was assembled with derived turret, new tracks produced by Diehl (who also produce tracks for the German Leopard 2) and some electronic upgrades. M-95 Degman (M-90 Vihor) prototypes will most probably remain as prototypes since its turret caster Slovenske Železarne destroyed molds for its turret. Also most of documentation is held by the Serbian Military Institute of Technology, and neither Croatia nor Serbia is financially capable of funding completion of this project. ==Potential clients== *: 16 Croatian Army 16 M-84A4 tanks to be upgrade to the M-84A5 (D) standard by the end of 2016.

She served in the Pacific Ocean theater of the war. Because of the bravery of her crew in dangerous combat areas, she returned home after the war's end with three battle stars and the Navy Unit Commendation. Cable was launched 1 April 1943 by Basalt Rock Company in Napa, California; sponsored by Mrs. B. Elliott; and commissioned 6 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander H. Pond, USNR, in command. == World War II Pacific Theatre operations == Cable began her salvage and rescue work while still in shakedown training, when she took in tow for San Diego, California, the water barge AW-86, which had suffered a breakdown off Cape San Lucas, Mexico. Cable cleared San Pedro, California, 30 April 1944, towing small craft to Kwajalein on her way to Milne Bay, New Guinea. Here she offered salvage and rescue services until sailing 10 August for Manus and Cairns, Australia, where she loaded firefighting and salvage teams. Continuing the lengthy process of invasion preparation, she sailed to Milne Bay to load firefighting equipment, and on 18 October put out from Hollandia, New Guinea, in a convoy of supply ships for the initial landings on Leyte.  Supporting the invasion of the Philippines  Many ships were damaged in the furious naval and air actions which accompanied the Leyte, and later the Lingayen, operations. Cable's essential services aided many; she made seaworthy again in only two days after the destroyer had flooded from the 19 shell hits received in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Such duty in San Pedro Bay and Lingayen Gulf was followed by assignment to harbor clearance at Manila through the spring of 1945.  Awarded the Navy Unit Commendation  Cable's devoted and skillful service in the Philippines was recognized with the award of the Navy Unit Commendation.  Supporting the Borneo invasion  Cable stood out of Manila Bay on 30 May 1945 where her repair facilities helped ready ships for the Borneo invasion. She steamed to Balikpapan for frontline support in July, and in August returned to the Philippines for continued service through 6 March 1946.  End-of-war activity  Homeward bound, she towed non-self-propelled Barracks ship APL-18 from Pearl Harbor to San Diego, where she arrived 28 July 1946 for local operations until 28 January 1947. Proceeding to the U.S. East Coast, Cable carried out salvage, rescue, and towing assignments in New England waters until 15 September 1947. == Post-war decommissioning == In 1947 she was decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts. She was loaned for commercial service the same day. She was sunk as a target on 7 August 1978. == Awards == In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, Cable received three battle stars for World War II service. == See also == * List of United States Navy ships == References  External links == * * Basalt Rock Company Shipbuilding History Category:Diver-class rescue and salvage ships Category:Ships built in Napa, California Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:1943 ships ","title":"USS Cable (ARS-19)"},{"id":"12389556","text":"Hylodes dactylocinus is a species of frog in the family Hylodidae.

The studies have attracted the attention of local and national animal rights groups, most especially the drug addiction studies of Marilyn Carroll, which she performs on primates, rats, and mice. ==Drug addiction== Non-human primates are used by the university to research the effects of drug addiction. The studies are led by Marilyn Carroll, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience. As of October 2000, Carroll's laboratory was using 34 rhesus monkeys in these studies, according to a meeting of the university's Social Concerns Committee,\\"Minutes of the Social Concerns Committee\\", University of Minnesota, October 2, 2000. a figure confirmed in a May 15, 2006 census obtained by the Minnesota Primate Freedom Project, a chapter of the national Primate Freedom Project.May 15, 2006 inventory of non-human primates, Minnesota Primate Freedom Project.

She writes that \\"several phases of the addiction process are modeled, such as acquisition, maintenance, withdrawal, craving, and relapse.\\" Her work has shown that antidepressants and behavioral or environmental changes, such as adding sweet-tasting drinking solutions, reduce the self-administration of drugs in laboratory animals. Other changes, such as limiting food intake, led to increased drug administration.\\"Effects of menstrual cycle phase on the reinforcing effects of phencyclidine (PCP) in rhesus monkeys\\", Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2006 November; 85(3): 584–591; and \\"Effects of Bremazocine on Self-Administration of Smoked Cocaine Base and Orally Delivered Ethanol, Phencyclidine, Saccharin, and Food in Rhesus Monkeys: A Behavioral Economic Analysis\\", ASPET, Vol. 301, Issue 3, 993-1002, June 2002. Carroll's work has also demonstrated that primates will become upset and mutilate themselves when forced to smoke cocaine; she notes in a publication: \\"Monkey M-V became very agitated and excitable when smoking cocaine. M-V’s state became more severe and incidents of self-mutilatory behavior occurred, specifically biting the upper leg area [...] One monkey showed considerable aggressive, self-mutilatory behavior during this time, throwing itself against the sides and top of its cage. As a result, it developed sinusitis and skin infections. Animal rights protests (1986-Present) Carroll's work on primates and other species has gained the attention of animal rights groups, including the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).Rudacille, Deborah. The Scalpel and the Butterfly, University of California Press, p. 181. Protests were first held outside her lab in 1986. Pictures of animal experiments were later sent to 400 of her neighbors, and her home was picketed. In 1997, Freeman Wicklund of the university's Student Organization for Animal Rights (SOAR) was sentenced to 90 days in jail after occupying the office of the president of the university to protest Carroll's research. Wicklund responded by beginning a hunger strike, which he told reporters would last until he was released; he was released two weeks later and given a year's probation instead. Carroll obtained a restraining order against SOAR, the ALF, and several of the protesters, including Wicklund.Rudacille, Deborah. The Scalpel and the Butterfly, University of California Press, p. 182. In 1998, Wicklund denounced the ALF, his previous activism, and made a proclamation of embracing pacifism; this move largely caused the campaign against Marilyn Carroll's research to deflate. The city in which she lives (Mahtomedi, MN) has since passed an ordinance attempting to prevent activists from picketing at her home. Carroll's work continues to draw negative attention from the media and animal rights and liberation groups. For example, in 2011, she received the Golden Hookah award by CNSnews.com, which identifies wasteful use of taxpayers' money in scientific research. Along with these national groups, Carroll's work has been the continued focus of local groups via on-campus protests, banner hangs, and other methods of campus messaging. Organizations working on this issue include Progress for Science and the Animal Rights Coalition \\"No Pain in My Name\\" campaign. ==See also== *Rat Park ==ReferencesExternal links== *Progress for Science *Research Animal Resources and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee groups at UMN *SAEN Page on University of Minnesota Category:University of Minnesota Category:American medical research Category:Animal testing in the United States ","title":"University of Minnesota primate research"},{"id":"12389605","text":"Hylodes ornatus is a species of frog in the family Hylodidae.

In 1876, Rosenau immigrated to the United States. He received a B.A. from the University of Cincinnati and a Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University. He also got rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College. He served as rabbi in Omaha, Nebraska and in Congregation Oheb Shalom of Baltimore, Maryland. He was also on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. Rosenau was considered a \\"radical reformer\\" regarding ritual and he was a member of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism. He was an editor of the revised editions of the Union Prayer Book and the Union Haggadah. William Rosenau was born in Wolstein, Germany in 1865, the son of Rabbi Nathan and Johanna (Braun) Rosenau. The family came to the United States and settled in the Philadelphia area when William Rosenau was eleven. Much of Rosenau's early education was acquired from his father. The atmosphere of a rabbinic home no doubt influenced Rosenau's decision to enter the rabbinate. He studied at the University of Cincinnati and received his A.B. in 1888. In 1889 he became a rabbi after graduating from the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. In 1900 he received a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1923 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Hebrew law from the Hebrew Union College. After graduation from the seminary, Rosenau served at Temple Israel in Omaha, Nebraska from 1889 to 1892. He then received a call from Baltimore to become rabbi at Congregation Oheb Shalom. He served as active rabbi in Baltimore until 1939, when he became rabbi emeritus. In 1942 he completed his fiftieth consecutive year as rabbi of the congregation. While at Congregation Oheb Shalom he succeeded in the introduction of English prayers and sermons (from the previous German), the abolishment of the compulsory wearing of hats during services, and the introduction of the Friday evening service. He also served on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University in the Department of Semitics (1902-1932). Rosenau was involved in the activities of the general and Jewish communities of Baltimore. He was a member of the Baltimore School Board from 1900 to 1910 and served on the Maryland Society for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis. He was a member of a commission which made a study of state-aided colleges in Maryland, the Board of the Prisoners Aid Association and the Maryland Commission for the Higher Education of Negroes. He served on the board of the Associated Jewish Charities and was for a time its director. He was a secretary of the central Conference of American Rabbis and later served as president (1916-1918). He was a founder of the Jewish Welfare Board, a member of the Board of Jewish Education, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and the Board of Governors of the Hebrew Union College (1917-1943). He served for several years as chancellor of the Jewish Chautauqua Society.

Tattvas are the basic concepts to understand the nature of absolute, the souls and the universe in Samkhya and Shaivite philosophies. Samkhya philosophy lists 25 tattvas while later Shaivite philosophies extend the number to 36. Tattvas are used to explain the structure and origin of the Universe. They are usually divided into three groups: śuddha (pure tattvas); śuddhaśuddha (pure- impure tattvas); and aśuddha (impure tattvas). The pure tattvas describe internal aspects of the Absolute; the pure-impure tattvas describe the soul and its limitations; while the impure tattvas include the universe and living beings that assist the existence of soul. ==Overview== Samkhya philosophy considers there exist only 25 tattvas - twenty four atma tattvas along with atman or soul. According to the early Shaivite philosophies, Parashiva or Parameshwara is the ultimate Reality or Parabrahman, \\"the one form where everything emerges. The nondualistic monism school of Shaivism, Kashmir Shaivism, describes the tattvas as Paramshiva manifests himself by a process of descent from Paramashiva to jiva, through the 36 tattvas.Piyaray L. Raina, Kashmir Shaivism versus Vedanta – A Synopsis The vibrant creative energy of Parashiva, known as Spanda, moves him to manifest himself these 36 tattvas as a līlā or divine play. Another important sect of Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta, a monism-cum-dualistic school, describes the tattvas in a different perspective. Passive Parameshwara is activated itself by Suddha Maya or divine grace (Shakti) of him. Like that, the universe, (Prakriti) is activated by ashudda Maya (physical body and all aspects of universe), another aspect of divine grace - Mahamaya. The interaction of Pure Maya and Impure Maya is the Pure - impure Maya where the souls (Pashus) attain knowledge which leads to the existence of whole universe. The thirty six Shaivite tattvas are divided into three groups - pure, impure and pure-impure tattvas Mahamaya divides itself into three aspects: Śuddha Maya, Śuddha-aśuddha Maya, and Aśuddha Maya, and causes five, seven, and twenty four tattvas respectively. == Five pure tattvas == The five pure Saiva tattvas are associated with the five acts of Lord Shiva in his Nataraja depiction. Suddha tattvas, also known as Śaiva tattvas are functioning in the absolute level which leads to the Panchakritya (Five acts) - Creation-Maintenance-Destruction-Concealment-Grace of almighty. Suddha tattvas are called pure because they are directly created by Shiva himself. Śiva Also known as Naadha tattva. One of the two aspects of the omniscient, omnipresent, conscious Absolute. In this essence, the Absolute doesn't consists of any desire (icchā), action (kriyā) or Knowledge (jnāna) related properties. It is in its pure conscious state. Śakti Another aspect of the Absolute which is known as Bindu Tattva. Pairing of Śiva-Śakti causes the creation of all the lower tattvas. The paired Śiva-Śakti is omniscience and consistently active. These two properties of Śiva-Śakti are known jnāna and kriyāa respectively.  Sadākhya  Also called Sadāśiva tattva or Siva Sakthi tattva. This tattva is responsible for the appearance of aham or self. This tattva is when kriyāśakti and jnānaśakti of the Absolute are in equilibrium. Iśvara Also known as Ishwara tattva. The tattva where the fourth act of Panchakritya - delusion or concealment happens. Iśvara tattva activates the souls which are concealed by pāśa. Idam, \\"this is myself\\", i.e., the objectivation of self-awareness is caused by Iśvara tattva.  Śuddha Vidyā  Also known as Sadvidyā or Kriyā. In this tattva the tri- murthis manifest. Jnānaśakti is more initiative than kriyaśakti in Śuddhavidyā tattva. Here, \\"self-ness\\" and \\"this-ness\\" become balanced. The other three acts of Panchakritya - creation, maintenance and destruction are done below suddhavidya. These five tattvas are the Absolute which leads to the moksha of souls. Or this five tattvas can be seen as retrogradation of souls from lower state to its higher steps towards liberation. == Seven pure-impure tattvas== Chart of the 36 tattvas in Kashmir Shaivism Pure-impure tattvas or Vidya tattvas are described as the \\"instruments\\" that assist the souls for their liberation. Soul or Atman is considered as \\"Purusha tattva\\" here, while the final manifestation of almighty is known as \\"Maya tattva\\". Maya manifests into five more tattvas known as \\"kanchukas\\" and these six tattvas adjoins the pusursha tattva and thus, produce seven vidya tattvas.  Māyā  Maya hides the divine nature of created beings as it creates the sense of separateness from the Divine and from each other. The five kanchukas Kanchukas can be fairly translated as cloaks. They block the subject from recognising the divine nature of the Universe. * kāla - the cloak of time * vidyā - the cloak of limited knowledge *rāga - the cloak of desire *niyati - the cloak of causality *kalā - the cloak of being limited  Purusha  Purusha is the soul. It pairs with maya, the final manifestation of god along with five kancukas. These five vidya tattvas are idle in nature. So, Śiva joins with Maya and Śakti joins with three kancukas - Kāla, Niyati, Kalā. Sadasiva joins with purusha and śuddhavidya operates vidya tattva. Raga is operated by Ishvara. The activated purusha with other vidya tattvas cannot exist in universe solely. There comes the assistance of upcoming 24 asuddha tattvas. == Twenty-four impure tattvas == Impure tattvas or Atma tattvas are aspects of Universe and physical body.  Antahkarana  Consciousness within the limited purusha forms the citta made of Intellect (buddhi), Ego (ahamkāra), and Mind (manas), known collectively as the antahkarana, or \\"inner organ\\". Buddhi is the first evolute of prakṛti. It represents the capacity of discernment. It evolves into ahamkāra after buddhi differentiates a notion of a limited individual self. That external sense of self is then experienced through the sensory mind (manas). Ten indriyas (five sense organs and five action organs), five tanmātras (subtle elements), five mahābhūtas (gross elements), and the sensory mind evolve from ahamkāra as it modifies into sattvic (sensory), rajasic (active) and tamasic (material) modes. These 24 lowest tattvas that evolve from individual consciousness are known as the impure tattvas (aśuddha). Five sense organs The five sense organs (jñānendriya) are the most sattvic functions of manas and include: *ghrāna (nose), i.e., the medium to experience smell *rasana (tongue), i.e., the medium to experience taste * caksus (eye), i.e., the medium to experience colour and shape * tvāk (skin), i.e., the medium to experience touch *śrotra (ear), i.e., the medium to experience sound Five motor organs The five motor organs (karmendriya), each corresponding to a sense organ, represent the physical organs of action. They are the most rajasic functions of manas. * pāyu (anus) - the organ responsible for excretion * upasthā (sexual organ) - the organ that enables procreation and sexual enjoymentIntroduction to Kashmir Shaivism, Gurudev Siddha Peeth, Ganeshpuri, 1975, pag. 33 * pāda (leg) - the organ that makes ambulation possible * pāni (hand) - the organ that enables grabbing and touching * vāk (mouth) - the organ that makes sound/speech possible Five subtle elements The five subtle elements (tanmātra) are the most tamasic functions of manas and represent the reflection of the corresponding five gross elements in the mind: * gandha (smell) * rāsa (taste) * rūpa (form) * sparśa (touch) * śabda (sound)  Five gross elements The five gross elements (mahābhuta) represent the final point of manifestation: *prthvi (earth) *jala (water) *tejas (fire) *vāyu (air) *ākāśa (ether or space) While mahābhūtas are the basis for the material world, tanmātras are but limited aspects and views of it, in no way able to fully describe it. We cannot actually perceive the reality, all we can access are limited \\"bands\\" of information that form a description of reality. These bands of information are the five tanmātras. This restriction however applies only to the limited beings (jiva, or '). For one who has gone beyond māyā, in the realm of the pure tattvas, there can be direct perception of reality, because as one's self is Ātman, so are the external objects. In such a state an enlightened being can perceive the world beyond the five senses (direct perception), in a state of diversity in unity and unity in diversity. ==See also== * , the four spheres of reality * Tattva (Samkhya) * Shaiva Siddhanta * Trika * Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta) ==ReferencesSources== * pag. 1 * cap. 6 and 7 * Singh, Jaideva (1979).

The D9 was a wooden low-wing cantilever monoplane with a single-seat open cockpit and a fixed tailskid landing gear. The wing had an inner section of parallel chord and no dihedral, joined to outer tapered sections with strong (140) dihedral,. This became a standard feature of many subsequent Jodel models. The prototype D.9, registered F-PEPF first flew on the 22 January 1948 flown by Edouard Joly. A Jodel D.92 The D.9 was powered by a single 25 h.p.

Plans were also sold by a number of companies including Falconair in Canada. Over 800 plans have been sold and over 500 aircraft have been built by amateurs and flying clubs. Ben Keillor translated the French kit plans to English in 1959, and constructed and demonstrated a D9 in Canada and America.

It is often kept as a pet. It has acquired a number of popular nicknames, including hippo frog, Freddy Krueger frog, and escuerzo de agua. In popular culture, the frog became an internet meme and is now sometimes known as the Wednesday frog. ==Description== leftThis frog has become popular in pet stores due to its comical flat appearance and intelligent behavior. Females reach a size of while males sometimes only grow half as large. They have a large head that makes up to 1/3 of the body, with notably an extremely large mouth. Their mouth contains a top row of teeth and two \\"fangs\\" on the lower jaw. They have extremely short and stubby limbs and the forelimbs are unwebbed. L. laevis is dark olive green with darker blotches outlined in orange. The males have a dark blue throat. ==Diet and behavior== Lepidobatrachus laevis photographed at Kyoto Aquarium The wide-mouth frog is well adapted to its environment, notably the harsh winter. During this time it will remain inactive underground in a cocoon of shed dead skin which protects it from losing water until they emerge. This species is generally very aggressive and will puff up when threatened to appear larger. If this behavior does not deter the intruder they will make a shrill screech, bite, and corner the target.Vellard, J. (1948). Batracios del chaco argentino. Acta Zoologica Lilloana, 5, 137-174. They are nocturnal and hunt at night, submerged up to their nostrils waiting for prey to pass by. They then lunge and swallow the prey whole. They feed on other frogs, insects, and snails. ==Reproduction== L. laevis is noted for their fascinating reproductive biology, such as how a single mating produces up to 1400 eggs. A pair will reproduce and deposit a mass of fertilized eggs in temporary pools of water. The embryo develops at a rapid rate over two weeks, in order to metamorphize into mobile adolescent form before the breeding pool dries up. The tadpoles are carnivores and cannibalistic at the time of hatching and have nearly adult jaws. They sexually mature in about a year.Faivovich, J. (1994). La distribución del género Lepidobatrachus (Budgett, 1899) (Leptodactylidae: Ceratophryinae). Acta Zoologica Lilloana, 43(1), 137-174. ==Distribution and conservation== It is commonly observed in Paraguay and Bolivia, and less frequently in Argentina. Its natural habitats are the dry and wet Chaco. Breeding may take place in shallow temporary pools and artificial ponds. It is in some areas threatened by habitat loss but there is a large total population size. The species is listed as Least Concern in view of its relatively wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining rapidly enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. ==Captivity== These frogs are often kept by keepers with mild experience with frogs or advanced owners. A ten to twenty gallon tank is generally recommended, without aquarium gravel because it causes digestive issues. River stones are a better alternative. Rocks should be sloped to allow the frog to exit the water. They do not require special heating in houses with a comfortable temperature of about . This species of frog needs to be kept alone or with members of the same species and of equal size, as they will consume anything smaller than themselves. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Care information for keeping Lepidobatrachus laevis in the home aquarium at the Aquarium Wiki Category:Lepidobatrachus Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Amphibians described in 1899 Category:Internet memes Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Lepidobatrachus laevis"},{"id":"12389711","text":"George Perry Mahoney (December 16, 1901 – March 18, 1989) was an Irish American Catholic building contractor and Democratic Party politician from the State of Maryland. A perennial candidate, Mahoney is perhaps most famous as the Democratic nominee for Governor of Maryland in 1966 in which he used the campaign slogan, \\"Your home is your castle; protect it.\\" ==Early life and career== Mahoney was born in Baltimore, the son of William D. Mahoney and Matilda \\"Cook\\" Mahoney. He married Abigail Catherine O'Donnell (died in 1963) on November 24, 1927, and later Ann Matilda Fagg. He worked as an engineer and a construction executive and real estate developer. Under Maryland Governor Herbert O'Conor (a fellow Irish American from Baltimore's 10th ward), Mahoney was appointed as a member on the State Racing Commission, where he made a name for himself accusing the industry of fixing horse races by injecting horses with stimulants and narcotics. He was later named chairman by Governor O'Conor. In 1950 he served as a member of the Democratic National Committee from Maryland. Mahoney was also a delegate from Maryland for Democratic National Conventions in 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964. Mahoney was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. ==Political campaigns== Mahoney's first campaign for office was in 1950, when he ran for governor. He challenged incumbent Democratic governor William Preston Lane, Jr. in the primary. Mahoney lost, but the close and bruising campaign left the Lane campaign weakened for the general election against Republican Theodore McKeldin. Lane lost by 57% to 42%, which at that point, was the largest margin of defeat in Maryland history. In 1952, Democratic U.S. Senator Herbert O'Conor retired and Mahoney won the Democratic primary to succeed him. He was defeated in the general election by Republican James Glenn Beall, 52.5% to 47.5%. Mahoney ran for governor again in 1954, narrowly losing the Democratic primary to University of Maryland President Curley Byrd by 50.64% to 49.37%. Byrd went on to lose to incumbent governor McKeldin by 54.46% to 45.54%. Mahoney ran for the U.S. Senate again in 1956. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by former senator Millard Tydings, who had been defeated in 1950 by Republican John Marshall Butler, partly because Butler's campaign had doctored a photo to show Tydings with Communist leader Earl Browder. However, Tydings had to withdraw from the race on August 19 because of poor health. The state Democratic Committee chose to replace him on the ballot a week later with Mahoney, who triumphed over Tydings' wife Eleanor Tydings by 97 votes to 55. Butler went on to defeat Mahoney 53% to 47%. Mahoney ran against Beall again in 1958, but lost a divisive Democratic primary campaign to Baltimore Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., who went on to lose to Beall 51% to 49%. Mahoney ran for governor again in 1962, challenging incumbent governor J. Millard Tawes in the Democratic primary. Tawes not only beat Mahoney but went on to win the general election against Republican Frank Small, Jr.. Tawes became thus the first and only Democrat to win a primary against Mahoney and then go on to win the general election. Mahoney won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1966 with just 30.21% of the vote. U.S. Representative Carlton R. Sickles (29.84%) and Attorney General of Maryland Thomas B. Finan (27.31%) split the vote and allowed Mahoney, who ran on an anti-open housing campaign to triumph. In the general election, Mahoney's slogan, \\"Your home is your castle; protect it\\", prompted Baltimore City Comptroller Hyman A. Pressman to enter the race as an Independent candidate. Mahoney's controversial stances caused many liberals in the Maryland Democratic Party to split their support between Spiro Agnew, due to his pro-civil rights, socially moderate views, and Pressman. This split helped Agnew to win the election with a plurality, taking 70% of the black vote.Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, from Eisenhower to the Tea Party*, p. 191 Agnew in 1969 became Vice President of the United States under Richard Nixon. Mahoney ran for the Senate again in 1968, this time not as a Democrat, but with the support of the American Independent Party. Democrat Daniel Brewster, who had been elected in 1962 to succeed the retiring Butler, was defeated by his former college roommate, liberal Republican Charles Mathias. Brewster, who supported the war policies of the Johnson administration, lost by 47.8% to 39.1%, with Mahoney taking 13.1%. Mahoney returned to the Democratic Party to run for the Senate again in 1970. He ran in the primary against Senator Joseph Tydings, who had defeated Beall in 1964. Tydings' faced criticism from the right and the left: from the right for his sponsorship of the Firearms Registration and Licensing Act, which would have required the registration of firearms; and from the left for his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. After a divisive campaign, Tydings beat Mahoney by 53% to 37%. Tydings went on to lose the general election to Beall's son, freshman Congressman J. Glenn Beall Jr., by 50.7% to 48.1%. ==References== *George Mahoney, 87, Maryland Candidate - The New York Times obituary.

Its common names are labyrinth frog, pepper frog, South American pepper frog, and pepper foam frog. This frog is found in central and southeastern Brazil, northeast Argentina (Misiones and Corrientes Provinces), and eastern Paraguay. Earlier reports from Bolivia refer to Leptodactylus vastus, or possibly an unnamed species. ==Description== This species is a large frog, with the snout-vent length of males measuring and that of females in snout–vent length. The labyrinth-related names of this frog refer to the labyrinthine patterns it has on its belly, which is often light with dark vermiculations. Tadpoles are cryptic colored, with a dark gray back and tail. ==Ecology and behaviour== Leptodactylus labyrinthicus occurs in the Cerrado and Caatinga at elevations up to above sea level. It has been found mostly in open habitats, with the Amazon rainforest and Amazon river blocking its natural range, although small populations have been introduced in Amazonia. It appears to be very tolerant to pollution. Due to this wide range of broad habitats, as of 2008, this frog is not considered threatened by the IUCN. This frog is a generalist and opportunistic predator. It has been known to eat invertebrates, amphibians, lizards, snakes, rodents and bats. The eggs of L. labyrinthicus are laid in foam nests, often in burrows on dry land or in swampy soil near water. It is hypothesized that the male frog finds or possibly creates the burrow in a suitable location and uses it as shelter during the reproductive season. The male makes advertisement calls mostly at night, though it has been observed calling during the day as well. After mating, the female frog lays both fertilized eggs and trophic eggs at one time and then does not return to the nest. The tadpoles hatch and feed on the trophic eggs; they can remain in the nest for up to 25 days, growing in size. At the start of the rainy season, the tadpoles move to lentic water, where they will complete their metamorphosis, feeding on anuran eggs, other tadpoles, and carrion. Other frog species do not lay their eggs until the first heavy rains; the head-start of the L. labyrinthicus tadpoles allows them to take advantage of the eggs and newly hatched tadpoles of other frog species. L. labyrinthicus tadpoles are mostly active at night, and hide from visual predators (including birds such as the creamy-bellied thrush) during the day by burrowing in gravel and leaves. ==Use by humans== This frog is used for human consumption. It is harvested in Venezuela, and attempts have been made to establish farms for commercial production in Brazil (although these failed for managerial reasons). The antimicrobial peptide pentadactylin has been isolated from the skin secretions of L. labyrinthicus and studied as a potential agent for use in chemotherapy. ==References== labyrinthicus Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Amphibians described in 1824 Category:Taxa named by Johann Baptist von Spix Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptodactylus labyrinthicus"},{"id":"12389821","text":"Leptodactylus laticeps is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.

It was originally described from Icacos Swamp on the south-western peninsula of Trinidad Island and was for a long time believed to be endemic to the island. However, in 2018 specimens were also reported from Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It is probably the sister taxon of Leptodactylus validus. Indeed, the French Guianan records were first identified as L. validus, and it is possible that also some other L. validus records refer to Leptodactylus nesiotus. It is likely that this species is also found in Venezuela, perhaps even wider in open areas of northern South America. ==Etymology== The specific name nesiotus is derived from Greek nesiotes, meaning \\"islander\\", and refers to its only known occurrence (at the time of species description) on the Island of Trinidad. ==Description== The type series consists of three adult males that measure in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded in lateral profile and rounded-ovoid from above. The tympanum is of moderate size and the supratympanic fold is distinct. The fingers have moderate lateral ridges whereas the toes have well-developed lateral fringes. There is a distinct light stripe on the upper lip extending at least to under the eye. Dorsal coloration of preserved specimens is in lighter and darker shades of brown gray. Males have a single internal vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== The Trinidadian population occurs in a swamp, which is a relatively pristine area and where the species is not facing significant threats. The continental populations occur along the coastal savannas and swamps of northern South America, providing continuous habitat for the species. ==References== nesiotus Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1994 ","title":"Leptodactylus nesiotus"},{"id":"12389887","text":"Leptodactylus notoaktites is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.

The body is robust; the head is large with an acutely rounded snout and prominent tympanum. The skin on the dorsum and venter is smooth, and a prominent dorsolateral dermal fold extends from the orbit to the groin. The fingers and toes are long with slender tips and lack webbing. Breeding males have greatly swollen forelimbs and one large, pointed, black spine on the inner surface of the thumb and two black spines on each side of the chest. The dorsum is tan to reddish brown with broad, reddish brown marks on the body between the yellowish tan dorsolateral folds. The dorsal surfaces of the limbs are tan to reddish brown with narrow transverse brown bars. The upper lip is tan with a brown margin and dark brown triangular spots. The venter is cream with bold dark brown to black mottling, especially on the belly and hind limbs. The iris is bronze. ==Distribution== This frog ranges in lowlands (below ) from southern Colombia to the Pacific lowlands of Ecuador and throughout the Guianas and northern two-thirds of the Amazon Basin in South America. ==Habitat== In leaf litter at night, Amazon rainforest, near Nauta, Peru, 2011 Principally a denizen of tropical rainforest, this species also invades dry forest and lower montane forests. ==Behavior== This nocturnal species spends its days in burrows, under logs, or hidden in leaf litter. Defensive mechanisms include noxious skin secretions and posturing by inflating the lungs and elevating the body on all four limbs. When grasped, these frogs usually emit a high-pitched scream. ==Feeding ecology and diet== Juveniles feed on small arthropods, but large adults feed on large arthropods, frogs, lizards, snakes, and small birds and mammals such as bats. Tadpoles are omnivorous, feeding on vegetation, tadpoles, and eggs, even of their own species. ==Reproductive biology== Males call solitarily from margins of ponds and backwaters of streams; the call is a loud \\"whoorup\\" repeated at intervals of five to 10 seconds. An attracted female is grasped by the male by axillary amplexus and held firmly by the muscular forearms and nuptial spines on the thumbs and chest. About 1,000 eggs are deposited in a large foam nest by backward and forward motions of the male's hind limbs that mix air, water, eggs, and secretions into the nest, which usually is deposited in a depression adjacent to water. The eggs hatch in two to three days; subsequent rains flood the nest site, and the tadpoles move into the pond or slow-moving stream. Development is rapid, and metamorphosis occurs about four weeks after hatching. Tadpoles attain a maximum total length of about 3.3 in (83 mm). The body is ovoid with a rounded snout with large eyes directed dorsolaterally. The oral disc is nearly terminal and bears finely serrate jaw sheaths and two anterior and three posterior rows of labial teeth. The body and caudal musculature are brown. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Leptodactylus pentadactylus, WildHerps.com * Smoky jungle frog, frogs.cc Category:Leptodactylus Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1768 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Smoky jungle frog"},{"id":"12389909","text":"Leptodactylus petersii (common name: Peters' thin-toed frog, in Spanish sapito de Peters, i.e. \\"Peters' toadlet\\") is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.

It is found in northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Brazil. Leptodactylus podicipinus live in grasslands and open habitats, often near ponds and flooded areas. They are common in suitable habitats. Eggs are laid in foam nests at the edges of permanent or temporary ponds and flooded areas. Male Leptodactylus podicipinus grow to a snout–vent length of and females to . ==Description== Leptodactylus podicipinus is a medium-sized member of its genus, with females having a snout-to-vent length between and males between . The dorsolateral folds are short and poorly developed, and there are yellowish glandular parches on the flanks and in the groin. The dorsal surface is brown and the underparts are dark grey, usually spotted or mottled with white; this patterning merges into mottling on the back of the thigh. The tips of the toes are either straight or are slightly bulbous. The tadpoles grow to a total length of about and are brown, sometimes with white speckles on the tail. ==Distribution and habitat== Leptodactylus podicipinus is found in the northern half of South America. Its range extends from central and western Brazil southward to northern and eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and northern Uruguay. It typically inhabits open areas near rivers which experience seasonal flooding, moist grassland and the vicinity of ponds. It occurs at altitudes of up to . ==Ecology== Like other members of the genus, Leptodactylus podicipinus has a strong skull and legs adapted for digging; the male uses both its snout and legs when digging. Another characteristic it shares is the creation by the male of a foam nest for the eggs. Among populations in the Pantanal of Brazil, males have been observed finding or digging depressions in the ground close to the edge of ponds, rather than in the larger bodies of water, the foam nests being then made in these small, water-filed basins. Other populations elsewhere in its range have not been observed engaging in this behaviour, which is an intermediate stage between the subterranean nests of the Leptodactylus fuscus group of species, and the floating nests of other less- derived species. ==Status== In most of its wide range, Leptodactylus podicipinus is a common frog. It does not appear to have any specific threats and is adaptable, living in areas disturbed by man including urban areas of northern Argentina. It also occurs in a number of preserved areas.

Horizontal gaze palsy may be caused by lesions in the cerebral hemispheres, which cause paresis of gaze away from the side of the lesion, or from brain stem lesions, which, if they occur below the crossing of the fibers from the frontal eye fields in the caudal midbrain, will cause weakness of gaze toward the side of the lesion. These will result in horizontal gaze deviations from unopposed action of the unaffected extraocular muscles. Another way to remember this is that patients with hemisphere lesions look towards their lesion, while patients with pontine gaze palsies look away from their lesions. Note that patients with gaze palsy still have conjugate eye movements and therefore do not complain of diplopia. The human Robo gene acts as a receptor for a midline repulsive cue. When Robo is mutated, the longitudinal tract formation is disrupted and therefore normal neuronal connections cannot form. This leads to the reduced hindbrain volume and scoliosis, which are common symptoms of horizontal gaze palsy. ==References== * Category:Visual disturbances and blindness ","title":"Horizontal gaze palsy"},{"id":"12389968","text":"Leptodactylus silvanimbus is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.

It is endemic to eastern Brazil and occurs in the Atlantic forests of the Bahia, Espírito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro states. The specific name spixi honors Johann Baptist von Spix, a German naturalist who worked in Brazil. Prior to its description, this species had been referred to as Leptodactylus mystaceus (Spix, 1824). Common name Spix's white-lipped frog has been coined for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length; sexual size dimorphism is not significant in this species. The snout is subelliptical from above and rounded with protruding ridge in lateral profile. The tympanum is large and distinct, as is the supratympanic fold. The dorsum is smooth but has a pair of well-developed dorsolateral folds from behind eye to hind leg. The dorsum has irregular darker brown markings on lighter brown background. The markings include an irregular interorbital backward-pointing triangle and chevrons in the suprascapular region. The dorsolateral folds are barely highlighted by darker brown color. A dark canthal stripe runs from the nostril to the tympanum, interrupted by eye. A distinct light stripe runs from the tip of the snout, below the dark canthal stripe, under eye and tympanum to angle of jaw. The upper lip has slightly darker shading below the light stripe The limbs are barred above. The venter is immaculate. Some individuals lack markings, while a light mid-dorsal stripe is seldom present.

It is monotypic, being represented by the single species, Lithodytes lineatus, the gold-striped frog or painted antnest frog. It is found in tropical South America where it lives in humid forests among the leaf litter. These frogs build foam nests at the edge of temporary pools, and the tadpoles develop within these. The frogs also associate with certain leafcutter ants and breed inside their nests without being attacked by the ants. ==Description== The female Lithodytes lineatus grows to a length of between , and the male is slightly smaller. It has a slender body and blunt snout. The overall colour is black apart from a pair of yellow lateral stripes running from the snout to the groin, where there is a red or orange patch. The limbs are brown banded with black. This frog is similar in appearance to the brilliant-thighed poison frog (Allobates femoralis) and may benefit by mimicking the toxic species, as it is avoided by predators. ==Distribution and habitat== Lithodytes lineatus is native to tropical South America. Its range includes the Orinoco basin and the Amazon basin and it is present in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, moist savanna, and intermittent freshwater marshes from altitudes ranging from sea level to above sea level. The species can be found below logs, among leaf-litter and in other concealed locations on the forest floor. ==Ecology== Lithodytes lineatus breeds in temporary pools, building foam nests in which the female lays 100 to 300 eggs. She then guards the developing eggs until the emerging tadpoles hatch. This frog is often found in association with the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes, with the male frog having been found calling from the interior of an active ants nest, seemingly unattacked by the ants. The ants usually kill intruders into the nest, and the frogs captured at the entrance to the nest had a noticeable aromatic odour; it may be that this acts as a repellent or other chemical signal to the ants. In one instance, four male frogs were calling synchronously from the inside of a large ant nest, the call being a series of brief whistles at the rate of about 85 per minute. Examination of another nest showed various passages and a wide vertical tunnel inside descending to the water table, with foam nests attached to roots in the wall of the tunnel and tadpoles at various stages of development in the underground pool. Ants were also moving along these tunnels. The frogs benefit from this association in that they have a well- protected breeding site and are safe from predation. It is not clear whether the ants benefit from the arrangement, but an examination of the contents of two frogs' stomachs showed that their diet included earthworms, crickets, isopods and insect larvae, with less than 10% being ants. Male frogs of this species have been observed calling at the entrance to, and from inside, an Atta laevigata nest, and juvenile frogs have been observed emerging from a nest of Atta sexdens. ==Status== This frog has a very wide distribution and is a common species, and its total population is estimated to be large. It may be in slight decline because of habitat degradation but seems to be able to adapt to secondary habitats. It is also present in a number of protected areas, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Leptodactylidae Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Taxa named by Leopold Fitzinger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Lithodytes"},{"id":"12390032","text":"Macrogenioglottus is a genus of frogs in the family Odontophrynidae.

It is named after Émil Goeldi, a Swiss zoologist who worked in Brazil. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout–vent length (based on 2 males and 3 females only). The dorsolateral skin is granular. The snout is subacuminate in dorsal view and protruding in profile. The canthus rostralis is evident and straight. Males have neither vocal sacs nor vocal slits. ==Diet== Stomach contents have been found to contain insects (cockroaches, Coleoptera, lepidopteran caterpillars), earthworms, and plant material. In experiments, Megaelosia goeldii have consumed other frogs. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are rivers in primary forest. During the day, they can be found on emergent rocks in shallow places. Tadpoles have been collected under large rocks in a moderate-sized forest stream. Megaelosia goeldii is a common species, but very difficult to catch. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by forest clearance and infrastructure development, and by pollution. ==References== goeldii Category:Amphibians described in 1912 Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Alípio de Miranda-Ribeiro Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Megaelosia goeldii"},{"id":"12390075","text":"Megaelosia lutzae is a species of frog in the family Hylodidae.

The specific name bagrecito is Spanish meaning a small catfish, and a nickname for David Cannatella, a colleague of , the scientist who described the species from specimens collected from near Marcapata. ==Description== Psychrophrynella bagrecito are small frogs: adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. Skin on dorsum is shagreened, becoming more coarse on the lower back. Dorsum is striped with shades of brown. Venter has areolate skin and is white to cream with some brown mottling. Males have distended vocal sacs. ==Habitat and conservation== Species' natural habitat is montane cloud forest. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by small-scale agriculture and firewood collection. == References == bagrecito Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1986 Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Psychrophrynella bagrecito"},{"id":"12390180","text":"Phrynopus barthlenae is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

It is endemic to Peru and only known from its type locality in the Cordillera Yanachaga, Pasco Region. The specific name bracki honors Antonio Brack, agronomist and ecologist who was instrumental for the establishment of the Yanachaga–Chemillén National Park. Common name Brack's Andes frog, or in , has been coined for it. ==Description== Based on the type series consisting of two adult males and a single female, adult males measure about and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is short and narrower than the body. The snout is rounded to slightly truncate. The canthus rostralis is moderately sharp. There is no tympanum, and also the supra-tympanic fold is absent. The fingers and toes are not expanded; the fingers have slight lateral fringes. No webbing is present. Skin of the dorsum is tuberculate, more so in the males than in the female. The coloration is nearly uniformly black or very dark brown, apart from some faint traces of lighter brown pattern. The male advertisement call is a two-note call, with the dominant frequency at 2500 Hz. ==Habitat and conservation== Phrynopus bracki is found in montane cloud and elfin forest at elevations of above sea level. It is a terrestrial species. The males were found inside curled dead leaves on the forest floor, revealed by their calls, whereas the female was found in leaf litter. This species is threatened by habitat loss, but most of its range is protected by the Yanachaga–Chemillén National Park. ==References== bracki Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1990 Category:Taxa named by Stephen Blair Hedges Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Phrynopus bracki"},{"id":"12390186","text":"Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers is a 1970 book by Tom Wolfe. The book, Wolfe's fourth, is composed of two essays: \\"These Radical Chic Evenings\\", first published in June 1970 in New York magazine, about a gathering Leonard Bernstein held for the Black Panther Party, and \\"Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers\\", about the response of many minorities to San Francisco's poverty programs. Both essays looked at the conflict between black rage and white guilt. ==\\"Radical Chic\\"== The first piece is set in the duplex on Park Avenue in Manhattan inhabited by conductor Leonard Bernstein, his wife the actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre, and their three children. Bernstein assembled many of his wealthy socialite friends to meet with representatives of the controversial Black Panthers and discuss ways to help their cause. The party was a typical affair for Bernstein, a longtime Democrat, who was known for hosting civil rights leaders at such parties. The Bernsteins' usual staff of white South Americans served the party. Some of the Bernsteins' typical friends in the arts and guests in journalism (including Oscar-nominated director Otto Preminger and television reporter Barbara Walters) are labeled the \\"radical chic\\", as Wolfe characterizes them as pursuing radical ends for social reasons, partially because organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had become mainstream. Wolfe's criticism is implicitly of the general phenomenon of white guilt and armchair agitation becoming facets of high fashion. When Time magazine later interviewed a minister of the Black Panthers about Bernstein's party, the official said of Wolfe: \\"You mean that dirty, blatant, lying, racist dog who wrote that fascist disgusting thing in New York magazine?\\" ==\\"Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers\\"== The second part of Wolfe's book is set at the Office of Economic Opportunity in San Francisco, which was in charge of administering many of the anti-poverty programs of the time. Wolfe presents the office as corrupt, continually gamed by hustlers diverting cash into their own pockets. The essay centers on the irony of these failed programs fortifying not the diets but the resentment and contempt of the Black, Chicano, Filipino, Chinese, Indian, and Samoan communities of San Francisco. Wolfe describes hapless city bureaucrats, the Flak Catchers, whose function has been reduced to taking abuse, or \\"mau- mauing\\" (in reference to the intimidation tactics employed in Kenya's anti- colonial Mau Mau Uprising), from militant young Blacks and Samoans, who are depicted as reveling in the newfound vulnerability of \\"the Man\\". The Flak Catchers smile pathetically, allowing their tormentors to indulge themselves in abuse; the process is seen as a farcical but useful expedient, condescending toward the resentment of these communities. Wolfe describes one mau-mauer who would show up at the offices and hand over icepicks, switchblades and straight razors that he said were taken from gangs, in exchange for payments from the program. As a result, much of the money of these programs was not reaching its intended recipients, rendering the programs largely ineffective. ==Cultural impact== The phrase \\"radical chic\\" has entered into the political and cultural lexicon to describe the adoption of radical or quasi-radical causes by members of the wealthy high-society and celebrity class. Both essays were later reprinted in Wolfe's collection The Purple Decades, indicating that he considered them among his best work. Mau- Mauing the Flak Catchers is cited in David Foster Wallace's Consider the Lobster in the essay on \\"Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky\\". Wallace recommends reading it to understand Dostoevsky's disillusionment as a young rich socialist when he met the dregs of Russian society in prison. ==References External links == * \\"Radical Chic\\", the complete text—New York magazine * \\"Radical Chic\\", a scan of the original article—New York magazine Category:1970 books Category:Books about race and ethnicity Category:Books about New York City Category:Books about the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Essay collections by Tom Wolfe Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books ","title":"Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers"},{"id":"12390190","text":"Niceforonia brunnea, the Carchi Andes frog, is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae found in Colombia and Ecuador.

It is endemic to Peru and known only from slopes of the Abra Acanacu (also spelled Acjanaco or Acanaco) in the Cordillera de Paucartambo, Cusco Region. There is an unconfirmed record from a neighboring mountain range, so this species might be more widespread than current knowledge suggests. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is narrower than the body. The snout is short, rounded in dorsal view and rounded to truncate in lateral view. Tympanum is absent. The canthus rostralis is moderately sharp. Skin is dorsally finely areolate, becoming coarser towards the flanks and the ventrum. The hind limbs are very short. No inter-digital webbing is present. Dorsal coloration is dull brown to pale tan, or has a mottled pattern of olive-brown and black to brown and greenish yellow or red. The venter is dull gray. The throat in males has an orange cast. Reproduction occurs through direct development (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage): females lay about 20 eggs that hatch as long froglets; they guard their eggs in a nest of moss. ==Habitat and conservation== Bryophryne cophites is a terrestrial frog that is primarily found in wet puna grasslands and elfin forests at elevations of above sea level. It has also been recorded in cloud forest but is very rare in that habitat. The species occurs in the Manú National Park. It can be very abundant in a suitable habitat, but is only known with confidence from three locations. Habitat loss is occurring along the western boundary of the park, caused by grazing cattle and fires; a fire has led to documented loss of at least one local occurrence of this species.

A Drama Desk and Laurence Olivier Award nominee for Best Actor, he performed on Broadway, the Metropolitan Opera, BBC television, in concert and made several recordings. He is most famous for appearing as Joe in Show Boat, and as Jake, as well as Porgy, in Porgy and Bess on Broadway, the West End, and in several major opera houses and regional theatres. He graduated from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music.Bruce Hubbard Dies; Operatic Baritone, 39 The New York Times. Archives. November 14, 1991. Retrieved November 22, 2014 ==Early life== Hubbard was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1951. He graduated from Arlington High School in 1971. In 1973, while still a student at Indiana University, where he was a music major, he helped coach actors who appeared in musicals. He returned to Indianapolis and recorded two songs on a vinyl LP. He recorded \\"Antiphon\\" from \\"Five Mystical Songs\\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and \\"Without a Song,\\" by Vincent Youmans, with the Arlington High School concert choir. This custom album may have been his first formally recorded release. ==Career== From 1978 to 1980, after Porgy and Bess, Hubbard was also seen on Broadway and subsequently in two Broadway National tours of Timbuktu!, starring the legendary Eartha Kitt, Melba Moore, Gilbert Price, and William Marshall and directed by the Tony Award winning director, costume designer and choreographer Geoffrey Holder. Hubbard first understudied, then eventually succeeded, Price in the leading role of the Mansa of Mali. He also appeared in the original company of Alan Jay Lerner and Leonard Bernstein's 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the role of Rev. Bushrod, and performed in the first Broadway production of Scott Joplin's Treemonisha. Hubbard began appearing in productions of Show Boat as far back as 1976, including a touring production featuring Van Johnson as Cap'n Andy. However it was his performance in the acclaimed Houston Grand Opera Broadway production in 1983, with Donald O'Connor, that garnered Hubbard a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. But perhaps the most notable production of the musical in which he appeared was not a live staged performance. The 1988 EMI 3-CD set conducted by John McGlinn, featured, for the very first time on recordings, the entire musical score, though not all the dialogue, using the original 1927 vocal arrangements and orchestrations. The album was highly acclaimed and became a best seller. It is still in print today and was chosen as one of EMI's Great Recordings of the Century. On the album, which attempted to be faithful to the original libretto, Hubbard was the first singer in modern times to sing Ol' Man River with its original, controversial lyrics; which included the use of the term \\"niggers\\", rather than the more traditional and commonly used phrase, \\"colored folks.\\" Use of the original lyric caused considerable controversy before recording even began. Willard White was originally cast as Joe and had been agreeable with McGlinn's vision. But he changed his mind after the all-black chorus, recruited from the Glyndebourne production of Porgy and Bess, strongly objected and sent a letter of protest to EMI. The record company backed McGlinn, and three days before the song was to be recorded, White and the chorus withdrew from the project. The conductor then turned to the Ambrosian Chorus, which had been signed to sing the white choral passages, to sing all the choral music. To sing Joe, McGlinn then turned to Hubbard, who had played the role on Broadway and happened to be in England singing Jake in the Glyndebourne production of Porgy and Bess. Hubbard said he needed a day to make up his mind and discussed it with a number of friends, including Eartha Kitt. Most, but not all, urged him to sing the word.'Show Boat' Makes New Waves. Stephen Holden. The New York Times. September 25, 1988.

Hubbard then appeared in the highly acclaimed 1986 Glyndebourne Festival revival of Porgy and Bess, as well as in the Metropolitan Opera production. The recording of the Glyndebourne production was also chosen an EMI Great Recording of the Century. Hubbard sang the role of Jake, the fisherman, but had died before the Glyndebourne production was brought to television in 1993. However, because the soundtrack of the recording was used in the Emmy- nominated television version, Hubbard can still be heard as Jake, while baritone Gordon Hawkins plays the role onscreen. However, Hubbard was actually seen in a 1987 televised Metropolitan Opera production of Bizet's Carmen, as the smuggler Le Dancaïre.Bruce Hubbard IMDb. 1990-2014.

It was conducted by Dennis Russell Davies and released in time for Christmas in 1990. It would be Hubbard's only solo album. It featured Aaron Copland's Old American Songs, Irving Berlin's song Always, and selections from Porgy and Bess, Girl Crazy, Centennial Summer and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

It is endemic to the Andean highlands in Peru. ==History and taxonomy== Noblella peruviana is the type species of genus Noblella. The genus was erected by Thomas Barbour to accommodate the species that had until then been known as Sminthillus peruvianus; the only other Sminthillus species was from Cuba (now known as Eleutherodactylus limbatus). However, despite its status as defining the genus Noblella, Noblella peruviana is a little known species. Its type locality is considered to be in error; the true locality is uncertain but may be in the Puno Region. In the literature, it has also been mixed with Pleurodema marmorata from Bolivia and with Psychrophrynella usurpator from Peru. ==Description== The holotype measures in snout–vent length. The following description is from the original species description by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble: > Snout rounded, equal to the greatest diameter of the orbit; loreal region > abrupt, nearly vertical; nostril midway between the tip of the snout and the > anterior corner of the eye; interorbital space a little broader than the > upper eyelid; horizontal diameter of the tympanum about one-half, vertical > diameter nearly two-thirds the greatest width of the eye; tympanum about > one-half its smallest diameter from the latter. Digits pointed, no terminal > disks; a well-developed tarsal and two metatarsal tubercles. Tibio-tarsal > articulation reaching just beyond the posterior angle of the eye; when the > limbs are held vertical to the axis of the body, the tibio-tarsal > articulation overlapping its mate of the opposite side. Skin feebly granular > above, smooth below. Color uniform grayish brown, slightly purplish above; a > broad band of dark brown extending on each side from the nostril to the > lumbar region; a narrow white line on the posterior face of each thigh > joining with a median line which extends anteriorly along the back for more > than half its length; posterior surfaces of the lower leg indistinctly > barred with dark brown. Lower surfaces of body whitish, the chin and thigh > indistinctly suffused with brown. ==Habitat and ecology== Reflecting the uncertainty regarding its type locality, habitat and ecology of Noblella peruviana are unknown. ==References== peruviana Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Taxa named by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1921 ","title":"Noblella peruviana"},{"id":"12390279","text":"Phrynopus pesantesi is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

Jan Jansz. Vos (baptised 4 March 1612 in AmsterdamGemeente Amsterdam Stadsarchief - buried 12 July 1667 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch playwright and poet. A glassmaker by trade (in that position he provided all windows for the new city hall on the Dam), he also played an important role as stage-manager and director of the theatre. He organized, on the mayors' orders, processions and splendid decorated floats, which sometimes drew disapproval, criticism, and derision. ==Life== On 20 February 1639, at the old City Hall of Amsterdam, he married Grietje Gerrets (1616 - 1651), already pregnant by him. They had two children: Jan (who only lived a few days) and Maria (who in 1664 laid the first stone for the new theatre). Jan Vos was of good family and lived in the Kalverstraat at no. 202. He prided himself on knowing no other languages than Dutch. With his Aran and Titus of 1641 his name, previously all but unknown, was made. Casper van Baerle admired the work, despite, or because of, the fact that it featured a prince served as a pudding, a baked Moor and some apparitions. (The subject is the same as in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus). In his Klucht van Oene (\\"The Farce of Oene\\", 1642), a number of dishonest practices by Amsterdam merchants and industrialists are criticized - bakers of bread short-selling their customers, tailors filching pieces of cloth owned by their patrons, glassmakers cheating with glass quantities, dyers of silk tampering with their material. In addition, house-agents, pawnbrokers, cashiers, notaries public and secretaries, landlords, millers, doctors, barbers, pharmacists and booksellers enter the stage. Jan Vos was a sought- after table companion of such leading families as those of De Graeff, Bicker, Huydecoper and Jan Six. He wrote occasional poems for them , and this has led to his often being characterized as \\"a family poet\\". In 1651 he was among the compilers of the Verscheyde Nederduytse gedichten (\\"Sundry Poems in Dutch\\") collection of poems, an attempt to bring together painters and poets of different schools and religions. In 1657, he was an honoured guest at the marriage of Jan J. Hinlopen and Leonora Huydecoper. Jan Vos was head of the Theatre of Van Campen for nineteen years, together with Tobias van Domselaer and Johannes Serwouters. Vos was part of the Muiderkring, a group of literary people meeting at a castle where the a member of the Bicker family had been appointed \\"drost\\" (keeper of the castle). He directed plays by Vondel. Jan Vos had a good eye for the public taste, and was repeatedly entrusted by the city authorities with designing and overseeing pageants and spectacles. In 1654, Vos organized ten performances celebrating the Treaty of Westminster. In 1659, Amalia van Solms, the Regent's wife, and her daughter visited Amsterdam, seeing twenty performances especially designed for the occasions. Nicolas Tulp, however, vehemently opposed the appearance of pagan gods and goddesses during the visitors' festive arrival. At the visit of Maria Henrietta Stuart, the widow of William II, it turned out that one of the floats represented the beheading of Charles I of England, Mary's late father. Jan Vos, who led the processions on horseback, and became a target for criticism. ==NotesReferences== *Dudok van Heel, S.A.C.

It is endemic to Brazil and only known from its type locality in Jaboticatubas, Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais. The specific name deimaticus is derived from Greek deimos fror \\"fear\\" and refers to the defensive display of this frog, probably aimed at scaring predators. Common names Jaboticatubas dwarf frog and frightening foam froglet have been coined for it. ==Description== The type series consists of three specimens. The holotype is an adult female measuring in snout–vent length. The other female type is of similar size, whereas the male type measures in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is robust. The snout is short. No tympanum is visible. The fingers and the toes are long and have neither webbing nor expanded tips. The dorsum has granulose skin and is light gray to light reddish brown in color. The interorbital stripe, middorsal stripe that splits in two posteriorly, and lateral bands are dark brown. The glands are black with white margins. ==Behavior== When threatened, this species performs a \\"deimatic\\" display in which it swells up its body, lowers its head, and raises its rump, such that the two large inguinal glands resembling eye spots are exposed. Similar display is known from Physalaemus nattereri. ==Habitat and conservation== Physalaemus deimaticus is terrestrial frog known from rocky areas at about above sea level. It probably breeds in water. It is not assumed to adapt well to anthropogenic disturbance, and could be threatened by fire, expanding human settlements, and disturbance resulting from tourism. It might occur with the Serra do Cipó National Park. ==References== deimaticus Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1988 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Physalaemus deimaticus"},{"id":"12390389","text":"Physalaemus ephippifer is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae. It is found in central and eastern Brazilian Amazonia, the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana), and southern Venezuela (Bolívar state). It might not occur in French Guiana. ==Description== Physalaemus ephippifer grow to in snout–vent length. The body is slightly elongated with a pointed snout. The tympanum is barely visible. The back is typically smooth but has warts in some specimens; there are few longitudinal ridges. The dorsal colouration is light to reddish brown, with a variable degree of greyish markings. There is a black stripe running from the tip of the snout to the eye, continuing as a black band on the flank. The ventral colour is creamy or yellowish. The legs are barred with dark brown and there are red or orange patches in the armpits and groin. The fingers and toes are unwebbed. ==Habitat and ecology== Physalaemus ephippifer is a common, adaptable species that benefits from human disturbance. It is living on the forest edge, in clearings, and in other anthropogenic habitats. In Suriname it is a common species of the savanna belt and the interior areas. The species breeds in temporary pools during the late wet season. The female makes a foam nest by secreting a fluid from the oviduct which the male whips into a foam with his hind legs. The eggs are hidden in the foam and hatch in about three days. After two or three days more the tadpoles emerge from the foam and subsequently develop in the water. It is thought that the foam deters predators, including older tadpoles of the same species. ==Status== This frog has a wide range and is a common species with a large total population. It is an adaptable species and is found in areas disturbed by humans, and no particular threats have been recognised. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== ephippifer Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1864 Category:Taxa named by Franz Steindachner Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Physalaemus ephippifer"},{"id":"12390393","text":"Physalaemus erikae is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae. It is endemic to eastern Brazil and currently known only from southern Bahia, although it is likely that its range extends into nearby areas in northeastern Minas Gerais and northern Espírito Santo with similar vegetation. ==Etymology== Physalaemus erikae is named for Erika Costa Elias, wife of Bruno Pimenta, one of the scientists who described the species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is robust. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is weakly distinct. The supratympanic fold runs from the posterior corner of the eye to the shoulder; immediately above it, a more or less weak dorsolateral fold runs to near the inguinal region. The fingers and the toes are long and have neither webbing nor expanded tips. Dorsal skin is warty with scattered short ridges or pairs of well-developed longitudinal ridges. Coloration is variable; preserved specimens may be brown with small black blotches on the dorsum and a black interorbital stripe (weak or absent in some specimens). Coloration may also be cream and light-brown; a white vertebral stripe can be present. Males have a large subgular vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Physalaemus erikae have been encountered in temporary ponds in cow pastures at the borders of Atlantic Rain Forest remnants, natural openings inside the forest, and cacao plantations. Males call from pond edges or floating in shallow water. Females have been spotted near ponds or dwelling on forest floor litter. This species seems to benefit from some degree of degradation and opening of the forest canopy, but complete loss of forest cover is likely to have a negative impact on it. It has been recorded in the Serra Bonita Private Reserve of Natural Heritage. ==References== erikae Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Physalaemus erikae"},{"id":"12390395","text":"Physalaemus erythros is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.
