It was opened in 1894 and electrified on the three-phase system in 1902. It is now electrified at 3 kV direct current and operated by Trenord. ==History== The line was built in stages between 1885 and 1894. Two large railway companies dominated the area at the time. They were the Rete Adriatica (Adriatic network) and the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean network). with the opening of the Colico-Bellano section, on 1 August 1894 a complete railway service started. ==Electrification== RA 34, later FS Class E.430 The Valtellina railway is notable for being an early user of electric traction. It was the first in Italy and the first in the world to use high-voltage three-phase alternating current for rail traction. On 15 October 1902 the electrification began on the Lecco-Colico-Chiavenna and Colico-Sondrio sections with overhead power lines at 3,000 V, 15 Hz. The frequency was later raised to 15.8 Hz for reasons unknown. Finally, the voltage and frequency were raised to 3,600 V, 16.7 Hz, which became an Italian standard. Power was supplied by the Campovico hydroelectric plant. The line is now electrified with 3 kV direct current. ==The route== The line was built with great technical daring but the Lecco- Colico-Chiavenna section now shows its age. Over the 40 kilometres to Colico there are 89 curves, 18 viaducts and 19 tunnels. However, the line, which runs along the eastern shore of Lake Como with its jagged coastline, offers passengers enchanting views of inlets in which can be seen patrician villas, lush vegetation and lake marinas. Tirano station is an interchange point for travellers who want to go to Switzerland on the Rhaetian Railway, a narrow- gauge line, departing from the aforementioned station that follows a route that reaches 2,253 metres in height and the famous tourist station St. Moritz. ==Traffic== The line is used by regional trains of Trenord which run along the Sondrio-Lecco and Sondrio-Tirano routes (stopping at all stations), and from Regio Express trains - until 2007 called Diretti - of Trenord, many of which travel the entire Tirano route to Milan Central. From December 2014, on public holidays and the month of August the Regional trains of Lecco-Sondrio terminate at Colico and are replaced by buses for the remaining section. ==Rolling stock== RA 361, later FS Class E.360 ===Historical=== Initially the rolling stock used, with three-phase alternating current, consisted of: * RA 34, later, FS Class E.430, Bo+Bo locomotive * RA 361, later FS Class E.360, 1′C1′ locomotive * Railcars ===Recent=== More recently, compositions have been used, between Milan and Tirano, of an FS Class E.464 electric locomotive with 7 MDVC carriages and MDVC pilot, while the festive trains consist of FS Class ALe 803 electric multiple units or E.464 locomotives and low-floor carriages. Sometimes FS Class ALe 582 or, rarely, compositions of FS Class ALn 668 diesel railcars are used.

The output will be sold to Snowy Hydro for retail sale under its Lumo Energy brand. Stage 2 is also expected to provide battery storage. The solar farm covers of land with more than 390,000 photovoltaic solar panels. The panels are mounted on fixed-angle racks. The site is a joint development between Equis and Snowy Hydro. Snowy Hydro also had plans to establish a 28MW diesel generator at the site. UGL Limited was contracted in February 2018 to build the first stage, which was expected to be connected to the power grid in the first quarter of 2019. A second stage to generate an additional 111MW is also being planned. The Tailem Bend solar farm received its generation licence on 30 January 2019, and was expected to start commissioning in February, with full production from mid-April. Its theoretical capacity is 108MW, but the licence limits it to 95MW to ensure it can deliver reactive power to the grid. The 95MW Tailem Bend solar farm began production on 4th March 2019 and officially opened on 30th May 2019.

Several young men pass by and make several gudocheks – each makes one for himself. The maiden asks the gudocheks not to tinkle, not to wake her (however, in some versions, her father) up. == Commentary == === Historical background === According to Alexander Tereshchenko, ″Utushka lugovaya″ could be performed during traditional Russian marriage celebrations. Pavel Svinyin wrote that the Don Cossacks used the song in matchmaking. Some researchers consider that image (\\"Utushka lugovaya\\"/ \\"Young duck\\") as a traditional image of the young woman or bride. === Genre characteristics === A number of sources mention the song as a plyasovaya or a khorovodnaya. Alexander Potebnja regards it – for its time signature – as an example of the so-called summer or spring songs. == Settings and performance == Before 1792, Vasily Pashkevich created for his third opera a theme based on the song. In the following two centuries, many composers (such as P. I. Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky‑Korsakov, Anatoly Lyadov, Alexander Ivanov‑Kramskoi) arranged \\"Utushka lugovaya\\".

TUF uses a series of roles and keys to provide a means to retain security, even when some keys or servers are compromised. It does this with a stated goal of requiring minimal changes and effort from repository administrators, software developers, and end users. In this way, it protects software repositories, which are an increasingly desirable target for hackers. A software update, sometimes referred to as a patch, can add functionalities and address flaws in existing code. Unfortunately, in delivering updates to neutralize flaws, these systems can unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities that, in turn, can be exploited by attackers. The design of TUF acknowledges that all software repositories will likely be compromised at some point, so any security strategy must be prepared for that scenario. TUF-enabled systems focus on limiting the impact of attacks and providing a mechanism for recovery. This strategy of “compromise-resilience” improves on existing methods based on keysigning by incorporating techniques, such as separation of signing duties and setting a threshold number of required signatures. Dividing the responsibility for authenticating a file or image ensures no single hacker can compromise the system. It also helps to ensure that keys used to perform a sensitive action can be stored in a secure, offline manner. Even if one party—or the repository itself—is compromised, the number of projects affected will be limited. To date, the list of tech companies and organizations using TUF include IBM, VMware, , Digital Ocean, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Leap, Kolide, Docker, and Cloudflare. The technology that evolved into TUF was first developed at the University of Washington in 2009 by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos, and its principles were first discussed in a paper Samuel and Cappos coauthored with Nick Mathewson and Roger Dingledine, researchers from The Tor Project, Inc.. Since 2011, TUF has been based at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, where Cappos continues to work with a team of graduate students and programmers in the Secure Systems Lab to supervise its maturation, development and integration into production use across different communities. One of the more significant earlier adoptions of TUF in the open- source community was by Docker Content Trust, an implementation of the Notary project from Docker that deploys Linux containers. Notary, which is built on TUF, can both certify the validity of the sources of Docker images, and encrypt the contents of those images.. Through Notary Content Trust, TUF also secures operations for Microsoft Azure. Since 2017, both Notary and TUF have been hosted by the Linux Foundation under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.. Cappos remains with the project as consensus builder. In December 2019, TUF was awarded “graduate” status within the organization, signifying that it has completed a series of steps needed to move the project to the highest level of maturity in the CNCF.. These steps included completing an independent third party security audit, adopting the CNCF Code of Conduct, and explicitly defining a project governance and committer process. TUF became both the first security project and the first project led by an academic researcher to graduate within CNCF{{cite weburl=https://lwn.net/Articles/807777/title=Cloud Native Computing Foundation Announces TUF Graduationpublisher=LWN.netdate=19 December 2019accessdate=13 April 2020}. Because it was designed for easy adaptation, versions of TUF have been created in a number of programming languages. It has been independently implemented in the Go language by Flynn, an open-source platform as a service (PaaS) for running applications in production. Implementations of TUF have also been written in Haskell, Ruby and Rust.

The child is Ana, Nanda's friend, and her tear of fear completes the spell. The spell will take place on the next full moon and can only be undone in the Castle of the Witches. Unfortunately, fairies can not enter the castle. Kira meets Mily (Cláudia Rodrigues), a fumbling little fairy. It ends up giving Kira the power to fly. Kira takes advantage and leaves for the witch's castle. The children and Rafael go to the greenhouse to find Kira. They find the Kuines and decide to go to the waterfall along with Chuchu (Luiz Carlos Tourinho) and Alface (Tadeu Mello), Kira's helpers. At the behest of Dara, Mily comes to the world of humans to ask for help from Raphael. Mily takes everyone to the magical world. The witches go to the mirror and discover that Rafael and the others are on the trail. Algaz appears and orders the pink-heart child to be captured so that the second tear is extracted. Epifania (Deborah Secco), a witch with no talent for evil, pays attention to what they say. She is the mother of Ana. Adastéia goes to the trail and catches Ana (Maria Mariana Azevedo). The spell of the fairy Mily ends, Kira falls and is imprisoned by a gigantic troll. Kira is saved from the clutches of the troll by Gorgon (Guilherme Karan), Raphael and his group. They head towards the castle. Kira gets in, but her friends do not. Inside, she sees the torture that the witches do with Ana. The girl is trapped in a cage on the cauldron with the boiling potion. Kira tries to stop them but can not. Rafael arrives and manages to save Kira with the help of Gorgon, the children and the elf Dafnis, Ana's father. Kira and Rafael use the force of love and thus save Ana and win the witches. The castle is going to explode. Everyone needs to leave. Gorgon and the children are the first. The moment is tense, the castle explodes without Kira and Rafael leaving. Among the rubble are the two. Kira and Rafael seal their love with a kiss and, later, with a beautiful union ceremony in Faerie. Mika and Zinga are present as well as all the other characters. Each character has his farewell story. Ana tries to see the future in a crystal ball. She sees the image of Kira, Rafael and a child. They walk like the harbinger of a happy future. == Cast == *Xuxa Meneghel as Kira / Elf of the Light *Luciano Szafir as Rafael (Rafa) *Deborah Secco as Epifânia *Thiago Fragoso as Dáfnis *Susana Vieira as Witch- Mór *Betty Lago as Witch-Algaz *Cristina Pereira as Witch-Desdêmona *Vic Militello as Witch-Desdêmona *Karen Acioly as Witch-Adastéia *Debby Lagranha as Fernanda Maia (Nanda) *Brunno Abrahão as Daniel (Dani) *Ana Maria Braga as Queen Zinga *Emiliano Queiroz as King Mika *Vera Fischer as Queen Dara / Mother of fairies *Zezé Motta as Prophesy Kálix *Guilherme Karan as Gorgon *Nathália Rodrigues as Fairy Light *Juliana Baroni as Kin Fairy *Cláudia Rodrigues as Milly Fairy *Tadeu Mello as Alface *Luiz Carlos Tourinho as Chuchu *Zilka Salaberry as Cléo *Gustavo Pereira as Lix / Duende do tempo *David Brazil as Rodim / Duende Veloz *Maria Mariana Azevedo as Ana *Thainá Medeiros as Gabriela *Adriana Bombom as Blue Fairy *Ana Paula Almeida as Yellow fairy *Monique Alfradique as Pink fairy *Lana Rodes as Fairy Turquoise *Daiane Amêndola as Red Fairy *Gabriella Ferreira as Lilac fairy *Joana Mineiro as Violet fairy *Letícia Barros as Orange fairy *Stephanie Lourenço as Green fairy *Thalita Ribeiro as Fairy Pearl ==Background and development== After an attempt to produce a new children's film was completely abandoned because of problems with Globo Filmes, Xuxa starred in the Xuxa Popstar film which was a box office hit. At the same time, he fulfilled a clause in his contract with Diler & Associados in which he should make two films aimed at the adolescent public and one for the children's public. And so, began to be sketched the new film project of the presenter. Xuxa wanted to do something different from her two previous films in the cinema: Xuxa Requebra (1999) and Xuxa Popstar (2000). If in these feature films the idea was to bring Planeta Xuxa to the cinema, privileging the musical attractions to the detriment of history, in that it was sought not only to create a more consistent plot, but to create an entire universe, which had its own rules. In this way, Xuxa tried to follow the trend of the film market at the time: to bet on a fantastic story, mixing the real world with the magical world. However, rather than betting on the fantasy genre, Xuxa wanted something that represented her willingness to retell stories to children. The idea of creating a film based on Duende came after a controversial statement by the host. In all interviews, the singer was emphatic in claiming that she had seen goblins on two occasions. Xuxa said the Goblins used to show up in their room at night. Then, one of the elves (female, according to Xuxa) cried beside her bed, leading her to believe that she should feed them. The hostess then put food on the counter in the room where she puts the elves she wins and then the apparitions stopped. \\"I put fruits, raisins,\\" he said. \\"They're gone.\\" The presenter's account controversies in the media. It was then that its manager Marlene Mattos, decided to take something beneficial from the situation make a movie, about Duendes. The film production became the most viewed in the history of national cinema. Three weeks after it was released, the film had already been seen by more than 700,000 people. \\"Xuxa e os Duendes\\" was the most expensive film of the Xuxa (budget of 3.8 million). Diler Trindade's goal was to reach 2.5 million viewers and earn R $10 million. Diler's prediction was almost right: the movie grossed R $11,681,917.00. ==Production== Still in 2001, before the debut of the first film, Xuxa guaranteed the sequel of the story for 2002, \\"We already have until name: Xuxa and the Elves 2 - On the way of the fairies\\". said the presenter. \\"Xuxa and the Elves\\" was Xuxa's most expensive film with a budget of 3.8 million. however it was surpassed by its sequence Duendes 2, that had budget tripled in more of R$5 million of Brazilian real. After losing the highest-grossing Brazilian title to City of God (2002), after leading for three consecutive years, Xuxa wanted the film to have more focus on the plot and less stock-and-share actions of recording artists such as the previous ones, With the production of A Globo Filmes and the distribution Warner, partners of the project, they invested the greatest exposure to the film so that the presenter could return to the podium. Captured HD high-definition camera, the film benefited from post-production in the studios of Tele-Image. the effects director of Tele-Image, Marcelo Siqueira, emphasizes limitations of time and budget that prevented the work of reaching a more accurate result. \\"The film was made from August to now, we had only 40 studio days to do the post-production effects.\\" In comparison, he says that Tele-Image, who did the same thing in Cacá Diegues' new film, had a much longer time for God Is Brazilian - at least seven months and a year and a half of preparations. Time and budget are restrictive factors that even the commitment and creativity can not compensate, at least in full, even more in a movie like this, full of effects. Siqueira and the owner of Tele-Image, Philippe Siaretta, even refer to the castle of the movie as \\"R$ 1.99\\" (Brazil) to highlight how much the lack of money was restrictive for them. Made to the touch of the box, with a $1 million budget (Brazil), Xuxa and the Goblins 2 would require double and even triple to come out with a target and also more post-production time, According to the producers. For Marcelo Rezende from Folha, the concept of the film is a film that aims above all to be pleasant, and the scheme in which it was assembled is of an almost militant simplicity. The intention is to create a fable. A moral tale about diversity. The elf loves a man (common, as the movie shows), and the point is to show the children that all differences do not really make any difference. Children-the probability is at least reasonable-must understand this message, because it is repeated over and over again. Almost every sequence, in infinite ways. Didatism leads everything, sets the tone and the mark as Xuxa seeks to perfect herself in the image of perfect teacher. If in Xuxa and the Xuxa Elves already wanted to secure a cast with more professional actors and fewer celebrities and recording artists, in Duendes 2, Xuxa vetoed pop singers and other \\"celebrities\\", something that was common in Requebra and Popstar, by exigency of his former manager Marlene Mattos. In the cast are actors of the Brazilian dramaturgy like Vera Fischer, Zezé Motta, Betty Lago, Thiago Fragoso, Susana Vieira, Deborah Secco, interpreting the main characters. Debby Lagranha, Emiliano Queiroz, Tadeu melo, Guilherme Karan and Ana Maria Braga are the only actors of the previous film that remain in Duendes 2. there are not any romantic pair for Xuxa, in Duendes 2, the television presenter is a romantic couple. with Luciano Szafir with whom she was married and had a daughter Sasha Meneghel. Along with the previous Xuxa e os Duendes 2, he received accusations of plagiarism, has received accusations of plagiarism. Writer Ana Maria Salgado claimed that the scripts of the two films were inspired by her book, \\"Maria da Graça in: O Portal\\" (en: Maria da Graça in: The Portal). She filed a claim for compensation for moral and material damages in court over Xuxa Promotions and Artistic Productions, Marlene Mattos and Diler and Associates. The 17th Civil Chamber of the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice ruled that the application was unfounded, based on the evidence that the defendants presented that two professional writers made the plot of the films, which was also supported by an expert. The judge stated that \\"the similarities are common in this literary type, that is, fairies with scepters or wands, evil witches who laugh and want to destroy the forces of good, the existence of magical portals, funny characters, etc. in the case of the films, the existence of elves that configure their main characters, which do not exist in the author's text\\". ===Music=== The soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2002 by Som Livre. The album consists of songs performed by the protagonist, presenter Xuxa Meneghel and other artists such as Deborah Blando, Thiago Fragoso and Paulinho Moska. The soundtrack was released between 2002 and 2003 shortly after the release of the DVD movie. The only existing version has the simple DVD-like cover, the cover is all blue with film and CD credits and small cast photos as well as the back cover of the DVD. ==Release== Xuxa and the Elves 2, it was released on December 13, 2002, in more than 300 cinemas in Brazil, on December 7, 2002, premiered at the Villa Lobos Shopping Mall in São Paulo, which caused a great commotion among children and adults who waited for an autograph of Xuxa. Xuxa said that he wanted to debut Xuxa and El Duendes 2 in Latin America, as long as it was dubbed in Spanish. \\"I wish people would see that it was me that I was there.\\" The presenter said she believes in the existence of goblins. \\"It is ridiculous not to believe that there is a better world than the one we live in.\\" Xuxa also spoke of the possibility of filming two new versions of Xuxa and the Elves. \\"We thought of making the film into four parts.\\" But the new versions of the movie never happened. ==Critical reception== As well as the first sequel, Xuxa and the Elves 2 - On the way of the fairies received low acclaim from film criticism. Estadão website praised the technical part of the film \\"display a very appreciable care with the image.\\" but it was negative in relation to the plot \\"formatted to house speeches full of good intentions about the right to differences and the value of love - they are about ten of each, at least - it continues to doubt the spectator's intelligence. so that the sense is clear.\\" For critical Marcelo Hessel of the site Omelete, the film is the worst of the year, writing that \\"If the script already shows a little predictable, no problem: the basic function of the film is to teach friendship lessons in a way\\" If the original of 2001 had at least some technical quality, the continuation lacks visual and narrative defects, the stage set with cones, sparkles and smoke appears to be wrong. flying fairies seem to be taken from a junkyard commercial.\\" He also criticized the fate of the amorous romance of the Epiphany witch and the Daphnis elf, defining it as \\"prejudiced,\\" by \\"displaying the witch turned into a fairy.\\" In other words, interracial love is acceptable as long as one side ignores their cultural heritage.\\" and concluded that Xuxa and the Elves 2 is only a mockery of a funny joke. Faced with proper black humor, he laughed out loud. If it continues like this, the Queen children promises to invade another reign: it will compete with Ed Wood, the King Trash. Carla Nascimento writing for Folha, said that Xuxa returns to be the queen of the absurd, \\"Only a lot of courage explains the total absence of modesty to produce and sell a movie like \\"Xuxa and the Elves 2\\", which opens tomorrow in 300 rooms all over country. \\"Of course, such courage is driven by the market, which has accepted very well anything that bears the name of the\\" queen of the children\\".\\" For Rubens Ewald Filho from Uol, the film is \\"very bad\\", \\"Even High Definition (HDTV), has a grainy and poorly defined image (particularly in interior and night scenes). It has one of the most scandalous merchandisings in Film History Brazilian, who also has a sad past on the subject: not only an English school, but a cookie brand that is an entire and annoying commercial.And must have lacked money in production because everything is very ugly, art direction is horrible and very, very poor. (Look at the floor of the house of the witches, you can see the canvas badly adjusted.) The castle on fire seems something worthy of Ed Wood's tape\\". Celso Sabadin from the Cineclick site. also made a negative reception about the film, for him \\"It is not possible, in a clear conscience, to call the products made by Xuxa \\"film\\".\\" stating that \\"Nothing she does is cinema, it's just a bunch of loose frames with the sole purposes of selling merchandising, promoting the \\"celebrities\\" of the moment, and making money. That is, a Xuxa film can not be considered a bad movie because basically it's not a movie, it's an immense commercial on the big screen and in the dark room, it's the life philosophy of the hostess who, as everyone knows, did not bear a daughter, but rather released a product on the market: Sasha. And if she does it with her own daughter, just imagine it with a movie.\\" A critics of the Cineweb, website defined Xuxa and the Elves 2 \\"as an unfortunate sequence\\", and praised City of God for taking the leadership of Xuxa from Brazil's box office, because according to him \\"Brazilians shame\\" the problem for him is not in Xuxa starring in films but rather \\"the kind of films she makes.\\" The productions starring Xuxa and his band are nothing more than a heap of ostentatious commercials of products (chocolate, biscuit and so on) and artists linked in some way to their empire - built on a systematic exploration of products, insistently advertised on television and sold to a huge mass of innocent children, daughters of uninformed parents, inattentive, or both.\\" Lamenting that \\"Among the many attacks on intelligence and the aesthetic sense of the public, to adorn one of the most uncontested sex symbols of the country, Vera Fischer, under a weird make-up. For these and more, watching the film proves to be a more sadomasochistic experience than that of Dobby, the house elf of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, when he insists on self-flagellation, knocking himself on the walls and injuring himself\\" and ended up wishing that \\"Brazilian cinema produces more and better films, especially in the area of children and youth, and that self-esteem and the level of public demand rise to the same extent.\\" Edinho Pasquale critical \\"DVD Magazine\\" site, \\"The film is rough, with badly made cuts, a scenario that borders on ridicule, songs are few (still good) and the \\"special participation\\" of a constellation of actors of TV Globo, it does not make sense (some appear just to put the name on the credits). \\"He said he had never seen a makeup job\\" so badly done (Vera Fischer's can be even hilarious) and merchandising \\"Embedded in context\\") have become music video and movie scene!.” Juliana Lima writing for Cinefilos said that like \\"Elves 1\\", the sequel has a \\"predictable plot and the good wins in the end. But that is not the film's biggest problem, which suffers from a forced dramatization and characters who celebrate everything at all times, which is slightly irritating.\\" and finalized writing \\"that the film undoubtedly is a classic trash film that guarantees many laughs. Not for the bad jokes - which are saved only by the performance of prestigious figures such as Tadeu Mello and Cláudia Rodrigues - but for all the rest: the peculiar characterization of the characters, such as Vera Fischer's fairy queen; of special effects and scenarios that seem to be much older than they really are or the storyline itself.\\" ==Box office== Sequencing a hit movie was a bold decision, even if the model was working very well, it could generate wear and tear on the public. Following the release of Xuxa Requebra (1999) the Brazilian box office in 2000 with more than 2 million viewers, Xuxa Popstar (2000) became the most watched film in Brazil in 2001, with more than 2,394,326 viewers, the first being a national film was the box office leader in the country in a decade. In 2001 Xuxa and the Elves (2001) reached more than 2.5 million spectators and became the most viewed production of the country, until being surpassed by City of God in November 2002, that reached 3 million spectators, the film by Fernando Meirelles took the children's queen from the leadership she was accustomed to occupy for three consecutive years. Duendes 2 was then released with the aim of returning the lead in theaters to Xuxa. Duendes 2 had more than 2,301,152 box office sold according to Ancine, the film reached fifth place among the highest grossing domestic films of 2003, being the first time in three years that Xuxa did not reach the lead. being the thirteenth most watched film of 2003 in Brazil, with a gross of more than 11,486,623.00. ==Home media== The DVD was released on June 2003, Authorized by TeleImagem, the DVD offers options to watch the movie with or without tags, through the Pan-Scan mode, in addition to WebDVD - with exclusive movie content for computer, games and wallpaper - and option of viewing angles, feature already used, unprecedented in Brazil, in the first \\"Xuxa and the Goblins\\". It also has hidden bonuses, making of, music videos and interviews with production and cast. Of the games available, there are those that can be played on both the DVD and computer. Edinho Pasquale from the DVD Magazine site, considered the DVD well done, but the product bad. It consutarou the image is reasonable, the sound good, has the good feature of if you choose which screen format you want to watch, but still does not compare to the quality of the DVD of the first movie. It deserved more than the minimum score (2 stars) for the \\"effort and good ideas of the DVD (Pan and Scan, Multiangles, Extras that can be seen during the film)\\". What many \\"blockbusters\\" do not have in the market. If you have (very) small children or are ardent fan of Xuxa, go ahead. If you want to watch an unpretentious movie, do not choose this one. Not even worth it. Read a good book on rainy days. ==Other media== BraSoft Studios, a national program developer and graduate of Globo Brands, has produced a videogame based on the film Xuxa and the Elves 2. On the basis of the film of the same name, the player controls the character Xuxa, which is a fairy. The game features 10 stages that follow the original script of the film. ==References== == External links == * Category:Xuxa Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian adventure films Category:Brazilian children's films Category:Brazilian fantasy films Category:Fantasy adventure films Category:2000s romantic fantasy films Category:2000s children's fantasy films Category:Films about elves Category:Films shot in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Films using computer- generated imagery ","title":"Xuxa e os Duendes 2 - No Caminho das Fadas"},{"id":"56590904","text":"Mabini (Borja) is one of 14 Barangays of the municipality of Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands, Philippines, situated in the southwest portion of the province.Ma-atas, Dinagat Islands - Google Maps ==Education== The barangay hosts the Boja Elementary School which was established, January 01, 1984 and is part of the Dinagat Islands District.Boja Elementary School == References == == External links == * Province of Dinagat Islands - Official webpage * Borja Elementary School Category:Philippines geography stubs Category:Barangays of Dinagat Islands ","title":"Mabini, Cagdianao"},{"id":"56590913","text":"Diverge is a 2016 American sci-fi film written, directed, co-produced and co- edited by James Morrison in his directing debut. ==Plot== Chris Towne is a man living in a post-apocalyptic world, who is desperate to find a way to save his wife from death.

Fay was a wooden steamer built in 1871 Quayle and Martin at Cleveland, Ohio. At the time of launch, the Fay was the largest ship ever built in Cleveland. ==Description== The ship was 216 feet long, with a beam of 34 feet and a gross tonnage of 1221 tons.. It has a single screw propeller powered by a 28.5\\" by 36\\" direct acting high-pressure steam engine manufactured by Cleveland's Cuyahoga Iron Works, and twin tubular boilers measuring 6'10\\" by 17'3\\". In 1887, the engine was upgraded to a steeple compound steam engine and single scotch boiler. The Fay had a two-level aft cabin situated above the engine room and a pilothouse atop the forecastle. She had three masts used as an auxiliary propulsion system. ==History of the ship== Joseph S Fay, The schooner D. P. Rhodes was built as the Fay's consort, and the pair worked in tandem hauling iron ore. On October 17, 1905, the two ships departed from Escanaba, Michigan en route to Ashtabula, Ohio with a load of iron ore, and the Fay towing the Rhodes. On October 19, 1905, the Fay encountered a strong gale in northern Lake Huron. Hugging the shore in adverse wind conditions, the Fay came too close to the rocks at Forty Mile Point. The captain attempted to recover, pulling out into open water, but the maneuver snapped the towline, sending the Rhodes loose and taking part of the Fay's stern with it. The loose Rhodes eventually hit rocks Cheboygan. Aboard the Fay, the captain drove the ship ashore, grounding only 200 yards from the Forty Mile Point Light. At impact, the wheelhouse, deck, mate's and captain's rooms were ripped from the deck and carried it to shore with the captain and 10 crewmen safe inside. The first mate and two other crewmen were left on the ship; the mate eventually tried to swim ashore but drowned. After grounding, the Fay quickly broke apart. ==The wreck today== The lower hull of the ship, still containing a load of iron ore sits in shallow water not far from shore, while a large portion of the starboard side is located on the beach near the lighthouse. In the submerged portion, most of the hull remains intact, as does most of the steam propulsion machinery. The rudder, copper hull sheathing, keelsons, the portside engine mount, the propeller shaft assembly, and iron ore cargo are the most prominent items found on the lake bottom. On the shore, the section of the starboard side is 134 feet long, and features scarfed ceiling planking, paired frame sets, and hundreds of wood and iron fasteners. ==References== Category:1871 ships Category:Ships built in Cleveland Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Maritime incidents in 1905 Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Huron Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"SS Joseph S.

Adhesives are commonly used for structural joints in various applications. Adhesives offer light weight and cost efficient options in design of mechanical members. In many applications, adhesive joints are the main load bearing joint as well as acting as a sealant in a joint. As such, the ability of adhesives for long service life needs to be assessed and evaluated. This is done based on the long term performance information available regarding a particular adhesive of choice. One of the ways to obtain the long term performance of an adhesive is using accelerated tests. In these tests possible failure mechanisms of an adhesive system will be simulated in a manner that accelerates time. == Adhesive failure prediction == In general, service failures are predicted by accelerated tests in which parameters such as temperature, moisture, mechanical loading, etc. are increased in order to reduce the time to failure in the system under investigation. Adhesive systems are no exception to this method for predicting failures in the service environment that they are designed for. The issue with usage of accelerated testing in adhesives stems from their complexity and varied reaction to test condition(s). In other words, an accelerated test regime may induce reaction kinetics that is not applicable to the actual service environment of an adhesive.ASI Adhesives and Sealants, Simulating the aging of adhesives, Feb 1, 2008, Damian Ferrand, Fabian Kaser, Bertrand Roduit and Willi Schwotzer, == Adhesive stability == Desirable performance of an adhesive system throughout its service time and environment depends on its stability and ability to retain its properties throughout its service life. However, several reasons can be the reasons for breakdown of an adhesive bond and like other polymers, prediction of life is not an easy task. One of the main degrading conditions to stability of adhesives is oxidizing environments. Adhesives, like other polymers, react with oxygen easily even at low temperatures. Oxidation will cause the long polymer chains to break up and their molecular weight to decrease. This is a non-linear process and tends to approach a critical level below which the mechanical properties are significantly degraded. Different adhesive systems behave differently in regards to oxidation which means they age differently in an oxidizing environment; therefore, it is crucial to have a method of predicting the oxidation aging of an adhesive that is applicable to the actual service without producing unwanted stress factors. Use of temperature as an acceleration factor for polymers and adhesives may not be appropriate. This is due to possibilities of parallel reactions forming at high temperatures that otherwise would not exist at lower service environment. Traditionally, oxidation induction time (OIT) and/or oxidation onset temperature (OOT) methods are used to predict the behavior of a materials' oxidation. These properties are typically found using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). However, these options use elevated temperatures which limit their use for adhesives and polymers. In these tests, the samples are isothermally or non-isothermally heated and once exothermic heat is detected, OIT or OOT measurements are determined. In order to keep the duration of the tests short (under 2 hours), the testing temperature is raised above 180 °C. Basically, the test sample is heated then maintained at constant temperature for some time to stabilize. Oxygen/air is then applied and the time of application to beginning of oxidation is the “oxidation induction time” (OIT). As mentioned above, high temperature exposure may interfere with correlation of the measured data with actual in-service behavior of some adhesive systems. This makes the use these tests limited and at times, unreliable. This limitation makes alternate tests, which are conducted at lower temperature and collect the same data, more applicable to adhesive oxidation process. == Chemiluminescence (CL) == Production of artificial light can be done in two ways, incandescent light in which light is produced from an object “glowing” hot. Light can also be produced in “cold” manner by photons emitting from energizing electrons which are then grounded and release energy. The process of light emission followed by grounding of the electrons may be very fast. During certain chemical processes such as oxidation, electron excitation and grounding take place which result in production of luminescence. In chemiluminescence, light is emitted as oxidation reaction progresses and specific exited species are formed and subsequently grounded. In polymers, initially unstable Alkyl radicals are formed which react further with oxygen to form peroxy. This process is illustrated by “Russel mechanism”, in which the peroxy radicals (ROO) are relaxed to their grounded state, light is produced by emission of one photon to ground stage. The chemiluminescence light is produced in various wavelengths depending on the material under oxidation reaction. Generally the Chemiluminescence is in the short wave range, however, in some cases it is detected in infra-red (IR) region of light spectrum. Regardless of the emitted light wavelength, in Chemiluminescence the intensity of light is measured and is then correlated to the progression of the oxidation process. Chemiluminescence (CL) light intensity can be measured at various isothermal oxidation cycles; however, the temperature need not be raised to high levels. Correlation of light intensity is made to oxidation process parameters such as Oxidation Induction Temperature (OIT). By obtaining measurements at different temperatures, an accelerated oxidation progression correlation can be established. The prediction of oxidation during service life can then be carried out. == Advantages of chemiluminescence == Temperature plays a big role in behavior of polymers. Characteristics such as melting, softening, glass transition, etc. are all temperature basic factors in polymers. Some or all of these characteristics happen at low temperatures in some polymers and as mentioned before, tests that exceed these temperatures do not correlate well with actual service life of a part. One of the most important advantages of Chemiluminescence (CL) in studying the oxidation of polymers/adhesives is that, it does not need to be run at high temperatures. This makes the CL results more applicable to the oxidation rather than other secondary reactions. Instrumentation set up of CL tests, can be tailored to the material of use and the amount of sample needed is usually very small (fraction of the actual part). This last point, is mainly due to the reactions that lead to light emission intensity which is not related to mass of the sample. Predicting oxidation in a polymer/adhesive system using CL measurements has the potential to be very close to the actual service condition of the part. This is due to the higher sensitivity of CL over conventional differential scanning calorimetry (CDS) methods, hence no need to run the CL experiments in high temperatures. Instrumentation for CL measurements is self-contained and easy to set up and use. == References == Category:Adhesives Category:Chemical tests ","title":"Accelerated testing of adhesives"},{"id":"56591033","text":"Santa Rita is one of 14 Barangays of the municipality of Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands, Philippines, it is situated in the southeast portion of the province.Santa Rita, Dinagat Islands - Google Maps == References == == External links == * Province of Dinagat Islands - Official webpage Category:Philippines geography stubs Category:Barangays of Dinagat Islands ","title":"Santa Rita, Cagdianao"},{"id":"56591048","text":"Tigbao is one of 14 Barangays of the municipality of Cagdianao, Dinagat Islands, Philippines, it is situated in the southeast portion of the province.Tigbao, Dinagat Islands - Google Maps ==Education== The barangay hosts the Tigbao Elementary School which was established, January 01, 1970 and is part of the Dinagat Islands Division.Tigbao Elementary School == References == == External links == * Province of Dinagat Islands - Official webpage * Tigbao Elementary School Category:Philippines geography stubs Category:Barangays of Dinagat Islands ","title":"Tigbao, Cagdianao"},{"id":"56591054","text":"Patricia O.

She was the second woman in Sweden to run a library, preceded by Cecilia Cleve, and the first to found and run a commercial lending library. Born in Arboga, she was the daughter of tailor Johan Hjelmér and his wife Brita. Her father died in 1777 at the age of 44, and her mother died six years later at age 43. Little is known about her childhood. In 1801, she married the bookbinder Abraham Fredric Unander in Stockholm. They had one son, Conrad Fredric. Abraham died in 1816, leaving Eva as a widow and single mother, with debts twice as much as the value of her estate. In 1818, she opened a lending library in Södermalmstorg. Initially, she ran advertisements in the daily newspaper Daglig Allehanda to attract patrons. She eventually stopped these advertisements, possibly because the library had become well-established. The patron could set the amount of time for the loan. The cost varied based on the number of books and the amount of time that they were borrowed, starting with four skillings to borrow a book for a day. Other books were also accepted as a form of collateral. The National Library of Sweden retains nine printed directories from Unander's library; a tenth directory may have existed and been lost. Eva Greek and Heléne Rova analyzed the languages and subject areas available in Unander's library catalogue, in order to analyze the reading tastes of the contemporary public. The library contained mostly fictional works, with many translated from other languages such as German. ==References== * Du Rietz, Anita.

The Federal CIO's office is a part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Prior to her appointment, President Trump established the American Technology Council and issued a Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure (Executive Order 13800) establishing that it is \\"the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise.\\" This makes the Federal CIO's role in establishing IT policy supporting enterprise risk management more substantial than the role of her predecessors. On Thursday, June 25, 2020 she announced her retirement and subsequently left the office in July. The office remained vacant as of August 20, 2020. == Duties, authority and challenges == In this position, Kent was be responsible for setting federal IT policy and leading the Federal CIO Council, which is composed of CIOs from various federal government departments and agencies. Under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), federal agency program officials, chief information officers, and inspectors general (IGs) are required to conduct annual reviews of each agency's information security program and report the results to the OMB. The effectiveness of FISMA to date has been flawed by several high-profile security breaches in systems that should have been subject to regular FISMA reviews, for example the 2014 and 2015 Office of Personnel Management data breach. A key challenge for Kent was to reform past policies cited in Executive Order 13800 that have permitted agencies to default on their responsibility for protecting private information in their custody under FISMA. In 2017, the Office of Federal CIO released its Report to the President on Federal IT Modernizationhttps://itmodernization.cio.gov/assets/report/Report%20to%20the%20President%20on%20IT%20Modernization%20-%20Final.pdf stressing the need to prioritize modernization of high-risk high-value IT assets; modernize and manage Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) and the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) to enable cloud migration; and consolidate acquisition, management, and cyber-security service policies. The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security to work with the Federal CIO Council to implement enterprise level risk management that establishes a Security Operations Center to provide centralized visibility into the state of security on each agency's networks in order to manage and mitigate risks to agencies lacking the required expertise to implement FISMA requirements (as established by National Institutes of Standards and Technology.) == Education and career == Kent has an undergraduate degree in journalism from Louisiana State University.

Escape to Life is a book of essays jointly written by the German writers Erika and Klaus Mann (daughter and son, respectively, of Thomas Mann).

Deutsche Kultur im Exil (1939/1991), Arts In Exile It was originally published by Houghton Mifflin in the United States in English translation April 14, 1939; an expanded edition was published in German as Escape to Life. Deutsche Kultur im Exil in 1991. The German edition consisted largely of the original German-language texts, although a small portion of (about 5%) it had to be re- translated from English because the original texts were lost. The book, commissioned by Houghton Mifflin, was a sort of \\"Who's Who\\" of the German exile community. The authors, Erika and Klauss Mann were themselves in American exile at the time, having escaped Germany in 1933, shortly after the Reichstag fire. Their work was translated from German to English by the Scottish writer/publicist Mary Hottinger-Mackie. Many of the portrayed musicians, literary figures, artists, scientists and physicians frequented their father Thomas Mann's house. The original 375-page 1939 edition included illustrated biographies, anecdotes and character analyses of such German and Austrian exiles as Albert Einstein, Lion Feuchtwanger, Sigmund Freud, George Grosz, Ferdinand Kramer, Thomas Mann, Max Reinhardt, Arnold Schoenberg, Ernst Toller, Bruno Walter, and Stefan Zweig. One chapter, \\"Culture in the Third Reich,\\" dealt with cultural figures such as Gustaf Gründgens who had come to terms with Nazi Germany. The book remained unpublished in Germany, and in the German language, throughout the lifetime of its authors. In 1991, Edition Spangenberg (Munich) published a German-language version compiled by Heribert Hoven, who also wrote a foreword. A film Escape to Life - The Erika and Klaus Mann Story (2000, Andrea Weiss and Wieland Speck), a documentary with dramatized episodes, told the story of Erika and Klaus Mann.

In March 1939 Carpatho-Ukraine declared its independence from Czechoslovakia but it was almost immediately occupied by the Kingdom of Hungary. East Galicia and Western Volyn were annexed by the USSR from Poland in October 1939, then the Soviet Union annexed Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia from the Kingdom of Romania in July 1940, due to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In 1944 the Red Army moving to the west reconquered the territory of Western Ukraine that was occupied by Nazi Germany and its allies in 1941. The Soviet authorities faced considerable opposition from the local population during the restoration of the Soviet regime in these territories. At that time, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and the conspiratorial network of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) were operating actively in Western Ukraine. In March 1944, in response to the situation, the NKVD Operational Headquarters was set up in Rivne to combat the Ukrainian national liberation movement.THE FIGHT OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME AGAINST THE UKRAINIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT 1940s-1950s.

She taught sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987. She was interested in the effect of social structures on individuals, and much her work fell within medical sociology, role theory, and sociology of the family. == Early life and family == Rose Laub Coser was born on May 4, 1916, in Berlin, Germany. She is a daughter of Rachel Lea (Lachowsky) Loeb and Elias Laub, a polish printer and publisher. Her parents were passionate socialists and knew Rosa Luxemburg well. They named their first-born daughter Rose in honor of Luxemburg. Coser grew in a socialist environment upheld by her parents. In 1924, the family moved to Antwerp, Belgium. In Antwerp, Rose Laub lost her younger sister to an accidental death. Then, due to the Nazi threat, the Laubs emigrated to New York City, U.S. in 1939. Rose Laub married Lewis A. Coser on August 25, 1942. Coser was a refugee who shared a common commitment to socialism with Laub and later became a noted sociologist. Laub and Coser bore two children, Ellen Coser Perrin, who later became a professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Steven Coser, who later became a computer scientist. == Education == Rose Laub Coser studied philosophy at the École Libre des Hautes Étude, which is a Parisian institution that relocated to the New School for Social Research in New York City during the Nazi years. She began to work in the field of psychology by assisting researches of psychoanalyst and experimental child psychologist René Spitz and working for David Riesman on his study of political apathy, called The Lonely Crowd (1950) and Faces in The Crowd (1952). She then attended Columbia University with Robert S. Lynd, a later professor at Columbia University, and Robert K. Merton, a later professor at Harvard University. She studied sociology with her husband, Lewis A. Coser. In 1957, Coser earned Ph.D under the supervision of Robert K. Merton, when he was a sociology professor at Harvard University. == Contribution == Coser made a number of contributions in many of the institutions she worked at. Her work at the Harvard University Medical School brought on a number of papers, including \\"Laughter Among Colleagues,\\" which was about humor's social functions in mental hospitals, \\"Evasiveness as a Response to Structural Ambivalence,\\" and a book, Training in Ambiguity: Social Structure and Professional Socialization in a Mental Hospital. Coser's major contributions fall within the areas of medical sociology, role theory, sociology of the family, and contemporary gender issues (both within family and the occupational world). Her contributions to medical sociology began at the start of her career. She completed case studies on the effects that bureaucratic organization of medical work affected patients and staff in mental and medical hospitals. Playing on Merton's role theory, Coser focused on the concepts of ambiguity and multiplicity. She was an advocate for the “liberating potential of a broad modern world.” Coser redefined important concepts within role theory and applied them the role of women in the family and workplace. Coser was a passionate feminist, and launched a class-action lawsuit against SUNY, for the recoupment of wages among female faculty and staff. She has served in important positions within the Society of Social Problems and the Eastern Sociological Society. Rose Coser published many works within the fields of medical sociology, sociology of the family, and gender roles. In her book The Family: Its Structures and Functions, discusses the universality of the family structure as well as how these structures may differ depending on the society in which they exist. Her work in this book also included her ideas on the relationship between society and the family, the way that the family shapes individuals whose behaviors and attitudes are appropriate for the society in which they reside, and she even has work on alternative structures of family and the role of women in the family. She was a co-founder of the journal Dissent with Irving Howe and Lewis A. Coser, and frequently published in it. Though she was not particularly religious, Coser's Jewish background allowed her to make several contributions to and fill many gaps in literature on Jewish women. === Role theory === Coser's work on role theory, which built on the work of her mentor, Robert K. Merton, demonstrates how people in modern society may take on multiple statuses and the roles that are attached to them, thus creating a wide social repertoire. However, according to Coser, women have historically been restricted from the acquisition of multiple and diverse roles, suffering more physical confinement and political, occupational restrictions, compared to men. In her classic paper written with Lewis A. Coser, \\"Stay Home Little Sheba: On Placement, Displacement, and Social Change (1974),\\" she displays how the \\"greedy institution\\" of the family has restricted participation of women in public life and argues that denying public policies of women's access to institutionalized child reinforces social and political subordination. The bulk of Coser's contribution within role theory is represented in Social Rules and Social Institutions, a collection of works in honor of Rose Coser. In one of these essays, \\"The Complexity of Roles as a Seedbed of Individual Autonomy,\\" Coser brings together the ideas of Robert K. Merton, Ferdinand Toennies, and George Simmel within the topic of complex versus simple role- sets. Rose Coser's work has brought together the theories and ideas of different sociologists. [For example, Lewis Coser, Peter Blau, and Helena Znancieka Lopata on role-theory; Gladys Rothbell (role of housewife); Cynthia Fuchs Epstein (roles of women in law); Jeffrey Rosenhold (\\"role-complexity and patterns of inheritance\\"); William D'Antonio (immigration of Jewish Italian women and families); Arlene Daniels (privileged women); Helga Nowotny (women the field of science); Nancy Chodrow (female psychoanalysts); Ellen Coser Perrin and James Perrin (physicians and their training); and Donald Light (protection of role in medicine).] == Works == Coser was a prominent sociologist who could expand and reconceptualize theoretical frameworks. She pushed and deconstructed paradigms of functional theory, role theory, and modernism to explain complex processes. Her work was always driven theoretically, and even with those substantive, she could evoke the patterned behaviors and institutional frameworks of issues that she dealt with: she crafted and refined institutional analysis, provided conceptual tools for the dissection of social problems. After receiving her Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia University, Rose Coser worked there as a research associate. She then moved on to do research at the University of Chicago. In 1951, Coser first was an instructor and then became an assistant professor at Wellesley College where she stayed for eight years before moving on to the department of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School as a research associate. After her time at Harvard, Coser became an associate professor at Northeastern University. In 1968, both Lewis and Rose Coser became professors at the State University of New York (SUNY) and worked there until retirement.

It is operated by the National Nuclear Research Institute, a sub-division of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission. The reactor is a commercial version of the Chinese Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) design. The reactor had its first criticality on December 17, 1994. == Description == GHARR-1 is a light water reactor with a maximum thermal power of 30 kW. Beryllium is used as a reflector and the reactor is cooled by natural convection. Low enriched fuel is used, although the reactor was initially designed for 90.2% enriched uranium. The reactor core has 347 fuel rods. The reactor is mainly used as a research tool, including for neutron activation analysis and reactor physics experiments. Research has indicated that GHARR-1 could be used to produce the radionuclide Technetium-99 in the future. It is also used for education of university students at the University of Ghana School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences. == Conversion to low enriched uranium == The miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR) design originally operated with high enriched uranium (HEU), typically 90% uranium-235 or greater. In 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) developed a Collaborative Research Project (CRP) and eventually a MNSR working group to coordinate conversion to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, typically defined as lower than 20% Uranium-235. HEU is associated with increased proliferation risks, as it can be more easily diverted to non-peaceful uses of atomic energy than LEU. The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission is a member of the MNSR working group, and has successfully transitioned GHARR-1 to low enriched fuel. Ghana was the first country outside of China to successfully convert their MNSR reactor to LEU. The HEU core was removed in August 2016 and the operation was completed in 2017. The original nuclear fuel was UAl4 with Al-303-1 cladding while the new LEU fuel is uranium dioxide at 13% enrichment with Zircaloy-4 cladding. == See also == * Nuclear energy in Ghana * Research reactor * Miniature neutron source reactor == References == Category:Nuclear energy in Ghana Category:Nuclear research reactors Category:1994 establishments in Ghana Category:Buildings and structures in Accra ","title":"Ghana Research Reactor-1"},{"id":"56591729","text":"Evie Shockley is an American poet.

He teaches photography at the European Institute of Design in Milan and is a visiting professor at the School of Visual Arts in New York. == Education == Wolf studied Philosophy and Psychology in Italy and Photography and Visual Arts at the London College of Printing, where he received the Higher Diploma in Advanced Photography. == Career == === Early Work === > \\"Silvio Wolf is one of those rare European artists of the latest generation, > who have based their creative work entirely on experimentation involving the > technical nucleus of the resources of photography.

In his work, Wolf constantly approaches the point where > photography is no longer the creation of a mirror image of reality, the > capturing of an image in the speed of an instant, but the close up > exploration of how images themselves form and appear.\\" > \\\\- Vittorio Fagone From 1977-1987 Wolf explored and studied the laws, language, and two- dimensional nature of the image. During this time Wolf met the conceptual artist Franco Vaccari, whose impact on Wolf’s work can be traced back to the idea of merging the analytical elements of his imagery with phenomenological factors.Angela Madesani, \\"Problemi di Luogo\\" exhibition catalogue, Lorenzelli Arte, Milan 2000 In the early 1980s Wolf traveled to the Middle East, where he encountered the Islamic vision of space, in which images are in which images are transposed in codes and geometries, containing the concepts of the infinite and the void. These aspects resonated with Wolf, leading him to develop through the series Architectures (1981-2008) those concepts that would become the visual and symbolic cornerstones of his entire research: the ideas of “absence,” “elsewhere, and the “threshold.\\" One of his earliest and most seminal works, The Two Doors (1980), shows a Moorish-style door that opens to another door, forming a dark and unreadable zone between them. According to Giorgio Verzotti, this small area is actually “the darkness that allows the perception of light and thus vision and the visual.” === Light, Time, and the Threshold === Though Wolf has developed his practice through a plurality of languages, “light,” “time” and “the threshold” are fundamental themes in his artistic inquiries. Icons of Light (1993-2007) are the result of a simultaneous process of generation and destruction: the very light that generates the photographic image destroys the painted one. Of the original paintings, only the perspective frame and the painted surface remain visible, while the light employed in the capture process materializes as the actual subject of representation. The Icons are spatial bodies on which perception constantly wavers between two-dimensional surfaces and three-dimensional forms, between here and elsewhere. Light Wave is a site-specific installation presented at the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009. By capturing long exposures of the light radiated by a film projector without the use of a tripod, the bodily vibrations of Wolf’s breathing and hand, as well as the numerous film frames, were absorbed into a single image. In establishing an intimate relationship between time and light, Wolf questions the notion of time. In this sense, time becomes the critical element that not only gives identity to the image but also the chance to densely materialize it. For Wolf, in photography, the term abstraction indicates \\"the abstraction from the river of time”. In his series Horizons (2006-2014) each Horizon is defined as a “scripture of light” self- generated by the camera when light reaches the film while loading the camera. Photochemically inscribed where the black of lightlessness breaks into bands and fields of reds, oranges, yellows, and white- which contains all possible color, where exposed, the result is the visible form of a coincidence among time exposure, light radiation, environment conditions and chance. Stripped of all external subject matter, the actual object of these photographs is the language of photography itself, not signifying the given but the possible, the embrace of all possible images. === Mirrors === In his most recent works, the back-lit black mirrors of Meditations (2009-2016), and ink-jet prints on highly reflective mirrored surfaces of Mirror Thresholds (2006-2014) and Shivah (2014), Wolf focuses on the experiential realm: shifting attention and displacing meaning away from the image and towards the he-she who sees. These mirrored works are produced by the absence of information, or in some cases by its excess, where the surface is devoid of an image it generates light and reflection, simultaneously representing what lies inside and outside the work. The viewer is standing on the threshold, in the mirror surface that shows us, the viewer, reflected elsewhere in another virtual, but extremely real space. Jacqueline Ceresoli has written, “Wolf’s inscriptions of light materialize the perceptive experience and go beyond the contemplative aspect to generate emotional and cognitive sensations together, because everything happens the moment one looks at them. Through photographs, that are conceptual objects, the possible relations not of things, but of the signifier and the signified as Saussure would define them, are investigated.” === Installations and Public Art === The practice of installations also constitutes a significant part of Wolf’s artistic career. With Great Western Wall (1987) Wolf began to develop a new way of thinking about photography and space , moving away from the two- dimensional format and extending his practice to the third dimension, creating experiential site-specific works that openly challenged the boundaries of perception, making use of light, sound, projections and the moving image. Frequently the locations Wolf intervenes in possess rich histories, taking as his starting point the traces and signs found in a given place. He collects them and elaborates the project away from the site, in his studio; then he brings back the processed signs to their place of origin, to create new relations and visions in the form of an installation. According to the curator Cristina Casero, “in these projects, as in all of the artist’s output, light plays a fundamental role and is an active element, rich with symbolic intensity and communicative power, capable of concretely determining an elsewhere, an abstraction not seen as an escape from the real, but as its deeper, sublimated and at the same time open interpretation.” == Exhibitions == Wolf's exhibitions and temporary and permanent installations have been presented in galleries, museums and public spaces in Belgium, Korea, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. He has participated, among other shows, in New Image 1980 in Milan, Aktuell ’83 in Munich, Documenta VIII in 1987 in Kassel, the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009 and at Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea in Milan in 2011. Wolf's work is in collections in North America and Europe, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Civico Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Milan; the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern, Valencia; and the Centre Canadien d’Architecture, Montreal. == Selected books == * Light Specific, Brescia: ed.

The club had previously considered options in the West Valley City area and planned an 8,000-seat stadium at the Utah State Fairpark until negotiations in the state government fell apart. Construction began in August 2016 and the academy's charter school opened in August 2017. The charter school, built to serve players and residents of nearby areas, focuses on a STEM cirriculum and includes an on-site dormitory. Real Salt Lake and Real Monarchs began using the indoor training facilities in January 2018, replacing preseason camps held in California and Arizona. Due to the stadium's proximity to the academy's charter school, away, it was unable to obtain a liquor license and was not initially able to serve alcoholic beverages. Under state laws, the license cannot be issued to businesses whose entrance is within of a school. In response, Real Salt Lake relocated the entrance to the northwest corner, at a cost of $250,000, and received a license from the state liquor commission. The stadium also features a 166-kilowatt array of solar panels on its roof. The first sporting event at the stadium, a Utah Warriors match against the Prairie Wolf Pack, took place on April 20 and was attended by 3,143 people. Real Monarchs played their first home match on April 30, a scoreless draw against Las Vegas Lights FC that was attended by 4,065 spectators. ==Other events== ===Soccer=== In June and July 2020, Zions Bank Stadium and Rio Tinto Stadium will host the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup, a special competition to begin the National Women's Soccer League's 2020 season after it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wheeler was the first black American to practice law in the state of Illinois and was influential in the establishment of Provident Hospital of Cook County — a medical facility still extant in the 21st century. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Lloyd Garrison Wheeler was born May 29, 1848 in Mansfield, Ohio. His father was active in the underground railroad movement, providing secret accommodations for escaping slaves from the Southern United States en route to freedom in Canada.William H. Pruden III, \\"Lloyd Garrison Wheeler (1848-1909),\\" in Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture, Last updated Feb. 19, 2015. With the illegalization of underground railroad activity the family moved to Chatham, Ontario, Canada, and it was there that Wheeler attended school. Following the death of his mother, the 11-year old Wheeler returned to the United States, settling in Chicago, where he would work in a variety of jobs. Gaining a position as the first black mail carrier in Chicago, Wheeler took advantage of his free time to begin studying for a career in law, reading in the office of local attorney George Bellows. Wheeler gained admission to Union College of Law, a forerunner of the Northwestern School of Law, and in 1869 passed the Illinois state bar examination to become a practicing attorney. He was the first black American admitted to the bar in the state of Illinois.\\"Obituary: Lloyd Garrison Wheeler,\\" Chicago Tribune, Aug. 31, 1909, pg. 4. ===Legal career=== Wheeler moved South from Illinois to Arkansas. In 1870, he was a delegate to the Arkansas Republican state convention and by the following year had been admitted to the Arkansas state bar. In 1872 he was a Presidential elector for Republican candidate Ulysses S. Grant. Wheeler worked briefly in private practice with another attorney before departing to take a position as county attorney for Pulaski County. Wheeler would remain in that position until 1873. Following his stint as county attorney, Wheeler returned to private legal practice before gaining a seat on the Pulaski County Board of Commissioners. The collapse of Reconstruction in 1877 and the growth of white terrorism in the form of the Ku Klux Klan spelled an end for Wheeler's political and legal career in Arkansas, and in 1879 Wheeler abandoned the state to return to the growing city of Chicago. He was active in the Illinois state militia, rising to the rank of Major. In Chicago Wheeler left the legal profession to take a job as a financial manager for wealthy investor John Jones, shortly before the latter's death.Christopher Robert Reed, All the World Is Here!: The Black Presence at White City. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2000; pg. 86. Wheeler would make a career of managing Jones' various commercial and real estate interests on behalf of the family, eventually marrying one of Jones' nieces, the former Ranie Petit. Together the couple would have seven children. Wheeler associated with the monied upper crust of black society in Chicago. This enabled him to engage in philanthropic fundraising, and he was influential in helping establish Provident Hospital of Cook County — a medical enterprise which survived into the 21st century. A friend of Booker T. Washington since the 1880s, in 1901 Wheeler came to Washington's aid by establishing the Chicago chapter of the National Negro Business League.J. Clay Smith, Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999; pg. 370. By 1903, with faltering businesses, Wheeler was ready to accept Washington's offer to move back South again, this time to Tuskegee, Alabama to manage the finances of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School. In addition to the handling of business affairs for the Institute, Wheeler also served as the superintendent of the school building and its campus. ===Death and legacy=== While at Tuskegee Wheeler's health began to decline, and he died there on August 28, 1909. He was 61 years old at the time of his death. ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * J. Clay Smith, Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five dark purplish-black and green flowers. It grows in heath in scattered places in the Sydney basin. ==Description== Corunastylis trifida is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and twenty five dark purplish-black and green flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long. The flowers lean downwards slightly and are long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is long and about wide with hairless edges and darker coloured bands. The lateral sepals are about long and about wide, with a humped base and a sharply pointed tip. The petals are about long and about wide with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The labellum is egg-shaped, about long and wide, thick and fleshy. There is a broad, tapering callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from January to April. ==Taxonomy and naming== The blackish midge orchid was first formally described in 1941 by Herman Rupp who gave it the name Prasophyllum trifidum and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. The specimen was collected near Castlecrag. In 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis trifida. The specific epithet (trifida) is a Latin word meaning \\"three-cleft\\", referring to the shape of the column.

He was educated at the Canterbury University School of Fine Arts in Christchurch, the Auckland Teachers' College, and the University of Auckland Elam School of Fine Arts. In the 1960s he spent some time as an Auckland high school art teacher. In 1978–79 Nicholls completed a Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, and in 1979 he became a Lecturer in Sculpture at the Otago Polytechnic School of Art in Dunedin, New Zealand, a position he held until 2001.

The Dunedin Public Art Gallery presented Journeywork, a major retrospective of Nicholls's career, in 2008. == Career == Nicholls first gained critical notice in the early 1970s with Probe, a series of large, outdoor works that used native kanuka timber to evoke the old log fences of rural New Zealand. Works from the series were displayed in 1972 outside the Osborne Gallery in Auckland and in 1973 at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial. According to art critic Jodie Dalgleish, \\"The Probe series had subtly begun to explore what would become Nicholls's central interest in an artistically motivated kind of physics concerned with the matter, energy, motion and force of sculptural structure and its interactions with natural and cultural forces.\\"Jodie Dalgleish, \\"Sitings of Place in the Sculpture of Peter Nicholls, 1971–2010,\\" The Journal of New Zealand Art History 31 (2010), 22.

He was the general inspector of the nation from September 1987 until he was kidnapped and assassinated by hitmen under orders of Medellín Cartel. == Biography == Hoyos was a lawyer from Medellín University, specialising in constitutional law. During his public life, he worked for the Judiciary of Colombia and was a member of the Colombian Liberal Party. He also was a municipal judge and councilman for the town El Retiro. At the departamental ambit, he was a deputy, treasurer and Comptroller for the department Antioquia; he also was a Representative in the Colombian Congress several times and general secretary of the Colombian Liberal Party. On September 17, 1987, Carlos Mauro Hoyos took office as the general inspector of the nation, after being elected by the Senate of Colombia. He began his position at one of the Colombian History's most critical times, due to the increasing terrorist threat by narco-traffic, headed by Pablo Escobar. During his administration as the general inspector of the nation, Hoyos had a close relationship with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which made him a target of the cartel. == Kidnapping and death == This criminal plot began a week earlier, on January 19, 1988, when the then candidate for Bogotá Mayorship and future Colombian president Andrés Pastrana Arango was kidnapped at his campaign house in Bogotá. A week later, on January 25, 1988, Carlos Hoyos was kidnapped when he was being driven to the Airport José María Córdoba of Rionegro after having visited Medellín. His bodyguards Jorge Enrique Loaiza and Gonzalo Villegas were killed, while the general inspector ended up wounded and taken by the kidnappers to a ranch near the zone. As a reaction, Colombian Army deployed military sweeping operations on the zone. Around 11:30 a.m., a group of police men arrived to inspect a ranch in the zone El Retiro, where coincidentally Andrés Pastrana was being kept in captivity. A police man offered himself to take the position of Andrés in order to facilitate his liberation and, at the same time, to guarantee the kidnappers to take flight. Nevertheless, minutes later, when Pablo Escobar learned about what had happened with Pastrana, he ordered his men to kill the general inspector Carlos Mauro Hoyos as a way to discourage the triumph of the government and give credit to the cartel. According to Jhon Jairo Velásquez alias Popeye - then hitman of Pablo Escobar - Hoyos was kidnapped since Escobar wanted to have him politically judged on the grounds of treason. Such accusation was based on Escobar being informed on Hoyos being allegedly bribed by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to approve the extradition of Colombian citizens to the United States, while also receiving money from Escobar to abolish it. Furthermore, Popeye stated that Hoyos, being wounded, was captured, taken away and hidden in a ranch located at the east of Antioquia, where he then was guarded by three men. Because of the deployed military sweeping operations on the zone, Escobar would order Popeye to kill him. Hence Popeye would put on a sweater and glasses, get in an old Jeep, which previously he had filled with books and medicine, and drive to the zone. On the road, there would be a military checkpoint that made him stop the car. Popeye then would claim that he was a student and that was in a hurry to get to a nearby ranch because a sick relative needed the medicine with urgency. His convincing story would let him get through the military checkpoint. Upon arriving at the ranch, Popeye would explain Hoyos the reason of his kidnapping and let Hoyos know that he would be executed immediately, since his trial had to be brought on earlier because of the military operations on the zone. Velásquez himself then would kill Hoyos by shooting him three times, take his body and abandoned it near a dried riverbed, near where Andrés Pastrana was being kept in captivity. According to Juan Pablo Escobar, Pablo Escobar's son, in his book, his father put the kidnapping of Carlos Mauro Hoyos in motion in order to put more pressure on the Colombian State. Furthermore, he tired of waiting for Hoyos to make a pronouncement against the extradition; Pablo and Hoyos had once talked about it in private and Hoyos had promised to make such declaration. Pablo delegated this kidnapping to Pinina, who then recruited six of his best men to carry it out. During the action, a shootout ensued, resulting in Hoyos's bodyguards killed, one of the Pinina's men, alias Pitufo, severely wounded and Hoyos also wounded in a leg. Because of the deployed military operation on the zone and the Pastrana's rescue, Pablo ordered Pinina to kill Hoyos as a way to discourage the triumph of the government and give credit to the Cartel. Therefore, Pinina killed him by shooting him eleven rounds. In 1991, David Ricardo Prisco Lopera, leader of the gang Los Priscos, also was accused of the murder of Carlos Mauro Hoyos, and other criminal acts. === Funeral === The day of his funeral, the song “Soy colombiano” was played, since it was one of his favourites, while his acquaintances recounted he liked drinking \\"aguardiente\\" and hearing music in the bars of his hometown El Retiro (Antioquia). His body was buried in the cemetery Campos de Paz. == Reactions == The reaction of the government of Virgilio Barco was issuing a severe anti- terrorism penal regimen that was named Statute for Defending the Democracy. At the same time, the government promised that the crime would not go unpunished. However, this was just the starting point of a narcoterrorist continuous period perpetuated by Pablo Escobar Gaviria and his henchmen to stain Colombia with blood. == Media == In 2012, the Colombian private channel Caracol Televisión premiered the series Pablo Escobar, The Drug Lord, inspired by the life of Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellín Cartel.

Mbalwa is approximately , by road, southeast of Kira Town Hall. This is approximately , by road, north-east of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda.

The plant was built to centralize wastewater treatment, instead of sending it to the 22 treatment plants that used to exist in the Sacramento Area. The SRWTP employs approximately 350 people, treats approximately 127 million gallons of effluent daily for over 1.4 million people in Elk Grove, Sacramento, Citrus Heights, Folsom, and Rancho Cordova. It was later renamed Regional Sanitation as it continues upgrades to meet new state standards. ==Process== The process that SRWTP uses to treat its wastewater takes many steps and requires aid from other agencies. The Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD) uses its web of underground pipes to send influent from homes and businesses lateral lines to the main sewer line where it will then flow to various trunk lines. These trunk lines flow the influent directly to SRWTP and it will only take approximately 8 hours to process and treat the incoming waste. The first process of primary sedimentation settles material to the bottom, where after removal of most of the waste, Oxygen is added to allow microscopic organisms to break down and digest wastewater particles. After these steps, secondary clarifiers will remove the microscopic organisms that settle on the bottom of the tanks, and then chlorine is added to the water to assure harmful contaminants are removed. The effluent will finally leave the plant and travel two miles to be discharged into the Sacramento River, near Garcia Bend, and to neutralize the chlorine, SRWTP adds sulfur dioxide before the wastewater enters the river and comes in contact with aquatic life. == EchoWater project == The Central Valley Regional Water Control Board is requiring the project to meet discharge requirements of all treatment plants in the state by 2023, hence the EchoWater Project. According to Industry Tap the project name comes from the idea that \\"just like sound waves echo back to their original source,\\" so too will SRWTP's water entering the Sacramento River. The EchoWater Project construction started on May 28, 2015 and although required completion date is by 2023 SRWTP is hoping to achieve this before then and is on track with a 2021 finish. Upon the completion of the project, discharged ammonia levels should be reduced approximately 95%, therefore increasing the water quality, the ability to recycle water, and survival rates of the nearly extinct Delta Smelt. Ammonia, nitrates, and other pathogens will be removed through the addition of hypochlorite, sodium bisulphite, and filtering and disinfection layers that will improve the discharged water to a tertiary status that can then be used for landscaping, agriculture, and power plants. Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) and a Return Activated Sludge systems are other new additions that will also enhance water quality and have a price tag of approximately $500 M. The EchoWater Projects consists of 12 projects that are primarily funded by California’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund that contributed $1.6 B and the State Water Resources Control Board. Monetary aide from these two entities will save Sacramento area customers from high interest costs to their monthly bill statements. When the project first began in 2010, monthly bills were projected to increase to at least $60 per month, now that number has drastically shrunk to only $39 per month in 2021. EchoWater is the largest project in the history of Sacramento, even surpassing the Sacramento International Airport and new Golden 1 Center Arena in cost. == Biosolids management program == SRWTP is one of the state’s main contributors of biosolids, also known as treated effluent, and processes a staggering 26,000 dry tons every year. This recycled waste goes into everyday products and is used for soil enhancement. Wastewater is high in N, K, P, and other nutrients which makes it a successful fertilizer, and it also aides in moisture retention and reduces erosion. According to CalRecycle, there are three classifications of biosolid: Class A, Class B, and exceptional quality (EQ). Class A biosolids are pathogen free when added to the soil whereas Class B biosolids may contain minimal amounts of pathogens that will die when in they come into contact with the soil. Effluent has been used for this purpose for much of America’s history (night soil). SRWTP provides community education and public outreach to share how the use of biosolids is a great practice in sustainability and reduces human footprint. == The Bufferlands == SRWTP bought the ‘Bufferlands’ in 1970 which entails 2,150 acres surrounding the plant to minimize odors and act as a buffer zone. This area contains both uplands and wetlands and supports native birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, as well as some of California’s endangered species, and in 2017 a rare albino deer was even spotted at the site. Cattle grazing is also used as a control method for vegetation which allows creatures such as burrowing owls and other native flora and fauna to thrive. Since its creation the Bufferlands riparian forests have doubled which provides a sanctuary for coyotes, hawks, snakes, and other species in a rapidly expanded city. SRWTP provides many opportunities for volunteer and community involvement where nature lovers may assist on current and future restoration projects in the Bufferlands. One such day is the national Migratory Bird Day where they host an event called 'A Walk on the Wild Side' and activities include hiking, live animal presentations, tours, exhibits, and music from the Side-Wheeler String Band. During this event people can also use binoculars to view rare great blue heron, great egret, and double crested cormorant rookeries. According to the scientific article \\"Habitat Restoration and Bird Responses at the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District Bufferlands,\\" in 1990 approximately 5 or 6 great blue heron and great egret nests were found on site, but since 2002 these two species have grown to over 100 nests each year. Another species of bird found at the Bufferlands, but does not reside there, is the canvasback duck that once disappeared but now migrates to this region once again. == Studies == A 2017 study from Kraus et al. concluded that phytoplankton declines were not due to Regional San and was from another source (i.e. non-native clams, climate change). A 2014 study from Hasenbein et al. concluded that ammonia from SRWTP was not the only contaminant affecting the spawning of Delta smelt. SRWTP is also currently aiding 4 large USGS studies on the Sacramento River to gather information and learn the effect the plant and its discharge has on the river and riparian habitats. == References == * Category:Sewage treatment plants in California Category:Sacramento, California Category:1982 establishments in California Category:Elk Grove, California Category:Buildings and structures in Sacramento County, California ","title":"Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant"},{"id":"56592380","text":"Most Rev.

It is the 30th overall episode of the series and is written by Brian Reich and directed by Ken Whittingham. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 23, 2014. It's the seventh episode of the season to be produced but it's the eighth to be broadcast. The show revolves around the fictional 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Rosa is leading a task force focusing on the \\"Giggle Pig\\" drug and enlists Jake to participate in the operation. Unfortunately, they also need to work with United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and are partnered with Agent Jack Danger, a very incompetent person. Meanwhile, Holt and Terry seek to help Amy overcome her cigarette addiction. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.04 million household viewers and gained a 1.5/4 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Ed Helms' guest performance, the cast and the writing in particular and noting it as one of the show's best episodes. ==Plot== Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) is leading a task force on \\"Giggle Pig\\" drug operations and asks Jake (Andy Samberg) to participate in the force but asks him and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) to get help from the USPIS. Terry (Terry Crews) begins to note Amy (Melissa Fumero) acting strangely and soon finds that she has a tobacco addiction due to stress. Terry tries to help her overcome it with the same techniques he used for his overeating addiction but fails. Holt (Andre Braugher) and Gina (Chelsea Peretti) also try to help her with a meditation but she still fails to pass it. Holt manages to make her see that she's just being extremely perfectionist and tells her she should reconsider her issues. Jake and Boyle visit USPIS Agent Jack Danger (Ed Helms), who is self-righteous and incompetent, believing the NYPD is inferior to USPIS. During an investigation where the drug is supplied through mailboxes, Danger's ineptitude stops Jake from catching a supplier. When Danger refuses to lend them a list with the suspects unless they go with their methods, Jake and Boyle steal the list and arrest the supplier. However, their actions receive punishment as their case is handed to USPIS. Jake decides to apologize to Danger, who accepts to hand back the case. The Nine-Nine and USPIS lead a raid into a drug ring and arrests everyone inside although Danger knocks himself out on the entrance. ==Reception== ===Viewers=== In its original American broadcast, \\"USPIS\\" was seen by an estimated 3.04 million household viewers and gained a 1.5/4 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 33% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.53 million viewers with a 2.2/5 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney, Bob's Burgers and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and sixth for the night, behind The Simpsons, Madam Secretary, American Music Awards of 2014, Football Night in America, and NBC Sunday Night Football. ===Critical reviews=== \\"USPIS\\" received critical acclaim from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" grade and wrote, \\"As it turns out, all Brooklyn Nine-Nine needed to get back into the swing of things is to up the penis and butt jokes. That's mostly true of life too. 'USPIS' is an episode that's full of such simple — on paper — juvenile humor, and it's the strongest episode of the season for it.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"As much as I enjoyed the time spent with Danger, 'USPIS' gets most of its energy from the clash between Diaz and Jake. He's mad that he has to work with Danger. She's mad that he's making her task force look bad. The plot's an interesting look at how workplace friendships get twisted by shifts of power — they used to be equals, and now they have to recognize that they aren't — but it moves too quickly to fully register.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"USPIS's reinterpretation of 'going postal' as a positive ('Maury went postal and brought in muffins for everyone!'), and Peralta's hilarious apology to Danger ('I'm sorry I said The Postman was a flop. I'm sorry I said that Forever stamps are a lie, because the Earth will eventually be swallowed by the sun') were among the many highlights. When it comes to delivering consistent laughs, this episode is proof positive that B99 is better than any Robocop.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"'USPIS' is a classical type of sitcom episode, one that's built around a beloved guest star coming in to do his schtick while all the regular characters react to him doing it. But what happens when the guest and/or his schtick aren't so beloved anymore?\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 9.0 and wrote, \\"If 'USPIS' stumbles, it's in the rushed climax, where we actually get to see about thirty seconds of cop action, as Diaz leads the charge to crack down on some Giggle Pig peddlers. But we don't watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine for the same reasons we watch, say, The Shield. We watch it for punchlines and for love of the Nine-Nine's officers. 'USPIS' emphasizes both wonderfully, while advancing Brooklyn Nine-Nines diegesis. This isn't just a bounce back from 'Lockdown,' it's a high point for the season.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2014 American television episodes Category:Brooklyn Nine- Nine (season 2) episodes ","title":"USPIS (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56592497","text":"Andrew Fitzgerald (born December 10, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for Bambitious Nara in Japan.https://bambitious.jp/news/detail/id=14568 He played college basketball for Oklahoma University. == Career statistics == -  align=\\"left\\"  2015-16  align=\\"left\\"  Kanazawa 50 4  23.1 .526  .200 .773  6.6  1.0  .6 .2  16.3 -  align=\\"left\\"  2016-17  align=\\"left\\"  Kanazawa 50   21.2 .558  .000 .784  7.3  1.2  .6 .4  16.2 -  align=\\"left\\"  2017-18  align=\\"left\\"  Kanazawa 60 60  28.1 .553  .000 .722  8.8  2.1  .8 .4  20.4 - ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in France Category:American expatriate basketball people in Japan Category:American expatriate basketball people in Poland Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Maryland Category:Ehime Orange Vikings players Category:Kanazawa Samuraiz players Category:Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Sportspeople from Baltimore ","title":"Andrew Fitzgerald (basketball)"},{"id":"56592504","text":"The 1981–82 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1981–82 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The defending champions of the Big Sky Conference, Vandals were led by fourth-year head coach Don Monson and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho. The 1982 basketball team was the most successful in the school's history, and has yet to be surpassed. Building upon the success of the previous season, the Vandals won their first 16 games and went 24–2 in the regular season. They defeated Gonzaga and all four Pac-10 teams from the Northwest. Idaho won the eight-team Far West Classic in Portland in late December 1981, winning all three games by at least 19 points (over Iowa State, Oregon State, and Oregon). The Vandals' only setbacks during the regular season were consecutive two-point road losses in late January. The first was to rival Montana on a raucous Saturday night in Missoula on a tip-in at the buzzer. The second was to Notre Dame in South Bend two days later, ending a three-games-in-four-nights road trip, which included multiple weather-related travel delays and re-routes, and a 4:30 am arrival in South Bend on game day. Although the Vandals hit 14 of their first 15 shots to jump to lead over the Irish, Notre Dame regrouped at home to win by two in overtime. Idaho was awarded just four free throws in the 45 minutes of play and missed them all. Notre Dame was led by future NBA guard John Paxson in 1982. The Vandals then won eight straight games to conclude the regular season, and won the four-team conference tournament, which they hosted for the second straight year as regular season champions. Their 26–2 record after the Big Sky tournament (& ten straight victories) earned the Vandals a #8 national ranking and a #3 seed in the West region of the 48-team NCAA tournament, which included a first round bye. Idaho's first game (in the second round) was nearly a home game, played just west at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman on a Sunday afternoon. The opponent was 16th-ranked Iowa of the Big Ten, the region's sixth seed, then coached by Lute Olson. A Final Four team two years earlier, Iowa won their first-round game handily, but Idaho won this close game by two points, in overtime, and advanced to the Sweet 16 at the West regional in Provo, Utah. There the Vandals met the nation's fourth-ranked team, Oregon State, the #2 seed in the West region. Idaho had defeated the Beavers by 22 points in December at the Far West Classic in Portland, but this time the result was far different, as the Beavers won 60–42. OSU was defeated two days later by the region's #1 seed Georgetown, led by freshman center Patrick Ewing. (Georgetown advanced to the national final, where they lost by a point to North Carolina.) The Vandals ended the 1982 season at , and were ranked as high as sixth in the nation (AP and UPI polls) at the end of the regular season They entered the top twenty at #18 in early January and two weeks later were up to eighth, but the two losses dropped them back to fifteenth. Eight straight wins elevated them to sixth prior to the Big Sky tournament, and were eighth in both final polls entering the NCAA tournament. The 1982 starters Ken Owens () and Brian Kellerman () in the backcourt, with forwards Phil Hopson and Gordie Herbert and center Kelvin Smith, all at . Just before their two losses in January, the team was featured in a two-page article in Sports Illustrated. (team photo) The alley-oop was a frequently used play against man-to-man defenses. Monson was named the Kodak Coach of the Year in Division I in 1982 (photo) and rumors were rampant that he would jump to a higher league, maybe to struggling Arizona in the Pac-10. That position was eventually filled by Lute Olson (a year later), and Monson chose to stay for another year at Idaho. With a salary of about $40,000 in 1982 and a one-year contract, an \\"appreciation fund\\" was set up by local fans to entice him to stay in The 1982 team was inducted into the Vandal Athletics Hall of Fame, as was Monson. ==Roster== ==Schedule and results== - !colspan=9 style= Big Sky Tournament - !colspan=9 style= NCAA Tournament ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference – Idaho Vandals: 1981–82 basketball season *Gem of the Mountains: 1982 University of Idaho yearbook – 1981–82 basketball season *Idaho Argonaut – student newspaper – 1982 editions Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball seasons Idaho Idaho Idaho ","title":"1981–82 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team"},{"id":"56592550","text":"Harvard is an English surname/family name/last name and given name/first name, derived a Middle English variant of Hereward; here (“army”) + weard (“guard”). ==References== Category:English-language surnames Category:Surnames of English origin ","title":"Harvard (name)"},{"id":"56592561","text":"This is a list of mammal species found in Kerala, India. == Order: Artiodactyla == === Family: Bovidae === ====Genus: Bos====  Species: Bos gaurus (gaur / കാട്ടുപോത്ത്)  File:Indian Gaur from anaimalai hills JEG5290.jpgmale File:Male Bison.jpgmale File:Gaur with calf.jpgfemale with calf ====Genus: Nilgiritragus====  Species: Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri tahr / വരയാട്)  File:A courting male in Eravikulam NP AJTJohnsingh DSCN2997.jpgmale (left) File:Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius) female.jpgfemale File:Nilgiritragus hylocrius.JPGhabitat ====Genus: Tetracerus====  Species: Tetracerus quadricornis (four-horned antelope / ഉല്ലമാൻ)  File:Tetracerus quadricornis I.jpgmale File:Tetracerus quadricornis III.jpgmale File:Chowsingha female feeding on silk cotton flowers AJTJohnsingh DSCN6829.jpgfemale === Family: Cervidae === ====Genus: Axis====  Species: Axis axis (chital / പുള്ളിമാൻ)  File:A chital stag 1.JPGmale File:Spotted deer (Axis axis) female.jpgfemale File:Axis axis (Nagarhole, 2010).jpgmale ====Genus: Muntiacus====  Species: Muntiacus muntjak (Indian muntjac / കേഴമാൻ)  File:Barking deer in BR hills.jpg File:Barkingdeer by N A Nazeer.jpg File:Barking deer (Indian muntjac) in Khao Yai national park (8071505654).jpg ====Genus: Rusa====  Species: Rusa unicolor (sambar deer / മ്ലാവ്)  File:Sambar (Cervus unicolor unicolor) male.jpgmale File:Sambar (Cervus unicolor unicolor) female.jpgfemale === Family: Suidae === ====Genus: Sus====  Species: Sus scrofa cristatus (Indian boar / കാട്ടുപന്നി)  File:Wildboar in Anamalai hills.jpg File:225A7892.jpg File:Scavenger feast - Yala December 2010 (1).jpg === Family: Tragulidae === ====Genus: Moschiola====  Species: Moschiola indica (Indian spotted chevrotain / കൂരമാൻ)  File:Indian spotted chevrotain Moschiola indica Mouse deer from the Anaimalai hills DSC9927 03.jpg File:Indian spotted chevrotain Moschiola indica Mouse deer from the Anaimalai hills DSC9927 01.jpg File:Indian spotted chevrotain Moschiola indica Mouse deer from the Anaimalai hills DSC9927 02.jpg == Order: Carnivora == === Family: Canidae === ====Genus: Canis====  Species: Canis aureus naria (Sri Lankan jackal / കുറുനരി )  File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Golden Jackal.jpg File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Golden Jackal Female.jpg File:Canis aureus naria - Yala December 2010 (1).jpg ====Genus: Cuon====  Species: Cuon alpinus (Ussuri dhole / ചെന്നായ)  File:Indian wild dog by N.

She holds the Edwards Professor of American History Endowed Chair at Princeton University. She specializes in the study of gender, race, and labor in the history of the Southern United States. ==Early life== Hunter was born in Miami, Florida. She graduated with Distinction in History from Duke University, then earned an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in history from Yale University. ==Career== Hunter taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then Carnegie Mellon University, before joining the faculty of Princeton in 2007. Hunter published her first book, To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors After the Civil War, in 1997. To 'Joy My Freedom is an account of the lives of southern African American women, specifically domestic workers in Atlanta, from the end of slavery through the Reconstruction era. She details the many struggles of African American washerwomen in Atlanta to control where they worked and for how long, how much they were paid, how their children were raised, and particularly the right to control their own bodies. The book was specifically noted for focusing on working class women rather than middle- and upper-class women, who are more commonly treated in historical analyses of the period, in part because written records about higher class people are more common. To 'Joy My Freedom won the H. L. Mitchell Award from the Southern Historical Association, the Letitia Brown Memorial Book Prize from the Association of Black Women's Historians, and the Book of the Year Award in 1997 from the International Labor History Association. The book was the focus of a symposium in the journal Labor History. In 2017, Hunter published Bound in Wedlock: Slave and Free Black Marriage in the Nineteenth Century. The book examines how enslavement affected the marriage practices and family lives of African Americans, and how the legacy of slavery continued to do so in the decades following the end of slavery. Bound in Wedlock chronicles a variety of types of intimate relationships, from highly temporary arrangements to ones that were as permanent as possible, both within and outside of formal legal marriage institutions. Hunter analyzes the complicated legality of marital unions between enslaved people, and argues that legal definitions of marriage were often used to break apart the family structures of enslaved people. Hunter also studies the status of marriage law during the Civil War, and in the antebellum era. In 2018, Hunter was named the Edwards Professor of American History at Princeton University. ==Bibliography== * To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women’s Lives and Labors After the Civil War (Harvard University Press, 1998) * ed.

It occurred in early May 1936 following the collapse of the Ethiopian government and the departure of Emperor Haile Selassie from the city prior to the Italian conquest of Addis Ababa. The attack forced the temporary abandonment of the compound and the evacuation of its personnel by the British Army. American diplomatic and consular staff, supported by Italian troops, returned to reoccupy the chancery several days following their evacuation. In the United States, American minister Cornelius Van Hemert Engert was recognized for his actions leading the defense of the chancery, though the administration of Franklin Roosevelt would come under public criticism for not better providing for its protection. ==Background== On October 3, 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. By April of the following year, Italian forces had reached as far as Dessie. Cornelius Van H. Engert, the United States minister to Ethiopia, had taken up his post in February 1936 but, as of April, had yet been formally accredited by the Ethiopian government. On April 30 he was summoned to the throne room of Menelik Palace to present his credentials to HaileSelasie. Less than two days later, with the Italian Army approaching the city, the emperor and the imperial court evacuated the capital for French Somaliland, a move that was unexpected and resented by many Ethiopians. ==Riots erupt== Prior to departing Addis Ababa, Haile Selassie had ordered government armories opened with the apparent intent that civilians would seize the weapons and spontaneously resist the Italian entrance into the city. Instead, the weapons free-for-all combined with the collapse of the government sparked widespread civil disorder. By the afternoon of May 2, with the street violence growing increasingly worse, American journalists who had been in the city covering the war – as well as 37 Greek civilians – had all sought refuge in the chancery of the embassy. In addition, the files of the Ethiopian foreign ministry were brought to the American chancery by John H. Spencer for safekeeping, along with a personal cache of \\"food and guns\\" which he donated to the embassy. ==Attack and evacuation== On Monday, May 3, the chancery was attacked by an organized band of shiftas, the attack repelled by embassy staff and local contract guards. However, with the chancery under continuing fire, Engert resolved to contact the embassy of the United Kingdom for assistance, the British being in a more defensible location and better protected. A courier who attempted to make the trek to the British compound had to turn back due to the intensity of street violence. A radio message was, instead, transmitted to the British embassy, however, as the U.S. had no direct contact with the British, it had first to be relayed to the United States Department of State, forwarded to London and then sent back to Addis Ababa, the entire process taking the better part of a day. At 8:30 a.m. on May 4, three open-topped trucks and a British Army escort from the UK's embassy arrived at the American compound, whereupon the spouses and children of diplomatic staff, and sheltering civilians – including one reporter's pet cheetah – were driven to the British legation a few miles away. Remaining to defend the American legation was Engert, his wife, four U.S. Navy radio operators, six diplomats, several Ethiopian domestic staff, and one Ethiopian police officer who had sought refuge at the facility. Among them, they were armed with nine rifles, two shotguns, ten revolvers, and a submachine gun. Throughout the day, the compound continued to take fire and two of the local domestic staff were shot and seriously wounded. With ammunition running low, the State Department authorized Engert to abandon the legation, however, British forces were unable to provide immediate aid as they were occupied repelling a simultaneous assault upon the Belgian legation. Finally, on the morning of May 5, soldiers of the 11th Sikh Regiment arrived and evacuated the remaining Americans to the British legation. Simultaneously, United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a telegram to Benito Mussolini requesting the Royal Italian Army immediately enter Addis Ababa to stabilize the situation. The same day as the evacuation of the Americans by the British, German troops had to be dispatched by that nation's embassy to rescue Swiss physician Marcel Junod and French journalists who were trapped in a collapsed building. Later that evening, 25,000 Italian troops entered Addis Ababa. The next morning a contingent of four Americans returned to occupy the chancery, however, soon found themselves again under scattered fire. At the request of the United States, Italian troops were thereafter dispatched to secure the legation and its grounds, with 53 soldiers of the Italian Army reported having arrived at the compound in a later cable to Washington sent by an American vice-consul. ==Aftermath== Engert was given a one rank promotion in the U.S. Foreign Service in recognition of his efforts during the attack. Robert Worth Bingham, the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, was instructed by Secretary Hull to express \\"sincere appreciation\\" to the United Kingdom for its \\"prompt and efficient assistance\\". Some newspapers in the United States commented on the fact it was necessary for the United States embassy to appeal for aid to the United Kingdom and condemned the Roosevelt administration for not providing for a better defense of the American legation. John Spencer would later report that, when he returned to retrieve the Ethiopian government files he had brought to the American legation for safekeeping, some had gone missing. The United States terminated its mission in Addis Ababa in the spring of 1937. ==See also== * 1975 AIA building hostage crisis * 2012 Benghazi attack * Dolo hospital airstrike ==References== Category:Attacks on diplomatic missions of the United States Category:1936 in Ethiopia Category:20th-century history of the British Army Category:Ethiopia–United States relations ","title":"Attack on the United States embassy in Addis Ababa"},{"id":"56592608","text":"Radwan bishop of Poznań (died 1172) was Bishop of Poznan probably in the years 1164 to 1172.Karol Maleczyński: O kanclerzach polskich XII wieku, \\"Kwartalnik Historyczny\\", nr 42 (1928), p.38 He probably came from the Radwanów family.

Before taking up the bishopric, he was the chancellor of Mieszko the Old (around 1167). As a Poznań bishop, he participated in the synod in Łęczyca in 1180. Soon after this congress, he probably died, because according to an extract from the Antiquitatum of the monastery Lubinensis around 1180, his successor Arnold had already given privileges to the abbey in Lubin. Władysław Semkowicz identifies him as the father of the knight Jan, certified in documents from 1228 and 1230, and the progenitor of the Sulim family.Władysław Semkowicz: Nieznane nadania na rzecz opactwa jędrzejowskiego, Kwartalnik Historyczny, nr 24 (1910), p.83-90.

However, he was mentioned for the first time only in the bull of Pope Innocent III of August 2, 1201. From 1206 Arnold II was a follower of Prince Władysław Laskonogi in his dispute with the Archbishop of Gniezno, Henryk Kietlicz, who led a hostile reform of a part of the clergy. Ignoring the interdict that the archbishop imposed on his diocese, he continued to give religious services to the cursed prince. It ended with an excommunication on Arnold, approved by a papal bull on January 10, 1207. He took part in the congress of princes in Głogów at Christmas 1208, where he removed church punishments. He took part in 1210 at the congress in Borzykowa.

Son of Szymon, castellan of Gniezno, brother of the cousin of Kalisz, Mikołaj Jankowic and Sędziwój of Jarocin. A representative of one of the most powerful families of Wielkopolska in the 13th and 14th centuries. No mention has been made of his childhood and studies. For the first time he appears in the sources as a chaplain of Bolesław the Pious.Antoni Gąsiorowski, Jerzy Topolski [red.]: Wielkopolski Słownik Biograficzny.

After the death of the king, he works in the office of Władysław Łokietek. In a document from 1297, he appears as a provost of the Poznań chapter. ==Episcopal career== In the same year, he left the court of Łokietek to embrace the Poznań bishop's throne.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 407 In 1298 he was the main negotiator of the settlement in Kościan, between Łokietek, Henry III Głogowczyk and wielkopolskie Wielkieks, who in exchange for the support of Łokietek's embrace of the Crown left by Przemysl guaranteed a number of privileges to Poznań bishops, including the title of the Crown Chancellor and the Poznań throne. Soon after, along with the majority of the magnates of Wielkopolska, he found himself in opposition to Łokietek. In 1299, Władysław Łokietek placed the interdict in the diocese of Poznań (by some historians, this fact is questioned). After that he became one of the main architects of Wenceslas II's coronation as the king of Poland. After the death of Wacław II, and soon after him Wacław III supported in the summer of 1306 Henryk Głogowczyk, who mastered Greater Poland. The support of the Silesian Piasts of German and Silesian influences in Wielkopolska quickly caused that the majority of the nobles stood in opposition to Henry and his sons. Jakub Świnka and Andrzej Zaremba were in the forefront of this movement. In 1312, both priests laid a curse on Henryk and his sons, which accelerated the end of their rule over Wielkopolska. In 1313 bp. Andrzej ultimately spoke on the side of Łokietek. During the office of the Poznań Bishop, he reformed the archdiocese of Poznań, dividing it into three smaller ones and planning to create a fourth one in the lands located on the northern bank of the Noteć. He issued laws that would put an end to the distribution of tithing from both new parishes and help to regain those assignments that his predecessors left behind. In the episcopal administration, he created a permanent general office, settled matters of cathedral vicars, created their permanent college, and recognized the bishops' chancellors as prelates. He also issued, in 1302, permission for an uprising at a Poznań friend. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:14th-century deaths Category:Bishops of Poznań Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Andrzej Zaremba"},{"id":"56592674","text":"Rafael Vázquez (born 26 March 1929) is a Mexican singer, songwriter, and actor.

The palace is located on Niyazi street (formerly Sadovaya) facing Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall. It was built on the project of architect Nicholas von der Nonne in 1891–1895. ==History== Architect of the palace, Nicholas von der Nonne On February 26, 1888, Leo De Boure (1840–1889), the oil magnate, founder of \\"Caspian Partnership\\" Joint Stock Company and millionaire appealed to the Baku City Council for approval of two-storied stone palace plan, which he wanted to build. On April 18, 1888, an agreement on allocation of 700 square meters of land was obtained on Sadovaya Street (present Niyazi Street). On August 26, urban engineer Nicholas von der Nonne and city architect, construction engineer Anton Kandinov confirm the plan of the palace. But architect A. Kandinov does not have the signature in the architectural project of the palace, and Nicholas von der Nonne is considered the only architect of the palace.Шамиль Фатуллаев.

Дебуровский дворец// literary portal: Proza.ru. — 2012 ===Property of Caspian Society=== De Boure died in 1889 before the construction of the building was completed. His successors sold groundbreaking building to “Caspian Partnership” Joint Stock Company in January 1891 for 16,000 rubles. Thus, the building became the property of the Society. Therefore, architects had to make some changes in the initial plan of the building. On the main facade of the building, two exit doors were constructed. The balconies was opened on Sadovaya Street side and Mikhailovsky Garden (now Vahid Garden) was the landscape from the balconies. History of construction of the building is dated back to 1891 – 1893.Р. М. Эфендизаде. Проспект Нариманова — принципы архитектурно-планировочного решения. — Researches of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR: Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, 1980. — p. 111. It is also noted that palace of “Caspian Partnership” Joint Stock Company was completed in 1895. The building's medallion had a \\"KT\\" (first letters of Caspian Partnership in Azerbaijani) abbreviation, but later it was destroyed during repair. In 1895, co-founder of the Caspian Partnership Society, S. I. Baghirov died and his assistant Pavel Osipovich Gukasov replaced him. In 1896, one of the family members, brother of chairman of Caspian Partnership Society, Arshak Osipovich Gukasov moved to the palace and settled in several rooms of it. In 1898, P. O. Gukasov and his family moved to this palace. It's also noted that a fire broke out in the palace during those years. View of the palace from Governor's garden (now Philarmonic Garden), 1900s ===Later period=== After the October Revolution of 1917, on July 31, 1918, with the active participation of British Consul E. McDonald, the government in Baku was passed from the Islamic Army of the Caucasus to Centrocaspian Dictatorship, which was invited to protect the city. In August 1919, the British army entered Baku. Following it, the headquarters of the British Command headed by General William Thomson was placed in the palace dedicated to Caspian Partnership. However, the family of the Gukasov family continued to live in the same palace. After Red Army units entered Baku on April 28, 1920, Nariman Narimanov became the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan. In 1921, he was elected chairman of the People's Commissars Council and council was placed at Palace of De Boure. Nariman Narimanov's family began to live on the second floor of the palace. After the death of N. Narimanov in 1925, Sadovaya Street was renamed N. Narimanov Street. From 1933, family of the first secretary of KGB, Mir Jafar Baghirov settled in the palace. In the 1930s a small reconstruction work was carried out in the palace, and on the left side a garden named after N. Narimanov was planted. In 1939 the street was renamed Chkalov Street. In 1951, M. Baghirov donated the palace to National Art Museum of Azerbaijan and the palace is still functioning as the first body of the museum. ==Architectural features== The palace-type building built by Nicholas von der Nonne is his first and last attempt to use volume-spatial solution by actively using plastic tools. This is sole historical building, which is perceived as a three-dimensional construction of flat-sized buildings in Baku. After re-planning the surrounding areas of the city, De Boure's palace remained an exemplary building. Significant size and effective location make up a composite accent between successfully constructed buildings. It is noted that the quiet, horizontal divisions of the palace creates a harmony with the surrounding club building, Building of Mayoralty of Baku and verticals of the property of Sadikhov. During projection of the Palace of De Boure, the squares along the red lines of the street were empty. Concerning this, the architect, Nicholas von der Nonne, paid special attention to the harmony of buildings in the neighborhood while working on the project. Considering the special position of the palace and the location, closeness to the Caspian Sea, large and plastic solutions are interesting. The baroque-style architecture of the palace, the well-placed classic elements and the powerful plastic tools (porticoes) used in the background of building using unhewn stone have an important role. During construction of the building, palaces built differently from local architectural schools that was formed for centuries, were just beginning to be built on the central streets of Baku. The classic symmetric-axis facade is applied in the architectural composition of De Boure's palace. In Baku, the European classics were developing from the 1880s, and this was the direction of Baku artists' creativity. They used all possibilities of classics to disclose the artistic manifestations of the structure of the building. While preparing for the master plan of Baku engineer Nicholas von der Nonne, put it in the construction of a circular trunk around Old City and designated the place of the palace. ===Planning=== The palace plan and architectural solution differs by industrialist tones: enfilade of the rooms are completed with hall chambers, the windows are facing the front facade. All rooms, including \\"Black\\" stairs and toilets, are lit up when air does. The exact system of capital walls is represented by one layered construction and constitutes basis of the carcass, which is connected to extensive corridors. The main stairs cover the north-western part of the quadratic yard area. At the end, the service (black) stairs are located. The left portico has access to the corridor. A three-quarter turn, triumphant marble staircase rises up from the right to the second floor, and discloses an interior. From the entrance, there is a marble two-quarter turn, an indoor-looking corner staircase. Both stairs combine the corridor in the style of enfilade. Palace of De Boure is considered one of the best objects in Baku with its architectural-plan and effectiveness. ===Facade=== Profile view of main facade Architect Nicholas von der Nonne worked in the construction of the modern center of Baku (late 19th century) and managed to incorporate his position in the development of city architecture. At that time due to dominance of two-dimensional buildings the city streets, which were not so wide, there was no interval between neighboring buildings. Seamless lanes in the spatial environment of different facades were dominant. Despite the appearance of facades, the monotony of buildings reduced the overall impact of the architecture of Baku streets. Implementation of the De Boure's palace in the favorable city structure played a positive role. in turn, the architect, N.A von der Nonne, determined the three-dimensional effect of the facade. The author included the concept of volume-spatial architecture into the horizontal system of the building. The triaxial shaped bulging center of side parts of the building facade are marked by vertical avant-corps and this results in the formation of plastics volume. Architect N.A von der Nonne believed that these elements were not sufficient for a prestigious palace building. For this reason, one-storeyed porticos are placed between the avant-corps that go forward from the façade line. Porticos have three corner columns of ionic order. The porticos, along with their balconies on the second floor, enlarge the building façade composition. Creation of architectural forms by classic methods has resulted in separation of strong stylobate of the facade surface and the rustication part of the first floor with large stone blocks. On the background of such monumental part, the proportion of lightweight porticos have the influence. The contrast of the volume of the facade elements is the model of new composition systems in city construction. Avant-corps of second floor are with noted with Corinthian order and it reminds of porticoes, far beyond the wall. They organize a plastic composition by harmonizing with the porticoes of the first floor. A rising classic object-spatial structure occurs over the building. The dense horizontal porticoes of the lower floor have a soft transition to the second floor rustication. The facade of the second floor is represented by vividly profiled window places located on rustications and rhythmically arranged, rectangular window frames. The triangular pediment on central rustication cornice is expressed with heraldic elements and sculpture figures. Architect Nicholas von der Nonne, in his original form, tried to mark the central part with a vivid artistic form, and decorated the form with a decorative dome on it. Vividly profiled cornice with sophisticated architectural detail differs in volume-spatial composition of the building. Triangular pediment on central avant-corps, heraldic element, a pair of Muse sculptures and decorative dome The classic forms of the portico's columns, the corinthian order of the rustications, the thin profiles of the window frames, and the first-floor floor covering on the lightweight stone background create the fullness of the palace's architectural composition. The building of the Nicholas von der Nonne is his first attempt of the use of volumetric settlement of the mansion through the active use of porticoes, loggias and other plastic means. The building is distinguished by the individuality of the planned and architectural solution: enfilades of rooms which has windows looking at main facade are completed with halls. All the rooms, including stairs and toilets, are illumined by the first light. At this time, the empty space free from the neighborhood allowed the architect to interpret the building as not to completed as a whole organism. Facade on the side of Niyazi street and specially mentioned and not deep avant-corps which has three axis are divided into two floors with stylobates which are profiled through the whole corps. The central axis is striking with small dome as well. The whole composition of the façade is enriched with lightweight loggia-porticoes of the Ionic order, which is particularly noticeable. This method led to the creation of a composition with landscape. The classic forms of the columns of the visible portico, corinthian order of the avant-corps, the profiles of window frames, and construction of first floor from deep and second floor of lightweight stones creates plastic composition. The palace has unique properties for buildings similar to other building in Baku. In the 1930s, the reconstruction of the land was completed. The volume of the palace was included in the reconstructed garden composition by architect K. İ. Senchikov, which created a whole ensemble. ===Interior=== Interior designs decorated with classic motifs, with the participation of Venetian mirrors with semi-circular arches. The walls are divided into decorated panels. Double corinth pilasters decorates the interior. Columns describe the composition of the rooms and are the most active elements of the interior. They do not prevent the screens on the walls, but on the other hand, they create a spatial environment. Architect N.A von der Nonne created an oriental interior in its own unique style for local architectural traditions in one of the corner rooms of the second floor. After von der Nonne, this tradition were accepted by many Baku architects. In the Azizbeyov's house, the house of Musa Nagiyev, the Rilskiy brothers' house, Palace of Zeynalabdin Taghiyev and other historical buildings in Baku oriental style halls have been preserved. On the second floor of De Boure's palace, there are two separate lounges oriented to front facade which was designed for ceremonial receptions. Long, straight corridors on the right and left sides of the building plan connect the entire room with an enfilade system. The lounges are large and decorated with columns on the side parts on transverse walls. This was one of the methods the architect N.A von der Nonne preferred. Including three-dimensional round columns that stand apart from the structure of the hall enriches the interior of the decorative plastic. The semi-ringed wall cavity, close to the columns and the floor of the hall, creates soft and cozy atmosphere with large arches. N.A von der Nonne often used such architectural elements in the interior of his residential buildings. The presence of mirrored steam next to the column also indicates the new shape applied on the interior. ==Gallery== File:National Art Museum of Azerbaijan (de Burs House).JPG File:De Burs palace Baku.JPG File:Palace of De Bur.JPG File:Palace of De Bur detail 2.jpg File:Palace of De Bur detail 4.jpg File:Palace of De Bur detail 1.jpg File:De Burs palace Baku 1.JPG File:Palace of De Bur detail.jpg ==References== == Sources== * * ==External links== *Official website of National Art Museum of Azerbaijan Category:Tourist attractions in Baku Category:Palaces in Azerbaijan Category:Buildings and structures in Baku Category:Culture in Baku Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1895 ","title":"Palace of De Boure"},{"id":"56593090","text":"Paunka Todorova (; born 26 January 1930) is a Bulgarian chess player.

The show is known for its negative demeanor towards local sports teams, hot takes, and willingness to go after local teams and players. The show's negativity towards local teams led to a famous bashing of the Boston Red Sox following the departure of two-time World Series champion manager Terry Francona, which resulted in Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry barging into the show in an attempt to defend his team. The show's negativity and bravado have also resulted in several controversies, most notable among them when Felger mocked the deaths of Roy Halladay and Dale Earnhardt. For all the show's negativity, however, it has also been associated with several Boston charities including Cuts for a Cause and Christmas in the City.

Papa made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona while training with the Trojan Swim Club in Los Angeles, CA. In the 200 meter backstroke, Papa was disqualified after he had a problem in his preparation. He jumped into the swimming pool before the start of the heat but his googles fell underwater. He struggled getting his googles back and when he went back to his starting mark he was disqualified by the referee for \\"deliberate delay\\". Protests from the crowd further delayed the start of the heat by a minute. He also competed at the 100 meter backstroke and the 4 x 100 meter medley relay. In the 100 meter backstroke, Papa had a fourth-place finish in the second heat by clocking 59.88 but failed to advance to the final round after finishing 43rd overall in the heats. In the latter event, he along with set a national record in the 4 x 100 meter medley relay by clocking 3:53.64 in the third heat for an overall 18th finish in the heats. ===Other=== Papa still holds the Philippines record for the 200 meter backstroke event with the time of 2:00.96 which he set at the 1997 Southeast Asian Games. It was also the SEA games record for the event which remained unbroken until 2015 when Singapore's Quah Zheng Wen broke it by clocking 2:00.55. Papa held the Philippine record for the 100 backstroke from 1997 to 2019. Jerard Jacinto broke the 22-year-old record.

Constructed in the International Style and opened in 1956, they are so called due to their excellent views of the Raritan River. The three buildings, named Campbell, Frelinghuysen and Hardenbergh, are tall and are 7 stories high. The buildings were built so as to be raised above street level with open air underneath to preserve sight lines between George Street and the Raritan River. But the open space was largely unused and the interior of the buildings did not have any significant space for study, lounging, or student programming, which led to renovation project in 2014. Hardenbergh Hall was originally designed as the \\"medical\\" dorm for Rutgers students who suffered from physical maladies such as asthma, and as such is one of the few dorms on the College Avenue Campus which is air conditioned. It is named after Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, who had been the first president of Rutgers College from 1785 to 1790, when it was still called \\"Queen's College\\". ==Honors College== Honors College A complex for freshman opened in 2015.http://rutgersfuturebydevco.org/page/8/rutgers-residential-honors-college ==Demarest Hall== Demarest Hall rear Demarest Hall was built during 1950 and 1951, and was named after Reverend William Henry Steele Demarest, President of Rutgers from 1905 to 1924. It has a cupola with a weather vane, hence the unofficial Demarest motto, \\"We've got a big gold cock.\\" It is the only Rutgers residence hall completely dedicated to Special Interest Housing. Demarest originally housed only freshmen, but older students protested. Demarest became the football players' dorm (until the mid-1960s) with sets of football player andirons in the two Main Lounge fireplaces indicating this status. One set of the football player andirons remain, though apparently the other set was stolen between 1993 and 2004. Rumors persist, and have been partly confirmed that the stolen set of football players is now at the Rutger's Club dining establishment. In the mid-1960s, Demarest began housing Honors students. These students formed special interest sections as a way to learn from each other in informal discussion, as a relaxed, more in-depth alternative to the standard classroom lecture. Some sections were created in conjunction with academic departments, such as French, the first special-interest section, created in 1966. Some early Demarest sections included Arts and Crafts, Women's Studies, Puerto Rican Studies, and Natural History. In the late 1970s, Demarest became an official special-interest hall, with funding from the Office of the Dean of Students; this funding was later assumed by the Bishop House Office of Residence Life, which was founded in 1980. Students ran the sections autonomously until the first time Rutgers College overbooked itself into a housing shortage and decided to implement the lottery system. Demarites had, up until then, been able to freely return to their sections year after year, but now it seemed that living in Demarest the next year would depend solely on the best lottery numbers, rather than their desire to remain active in the Demarest community. The residents of Demarest made a deal. They would accept limited supervision from the Office of Residence Life and implement certain requirements for living in the dorm, such as required individual projects, while still reserving the major decisions, such as the establishment of sections, for Demarest residents. In return, they would receive guaranteed housing in Demarest and the right to control section membership. The autonomy did not last. In 1987, Residence Life imposed an unprecedented degree of supervision and administrative procedures on the special interest structure. Among the changes were the enumeration of membership criteria, the reformulation of most sections along strong academic lines (Arts and Crafts, for example, became Visual Arts), and the appointment of a faculty advisor for each section. The sections were segregated, their members forced to live together in contiguous blocks of rooms. Sections were required to answer directly to Bishop House. Residence Life never directly informed Demarites of the new rules; they had to find out about them by reading an ad in The Daily Targum. Berni Calkins, the then-Assistant Coordinator of Residence Life, who was primarily responsible for this low point in Demarest/Bishop House diplomacy, refused to cooperate with Demarest residents or even believe that some residents had rights under the Constitution, despite repeated invitations for her to attend a Hall Government meeting to discuss the issues. In 1989, a new Demarest populace and a mostly-new Residence Life staff, including the inimitable Anna-Marie Toto, began a less bitter relationship, including SIC, the Section Issues Committee. SIC was formed to give Demarest residents a better opportunity to tell Residence Life their concerns about section-related issues. SIC was composed of the Residence Counselor, all the section leaders, and two additional representatives from each section who had lived in Demarest for at least a year. SIC was responsible for reviewing section program proposals, drawing up section budgets, reviewing section applications (for entire sections, new and continuing), and determining the criteria and procedures for section member applications. The sections were desegregated, wounds healed, and people actually started working together. The cooperative spirit seemed to have evaporated with Anna-Marie Toto's departure from Bishop House: Residence Life retained control over the sections, but did not fulfill its part of the original bargain. However, Dean Calkins left to be a full-time mother, and Demarest has since undergone a renaissance—including the appointment of an official Demarest Historian position in Hall Government. New policies were enacted in the Fall 2009 Semester to create an environment where only Demarites who are actively contributing and participating in the various sections and events will be allowed to return. This new policy while already currently in effect, will be changed slightly so that Room-Selection will occur prior to the distribution of Lottery Numbers. This change reflects a new direction for Demarest where some members who would return to the dorm only did so due to a poor lottery number. The new policy actively seeks to remove these denizens who use Demarest as back-up housing in case they get a high lottery number. In 2011, Demarest became be one of three residence halls at Rutgers-New Brunswick to test a new program of co-ed living environments. Students of any gender who wish to share a room with a roommate of the opposite gender could do so under this gender-neutral housing program, provided both parties select this housing option together. The bathrooms on the second floor are gender-neutral, and require a swipe of a Rutgers ID card to enter. For many years, all of the building's bathrooms were unofficially co-ed. Freshmen do not live on the 2nd floor. Most freshmen live on the first floor, although there are a handful on the third. ===Famous former residents=== The worldwide community of those who have ever lived in Demarest Hall is known as \\"Demarest-in-Exile.\\" *Junot Díaz refers to Demarest in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.

This track, which typically forms a loop, is often compared to smaller racecourses; it is, however strictly designed for testing. The layout of its environment imitates motorway circumstances. == Structure == In most cases handling courses consist of two parts: low and high speed courses, both enable the same types of tests, only at differing speeds. Handling courses may also be categorised either as wet or dry courses according to the availability of the option for track wetting. The alternative routes of the handling courses provide diverse track options for the tests. As the course sections have varying radius of curvature, handling courses are suitable for testing all vehicles types. Several types of specially paved shorter sections may also belong to handling courses depending on the given proving ground. These may be curved, straight or even wavy asphalt track sections, furthermore straight or curving sections with varying sideway slopes. Occasionally even degraded surfaces requiring maintenance are built deliberately in order to increase the number of options; furthermore sections suitable for conducting aquaplaning tests may also be inserted. The option of wetting of the latter sections is usually provided by using nozzles. The safety of testing is ensured b the crash spaces designed around the curves. == Goal and utilization == Vehicle behaviour or manoeuvrability refers to the testing of the connection between steering and the running gear, the different assistance appliances (ESP, ABS, ASR), and other systems influencing the dynamics of vehicles. As testing options are unlimited, handling courses are suitable for all situations related to the dynamics of modern vehicles. == Handling courses of existing proving grounds == Currently most proving grounds in Europe feature handling courses. The most well-known examples are the Boxberg Proving Ground constructed by Bosch (Germany) and the Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre in Sweden. A test track featuring a handling course is currently under construction in Zalaegerszeg, Hungary as well. === Boxberg Proving Ground, Germany, Boxberg === The handling course at the Boxberg Proving Ground consists of two parts. One part is designed for higher speeds suitable for testing all vehicles types thanks to its radius of curvature varying between 48 m and 101 m. The other part is designed with radius of curvature varying between 15 m and 115 m, and has inclinations which increase its difficulty. Several sections of this part are wettable, and it also has a circular surface for drifting. It is not suitable for testing heavy-duty vehicles and buses, but it has a track unit imitating a mountain tunnel, which is suitable for simulating windy circumstances. === Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre, Sweden === The handling course at the Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre may be divided into two parts, one with snowy surface, the other with frozen. The total length of the snowy surface is 2470 m, its width is approx. 5 m, it contains 13 curves, and due to the snow its grip is medium (μ <0,3). The frozen surface is also divided into two sections. The total length of the first section is approx. 1850 m, its width is approx. 5 m, it contains 8 curves, and the grip of the ice is medium (μ <0,3). The second section is approx. 3000 m long and has the same width as the first section, it contains 30 curves and its grip is also the same as that of the first. === ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH, Germany === The handling course at the Papenburg Test Centre is a small scale replica of the racecourse at Hockenheim with a length of 2.6 km and a width of 10 m, and may be divided into two independent units. === Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track, Zalaegerszeg, Hungary === The handling course will be a basic component of the test track currently under construction near Zalaegerszeg. The external handling course designed for high speeds will have a total length of 2032 m and a width of 12 m. Its straight sections and curve radius enable reaching a speed of 120 km/h. The 1334 m long and 6 m wide internal handling course will be designed for the same tests at lower speeds of maximum 60 km/h. Furthermore the handling course will contain several specially paved section inserts, such as pothole and eroded sections, basalt pavement, straight, curved and wavy pavements, hilly road sections and a section with a 5% sideway slope. A basalt pavement disc will also be built suitable for testing drifting and skidding, as well as a section insert which enables the simulation of sliding on a wet road. == References == Category:Vehicle technology Category:Road test tracks ","title":"Handling course"},{"id":"56593368","text":"Cordobese Union (, UCOR) is a localist political party in Córdoba created by Rafael Gómez Sánchez ahead of the 2011 local elections. ==History== Rafael Gómez (better known as \\"Sandokán\\"Rivera, Agustín (23/04/2011): «Elecciones Municipales y Autonómicas - El ‘malayo’ Sandokán da la gran sorpresa en Córdoba al lograr cinco concejales».

Gall Anonim dedicated his first and second part of this chronicle, which means that he certainly held his office around 1112/1113. The date of his taking up the diocese and the date of death remain unknown. However, if we assume that Gall in the dedication of his first book mentioned four Polish bishops in the order of seniority counted from consecration, then Paul had to become a bishop before 1110.Listed as the last one, Żyrosław became a bishop in Wrocław in 1112, the penultimate Maur took the diocese of Kraków in 1110, and the first Szymon was a Bishop of Płock around 1108, when - according to the testimony of Galla himself, he defended Mazovia against the invasion of Pomorzan. The consecration of Paul mentioned in the second place must have taken place before the consecration of Maura (1110), and after Simon's consecration (before 1108); see Abraham, pp. 90-91. 2. Perhaps he became a bishop as a result of Gwalon's legacy in 1103, for it is known that Gwalon has filed two Polish bishops from office. ==References== Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Poznań ","title":"Paweł (Bishop of Poznań)"},{"id":"56593431","text":"Half Girlfriend is a 2014 Hindi novel by Chetan Bhagat.

The fraud was allegedly organized by jeweller and designer Nirav Modi. Nirav, his wife Ami Modi, brother Nishal Modi and uncle Mehul Choksi, all partners of the firms, M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds; along with PNB officials and employees, and directors of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi's firms have all been named in a chargesheet by the CBI. Nirav Modi and his family absconded in early 2018, days before the news of the scam broke in India. India's Enforcement Directorate has begun attaching assets of the accused and is seeking to immediate confiscation under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance. Modi is on the Interpol's wanted list for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and dishonesty including delivery of property, corruption, money laundering since February 2018. In March 2019, Modi was arrested in central London by UK authorities. The bank initially said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam, as the bank's core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued LOUs to overseas branches of other Indian banks, including Allahabad Bank, Axis Bank, and Union Bank of India, using the international financial communication system, SWIFT. The transactions were noticed by a new employee of the bank. The bank then complained to the CBI, who is currently investigating the scam apart from ED and Reserve bank of India. On a later date, CBI named key officials Usha Ananthasubramanian, former CEO of PNB, executive directors KV Brahmaji Rao and Sanjiv Sharan in a chargesheet holding them responsible for failure to implement several circular and caution notices issued by the RBI regarding the reconciliation of SWIFT messages and core banking systems. ==Investigation== Punjab National Bank (PNB) alleges associates of three firms - Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds- approached PNB on 16 January 2018, with a request for LoUs to make payment to its overseas suppliers. The bank demanded at least a 100 percent cash margin for issuing LoUs, but the firms contested that they had received LoUs without any such guarantee in the past. Branch records did not show any such facility having been granted to the firms, PNB suspected fraud and began digging into transaction history. On 29 January 2018, PNB filed a complaint with the CBI, wherein it was alleged that Nirav, Ami Modi, Nishal Modi and Mehul Choksi, all partners of M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds, in collusion with two bank officials committed the offence of cheating against PNB and caused a wrongful loss. The PNB official in his complaint informed the agency that at the Bank's branch office at Brady House in Fort, Mumbai, two of its employees, Gokulnath Shetty, retired Deputy Manager of PNB and another bank official, issued fraudulent LoUs to Hong Kong based creditors on behalf of three firms associated with Nirav Modi and the Gitanjali Group. “The public servants committed abuse of official position to cause pecuniary advantage to Diamonds R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds and wrongful loss of Rs 280.70 crore to PNB during 2017,” said the first information report (FIR) filed by CBI. As of 18 May 2018, the scam has ballooned (US$2.1 billion) and Nirav Modi is said to be hiding in London, allegedly travelling on a fake passport. On 13 June 2018, the CBI approached the Interpol to issue a red corner notice (RCN) against Nirav Modi's brother Nishal and one of his executives in connection with its probe into the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud. The CBI sent a request to the Interpol to issue a RCN against Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi of the Gitanjali Group. On 20 August 2018, former MD and CEO of Allahabad Bank, Usha Ananthasubramanian was granted bail on a surety bond of Rs 1 lakhs by Special CBI court in Mumbai. A week earlier, the government had dismissed Usha on the last day of her work. Ananthasubramanian was MD of Punjab National Bank between August 2015 and May 2017 and had also served as its executive director. She was dismissed with immediate effect. The CBI registered a disproportionate assets case against a retired deputy manager of Punjab National Bank, Gokulnath Shetty, a key accused, for allegedly amassing wealth 200 per cent more than his known sources of income. Nirav Modi, who disappeared in February 2018, was in the British capital since June 2018. He was arrested in central London on 19 March 2019 after an Indian-origin clerk at a bank in central London recognized him and alerted the police. UK police arrested Modi, on behalf of the Indian authorities, who asked for his extradition. Modi appeared in court on 20 March 2019. In the same month, the UK court refused twice to grant him bail on the ground that he was a flight risk and could flee the country if given a chance. For the third time again, Modi was denied bail and to remain in prison till May 24, 2019. The court had also noted that Modi could tamper with evidence if left free. It has revealed in earlier hearings that Modi had threatened to kill a prime witness and bribe another to escape justice. In June 2019 Four Swiss bank accounts of Nirav Modi and his sister Purvi Mehta's had been \\"frozen\\" by authorities in Switzerland as part of the Scam, The total amount of Rs 283.16 crore has been frozen on the request of the Enforcement Directorate. After Swiss bank, a few days later, on 2 July 2019, the Singapore High Court ordered to freeze four bank accounts in the name of Modi, Purvi, and her husband, Mayank Mehta. These accounts have Rs 44 crore between them. Interpol has issued Red Corner Notice against both Purvi and Mayank. In August 2019, The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has moved an application in the special CBI court, seeking to declare fugitive businessman Nirav Modi, his brother Neeshal Modi and a close associate Subhash Parab proclaimed offenders and to attach their properties. All three declared 'wanted' by the CBI in its charge sheet in the Rs 13,700 crore PNB scam. Though the agency last year obtained warrants against them, they couldn't execute as the accused fled India before the case registered in February. Nirav Modi legal team has made four bail applications, which have been rejected each time due to Modi deemed a flight risk. Modi, who is prisoned at Wandsworth prison in south-west London since March 2019 which extended till September 19 and later further remanded to judicial custody until October 17 by a UK court which said it was working towards his Five-day extradition trial hearing for May 11–15, 2020 and he must appear via video link before a court every 28 days. In September 2019, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi of the Gitanjali Group is a \\"crook\\" and repatriated to India after he exhausts all legal options. Mehul Choksi, who is currently in the Caribbean nation of Antigua, told the high court that he left India for medical treatment and not to avoid prosecution in the case. He said he would return to India as soon as he is medically fit to travel. In December 2019 - Nirav Modi, his step-brother Nehal Modi and two of their business associates tried to threaten witnesses and destroy evidence, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the additional charge sheet submitted before the CBI court in Mumbai. According to CBI's charge-sheet, the evidence came after nine of Nirav's employees submitted details to CBI of how Nirav and Nehal, along with associates, took them to Egypt against their will and coerced them into signing documents that would establish the nine as owners of dummy companies Nirav had floated. In March 2020, Enforcement Directorate (ED) auctioned 72 luxury items seized from Nirav Modi for Rs 2.29 crore. In May 2020, Based on the request from Indian agencies, Interpol had put Nehal Modi back again on the Red Corner Notice for assisting his step-brother Nirav Modi in defrauding the PNB months. Last year his name was removed from the Interpol website when Nehal Modi and Neeshal Modi had challenged the RCN. CBI reported, Nehal purportedly managed two companies for Nirav Modi, which received $50 million from dummy entities. After the scam got exposed, he took away diamonds worth $6 million, 3.5 million in UAE dirham, and 50 kg of gold. In Dubai, he destroyed digital evidence in the form of mobile phones and a server, and also threatened the key witnesses. On 8 June 2020, The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) Court has ordered a confiscated of nearly Rs 1,400 crores worth property of Nirav Modi. In May 2020, the UK court adjourned the Nirav Modi trial until September 2020, on the Five-day extradition trial hearing. Modi has applied for political asylum after his bail was denied five times in the UK. In July 2020, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against Mehul Choksi alleging how he ran an organized racket to cheat customers and lenders in India, Dubai and the United States. ==Reforms== On 1 March 2018, the government approved the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by giving powers to the government to confiscate assets of a fugitive, including Benami assets of absconding loan defaulters. The bill covers a wide range of economic offenders which include: loan defaulters, fraudsters, individuals who violate laws governing taxes, black money, benami properties, financial sector, and corruption. On 12 March 2018, the government introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha. In March 2018, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped banking instruments such as the Letter of understanding (LoU) and Letter of Comfort (LoC) that in an attempt to plug a loophole and improve banks’ due diligence in trade credit. Some bankers said that LoUs and LoCs led to receiving banks depending completely on the issuing bank on creditworthiness. == References == Category:Banking in India Category:Finance fraud Category:Fraud in India ","title":"Punjab National Bank Scam"},{"id":"56593491","text":"The FS Class E.430 locomotives, initially classed as RA 34, were three-phase alternating current electric locomotives of the Italian railways. They were built for Ferrovia della Valtellina by Ganz and MÁVAG in 1901 and had a power output of 440 kW (about 600 metric horsepower) and a haulage capacity of 300 tons. One locomotive is preserved. ==History== Early Type of Valtellina Three- Phase Gearless Locomotive, 1907 Class E.430 is the first example, worldwide, of an electric locomotive powered by three-phase current. It was built for Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network), which at that time operated the Ferrovia della Valtellina, by Ganz Works, for the electrical part, and by the Royal Hungarian State Machine Factory (MÁVAG), for the mechanical part. These were, at the time, the most advanced factories in the world in the electric railway sector. The locomotives were numbered 34.1 and 34.2 under the management of the Adriatic Network. Acquired in 1905 by the Ferrovie dello Stato, the numbering changed to 0341-0342 and in 1914 they were re-numbered E.430.1 and E.430.2. Since the Valtellina lines were the first in Italy to use three-phase electric power for the haulage of trains, the E.430 was used from the beginning. The Adriatic Network had commissioned the entire electrification project from the Ganz company in Budapest. The equipment was built under the supervision of Kálmán Kandó, one of the pioneers of three- phase traction in Italy. The electrification work began in 1897, with the establishment of a government commission to experiment with different electrification systems: one with accumulators (Bologna - San Felice and Milan - Monza lines), one with direct current at 650 V from a third rail (Milan - Varese), and finally the three-phase system on the Valtellina line. The tests of the electric power lines at 3,000 - 3,300 Volt, at frequency 15 - 16.7 Hz, powered by the Campovico hydroelectric plant were carried out between 26 July 1902 and 4 September 1902, while tests on the Lecco - Colico - Chiavenna and Colico - Sondrio lines officially began on 15 October 1902. The passenger service was entrusted to a fleet of 10 electric railcars belonging to Class RA 32, while the freight was entrusted to the two locomotives of Class RA 34 numbered 34.1 and 34.2 (later E.430 FS). alt=Longitudinal section engineering drawing The electric locomotives, built by Ganz and Mavag in 1901 and with a power of 440 kW and a haulage capacity of 300 tons, easily out-performed the steam locomotives of the time. The electric railcars, on the other hand, proved insufficient for hauling passenger trains and, subsequently de-motored, they were transformed into passenger coaches of Class RBz. From 1928 the locomotives were removed from the Valtellina line and transferred to the stations at Bolzano and Fortezza where, from 1929, they were used as shunting locomotives to assemble trains of wagons in transit towards the Brenner Pass. ==Technical details== The design of the locomotive was unusual. It comprised two half-locomotives coupled back-to-back with a bellows joint in the middle of the cab. This gave the wheel arrangement of Bo+Bo, rather than the more common Bo-Bo bogie system in later years. Front and rear visibility was ensured by three glass panels and there were four more on each side. Windshield wipers and washers were not provided. Each half-locomotive had two axles with leaf springs. The four 150-horsepower traction motors were mounted coaxially on the axles, with a bellcrank linkage to the wheels, similar to that also used for the Valtellina electric railcars. The wheels and motors were covered by sloping bonnets, each equipped with four doors to allow maintenance. Current collection was by two bow collectors, controlled by groups of four cylindrical springs each. ==Brief history of the Valtellina lines== * Colico - Sondrio: inaugurated 16 June 1885, electrified 1901-1902 * Colico - Chiavenna: inaugurated 9 September 1886, electrified 1901-1902 * Lecco - Bellano: inaugurated 1 July 1892, electrified 1901-1902 * Bellano - Colico: inaugurated 1 August 1894, electrified 1901-1902 * Sondrio - Tirano: inaugurated 29 June 1902, electrified after World War I ==Preservation== E.430.001 is in the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan.

After the death of the Poznan bishop Bogufał from Czerlin (December 1264), the Poznań chapter took January 25, 1265 to his successor, the provost of Poznań's Pietrzyk. However, the Archbishop of Gniezno, Janusz, refused to approve the election and tried to impose his candidate, the dean of Gniezno, Falenta, who had the support of the Duke of Gniezno-Kalisz Bolesław the Pious. Under the pressure of Archbishop Pietrzyk, he resigned himself. The chapter took in his place the Archdeacon of John, but Janusz also rejected this candidacy and consecrated Falenta to the Bishop of Poznań. Then the chapter appealed to the Pope. Through the bishop of Wroclaw, Tomasz Falenta, he was called to appear in person at the curia, which he submitted to papal confirmation. After recognizing the case, Pope Clemens IV in the bull of May 22, 1267 annulled all previous candidacies and appointed one of his chaplains, Mikołaj, to whom he also gave the episcopal consecration to the post of the Poznań bishop. However, in the bullet against Falenty, the Pope used the wording venerabil fratrem nostrum V. episcopum quondam Poznaniensem, which suggests that he acknowledged the validity of his consecration.

It was named after the State of West Virginia which entered the Union in 1863. ==Geography== West Virginia Avenue is located in the northeast quadrant of Washington DC. It runs from K Street NE to NE York Avenue NE on a south-west to north-east axis. It intersects Florida Avenue as it exits the original design of Washington DC as designed by L'Enfant. It runs in the northern part of the Near North East neighborhood and is the border for the neighborhoods of Trinidad and Ivy City. It runs adjacent to Gallaudet University and Mount Olivet Cemetery. ==History== The avenue was not part of L'Enfant Plan. A large section north of Florida Avenue is located outside of his original design and the southern part cuts into blocks part of the plan. Prior to its installation, the only accesses out of the city where through Delaware Avenue where it crossed Florida Avenue (then known as Boundary Street) and at Maryland Avenue. The path follows a railway track that ran the same course going from Delaware Avenue NE, down I Street NE and then heading north-east out of the city. The railroad track was owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and was going to Baltimore. The area north of Boundary Road was made of fields with no significant structure until the late 19th Century. In April 1864, the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and the Blind (later renamed Gallaudet University) on the northern side of the railroad track off and Boundary Street. By 1893, several streets had been developed east of the track where the Trinidad neighborhood stood and the section north of Boundary Street was used to access the neighborhoods of Ivy City and Montello. In 1907, after many years of negotiations between the US Government, the railway companies and local citizen’s groups, Union Station opened. It became the only train station in the city where all trains entered the city.S.Res. 664 \\"Celebrating the centennial of Union Station in Washington, District of Columbia\\",110th Congress, 2nd Session September 17, 2008. U.S. Government Printing Office, GPO.gov As a result, the previous tracks were no longer needed as the new tracks followed Delaware Avenue NE out of the city. The local community saw an opportunity to build an access road out of the city on that same path. On October 21, 1909, the Northern Suburban Citizens' Association assembled in Langdon Hall passed a resolution to have West Virginia Avenue be improved as a public thoroughfare from 22nd Street NE to Florida Avenue as well as add sewer pipes.Northeast Suburbs Awake: Want Streets Improved - The Evening Star - October 22, 1909 - page 2 The following year, the Associations asked the District Commissioners to use the unexpended balances of appropriation to resurface the avenue on the same distance.Ask Street Improvement - Northeast Suburban Citizens Point to Urgent Needs - The Evening Star - June 17, 1910 The Northeast Washington Citizens' Association joined in to request that West Virginia be a thoroughfare as it would be the only one in that area.Ear-Burning Words - The Evening Star - October 11, 1910 - page 20 A right of way of a 1000 feet had been given to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and had been deeded to the United States on February 12, 1901.Bill for Removal of Property Yard meets Opposition - The Washington Times - March 4, 1912 - page 2 9000 feet of these had been made into West Virginia Avenue by 1910 with small portions being transformed into parks by then.Opposed to Giving Up the Property Yard - The Evening Star - December 12, 1910 - page 4 ===The Property Yard=== By the end of 1910, a bill was pending in the House to get the remaining. The District Commissioners objected to giving up about 600 feet of that right of way that was used as a property yard on square 857 between 6th Street and 7th Street NE. They argued that the land was needed for storage in the area. While they agreed that piles of stones and broken down carts were unsightly they argued that this would one day be hidden with a brick wall. In addition, if it was given up, the traffic from that avenue would end up on I Street that does not have an exit passage at Union Station, unlike K Street which goes under the tracks. On February 1, 1911, William R. Harr, acting Attorney General announced that the commissioners had no authority over the piece of land used for the yard. The Department of Justice determined that since the strip of land was vested to the United States, the commissioners only had authority to police it. This decision was forwarded to the Senate District Committee. This was a major victory for the citizens.Board has no Control, Law Department Says - The Evening Star - February 1, 1911 The Senate gave its approval on the resolution a few days later.Property Yard is Barred - The Evening Star - February 11, 1911 - page 2 On April 10, 1911, a bill was introduced in the Senate by Duncan U.

South of Florida Avenue, the old railway roadbed had been flanked by fences on the back of the properties built on either side. B & O's Old Roadbed - The Evening Star - May 9, 1911 - page 6 The Commissioners responded and argued again that K Street NE was the street that should be used as it is already wide and developed, unlike I Street. Extending West Virginia all the way to I Street would lead to the removal of the yard which would need to be relocated somewhere else in the area at an estimated cost of $50,000 with a waste of $10,000 from the improvements that have already taken place on the lot. This would be considered a damage to the public.Would Retain Yard - The Evening Star - May 19, 1911 - page 4 In the House of Representatives, Adam B.

Some conditions can cause the disappearance of vaginal rugae and are usually associated with childbirth and prolapse of pelvic structures. The rugae contribute to the resiliency and elasticity of the vagina and its ability to distend and return to its previous state. These structures not only allow expansions and an increase in surface area of the vaginal epithelium, they provide the space necessary for the vaginal microbiota. The shape and structure of the rugae are supported and maintained by the lamina propria of the vagina and the anterior and posterior rugae. The anterior and posterior columnae rugae are transverse vaginal support structures between which the transverse rugae exist. The cross section of the vagina normally forms a shape that resembles the letter 'H' due to these structures. Vaginal rugae disappear in those with an estrogen deficiency and those women who are older. The rugae can disappear with anterior vaginal wall prolapse which can occur when supports to the portion located between the vagina and bladder are damaged and the bladder bulges into the vaginal lumen. Vaginal self-examination includes visualizing the presence of vaginal rugae. Anatomists identified rugae of the vagina as early as 1824. == Development == The appearance and presence of vaginal rugae change over the life span of females and are associated with hormonal cycles, estrogens, childbirth, puberty and menopause. During gynecological examination of prepubescent girls, rugae can be visualized. The vaginal rugae change after menopause. In some older women the rugae are present but become flattened and difficult to see. In others, the rugae tend to disappear. == Clinical considerations == Other structures can be present on the vaginal wall though most of the time these can be differentiated from rugae. Vaginal cysts can be small protrusions into the vagina that can be felt or palpated by a clinician. Vaginal inclusion cysts can appear as small bumps and can develop after childbirth. Other small structures or protrusions can be Gardner duct cysts, patches of endometrial tissue, and benign tumors. These cystic structures can obliterate the rugae and is a clue to their presence. The absence of vaginal rugae seen in the normal vagina of a healthy woman may be an indication of a prolapsed bladder (cycstocele) or rectocele. An enterocele, or bulging of the bowel into the vagina can also cause vaginal rugae to disappear. The absence of vaginal rugae may also be an indicator of pelvic organ prolapse. Vaginal rugae disappear in those with an estrogen deficiency. == Childbirth == Vaginal rugae can disappear during the second stage of labor. After a vaginal birth the rugae are not visible and the walls of the vagina are smooth. By the third week postpartum the vagina has become much smaller and the rugae begin to reform on the vaginal walls. Six weeks after birth, the rugae have returned to approximately the same size as they were before the birth. The number of rugae after childbirth decreases. In women who have not given birth, the rugae are more prominent than in those who have given birth multiple times. ==References== Category:Human female reproductive system Category:Women and sexuality Category:Women's health Category:Anatomy Category:Gynaecology Category:Epithelium ","title":"Vaginal rugae"},{"id":"56593758","text":"– later known as Elisabeth Maria – was a Japanese Roman Catholic.

In 2015 she was named as Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed her life of heroic virtue. ==Life== ===Childhood and war=== Satoko Kitahara was born in Japan on 22 August 1929 to aristocrats as one of five children (four girls and one boy). Kitahara was descended from samurai warriors and was raised in a Shintō household (she was also descended from Shintō priests). The Kitahara's supported the Japanese war effort during World War II with both her father and brother-in-law being sent to fight. Her older brother was summoned to work in the Nakajima Airplane Warehouse which prompted Kitahara to join him there during the course of the war. Her time there was interrupted with frequent warning sirens due to continuous bombings and she even survived a U.S. bombing of the plant (sending her into deep shock) but contracted tuberculosis as a result of the attack. Her brother succumbed from pneumonia not long following this. In the warehouse she became appalled with the unchaste behavior of some of her colleagues and soon became dissolusioned after reports of Japanese atrocities during the war were made public. Over time she came to believe that the Shintō religion provided nothing for her. Her chance encounter with Roman Catholicism began her entrance into the Church after having seen Christian individuals and having attended catechism classes. But she looked towards the faith-motivated charitable works of some Christians and became fascinated with this. ===First exposure to Catholicism=== Kitahara developed an admiration for the work of Doctor Albert Schweitzer around this point and commenced her college education once the war ended. In March 1948, while a pharmaceutical student in the department of medicine at the Showa Women's College, she and a classmate took a stroll one afternoon in Yokohama. The pair asked themselves about the meaning of life which Kitahara came to question following a series of life events. One such event was avoiding death after a bus almost ran her over in 1935. Two siblings had died from illness in the war and she gave up her idea of becoming a concert pianist to turn towards medicine. Kitahara would often pass churches and felt compelled to look inside but was frightened and nervous to do so. But this March afternoon was when she and her friend noticed a man going into the church of the Sacred Heart which enticed the pair to follow him inside. Inside she was spellbound upon seeing a Marian statue (she did not know who it depicted) while in 1950 writing that she became overwhelmed with an \\"indefinable emotion\\". In the next few months she made a series of visits to more churches. It was not long prior to her graduation that - in March 1949 - she encountered a student who expressed happiness to the point where Kitahara inquired as to their cause of this. The student said that she began attending the same church that Kitahara had gone into back in 1948. Kitahara obtained her diploma in 1949 upon her graduation. Her father did not share her interest in Roman Catholicism but wanted his granddaughter (her niece) Choko to receive a good education. To that end he sent Choko to a school that the Mercedarian Sisters (who hailed from Spain) managed. Kitahara encountered the order when she accompanied Choko to the school and was awestruck upon seeing a Japanese nun wearing the Mercedarian habit. Sometime later Choko began attending Mass in the convent school and the Mother Superior invited Kitahara to attend upon seeing her with Choko. Over time she became an obsessive cinema fan and went to the movie theatre as often as six times a week. ===Baptism=== It was not long until the nuns were proving her with catechetical lessons and she began to attend morning Mass in the convent's chapel each 6:00am. Her father meanwhile had resolved never to oppose the aspirations of his children but disagreed with his daughter's approach to faith and decided to exchange ideas at dinner hoping to dissuade her. He urged her to recognize that the advance of science made religion obsolete while she countered that miracles defied science in several reported cases which empowered the need for faith and reason. Kitahara converted to the faith and received baptism on 30 October 1949 from Father Albert Bold (of the Divine Word Missionaries) in which she assumed the name \\"Elisabeth\\". Bold went through the list of saint names to see which one she would like to take. He came across that of Saint Elizabeth and told her of her service to the poor. Kitahara became excited and said with resolve: \\"I am taking that name. I am taking that name\\". Upon her baptism Bold gave her a rosary which Pope Pius XII had blessed. Her older sister Kazuko heard her mention that baptism made her \\"the bride of the Lord\\" and so volunteered to sew a white wedding gown. This gown became a visible pledge to consecrate herself to God. Kitahara assumed the name \\"Maria\\" upon her Confirmation and again wore her wedding gown. It was not long until she harbored dreams of becoming a Mercedarian nun herself. To that end she arranged to have one of the nuns teach her the Spanish language (a requirement). Her dreams would soon be realized to the point she packed a black dress (in preparation for becoming a postulant) and tucked a train ticket beneath her pillow. But the dream became shattered before she left after developing a high fever in which a doctor would diagnose her with tuberculosis. The Mercedarians could not receive a new postulant in poor health which saddened Kitahara and made her unsure of what God's plan for her was to be. ===Meeting Żebrowski=== In November 1950 - while helping her mother with household chores - she heard the store assistant from her older sister's shoe store call to her to meet a visitor. The visitor in question was the Polish Conventual Franciscan friar Zeno Żebrowski (1891-1982) whom the assistant believed was a priest (but was incorrect in that). Żebrowski had come to Japan in 1930 with Saint Maximilian Maria Kolbe in order to evangelize. The assistant told the friar that the store owner's sister was a Christian which interested the friar. His gaze upon her entrance became fixed to the rosary dangling off the sash of her kimono. He asked in Japanese if she was baptized to which she said that \\"I was baptized at the convent of the Mercedarians\\". He was pleased with this and startled Kitahara when he asked if she ever wanted to become a nun. This startled her because it was an innermost thought but nevertheless replied that she was interested in that path. Żebrowski assured her that the Blessed Mother would guide her and before leaving gave her a pamphlet on the late Kolbe. The assistant came to her home later that evening with the newspaper regarding the friar and some riverbank settlement of impoverished and homeless people known as Ants Town (Arinomachi). Kitahara wanted to help the children there but did not know how to contact the friar. That 1 December she was closing the shutters for the night when she noticed a robed figure running through the rain without an umbrella and realized that it was Żebrowski. Kitahara ran after him - also without an umbrella - and wandered the streets to look for him. He greeted her when she found him and he would soon introduce her to the Ants Town and the work involved with it. ===Ants Town=== Prior to Christmas in 1950 the friar came to visit her with Matsui Toru who was one of the unofficial leaders of the settlement . Toru asked her to help entertain the children, for which she used her pianist abilities to both instruct and entertain them. Toru and Kitahara worked together. Toru who was later baptized into the faith in 1953. Both she and Żebrowski collaborated to minister to the ill, the displaced, and the orphaned. Kitahara dedicated herself to alleviating the suffering of those whom the war had victimized. But she realized that she would be able to better help them if she became like them. To that end she renounced her wealth and status to live with the homeless and the outcast. Kitahara also resorted to rag-picking. It was not long until she led children in rag-picking expeditions and one of the participating adults was her own mother. In the beginning of 1951 she became a member of the Militia Immaculatae. Her dedication to the children was strong and her commitment to the Ants Town grew stronger with each person she was able to aid. ===Illness and death=== Kitahara died at 7:00am on 23 January 1958 due to tuberculosis. She was buried in a plot at Tama. Her mother entered the Church in 1962. ==Beatification process== From 1972 the beatification process had been called for with the Conventual Franciscans also taking an interest in the cause being opened. The order wanted to promote Kitahara's life and lobbied for her cause to Archbishop (later cardinal) Peter Seiichii who launched an initial investigation. The cause's formal launch came under Pope John Paul II on 26 January 1981 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Kitahara as a Servant of God and declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause). The cognitional process of investigation was launched in 1981 and closed in 1983 before the C.C.S. validated the investigation in Rome on 5 October 1984. The postulation later drafted a Positio dossier which documented Kitahara's life and virtues and which was published on 14 August 1997. This dossier was sent to the C.C.S. in 1998 for assessment. Theologians confirmed the cause on 12 June 2014 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 13 January 2015. Pope Francis confirmed that Kitahara lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue on 22 January 2015 and named her as Venerable. The current postulator for this cause is the Conventual Franciscan friar Damian-Gheorge Pătraşcu. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Official website Category:1929 births Category:1958 deaths Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:20th-century Japanese people Category:20th-century Japanese women Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Japanese Roman Catholics Category:Japanese social workers Category:People from Tokyo Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Japan Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis Category:Showa Women's University alumni ","title":"Satoko Kitahara"},{"id":"56593772","text":"Connor Austin Lammert (born August 31, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for Cyberdyne Ibaraki Robots in Japan. ==References== ==External links== *Texas Longhorns bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Japan Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Florida Category:Basketball players from Texas Category:Cyberdyne Ibaraki Robots players Category:Hiroshima Dragonflies players Category:Nishinomiya Storks players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Sportspeople from San Antonio Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida Category:Texas Longhorns men's basketball players ","title":"Connor Lammert"},{"id":"56593796","text":"Moussa Hirir (born 1 March 1984) is a Djiboutian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Djibouti national football team. ==Career== He played from 2008 to 2009 at Société Immobilière of Djibouti.

Jan Gerbicz, or Herbisz was a thirteenth century bishop of Poznan (around 1240-1297).Stanisław Karwowski, Biskupi poznańscy z drugiej połowy XIII wieku Roczniki Towarzystwa Przyjaciół Nauk Poznańskiego vol.43, (Poznań, 1915). He came from a noble family of Wielkopolska of the Nałęczów coat of arms and was the Son of Tomasz, castellan of Poznan. He may have had a legal education and probably started his spiritual career from the cantor office in Poznań, which he held in the years 1269-1276. In a document of June 6, 1278, is already called an archdeacon. It is also known that he was a member of the Gniezno chapter. On August 17, 1285, he was certified for the first time as a Poznań Bishop, but according to Jan Długosz, he received the bishop's consecration from the hands of Archbishop Jakub Świnka only in May 1286 in Ląd. From the beginning of his ministry on the Poznań throne, he was associated with the policy of Przemysł II and Jakub Świnka. Probably, on their initiative, he mediated in a dispute between Prince Henry IV Probus and Tomasz II Zaremba, bishop of Wrocław, who was the co-author of the privilege granted by that same prince to the Wrocław bishopric. In 1295, he took part in the coronation of Przemysl as the king of Poland, and after his murder in 1296, he was a signatory of the Curiatian system, under which Henry III Głogowczyk was to embrace southern Wielkopolska. He was a good administrator in managing the diocese. He bought several villages in Greater Poland, erected the altar of the Holy Trinity and Saint Jadwiga, founded by Przemysł II, founded the parish churches in Lusów (more precisely in 1288 he established the parish in the existing church from 1244) and Mieszków and collegiate church of St. Jacob in Głuszyna. In 1297 he obtained numerous estates for the Poznań bishops along with broad immunities in the Duchy of Czersk in Mazovia from Bolesław II Mazowieckie. He invested in the Magdeburg Law of Słupca and Śródka (which was part of the Poznań conurbation) and several villages. He also tried several times to sort out tithing in the diocese. The Gniezno cathedral gave a codex, including the decrees of Gregory IX, which is still in its collections written down on parchment. The exact date of death is not known, but the document from June 17, 1297 still has his name, while December 20 of the same year, Andrzej Zaremba sat on the bishop's throne. ==References== Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Poznań ","title":"Jan II Gerbicz"},{"id":"56593811","text":"The Count of Heiligenberg (from the House of Fürstenberg) took the place of honour in the Swabian Imperial College. The Swabian College of Imperial Counts (German: schwäbisches Reichsgrafenkollegium or schwäbische Reichsgrafenbank) was the gathering of the Imperial Counts and Imperial Lords of Swabia to safeguard their interests in the Imperial Diet, especially at its Imperial Council and in the Circle of Swabia. == History== The College was a development of various earlier bodies in the area, such as the 1407 Sankt Jörgenschild 'Knights' Society' (Rittergesellschaft) and the 1488 Swabian League. At the end of the 15th century, a College of Imperial Counts was a body intended to represent the interests of nobles of the status of count and below in the Holy Roman Empire. Initially Swabia was covered by the Wetterau College of Imperial Counts, since from 1495 Wetterau and Swabia both laid claim to a single vote at the Imperial Diet. It took until 1524 for the Holy Roman Emperor to firmly commit to a curial vote for the Imperial Counts of Swabia. The Imperial Counts of Swabia had a permanent delegation to the Diet from 1549 onwards - their envoys also represented the Frankish Imperial Counts until 1641, when they formed their own College of Imperial Counts. In 1579 the Wetterau and Swabian Colleges created the Dinkelsbühler Union, by which they internally resolved disputes between them without resorting to war and supported each other against other imperial estates. The Swabian College held regular meetings from 1533 onwards, but these were interrupted between 1630 and 1645 by the Thirty Years' War. The Colleges and Union were both dissolved along with the Empire itself in 1806. == Organisation == It was headed by two directors, known as 'Grafenhauptmänner'. Below them were adjuncts as well as other officials. Without their consent no council of counts could be summoned and the directors had to seek their advice on important issues. Together with a syndic, these officials and the directors formed the Collegiate Council. All of the officials were elected for an unlimited term and later for life. As a rule, the College's meetings took place at the same time as those of the Circle of Swabia. The heads of the member territories had the right to vote, but when a line went extinct it lost its voting rights. Initially the counts had to attend in person, but later they were allowed to send representatives. Only a simple majority was needed until 1613, when it was changed to a two- thirds majority. Directly holding an Imperial County was usually a prerequisite of membership, though from the mid 16th century onwards there were exceptions, such as 'realists' (i.e. those who held a territory actually but not directly), 'personalists' (those who had the status but not the territory) and those who had temporarily or permanently renounced possession of a territory. The College formed the 'Grafenbank' in the Swabian Circle Assembly, number 98 in the ordering of the Reichsfürstenrat. All its members (except Baden, added in 1747) were Catholics and so all belonged to the Corpus Catholicorum within the Diet. == Members (1792) == == Bibliography (in German) == * Gerhard Köbler: Historisches Lexikon der deutschen Länder.

This contains two townhouses: number 4 with the central entrance and two bays to the left, and number 3 with the right two bays and an entrance in the un-colonnaded section to the right (just out of view). William Henry Playfair designed Royal Terrace between 1820 and 1824. Together with the adjoining Carlton and Regent Terraces, the three streets are in a continuous line, cut only by Carlton Terrace Lane giving access to mews, leading around the eastern end of Calton Hill and surrounding Regent Gardens, the largest of the private gardens of the New Town. These streets, with Royal Terrace the grandest, were the showpiece of Playfair's conception for the Eastern New Town, intended to be grander than James Craig's original development.Youngson, A.J. (2001): \\"The Companion Guide to Edinburgh and the borders\\", Chapter 9 (Calton Hill), Polygon Books, Edinburgh, UK, The streets were named in connection with the visit to Edinburgh in 1822 of George IV. The extension was projected to reach from Calton Hill down towards Leith, although ultimately very little of the northern section was ever built.Report on The New Town Conservation Area by Edinburgh Town Council == Architecture == Royal Terrace is in the form of an extended, 121-bay 'palace front' of classical 3-bay (and one 4-bay) townhouses.Listed building information for 1 and 2 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 10 February 2018 Playfair's original drawings are held by Edinburgh University, including plans for the whole facade as well as individual sections.Edinburgh University William Henry Playfair Architectural Drawings 821-877 The houses are now all category A listed buildings. The design of the townhouses is unlike those in neighbouring streets. Door entrances and windows on the ground floor are arched and surrounded by V-chamfered rusticated stone work. Ten of the houses still have their original fanlights. The upper floors throughout are of polished ashlar stone with basements of droved ashlar. The houses are of two or three storeys with attics to the colonnaded sections.Listed building information for 3 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 24 February 2018Listed building information for 4 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 24 February 2018 The long symmetrical facade alternates between colonnaded and un-colonnaded sections, from east to west, as follows: Panorama of Royal Terrace, Edinburgh, reaching from Carlton Terrace in the east (extreme left), to Greenside Church in the west (extreme right) — this is probably the longest Georgian terrace in Europe, a straight, continuous structure measuring 360 metres from east to west. ==Construction== 40 Royal Terrace, the first house to be built in 1821, an example of a two-storey townhouse (with basement and attic) in a section without Greek columns Playfair hoped to attract \\"fashionable and wealthy people\\" to Calton Hill,Youngson, A.J. (1966): \\"The Making of Classical Edinburgh\\", pp. 155-156, Edinburgh University Press, but almost immediately he encountered competition from new developments to the western end of the New Town, in particular the Moray Estate. Building began in Royal Terrace in 1821, but was not completed until 1859–60. This was in contrast to Regent and Carlton Terraces which were completed in the 1830s. ==Length and 'Whisky row'== Royal Terrace is a continuous straight structure of about 360 metres, reputedly the longest Georgian terrace in Europe.Space and grace, The Scotsman, 28 September 2006 It is 30 metres longer than the Royal York Crescent (1791–1820) in Clifton, Bristol.Historic England, Images of England The Moray Estate claim a single built-up environment of nearly 600 metres,Michael Carley at al (2015): Edinburgh New Town: A Model CityThe secret garden, The Guardian, 8 July 2017 but unlike Royal Terrace, this is a series of unbroken streets rather than a single entity. Royal Terrace was known in Edinburgh as 'Whisky Row', supposedly because merchants living there had an unobstructed view of their ships coming into Leith Harbour. In fact, some wine merchants did come to live in the terrace, including John Crabbie (1806–1891), founder of John Crabbie & Company, responsible for Crabbie's Ginger Wine, who lived in number 22 from 1861 to 1891.Mitchell , Anne (1993), \\"The People of Calton Hill\\", p. 83, Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, == Former residents == Entrance to 4 Royal Terrace with original fanlight above the door Garden behind 11 Royal Terrace ===Listed by address=== *1 - John Colquhoun (1805–1885) sportsman and sportswriter and Sir Alan John Colquhoun *1 - Lucy Bethia Walford (1845–1915) novelist and artist, daughter of John Colquhoun *1 - Frances Mary Colquhoun (1836–) author, daughter of John Colquhoun *3 (or 5?) - William Paterson Paterson (1860–1939) theologian and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland *5 - Robert Kerr Hannay (1867–1940) historian *5 - Robert Flint (1838–1910) theologian and philosopher *8 - Alexander Ignatius Roche (1861–1921) artist, an important figure in the “Glasgow Boys” *15 - Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819–1900), Astronomer Royal for Scotland (1846–1888) *19 - Rev Robert Boog Watson (1823–1910) malacologist and minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his brother Patrick Heron Watson *19 - Francis Chalmers Crawford (1851–1908) FRSE, stockbroker, amateur botanist and ornithologist *20 - Charles Alexander Stevenson (1855–1950) lighthouse engineer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *21-22 - Charles Saroléa (1870–1953) Professor of French and writer on international affairs *22 - George Reid (1841–1913) artist *24, 38, 35 - James Cowan (1816–1895) Liberal Party politician, son of Alexander Cowan *25 - Alan Stevenson (1807–1865) lighthouse engineer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *25 - David Stevenson (1815–1886) lighthouse designer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *27 - Sir William Taylour Thomson (1813–1883) KCMG CB, military officer and diplomat *28 - John Crabbie (1806-1891) - founder of John Crabbie & Co, Crabbies Green Ginger etc.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1881 *28 - Roderick Ross (1865–1943) Chief Constable of Edinburgh City Police (1900–1935) *28 - Thomas Hutchison (1866–1925) landowner and politician, Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1921 to 1923 *32 - John Bartholomew (1831–1893) cartographer *32 - Thomas Brown (1806–1872) architect *33 - Lt Gen Thomas Robert Swinburne (1794–1864) and Adam Alexander Dawson (1913–2010) film and television author *35 - Alexander Cowan (1775–1859) papermaker and philanthropist, father of James Cowan and Charles Cowan - visited by niece Helen Bannerman, who was also born there *37 - Rev Prof William Stevenson (1805–1873) and Charles Cowan (1801–1889) politician and paper-maker, son of Alexander Cowan *39 - Donald Tovey (1875–1940) musicologist, composer, and musician 891 == Present use == The terrace is now in both commercial and residential use.

On the pages of history, he appears for the first time in 1319, when as the chancellor of the Poznań bishop he joined the delegation appointed by the papal judges, who was to hand the lawsuit against the Teutonic Knights on the trial between Poland and the Order on Gdańsk Pomerania. It is known that during this process he participated in the meetings of the court in Inowrocław and Brześć Kujawski. He was also included in the judgment of 1321 ending this trial as one of the witnesses. In the same period he received the post of Archdeacon of Poznań. In 1331 he was almost killed during the Teutonic military expedition to Greater Poland, when the Order's troops captured the Słupca. In 1335 he received the dignity of the bishop of Poznań. As a new bishop, together with Janisław I,Archbishop of Gniezno, he challenged the Order to the Roman Curia. During the trial in 1339, which took place in Warsaw between the Order and Poland, the defendant as a witness issued both a negative opinion on the rule of Władysław Łokietek in Pomerania and on the crimes committed by the Teutonic Order. He gave up his claims, like the rest of the bishops, in 1343 at the conclusion of the Kalisz peace. In 1344, he started the reconstruction of the Poznań cathedral in the Gothic style. He died on 14 April 1346 and was buried in the cathedral. ==Creativity== Several hymns have been written to our times in honor of the Mother of God and saints. Presumably, he also composed an inscription beginning with the words of Hic iacet in Tumb, engraved on the grave of Bolesław the Brave founded by one of his predecessors on the episcopal throne, Bogufała II. According to the accounts, Bishop Jan was also a musician playing the zither. ===Musical Works=== *Salve salutis janua (sequence for the celebration of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in 16 verses),published by G.

An insight into Herlihy's character is given in a review of the report by the internationally esteemed Irish author Colm Toibin \\"He had spent many years in Rome and was rather disappointed to be returned to an Irish backwater.

The tournament spanned three days during the PlayStation Experience weekend, and took place in the Anaheim Hilton Hotel and Anaheim Convention Center. The first day of the tournament featured a Last Chance qualifier, which was won by newcomer Naoki \\"Nemo\\" Nemoto. The finals were won by Dominican newcomer Saul Leonardo Mena \\"MenaRD\\" Segundo, who defeated Hajime \\"Tokido\\" Taniguchi in the final match. ==Capcom Pro Tour== The Capcom Cup was the final tournament of the 2017 season of professional Street Fighter V competitions, the Capcom Pro Tour. Players could qualify for the 2017 Capcom Cup by competing in the fifteen Premier Events, the few dozen smaller tournaments, several online tournaments, and the 2017 Evolution Championship. The 30 players who had accumulated the most points in these events automatically qualified for the tournament. ==Tournament background== The top eight portion of the tournament took place at the Anaheim Convention Center. The 2017 Capcom Cup took place over the course of three days, beginning with the Last Chance Qualifier played at the Anaheim Hilton on Friday, December 8. Featuring 164 players from 18 different countries, the champion of the Last Chance Qualifier automatically qualified for the bottom seed of Capcom Cup itself. The Top 32 phase of the Capcom Cup took place on Saturday, December 9. Tournament organizers decided to stick to a traditional bracket system, foregoing the group tournament system that was originally announced. The group tournament system was planned in an effort to make timing more accurate, and the Capcom Cup team stated that they were still looking into it as a possible alternative for future events. The finals of the Capcom Cup, featuring the top 8 players of the event, took place during the PlayStation Experience in the Anaheim Convention Center. ==Participants== Du \\"NuckleDu\\" Dang, the winner of the 2016 Capcom Cup, announced on November 27 that he would not attend the 2017 edition of the tournament, giving up his auto-qualification to the runner-up of the 2016 tournament, Ricki Ortiz. As the seeding of the Capcom Cup is fully based on the overall leaderboard ranking, Ortiz obtained the seed number 31, ranking only above the Last Chance qualified competitor Naoki \\"Nemo\\" Nemoto. Nemo faced top-seed Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley in the first round of the tournament, while Ortiz faced Evo 2017 champion Hajime \\"Tokido\\" Taniguchi. The first round of the tournament also featured a match between the high-level Japanese players Kenta \\"Fuudo\\" Ai and Yusuke Momochi. Veteran Japanese player Daigo Umehara secured the 17th seed during the 2017 Pro Tour, and Brazilian Didimokof secured a place in the Capcom Cup by winning the Latin America Regional Finals. Fujimura \\"Yukadon\\" Atsushi won three Premier Events during the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, ranking 4th in the overall standings. United Kingdom player Benjamin \\"ProblemX\\" Simon, meanwhile, won two Premier Events and two Ranking Events, ranking 6th in the overall standings. The 18-year old Dominican competitor MenaRD qualified for the Capcom Cup despite the high cost and difficulty of traveling to the United States during the Capcom Pro Tour, coupled with the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria. Sponsored by The Rise Nation, MenaRD was ranked 25th when the tournament began. MenaRD's first round was against Ibuki-player Ho Kun Xian. ==Tournament summary== ===Last Chance qualifier=== Of the 164 entrants, the winner of the Last Chance qualifier was Naoki \\"Nemo\\" Nemoto, who was already considered one of the favorites to win the event. Nemo was unable to qualify for the Capcom Cup due to a lack of free time, and had only competed in five events during the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour. Playing with the character Urien, Nemo played against Lee \\"Infiltration\\" Seon-Woo three times during the tournament. The two first faced off in the Winner's Semifinals, where Nemo defeated Infiltration's Menat 3–1. After beating Brian \\"Brian_F\\" Foster in the Winner's Finals by a 3-2 margin, Nemo faced Infiltration again in the Grand Finals. Here, Infiltration opted to switch to his old character of choice Juri. This switch paid off in the first set, as Infiltration beat Nemo 3-1 and forced a bracket reset. However, Nemo adjusted his play and scored a 3–1 victory of his own in the second set, winning the tournament. Brian_F finished third place after losing to Infiltration in the Loser's Finals. ===Main tournament=== Tokido finished the 2017 Capcom Cup in second place. Nemo knocked top-seed Punk into the loser's side during their first match of the second day, and was then knocked into the loser's side himself after losing to Daigo Umehara. Nemo went on to defeat Ryo \\"Dogura\\" Nozaki, Didimokof, and Masato \\"Bonchan\\" Takahashi in order to make it into the Top 8. Punk lost to Naoki \\"moke\\" Nakayama in the fourth round of the loser's side, missing the Top 8 by one game. MenaRD, playing with the character Birdie, managed to remain on the winner's side for the majority of his run through the tournament, defeating high-level players such as Xian, Kazunoko, Umehara in the quarter-finals, and Itabashi Zangief in the semi-finals. MenaRD was knocked out of the winner's side in the next round by Tokido, who was playing with the character Akuma. After winning the loser's final against Nemo, MenaRD faced Tokido once again and managed to reset the bracket with a 3-2 match. Tokido controlled the fighting space using Akuma's ranged fireball attacks and tried to keep MenaRD at a distance in order to frustrate him. However, using unique quirks of Birdie that are difficult to anticipate, MenaRD could unpredictably close the distance, consistently leaping forward to execute a special attack. MenaRD won the last match of the Grand Finals 3–1. ==Impact== The 2017 Capcom Cup showcased entirely different player characters than seen in 2016. Characters such as Ryu, Ken, and Cammy did not appear at all in the Top 32, and characters such as Guile, R. Mika, and Laura were all knocked out early. Characters that were considered middle-tier at the start of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, such as M. Bison and Rashid, took the place of these formerly high- tier characters. MenaRD's mastery of Birdie was particularly notable. Shack News stated that 2017 was an \\"amazing year ... for Street Fighter V's character diversity.\\" Each of the Top 8 competitors played with a unique character, resulting in a very diverse final day. Red Bull described MenaRD's success as \\"a beacon of hope\\" for the Caribbean fighting game community. Players from this region face difficulties traveling to events, and few Premier tournaments take place in the Caribbean. MenaRD had stated that he hoped to invest his winnings ($250,000 USD) back into his local community and bring about more successful players. In a recap video produced by Capcom, MenaRD said: \\"kids or teenagers that want to do something in competition, you know, they usually do baseball. They usually do basketball. But I want fighting games or esports, in general, to be an option in my country.\\" ==Reveals== During the final day of the Capcom Cup, Capcom announced Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, a collection of Street Fighter games that predate Street Fighter IV to be released in May 2018. Following the closing ceremony of the Capcom Cup, Street Fighter executive producer Yoshinori Ono revealed the six characters that would be incorporated into Season Three of Street Fighter V. The introduction of the character Sakura had been teased leading up to the event and did not come as a surprise. However, a second, unexpected trailer played directly after it, serving as cinematic opening for Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition. The live audience cheered in excitement sudden reveal of familiar Street Fighter characters such as Blanka, Sagat, and Cody. This trailer also revealed two new characters: G and Falke. Red Bull described Season Three's cinematic reveal as \\"the pinnacle of Capcom Cup 2017,\\" calling it \\"the most polished and hype-inducing cinematic trailers made thus far for Street Fighter V.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:Capcom Cup Category:2017 fighting game tournaments Category:2017 in esports Category:Esports competitions in the United States ","title":"Capcom Cup 2017"},{"id":"56594574","text":"Hala Urania is an indoor arena in Olsztyn, Poland.

He showed promise when winning his final start as a two-year-old and was considered a contender for the following year's classic races. In 1936 he was slow to find his best form and ran unplaced in both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby before recording an upset victory in the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse in September. As a four-year-old he again upset the odds to take the Eclipse Stakes at 20/1 but failed to win again and was retired from racing at the end of the following year. He later stood as a breeding stallion in the United States, where he had some success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Boswell was a bay horse, bred and owned by the American banker William Woodward Sr.. He was trained throughout his racing career by Cecil Boyd-Rochfort at his Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Boswell was probably the best horse sired by Lord Derby's stallion Bosworth who finished second in the St Leger in 1929 and won the Ascot Gold Cup in the following year. Boswell's dam Flying Gal was bred in the United States and finished third in the Alabama Stakes in 1930. She was a daughter of the French broodmare Filante whose other descendants have included Wonder Where, War Emblem, Dancing Spree and Lady Pitt. ==Racing career== ===1935: two-year-old season=== Boswell did not appear as a two-year-old until the autumn of 1935 when he was beaten in his first two starts before winning the Hurst Stakes. In the Free Handiacp, a ranking of the best British juveniles he was assigned a weight of 123 pounds, ten pounds behind the top-rated Bala Hissar. He attracted considerable attention as a promising colt and a possible Derby contender. ===1936: three-year-old season=== Boswell was beaten in the Column Produce Stakes on his three-year- old debut and then finished unplaced behind Lord Astor's Pay Up in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. He took his place in the field for the Derby on 27 May but after a brief effort approaching the straight he faded to finish unplaced as the Aga Khan's Mahmoud won from Taj Akbar and Thankerton. The colt was beaten again in the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot and was equipped with blinkers for the Lingfield Park Plate over one mile in which he was easily beaten by the four-year-old Fair Trial in the two-runner. After an unplaced effort behind Rhodes Scholar in the Eclipse Stakes he showed better form to take third place behind Esquemeling in the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York Racecourse in August. On 9 September at Doncaster Racecourse Boswell, ridden by Pat Beasley, started a 20/1 outsider for the 161st running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs. He had not been regarded as his stable's best contender for the event but moved into contention when both Precipitation and Flares were withdrawn. The other twelve runners included Mahmoud, Rhodes Scholar (the favourite), Thankerton and Esquemeling. Boswell started well before settling behind the leaders as Pizarro set the pace from a closely grouped field. Entering the straight, Pizarro dropped away and Fearless Fox went to the front followed by Boswell, Mahmoud, Thankerton and Magnet. The closing stages of the race developed into a \\"most exciting duel\\" between Fearless Fox and Boswell with the latter gaining the advantage in the final strides to win by three quarters of a length. There was a gap of three lengths back to Mahmoud, who held off Magnet to take third place. After the race Boyd-Rochfort said \\"I have always considered Boswell to be a great horse [and] told everyone to back him for the Derby\\". Pat Beasley commented \\"I always felt I would win... The funny thing about Boswell is that he has always been a good horse but has only just proved it. Possibly he is an autumn horse.\\" Boswell returned to Newmarket with heavy bandaging on his left hind leg, having developed what was described as \\"heel bug\\". On his final start of the season, Boswell finished second to his stablemate Precipitation in the Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmarket on 1 October. In 1936 Boswell earned £10,554 making him the second biggest money-winner of the year behind Rhodes Scholar. ===1937: four-year-old season=== Boswell began his third season with a defeat in the Heathcote Stakes and then finished unplaced behind Precipitaion in the Ascot Gold Cup, in which he apparently failed to stay the two and a half mile distance. For his next race he was dropped back in distance for the £9,283 Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 17 July and started at 20/1 in a six-runner field headed by Rhodes Scholar. Boyd-Rochfort expressed little confidence in the horse's prospects and William Woodward did not bother to attend the event. With Beasley in the saddle, Boswell took the lead early in the straight and recorded his second upset victory in a major race as he won by a length from Daytona, who had been racing along the stands-side rail on the opposite side of the track. Monument was a further length away in third while Rhodes Scholar, who appeared to be uncomfortable on the hard ground came home fifth. Despite very few of the crowd having backed him, Boswell was given a \\"cordial round of applause\\" as he returned to the unsaddling enclosure. ===1938: five- year-old season=== Boswell remained in training as a five-year-old but his form was disappointing. In June he made a second attempt to win the Ascot Gold Cup, but as in the previous year he made no impact and finished unplaced behind a stablemate as the race was won by Flares. At Newmarket in August he started 5/4 favourite for the Dullingham Stakes but came home last of the three runners, prompting comments to the effect that Woodward had made a mistake by keeping the horse in training. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Boswell an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Woodward retired Boswell fromracing at the end of 1938 and imported him to the United States where the horse stood as a breeding stallion until his death in 1949. Boswell was not conspicuously successful as a sire of winners but did get some good horses including: *Round View (brown, 1943) winner of the Flamingo Stakes, Monmouth Handicap and Whitney Stakes. *Lord Boswell (brown, 1943) winner of the Endurance Handicap, Remsen Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; second in the Preakness Stakes. *Cochise (grey, 1946) winner of the Massachusetts Handicap, Saratoga Cup, Arlington Handicap and Grey Lag Handicap. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1933 racehorse births Category:1949 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 20-b Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Boswell (horse)"},{"id":"56594753","text":"Todd Pace is an American competitive swimmer.

The game is a collection of three previous Mercenaries Saga games - Mercenaries Saga: Will of the White Lions, Mercenaries Saga 2: Order of the Silver Eagle and Mercenaries Saga 3: Gray Wolves of War. ==Gameplay== Merceneries Saga Chronicles consists of a collection of the three entries in the Mercenary Saga games; Mercenaries Saga: Will of the White Lions, Mercenaries Saga 2: Order of the Silver Eagle and Mercenaries Saga 3: Gray Wolves of War. All three titles play as tactical role-playing games games, playing similarly to the Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre series of games. The player directs a team of characters across a grid to battle a computer-controlled opponent team in turn based combat. In a character's turn, the player makes decisions in regards to moving a character on the grid within their movement range, and potentially attacking opponents if any are within the attack range. Damage is affected based on characters' proximity to one another and the overall map of the grid. Effectiveness of attacks are determined by a character’s attack power against the other character's defense, all of which are altered based on character's base stats, and alteration of said stats based on equipping items and changing classes of characters in the game's menus prior to starting battles. Successful attacks earn experience points and skill points, which in turn help characters level up and strengthen their stats, while \\"mana points\\", which are slowly accrued over the course of battle, are used in order to use more powerful attacks mid- battle. If a character loses all of their health through being attacked, they faint, and after 5 rounds of turns, they are removed from the specific battle and unable until the next battle. The game is won if the player makes the entire team fainted or removed from battle, and loses if the same happens to them. The three titles combined contain 82 specific story-based battles, along with more optional battles as well. ==Story== All three games revolve around the same basic premise: The game follows a group of mercenaries that start out with just taking random odd jobs, but eventually lead the group into various political and social drama over the course of their travels, while people increasingly join the group as the story progresses. The first title follows Leon, the leader of the \\"White Lions\\" mercenary group, who in their mercenary work, get wrapped up in an on-going war. The second title follows Claude, the leader of the \\"Silver Eagle\\" mercenaries, who end up searching for the antidote for a prince poisoned by an assassin. The third title follows Marion, the leader of the \\"Gray Wolves\\" mercenaries, who fights for the Kingdom against an uprising from the opposing Liberation Army. ==Development and release== The game was first announced on January 2, 2018, as a collection of the three previous games in the Mercenaries Saga series -Mercenaries Saga: Will of the White Lions, Mercenaries Saga 2: Order of the Silver Eagle and Mercenaries Saga 3: Gray Wolves of War. The game was developed by Rideon Japan, the original developer of all three entries, and prior to them, had previously developed the Adventure Bar Story mobile phone game. The game marks the first time that all three games were made playable in English on one platform; the first Mercenaries Saga was only released on mobile phones in Japan, while the second and third titles were released on mobile phone and Nintendo 3DS in both Japanese and English. Chronicles was released on January 18 in Japan, and on February 8 in North America and Europe. The three games are largely the same as they were in their individual releases, but do feature some minor changes to the first two entries in the series to make them consistent with the setup of the third entry. ==Reception== Reception for the game was generally positive; reviewers generally praised the game's core gameplay for being a good, if not simplified, recreation of the Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre games core gameplay, and for the collection containing a lot of content in compiling three titles in one release. Conversely, multiple reviewers criticized the weak story and overall generic presentation and graphics. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Role- playing video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Nintendo Switch- only games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:2018 video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Mercenaries Saga Chronicles"},{"id":"56594874","text":"US Sailing's Miami Olympic Classes Regatta is an annual sailing regatta at the US Sailing Center in Miami, the United States part of the ISAF Sailing World Cup.http://www.sailing.org/worldcup/miami_2018.php It hosts the Olympic and Paralympic classes.http://miami.ussailing.org/event-background-past-champions/ ==Winners== Winners of the regatta in each class: ===2.4 Metre=== *2002 – Tom Brown *2003 – Heiko Kroger *2004 – Jeff Madrigali *2005 – Stellan Berlin *2006 – Stellan Berlin *2007 – Stellan Berlin *2008 – Damien Seguin *2009 – Allan Leibel *2010 – Paul Tingley *2011 – Damien Seguin *2012 – Damien Seguin *2013 – Megan Pascoe *2014 – Megan Pascoe *2015 – Bjørnar Erikstad *2016 – Helena Lucas ===Men's 470=== *1993 – Mike Sturman & Bob Little *1994 – John Merricks & Ian Walker *1995 – John Merricks & Ian Walker *1996 – Matteo Ivaldi & Michele Ivaldi *1997 – Morgan Reeser & Bob Merrick *1998 – Larry Suter & Jonathan Farrar *1999 – Graham Vials & Magnus Leask *2001 – Kevin Teborek & Talbot Ingram *2002 – Steven Hunt & Michael Miller *2003 – Paul Foerster & Kevin Burnham *2004 – Mikee Anderson-Mitterling & Graham Biehl *2005 – Sven Coster & Kalle Coster *2006 – Nic Asher & Elliot Willis *2007 – Nick Rogers & Joe Glanfield *2009 – Onan Barreiros & Aaron Sarmiento *2010 – Anton Dahlberg & Sebastian Östling *2011 – Nic Asher & Elliot Willis *2012 – Mathew Belcher & Malcolm Page *2013 – Stuart McNay & Dave Hughes *2014 – Sofian Bouvet & Jeremie Mion *2015 – Luke Patience & Elliot Willis *2016 – Stuart McNay & Dave Hughes *2017 – Stuart McNay & Dave Hughes *2018 – Luke Patience & Chris Grube ===Women's 470=== *1993 – Allison Jolly & Lynne Shore *1994 – Allison Jolly & Lynne Shore *1995 – Anette Patrunky & Hanne Pilz *1996 – Kris Stookey & Louise Van Voorhis *1997 – Whitney Connor & Elizabet Kratzig *1998 – Whitney Connor & Elizabet Kratzig *1999 – Tracy Hayley & Louise Van Voorhis *2001 – Courtenay Dey & Linda Wennerstrom *2002 – Courtenay Dey & Linda Wennerstrom *2003 – Katie McDowell & Isabelle Kinsolving *2004 – Alina Grobe & Vivien Kussatz *2005 – Amanda Clark & Sarah Mergenthaler *2006 – Ingrid Petitjean & Nadege Douroux *2007 – Marcelien de Koning & Lobke Berkhout *2009 – Henriette Koch & Lene Sommer *2010 – Amanda Clark & Sarah Chin *2011 – Ingrid Petitjean & Nadège Douroux *2012 – Lisa Westerhof & Lobke Berkhout *2013 – Fernanda Oliveria & Ana Luiza Barbachan *2014 – Sophie Weguelin & Eilidh McIntyre *2015 – Jo Aleh & Polly Powrie *2016 – Sasha Chen & Haiyan Gao *2017 – Afrodite Zegers & Anneloes van Veen *2018 – Tina Mrak & Veronika Macarol ===49er=== *1998 – Marcos Soares & Fabio Matune *2001 – Andy Mack & Adam Lowry *2002 – Andy Mack & Adam Lowry *2003 – Tim Wadlow & Pete Spaulding *2004 – Tim Wadlow & Pete Spaulding *2005 – Morgan Larson & Pete Spaulding *2006 – Piero Sibello & Gianfranco Sibello *2007 – Morgan Larson & Pete Spaulding *2009 – Nico Delle-Karth & Nikolaus Resch *2010 – Manu Dyen & Stephane Christidis *2011 – John Pink & Richard Peacock *2012 – Nico Delle-Karth & Nikolaus Resch *2013 – Fred Strammer & Zach Brown *2014 – Jonas Warrer & Peter Ørsted Lang *2015 – Nico Delle-Karth & Nikolaus Resch *2016 – Diego Botin le Chever & Iago Lopez Marra *2017 – Dylan Fletcher-Scott & Stuart Bithell *2018 – Dylan Fletcher- Scott & Stuart Bithell ===49er FX=== *2013 – Martine Soffiatti Grael & Kahena Kunze *2014 – Sarah Steyaert & Julie Bossard *2015 – Alexandra Maloney & Molly Meech *2016 – Alexandra Maloney & Molly Meech *2017 – Martine Soffiatti Grael & Kahena Kunza *2018 – Victoria Jurczok & Anika Lorenz ===Elliot 6m=== *2009 – Lotte Meldgaard Pedersen, Tina Schmidt & Trine Palludan *2010 – Anna Tunnicliffe, Molly Vandemoer & Debbie Capozzi *2011 – Claire Leroy, Marie Riou & Elodie Bertrand *2012 – Lucy MacGregor, Annie Lush & Kate Macgregor ===Europe=== *1993 – Tine Moberg-Parker *1994 – Tine Moberg-Parker *1995 – Marcia Pellicano *1996 – Jenny Armstrong *1997 – Laura Dunn *1998 – Tine Moberg-Parker *2000 – Soren Johnsen *2001 – Meg Gaillard *2002 – Meg Gaillard *2003 – Lenka Smidova *2004 – Lenka Smidova ===Finn=== *1993 – Richard Clarke *1994 – Jose van der Ploeg *1995 – Brian Ledbetter *1996 – Phillipe Presti *1997 – Sebastian Godefroid *1998 – Larry Lemieux *1999 – Rodrigo Miereles *2000 – Richard Clarke *2001 – Larry Lemieux *2002 – Andrew Simpson *2003 – J.

Dunkerton moved to Herefordshire from London at the age of 14. He was educated at Ibstock Place School, London, Orleans Park School, Twickenham, from 11 to 14, and then the Minster School, Herefordshire. ==Career== At the age of 19, Dunkerton, along with his then business partner Ian Hibbs, founded the fashion retail chain Cult Clothing Co with a £2,000 loan. In 2014, Dunkerton took control of his family's cider company, and brought in business partner Jeremy Benson (aka Bean), to work alongside his father Ivor, developing his palate and learning the craft of organic cider and perry making. In 2016, Dunkertons Organic Cider was moved from Herefordshire to a brand new cidery at the 250-acre Dowdeswell Park, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. In 2015, Dunkerton stepped down as chief executive of Superdry and was replaced by Euan Sutherland. Dunkerton left Superdry in April 2018 to concentrate on his other business interests. He owns The Lucky Onion group, which operates a small group of hotels, restaurants and pubs in the Cotswolds, England. In April 2019, Sutherland resigned as CEO of SuperGroup plc after Dunkerton won a bid to be reinstated to the SuperGroup plc board. ==Political activism== In the early 1990s, Dunkerton stood three times as a Labour Party candidate in the Cheltenham Borough Council elections. He stood in the St. Peter's ward in 1990, and in the Park ward in 1991 and 1992. In August 2018, Dunkerton donated £1 million to People's Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. He believes that the success of the Superdry business could not have occurred if Britain had been outside the European Union at the time. In the 2019 general election, he voted for the Liberal Democrats. ==Personal life== Dunkerton lives in Cheltenham. In February 2016, he sold just under £50 million of shares to fund his divorce settlement with his wife, Charlotte Abbot. He has two children, one stepdaughter and one daughter. In August 2018, Dunkerton married fashion designer Jade Holland Cooper. He owns a private jet, which he describes as \\"a tool rather than an indulgence\\". == References == Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:British company founders Category:Labour Party (UK) politicians Category:People from Cheltenham Category:People educated at Ibstock Place School Category:People educated at Orleans Park School ","title":"Julian Dunkerton"},{"id":"56594932","text":"Ultimo, pseudonym of Niccolò Moriconi (born 27 January 1996), is an Italian pop singer/songwriter and winner of the Sanremo Music Festival 2018 in the Newcomers category.

The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting occurred in his jurisdiction in February 2018 while he was Sheriff, and his department and deputies were criticized. In October 2019, the Senate of Florida voted to confirm Israel's suspension from the position of Broward Sheriff. On July 15, 2020, Israel was hospitalized with COVID-19. ==Career== Israel was born to a Jewish family in New York and raised in The Bronx and Long Island. His father was a homicide detective. He studied political science at SUNY Cortland. He became a patrol officer for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department in 1979. In the 1980s he was investigated for 10 incidents by Fort Lauderdale Police Department Internal Affairs division. The incidents included 6 accusations of \\"excessive or unnecessary force\\", shooting at a drug suspect, and using profanity. Israel was cleared of all wrongdoing. The records of five of these investigations, including two of the more serious incidents, which involved allegations of false arrest and theft, were later reported to be missing from the city records. Israel later worked in narcotics and later served as a SWAT commander. From 2004-08, he was the chief of police in North Bay Village. He left that position in 2008 to run for Sheriff, but lost the election. ==Broward County Sheriff== Israel was elected sheriff in 2012, running against incumbent Al Lamberti, and reelected in 2016. He was the first Jewish-American sheriff in Broward County history, and the second in Florida's history. He is known for being outspoken regarding gun violence and gun control, and opposes open carry legislation. In 2016, Israel began to implement a plan for deputies to have body cameras. ===Fort Lauderdale airport shooting=== In 2017, his office was criticized for failing to take control in the aftermath of the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, in which five people were killed and another six were injured, although the suspect was taken into custody within 90 seconds. According to a report issued by the Sheriff's Office, the failure was caused both by leadership issues and problems with communication systems. ===Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting=== Sheriff Israel visits victim Anthony Borges. In the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Israel came under scrutiny for both the actions of his deputies and his department's failure to act on warning signs about shooter Nikolas Cruz. On the day of the shooting, an armed sheriff's deputy was outside of the school but did not enter. Afterwards Israel criticized the deputy, saying that he should have \\"went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer\\". It was later discovered that there may have been at least two other deputies, that arrived later, who also did not enter the building. Coral Springs police officers who arrived at the scene were surprised to find that the deputies still had not entered the building. According to Israel, his agency had \\"been involved in 23 type calls involving the killer in some way, shape or form – or his brother.\\" However, through a Freedom of Information Act request CNN found that the sheriff's department had actually received 45 such calls about Cruz or his brother over the past decade. Israel rejected calls for his resignation, including one from State representative Bill Hager. On November 12, 2018, at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission's monthly meeting investigating the shooting, Israel admitted that he had changed the Broward Sheriff's Office written policy on active shooters, changing one word in a critical sentence about deputies engaging active shooters from \\"shall\\" go in after the shooter, to \\"may\\" go in after the shooter. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, a commissioner on the panel, admonished Israel, stating that \\"Words matter, and according to your policy, he did not have to go in\\". Judd was referring to Scot Peterson, the former Broward Sheriff's Office deputy assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a school resource officer, who resigned after it was revealed that he had not entered the building to engage the shooter. Peterson had waited outside the building with his gun drawn while shots were being fired inside. Israel's admission that he changed the verbiage of the active shooter policy clashed with his own statements at a news conference nine months earlier, just days after the shooting, when he announced that Peterson was being suspended without pay because \\"He never went in.\\" At the time of the shooting on February 14, 2018, Israel's re-written active shooter policy in effect on the day of the shooting provided that Peterson did not have to go in, but that information had not been brought to the public light until the commission meeting on November 15. During the commission meeting as Israel was being questioned, another Florida sheriff on the panel brought up that several of Israel's deputies on the scene of the shooting failed to take command, and seemed disengaged, or failed to act at all, driving back and forth outside the school during the shooting, or they were distracted. This eventually led to more disciplinary action against these deputies. ==Criticism and suspension== Sheriff Israel was criticized by his political opponents, who accused him of hiring his political supporters to work in \\"community outreach\\" jobs that consisted mostly of going to meetings and touting the Sheriff's Department's success. Ten such workers were hired since 2013, for salaries totaling $634,479. Israel responded to criticism of his team with \\"lions don't care about the opinions of sheep,\\" while also stating he doesn't spend more than ten seconds listening to his opponents' criticisms. On April 20, 2018, the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association opened a no-confidence vote for members, scheduled to conclude on April 26. This was the first no-confidence vote the union has brought against a sheriff. The no-confidence vote concluded 534–94 against Israel. In May 2018, the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association paid for a billboard just north of Sunrise Boulevard on Interstate 95 appealing to Governor Rick Scott and referencing their vote with the phrase \\"There is no confidence in Sheriff Israel\\". The association called for the governor to remove Israel following his handling of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. On January 11, 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially suspended Israel for his responses to the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting and Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. DeSantis appointed Gregory Tony as Israel's successor. On October 23, in a special session of the Florida Senate, the chamber voted 25–15 to uphold the suspension. Israel and Tony (against whom the Union members also voted \\"no confidence\\" in April 2020) were the leading contenders for the sheriff position in the 2020 Democratic Party primary, which Tony won in August that year. In Broward County, winning the Democratic nomination virtually guarantees election victory for Tony. ==See also== *Broward County Sheriff's Office ==References== ==External links== *.

The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 27 and was released on February 1, 2019, by Netflix and in selected theaters. ==Plot== In Miami, art critic Morf Vandewalt attends an art exhibition alongside his friend, Josephina, who works for Rhodora Haze, owner of the Haze Gallery and formerly a member of the rock band Velvet Buzzsaw. Unfulfilled in his love life with his boyfriend, Ed, Morf starts a sexual relationship with Josephina. Returning to Los Angeles, Josephina finds a dead man named Vetril Dease in her apartment building and enters his home to discover myriad paintings, some of which are partially destroyed. Josephina steals the paintings to show Morf and Rhodora, who become fascinated with Dease. Rhodora decides to exhibit several of his pieces in her gallery, where they're an instant success. The artworks also enchant Gretchen, Morf's art curator friend, and Piers, a former artist for the Haze Gallery. Rhodora keeps most of the paintings, and Morf and Josephina keep a small portion each. To ensure the rarity of the paintings, Rhodora orders gallery worker Bryson to transport half of them to storage. En route, a painting catches fire from his cigarette ash and burns him, causing him to crash into a gas station. After he heads inside to clean the burns, Bryson is dragged into a painting by a tribe of monkey mechanics. Researching Dease, Morf discovers he suffered from a troubled and abusive childhood that culminated in the murder of his father and a growing mental illness that permeates his works. Jon Dondon, a rival art gallery owner, has hired an investigator to uncover the same story. He attempts to reveal Dease's story to the press but is murdered when a mysterious hand hangs him by his scarf. Coco, Rhodora's former assistant who had just begun working for Jon, discovers his body. Morf sees a hand in a Dease painting suddenly move, which unsettles him, and he later discovers that Dease used blood in his paintings. Gretchen negotiates display of some of Dease's collection in the city gallery. In exchange, the city gallery will display an interactive piece titled Sphere that is owned by Gretchen's primary client. Meanwhile, Gretchen also sabotages Josephina's relationship with Morf by telling her he still cares for Ed. One night, Gretchen sticks her arm in one of the holes in Sphere, which malfunctions and severs her arm before she dies of blood loss. Despite her death, there is a spike in interest and demand for the Dease exhibit. Morf and Josephina break up after he finds out she is dating Damrish, a rising artist. Morf's visions worsen, and he urges Rhodora to stop selling Dease's artwork. She ignores him and, knowing he will write a negative article about the artworks, tries to sell them off as fast as she can. Morf hires Coco to dispose of the artworks. After breaking up with Damrish for him choosing not to display his art in a gallery, Josephina is mysteriously transported into a gallery where the paintings melt around her and cover her skin. As Morf puts the Dease artworks into his storage unit, he discovers a deactivated Hoboman, a robotic art piece he had earlier critiqued. Hoboman springs to life and chases Morf into a dead end, where, despite Morf's pleas for mercy, he snaps Morf's neck. The next morning, Coco finds Morf's body while Josephina's terrified image is seen on a wall of graffiti. Rhodora, now believing the deaths are connected to Dease, has all the artwork in her house removed. As she sits outside her house, the buzzsaw tattoo on her neck begins spinning and slashes her flesh, killing her. On the way to the airport, returning home to Michigan, Coco passes a homeless man selling Dease's paintings. Meanwhile, Piers, who has moved away to a beachside house, draws curving lines on the beach as the waves wash over them. ==Cast== * Jake Gyllenhaal as Morf Vandewalt * Rene Russo as Rhodora Haze * Toni Collette as Gretchen * Zawe Ashton as Josephina * Tom Sturridge as Jon Dondon * Natalia Dyer as Coco * Daveed Diggs as Damrish * Billy Magnussen as Bryson * John Malkovich as Piers * Alan Mandell as Vetril Dease * Mig Macario as Cloudio * Nitya Vidyasagar as Gita * Sedale Threatt Jr. as Ed * Pat Healy as the man from Parlack * Marco Rodríguez as Ray Ruskinspear ==Production== Dan Gilroy conceived the project after Superman Lives, a film which he had a hand in developing, was abruptly cancelled because Warner Bros. was not willing to produce it due to the large budget. He felt that he had wasted a year and a half on the film, but he ultimately made peace with the idea while sitting on a beach, a moment that inspired the final scene in the film. In June 2017, it was announced Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo had been cast in Gilroy's then untitled film, with him writing and directing the film, while Jennifer Fox would serve as a producer, and Netflix would produce and distribute the film. Speaking with Business Insider in November 2017, Gilroy teased the project saying: In January 2018, it was announced the title was Velvet Buzzsaw. In March 2018, Zawe Ashton, Natalia Dyer, Tom Sturridge, Daveed Diggs, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Billy Magnussen joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began on March 5, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders composed the score for the film, replacing Gilroy's frequent collaborator James Newton Howard. Director Dan Gilroy has stated that he wrote the Morf Vandewalt character to be sexually fluid because he \\"believe[s] that sexuality is far more fluid than society does.\\" ==Release== Velvet Buzzsaw had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 2019. It was released by Netflix on February 1, 2019. ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 61% based on 179 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"If you only watch one art-world satire with horror overtones this year — or most others — it should probably be Velvet Buzzsaw.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing: \\"It's a wildly inconsistent film, sometimes disappointingly clunky and as superficial as the world it's mocking, but it's also an ambitious piece of work with unforgettable imagery and an ace ensemble.\\" Emily Yoshida of Vulture wrote: \\"Writer and director Dan Gilroy is drawing from the same well of a bitter, morally compromised Los Angeles that he did for 2014's Nightcrawler, but Velvet Buzzsaw, as gleaming and sun- drenched as Nightcrawler is dark, is even more of an invective, and even more operatically heightened.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety called it \\"[Gilroy's] most cynical movie yet, with most of the venom concentrated in the character of the critic.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of C, writing \\"Gilroy's film needed to be 60% better or 20% worse in order to transcend the forgettable silliness of its existence, but it could stand the test of time as a lasting monument to the idea that our own personal taste is the only real thing we ever had.\\" ==References== ==External links== * on Netflix * * * Category:2019 independent films Category:2019 LGBT-related films Category:2010s satirical films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:2010s supernatural thriller films Category:2019 films Category:2019 horror thriller films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:American LGBT- related films Category:American satirical films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:English- language films Category:Films about fictional painters Category:Films directed by Dan Gilroy Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in California Category:Films with screenplays by Dan Gilroy Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:LGBT-related satirical films Category:LGBT-related thriller films Category:Male bisexuality in film Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films scored by Marco Beltrami ","title":"Velvet Buzzsaw"},{"id":"56595126","text":"Video gaming in Indonesia is a growing sector, holding the 16th largest market in the world and about half the Southeast Asian market in 2017. Over 40 million people in the country are active gamers, with mobile gaming being the dominant sector in terms of revenue. The development of video games in the country began with imported consoles and arcade centers, prior to developments of online gameplay in PC games and increasing prevalence of the internet cafés. Mobile games began gaining importance as smartphones were introduced. The Indonesian video game industry contributed about USD 1.1 billion to the national economy in 2015, despite only earning a small fraction of the local gaming revenues. Video game piracy is also prevalent across the country, making up the majority of installed games. ==History== Development of video games in Indonesia began in the mid-1980s through imported video game consoles such as the SNES, PlayStation and Xbox. Arcade centers also appeared, including major chains Timezone which started in Indonesia at 1995 and Amazone which was established in 2001. According to a designer from Namco Bandai, 1,000 of the 1,500 arcade machines distributed in Asia Pacific operated in Indonesia. Later on, by the late 1990s and early 2000s PC games such as StarCraft and Counter-Strike caught on alongside their online features. While most of the games were imported, there were several locally developed games such as Nusantara Online (a MMO which featured precolonial Indonesian history). There were also several localized games, such as Audition Online which was localized as AyoDance when it was launched for Indonesia in 2007. This contributed to a major boom in internet cafés (known locally as warnet, a portmanteau of warung internet), which had 2,500 locations across the country in 2002 and 5,000 by 2007. Due to the size of the Indonesian market, several games were localized specifically for the nation's audience. Examples include South Korean online first-person shooter Special Force which featured levels in Jakarta with the Monumen Nasional as a background and Harvest Moon. Matahari Studios, which closed down in 2010, is often credited as being the first local video game developer in the country, although it more often took outsourcing work from major studios instead of developing its own games. More recently, growth in the number of smartphone users have fueled growth in mobile online games, aided by the lower development costs associated for local developers. This change also allowed extension of the playerbase beyond typical youth gamers to a more casual demographic, with the game platforms including Facebook in addition to the application stores of iOS and Android. The 2018 Asian Games, held in Indonesia, included a demonstration event for Esports. ==Statistics== Indonesian video game sales, 2011-2017. According to gaming researcher Newzoo, in 2017 there were an estimated 43.7 million active gamers in Indonesia, spending a total of USD 879.7 million for an average annual spending of USD 20.13 per person. This made Indonesia the largest gaming market in Southeast Asia and 16th largest globally, just behind Taiwan and ahead of India. According to Euromonitor, the industry revenues had grown from IDR 1.812 trillion in 2011 to IDR 11.395 trillion by 2016, for a growth of 44.4% annually. Another research from Unity Technologies found that Indonesia's video game market was the fastest–growing in Southeast Asia. Of the 2016 sales, about 98% was through internet retailing in form of software. Sales of video game hardware, including consoles and accessories, amounted to just around IDR 200 billion annually between 2011–2016. Approximately 56% of PC game players in Indonesia are males, with the 21–35 age group making up the largest demographic. According to Euromonitor, Sony consoles are the most popular with a 60.6% market share followed by Microsoft and Nintendo. Mobile games make up the majority of the revenues, with a 52% revenue share in 2015. ==Gaming culture== Despite declining in recent years due to the spread of better quality mobile internet, internet cafés are still prevalent in large cities and small towns alike with some providing higher–end computers for competitive gaming. Video Games Indonesia (VGI), founded in 2002, was the oldest gaming community in Indonesia prior to its shutdown in 2016. A 2013 study estimated the prevalence of video game addiction among Indonesian school students at over 10 percent, although its authors admitted that improvements to the study's methodology were required to draw a proper conclusion. ===Mobile gaming=== Mobile games are particularly popular in Indonesia, following growing internet penetration. Strategy mobile games such as Clash of Clans and Game of War: Fire Age were the most popular titles in 2014. There is also a significant competitive scene, with eSports tournaments for mobile games such as Vainglory being held in Jakarta. ==Local industry== Indonesian stall in the 2016 Tokyo Game Show. The Creative Economy Agency (Indonesian: Badan Ekonomi Kreatif or Bekraf), formed in 2015, is the government body responsible for aiding in and managing the development of the gaming industry as part of its task to develop Indonesia's creative industries. It also holds an annual trade show known as Game Prime since 2016, which targets developers from Indonesia and the ASEAN. The Indonesian Game Association (Indonesian: Asosiasi Game Indonesia), formed in 2013, acts as the industry's trade association. The video games industry in Indonesia comprised 1.77% of the national creative economy (IDR 15.08 trillion) in 2015 according to Statistics Indonesia, with only 20% of developers being part of an association. It sustained at least 2,200 jobs in 2017. However, it contributed only 1.8% to the domestic market according to Anton Soeharyo, chief executive of local developer TouchTen. Director-general of informatics application Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan from the Ministry of Communication and Informatics gave a different figure, at 10 percent market share in 2016. Local game developers are targeted to hold 50 percent of the national market by 2020. In January 2016, chairman of the Indonesian Game Association Andy Suryanto estimated that there were around 1,000 active local game developers in the country. On the other hand, Unity Technologies gave a figure of about 400 developers producing over 1,000 games. Most of the new titles created are targeted towards the PC or the mobile market, with only a single game released for the PlayStation 4 in recent times and none for the other major consoles. Lyto, which publishes foreign MMOs such as Ragnarok Online and CrossFire, was the largest local developer in terms of revenue according to Euromonitor. Due to various factors, most new Indonesian video game studios do not stay in business for longer than five years. There have been several local mobile game hits, including incremental game Tahu Bulat in 2017. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has budgeted USD 2.1 million in 2015 to prepare a roadmap and support the gaming industry. ===Indonesian video games=== Some of the more notable games developed in Indonesia include: * Sentou Gakuen (2011) * Samurai Taisen (2013) * DreadOut (2014) * Orbiz (2017) * Legrand Legacy (2018) * Rage in Peace (2018) * Coffee Talk (2020) ==Rating== Indonesia has its own game rating system, the Indonesia Game Rating System which was launched by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics in 2016. It categorizes video games into the following classifications: * SU/Semua Umur (all ages) * 3+ (for ages 3 and up) * 7+ (for ages 7 and up) * 13+ (for ages 13 and up) * 18+ (for ages 18 and up) ==Piracy== Video game piracy is common in Indonesia, with BSA estimating 84% of all software installed in Indonesia throughout 2013 being unlicensed. Many stores in Indonesia offer illegally downloaded video games burned into DVDs for significantly less than its normal retail price, with Wii games being sold for IDR 20,000 (USD 2) or less. Due to the nature of Indonesian copyright laws, video game companies are required to bring the lawsuits against the illegal merchants to court, the cost of which would often outweigh the benefits. When online-only consoles such as the PlayStation 3 was released in Indonesia, authorized dealers initially controlled the distribution. However, once piracy took up these distributors withdrew from the country, causing a scarcity of authentic video game copies and raising the prices–resulting in further increase in piracy. ==References== Category:Indonesian culture Category:Science and technology in Indonesia ","title":"Video games in Indonesia"},{"id":"56595128","text":"Raymond E. 'Ray' Majerus (1924 – December 17, 1987) was an American labor leader who served as secretary-treasurer of the United Automobile Workers. From 1954 to 1960, Majerus was a key figure in the Kohler strike. ==Biography== Majerus began working for Kohler Co. in the early 1950s. In 1952, Majerus led a wildcat strike for which he was fired. He remained involved in labor organization efforts at Kohler, however, and played a role in the decision to affiliate the company-supported Kohler Workers Association with the United Automobile Workers. When the U.A.W. won its first contract with Kohler in 1953, one of the provisions insisted that Majerus be barred from working at the plant. Despite the ban, Majerus served as a union representative and was a key figure in the Kohler strike that lasted from 1954 to 1960. The union eventually won the strike, and Kohler was forced to give workers back pay. In 1965, while working as a U.A.W. staff member in the Wisconsin-Minnesota region, Majerus traveled to Selma, Alabama to march for civil rights. Majerus was elected director of the Wisconsin-Minnesota region of the U.A.W. in 1972. Eight years later, in 1980, he was elected secretary- treasurer of the United Automobile Workers, the second-highest position in the union. In 1982, Majerus sought the presidency of the United Automobile Workers. He was an early front-runner, but ultimately lost to Owen Bieber. In addition to his union positions, Majerus also served as a member of the Democratic National Committee from Wisconsin. He died on December 16, 1987, of a heart attack. ==Personal life== He was the father of basketball coach Rick Majerus. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1987 deaths Category:United Auto Workers people Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:Democratic National Committee people ","title":"Raymond Majerus"},{"id":"56595159","text":"Tellam Balaraju is an MLA of Polavaram Assembly Constituency in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.

The episode was written by Shannon Hamblin and Kristen Cloke, and directed by Glen Morgan. It aired on February 28, 2018, on Fox. The episode's title is base64 code for \\"Followers\\" and the tagline for this episode is \\"VGhlIFRydXRoIGlzIE91dCBUaGVyZQ==\\", which translates to \\"The Truth Is Out There\\" in Base64. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, Mulder and Scully deal with various forms of artificial intelligence; and the episode is told with minimal use of dialog. ==Plot== A machine learning chatbot is released to the public via Twitter. It very quickly gets manipulated by some racist internet trolls and becames a nazi bot and is ultimately switched off. The sequence of visual montages ends with a warning to all humans and blends to the usual intro. Fox Mulder and Dana Scully visit a fully automated sushi restaurant. The restaurant is called Forowā, which in Japanese translates to FOLLOWER. It is spelled in Katakana Japanese. After they pick their selection on a screen, they both are occupied interacting with their smart devices. While Scully enjoys her sushi, Mulder receives the wrong food: a blobfish. He disturbs the chefs, which also are robots, and leaves the kitchen. He refuses to leave a tip and, when trying to get his credit card back, finds it is stuck in the slot. When trying to use force, an alarm goes off and the restaurant starts shutting down. Scully uses a chopstick to forcefully open the door so they can get out. Mulder realizes that his card is still in the restaurant, but gives up on getting it back. Scully is informed by her smart device, that her \\"Whipz\\" (an automated taxicab service) is arriving. She enters the back of the car but before she is able to say goodbye, the driver-less vehicle closes its door and she is driven away. On the way to her home, she becomes alarmed because the car is speeding and ignoring her requests to slow down. Mulder enters his own car and drives off. They are both constantly bothered by review requests. Scully returns home and immediately tries to call Mulder, but their phones refuse a connection. Scully's home alarm system refuses her code and is activated. She has to call in the false alarm and is billed $250 for it. When going to bed, Scully is shocked when a message, suggesting to buy more hair styling cream, arrives seconds after she throws her empty tube in the trash bin. When dismissing the message, she accidentally drops a glass container to the ground, which shatters. Her cleanup is disturbed by the sudden arrival of a robotic vacuum cleaner delivered via drone in front of her door. Scully, assuming it is a gift from Mulder, lets the robot clean the mess, but eventually gets fed up with it and puts it back in the packaging. Her attempts to reach customer support to return it fail. One-by-one, Scully's appliances malfunction and the fireplace goes out, but gas is still flowing out. She tries to light a candle, but breaks the match. Meanwhile Mulder is tricked by his GPS to drive back to the restaurant, which is still upset and has his credit card. He instead grabs a map and navigates by himself. At home he calls his bank to report the \\"stolen\\" credit card but is unable to get through to a human operator. Mulder checks outside the house and sees a mid-sized drone flying in front of him. He initially dismisses it as a child's toy, but after more annoying attempts to spy on him he destroys it with a baseball bat. Three bigger drones appear and collect the remains. Still trying to get into contact with his bank, Mulder is bothered again by the restaurant, still trying to get a tip out of him. Mulder suddenly discovers that his house has gotten populated by mini-drones and escapes by driving away in his car. He drives to Scully's home, where she has just smelled the leaking gas. The robotic vacuum cleaner is about to light the match when Scully breaks out of the house with a fire poker. The explosion throws both agents onto the grass. Both their phones refuse to let them dial 9-1-1. When they try to get to the office, they find themselves being chased by the drones again and ditch all their traceable electronics. The chase proceeds to a warehouse, where the agents are pursued by quadrupedal robots. After being shot at and facing an industrial robot, Mulder eventually tips the restaurant 10%, and the machines retreat and everything goes back to \\"normal\\". In the last sequence of the episode, Mulder and Scully are having breakfast together in a human-operated diner, paying with paper money and still focusing on their smart devices. Scully decides to put her phone aside and gently touches Mulder's hand, to which he reacts by turning his phone's screen down. They both sit contemplating and holding hands. ==Production== In August 2017, it was announced that Kristen Cloke and Shannon Hamblin would be writing an episode based on a story by Glen Morgan, who directed the episode. This was the first X-Files script to be written by Cloke and Hamblin; Cloke (who is Glen Morgan's wife) had previously guest- starred in the fourth-season episode \\"The Field Where I Died\\"; and Hamblin has worked as Morgan's writer's assistant. Director Glen Morgan was inspired to tell a story visually, without dialog. Morgan had done a similar type of episode for Space: Above and Beyond, a TV series he co-created with X-Files writer James Wong, which starred Cloke. ==Reception== \\"Rm9sbG93ZXJz\\" received very positive reviews from critics.

To this end, he dispatched the Jesuit friars Francisco Sazi and Tomás de Arrevillaga who obtained guarantees from the Sultan that they would be allowed to safely preach. There were continued incursions from pirates based from Sulu and Mindanao leading the governor-general to retaliate harshly. In 1744, he faced a revolt led by Francisco Dagohoy who had several grievances against Spanish authorities and members of the Roman Catholic Church. Dagohoy took up arms on the island of Bohol. Francisco Dagohoy, his followers, and eventually their successors would continue to rebel for 85 years until 1829. The Dagohoy Rebellion became known as the longest rebellion against Spanish authorities in Philippine history. Gaspar de la Torre died on 21 September 1745. By virtue of a royal decree issued earlier in August 15, 1734 the highest governing person in the Philippine Islands was to take responsibility of running the government in case of death of the incumbent governor-general. By consequence, the position of acting governor-general of the Philippines was occupied by Archbishop Juan de Arechederra, Bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia, upon Gaspar de la Torre's death. In addition to the position of governor-general, the Archbishop also assumed the position as president ad interim of the Real Audiencia on the same day.Barquilla 1990, p.624 == See also == * Juan de Arechederra * Francisco Dagohoy * Dagohoy Rebellion == Sources == * Baquillas, José Barrado.

The episode was written by Benjamin Van Allen, and directed by Holly Dale. It aired on March 7, 2018, on Fox. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the brutal animal attack of a little boy in Connecticut, while suspecting darker forces are at play. ==Plot== At a park in Eastwood, Connecticut, a little boy named Andrew sings a theme song from a children's show while playing with his \\"Mr. Chuckleteeth\\" toy. While Andrew's mother, Diane, is distracted by a phone call, the boy spots a life-sized version of Mr. Chuckleteeth meandering in the forest. When she turns around, Andrew has disappeared. As Diane frantically searches for the boy, Andrew has followed Mr. Chuckleteeth into the forest. A few hours later, a group of police investigators, including Andrew’s father Rick, discover Andrew's mangled corpse. Because the killing of a law enforcement officer's child puts the case under FBI jurisdiction, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully investigate. While Mulder initially suggests that the culprit could be a coywolf or, more exotically, a hellhound, Scully observes during the boy's autopsy that the neck injuries which killed the boy were most consistent with being shaken to death. Mulder finds a substance resembling sand or salt on the boy's ankle. While the town gathers to mourn the death of the boy, Mulder goes to the house of Chief Strong, head of the local police. Mulder notes they have several books on the town's history, which includes witchcraft trials. He interviews the chief's daughter Emily, who was with Andrew at the park. Emily tells Mulder and her mother Anna that she saw Mr. Chuckleteeth in the forest before Andrew was killed. Back at the police department, Rick searches the sex offender database and finds a man named Melvin Peter. When Scully and Chief Strong look for Rick, they spot him racing away in a patrol car. Chief Strong and Scully chase after him. Rick reaches Peter's house and breaks in, brandishing a gun. Mulder, Scully, and Chief Strong find that Peter is not home, but discover numerous pictures of Peter performing as a clown at children’s parties. Peter's closet contains a caged monkey, clown costumes, and a Mr. Chuckleteeth mask and shoes. Meanwhile, Emily is lured outside her house by a character from one of her children's programs standing on her lawn. She is later found dead, murdered in the same manner as Andrew. Mulder notices a salt circle around the body, suggesting use of witchcraft. When Peter returns to the neighborhood, Rick attacks him. Mulder confronts Chief Strong and forces him to admit that he has been unfaithful to his wife, knows witchcraft is involved and that Peter is not their suspect. At the park, a crowd gathers to watch Rick brutally beat Peter, who denies killing the children. The police arrive and try to disperse the mob; when they fail, Mulder fires his gun into the air. Rick is taken off of Peter, but suddenly pulls his service weapon and shoots Peter in the head. After Rick is put on bail, he goes home to confront Diane about an affair she had with Chief Strong. Diane leaves the house and drives to a freeway. There, she runs into the hellhound in Andrew's form and flips her car when swerving to avoid it. Rick breaks into Chief Strong’s house, where he encounters Mr. Chuckleteeth. Rick chases Mr. Chuckleteeth to the front of the house, where he finds Chief Strong has come home and is now pointing a gun at him. Mulder and Scully arrive to find that Chief Strong has shot Rick dead. After fleeing his house, Chief Strong finds Diane's overturned car on the road and follows what appears to be Diane into the woods, failing to notice her mauled corpse on the forest floor (having been killed by the demon). Mulder and Scully visit the park where Andrew disappeared and head into the woods. Chief strong finds his wife, Anna, standing in a salt circle in the woods holding a grimoire. As Strong comes to realize his wife summoned the demon to get revenge on Diane for the affair, the hellhound kills him. Mulder and Scully find Anna standing over Chief Strong's body and rush over to stop her. Anna casts another spell, causing her to suddenly burst into flames and die. Afterwards, Scully and Mulder leave the town. As they drive away, a piece of playground equipment starts spinning on its own. ==Production== ===Filming=== Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons. The episode was directed by first-time X-Files director Holly Dale, who was announced as a director in August 2017. ===Writing=== The episode was written by staff writer Benjamin Van Allen, his first writing credit for the series. He served as a writer's assistant in season 10. Van Allen spoke of his inspiration for this episode in an interview: Van Allen's idea for \\"Mr. Chuckleteeth\\" came from an old British kids TV series called Jigsaw, where one character is named Mr. Noseybonk. ==Reception== \\"Familiar\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 78% with an average rating of 6.38 out of 10 based on 9 reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN called the episode \\"a solid, self contained monster-of-the-week creep out, that went really dark at times, but faltered a bit under unnecessary, and muddled, messaging\\" and scored it a 7.4 out of 10. Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire said \\"It’s genuinely impressive how much “Familiar” felt like a vintage “X-Files” episode, given that both its writer (newcomer Benjamin Van Allen) and director (veteran Canadian Holly Dale, the second woman hired to direct this season and fourth total across the show’s 218 episodes) have never worked on the show before now. Clean and direct in its standalone approach, it wasn’t the most twisty of mysteries, but did deliver the sort of supernatural weirdness we remember fondly from the show’s earliest years.\\" In its initial broadcast in the United States on March 7, 2018, it received 3.46 million viewers, which was up from the previous episode, which had 3.23 million viewers. In December of 2018, Tim Surette at TV Guide named Familiar's Mr. Chuckleteeth the best TV villain of 2018, saying \\"If you've ever watched any kids' television shows, you know that they're full of messed-up sh--. In \\"Familiar,\\" The X-Files went back to the classic monster-of-the-week format with Mr. Chuckle Teeth, a toy based on a character from a children's series who comes to life and murders people. It's actually a demon, but even if it wasn't, we still would have peed our pants.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:The X-Files (season 11) episodes Category:Television episodes about demons Category:Television episodes about witchcraft ","title":"Familiar (The X-Files)"},{"id":"56595221","text":"\\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" is the ninth episode of the eleventh season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. The episode was written by Karen Nielsen, and directed by James Wong. It aired on March 14, 2018, on Fox. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, Mulder and Scully, while investigating human organ theft, uncover a mysterious cult consumed with macabre rituals. The tagline for this episode is \\"I want to be beautiful.\\" ==Plot== At a makeshift operating theater in the Bronx, two surgeons harvest a man of his organs, killing him in the process. The operation is interrupted by Juliet, a young woman who kills the surgeons by driving metal spikes through their chests. She manages to secure most of the organs and delivers them to a nearby hospital with a message: \\"I will repay\\". Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are drawn to the case because evidence suggests that it was a ritual killing. The police dismiss Mulder's speculation and believe the murders are related to an organ theft ring, pointing out that one of the surgeons had his medical license revoked and was an associate of the Russian mafia. Meeting at a church, the agents briefly debate the nature of faith. Scully confirms that all legal organ donations have been accounted for while Mulder has found no trace of illegal sales on the dark web. Mulder links the killer's message to a psalm about God's vengeance, and notices that iron bars matching the murder weapon's distinctive shape have been removed from the church fence. Because of this, Mulder comes to believe that the murders are driven by divine wrath instead of demonic worship. A conversation with a priest leads them to Juliet, who tells Mulder and Scully that her sister Olivia joined a cult. Meanwhile, the missing organs are taken to the home of reclusive TV star Barbara Beaumont and her partner Randolph Luvenis. Beaumont has formed a cult which consumes human organs to offset the aging process; despite being eighty-five years old, Beaumont appears to be thirty. The effects are only temporary, leading Luvenis to surgically conjoin himself to others, parasitically feeding off them to reverse his age. Together, they have been feeding organs to their followers and plan to conjoin them to Barbara in the hopes of giving her eternal youth. However, tensions arise when the stolen organs are not enough to feed the cult. As Luvenis leaves to steal the remaining organs from the hospital, a cult member offers himself as a sacrifice to sustain the others. After he stabs himself, he is eaten alive. Knowing that the stolen organs can never be used in a transplant, Mulder and Scully arrange for a tracking device to be placed in a heart for Luvenis to retrieve. They follow the signal to Beaumont's house and attempt to gain access, unaware of Juliet's presence. Luvenis, suffering accelerated ageing without a host, undergoes surgery to attach himself to Olivia. Once inside the house, the agents are overpowered by Beaumont's followers, who throw Scully down an elevator shaft. Mulder is rescued by Juliet, who kills Beaumont with a metal stake to the chest. Beaumont's death dishearten her followers, allowing Mulder to escape. As he tries to locate Scully in the basement, Mulder is confronted by Luvenis, who has the appearance and strength of a much younger man after being conjoined to Olivia. Despite his boasts of gaining immortality, Juliet kills him. Despite being doomed to die with Luvenis, Olivia claims she was happy with the cult. Juliet surrenders to Mulder. Scully is found to be safe, having been cushioned by trash thrown away by the cult. In the aftermath, Mulder and Scully return to the church. Mulder acknowledges the power of faith, suggesting that his atheism is because he does not need faith rather than because of a lack of it. ==Production== ===Filming=== Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons.

Nielsen also served as the script coordinator for seasons 10 and 11. Nielsen's inspiration for the episode was revealed in an interview with SyfyWire: Even though the episode is the penultimate episode of the season, Nielsen felt she wanted the final scene of the episode to relate to the upcoming conclusion. She wanted everything to lead up to William, trying to build some momentum that she felt was needed. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 100% with an average rating of 7.57 out of 10 based on 8 reviews.

Reflecting on his difficult childhood, he resolves to find the Cigarette Smoking Man to learn the truth about his nature. Mulder and Scully receive a call from Monica Reyes, warning them that William has been taken into custody and is being escorted to a government warehouse in Maryland. Scully, who has been struggling with illness and visions of the future by way of her psychic link with William, predicts that he will not be there. Mulder infiltrates the building, but is forced to kill the agents and Mr. Y before he can question them and he finds no trace of William. Scully identifies a cluster of lottery winners in north-eastern Tennessee, which she believes is a side-effect of William's presence. Mulder picks up the trail but is himself followed by a government agent. William hitches a ride with a truck driver, only to terrify him with his powers.

With the help of Sarah Turner and Brianna Stapleton--the two girls at the center of the \\"Ghouli\\" episode--and Sarah's friend Maddy, Mulder finally locates William in a hotel in Norfolk. He convinces William to talk to him as a unit of soldiers, lead by Erika Price, locate the agent's car. The agent is dead, having been torn apart by William. Price's unit descends on William's hotel room and attempt to arrest him. William turns his powers on them, causing them to explode. He nearly loses control and kills Mulder, but regains his composure and flees the scene as the media descends on the hotel. In a bid to buy Mulder more time, Scully contacts right-wing online webcaster Tad O'Malley and claims that the incident at the hotel was part of the project to release a man-made pathogen developed from an alien virus. Mulder is named as the source for the story, prompting Director Kersh to order Walter Skinner to shut down the X-Files once and for all and to dismiss Mulder and Scully from duty. Scully receives another vision, this time of Mulder's death and pleads with Skinner to help her save him. Mulder follows William to an abandoned factory on the coast. Scully arrives shortly afterwards and Mulder suggests that they give up trying to find William because he does not want to be found and because they cannot protect him. Scully refuses to back down, pressing Mulder for details when the real Mulder arrives; the Mulder Scully spoke to was William in disguise. As the two chase him through the factory, Skinner realizes that they have been followed by Reyes and the Cigarette Smoking Man. The Cigarette Smoking Man forces the car to run Skinner down. Skinner shoots and seemingly kills Reyes and attempts to outrun the car; Skinner is seemingly crushed between two cars. The Cigarette Smoking Man confronts William (still under the disguise of Mulder) on the waterfront. William taunts him, challenging him to kill \\"Mulder\\". The Cigarette Smoking Man shoots him in the head and he falls into the water, mirroring Scully's vision of Mulder's death. The real Mulder appears, shooting the Cigarette Smoking Man, who realizes that he has killed William. He falls into the water and his body is carried away by the current. In the aftermath, Mulder and Scully comfort one another. Scully accepts that while William is her biological child, she was never a mother to him and that she and Mulder were never meant to raise him, describing him as an experiment that was implanted in her. Having finally learned the truth about William's parentage, Mulder struggles with the knowledge until Scully reveals that she is pregnant with his child, a seeming impossibility. As the two embrace, William resurfaces from the water elsewhere, conscious and alive. ==Production== ===Filming=== Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original first five seasons.

He explained his reason for a four part mythology arc in this interview with TVInsider: When asked about the possibility of a twelfth season, Carter said there are still more files to be uncovered \\"in those drawers in Mulder's office.\\" Carter says, \\"the truth is always out there, and it's open to be being explored.\\" Still, he stated that he was satisfied about this episode being the series finale. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== \\"My Struggle IV\\" received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 31% with an average rating of 5.49 out of 10 based on 13 reviews.

At age 12 he was apprenticed to a City of London jeweller. He went to work for a private bank. When Henry Thornton joined it during the 1780s, the name was Down, Thornton & Free, or just Down & Co. In 1815 both Thornton and Richard Down, an original partner, died, and a new partnership was formed that involved Scott. It traded as Pole, Thornton, Free, Down & Scott, with Henry Sykes Thornton as one of the incoming partners. Initially a Calvinist of the Church of England, Scott became a Calvinistic Methodist. He attended the Tabernacle Chapel, City Road, Moorfields, He later joined a Congregationalist chapel in Stoke Newington. In 1816 he was one of the founding committee of the Peace Society. In a tract of 1817, his address is given as Islington. The bank failed in the Panic of 1825. Scott suffered a large personal loss.

It started in London, Ontario, running northward for to the small town of Wingham. It originally planned to continue north to Southampton or Kincardine, but instead joined the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway (WG&BR;) at Wingham. The route was primarily used for farm shipments, and was nicknamed the \\"Butter and Egg Special\\", while passengers complaining about the rough ride constructed the backronym \\"Let 'er Hit and Bounce\\". The line started and ended on lines operated by the Great Western Railway (Ontario) (GWR), and the route and construction was supervised by that company. Construction began in early 1875 and completed by the end of the year, officially opening for passenger traffic in January 1876. In 1882, the line fell under the control of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) as part of their purchase of the GWR, and its original name disappeared as part of the 1 April 1893 GTR amalgamation. GTR's 1918 bankruptcy and subsequent reformation as part of Canadian National Railways (CNR) led to the line becoming the Exeter Subdivision. The central section was abandoned in 1941, leaving the portion from London to Ilderton at the south end of the route as the Ilderton Spur. The northern section from Clinton to a grain silo in Centralia retained the Exeter name. The Ilderton Spur was abandoned in 1988, and the Exeter Sub was purchased in 1990 by RailTex, who continues operation as part of their Goderich-Exeter Railway. ==History== ===Origins=== One of the main promoters of the LH&BR; was Patrick Kelly, a reeve who operated a sawmill and factory at Blyth, about north of London. At that time the closest railway was the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway (B&LH;) at Clinton, some away and only reachable by wagon, making export unprofitable. The B&LH; had no need to run through Blyth, so Kelly began discussions with businessmen in London, pitching them the idea of opening up the vast agricultural areas north of the city, as well as potentially capturing some of the laker trade on the upper Great Lakes. Kelly was able to interest a number of London businessmen in the idea, including John Carling and his brother William, sons of Thomas Carling, founder of the Carling brewery. On 22 November 1880 a meeting was held in London, Ontario to judge interest in the idea of a line running through the farms north of the city and then on to a port on Lake Huron. Having seen the town's fortunes improve with the arrival of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1854, the proposal had strong support. The company was incorporated on 15 February 1871, with the charter proposal having two options for the northern end at either Southampton or Kincardine. Given the short route, and the lower cost of construction, a narrow gauge line was initially considered. When it was learned that the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway (WG&BR;) would be building branches to both of these port towns, the plans changed to meet the WG&BR; on its southern branch, running to Kincardine. The actual meeting point was not selected, although it would be somewhere in Stanley or Tuckersmith townships in Huron County. ===GWR involvement=== Further progress proved difficult. The directors knew they were unqualified to plan and build the line themselves, so they first approached the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), who at that time were building a new route to Sarnia to the north of London. The GTR proved uninterested, so the group next approached the GWR, which was helped due to John Carling being a member of the GWR board. The GWR was interested in the idea, but were concerned that the line might draw traffic off the Wellington, Grey and Bruce, which they had recently leased. They proposed ending the line at Blyth. At the time there was a basic formula used for fundraising, where townships along the route would buy shares in the company and then have them matched approximately 50% by the provincial government. The eventual subscriptions came to $311,500, leading to a payment of $178,630 from the government. A significant amount of the subscriptions came from townships on the northern end of the route, including Wingham and Kincardine, so the longer route to Wingham was eventually approved. Biddulph Township, and the town of Lucan within it, dithered on whether to fund the line. Situated just north of Ilderton, they were originally part of the surveyed route. But intense competition between the GTR and the GWR led the GTR to begin their Sarnia line, which passed through Lucan. The locals argued that there was no need to put up more money for another line. After repeatedly trying to get the township on-side, Lucan eventually decided to raise funds themselves. But as the process dragged on into 1873, the GWR gave up and moved the line to the west. Bypassing the township produced the long, gentle curve to the west, north of Ilderton. Lucan realized this was a problem, and 10 years later offered $18,000 to anyone that would build a spur to the LH&BR;, without success. ===Construction=== Construction finally began in early 1875, with the last spike driven at Wingham on 11 December 1875. Minor improvements were required, and the line opened for freight on 31 December 1875. The official opening train travelled from London to Wingham and back on 12 January 1876, meeting with great fanfare at the towns along the route. Passenger service opened on 17 January. Built to the exacting standards of the GWR's later work, the line was well built and came in on budget, rare for that era. The route was used primarily for shipping agricultural products, which gave it the nickname the \\"Butter and Egg Special\\". This proved rather profitable, and in 1879 it was stated that \\"the London-Huron&Bruce;, in proportion to its length (74 miles) is the best paying road in the Dominion of Canada\\". Passengers were not so impressed, and called it the \\"Let 'er Hit and Bounce\\", a play on its acronym, LH&B.; ===Changing hands=== The line operated under the GWR lease until August 1892, when the Grand Trunk Railway's (GTR) hostile takeover of the Great Western occurred. It remained nominally independent within the GTR until 1 April 1893, when the GTR amalgamated its operating companies in Ontario. This became part of Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1923 when they assumed control of the now-bankrupt GTR. CNR continued operation of the line as their Exeter Subdivision. ===Abandonment=== Lower rates of train travel, especially during the Great Depression, led to losses on what had previously been a very profitable line; in 1939 the line lost $9,000. In December 1940, CNR informed the towns along the northern section of the line that they would be abandoning the section between Clinton and Wingham, which included the section through Blyth. In spite of protests, a last ceremonial passenger train ran on 26 April 1941, an event that was widely covered in the local papers. Passenger service along the rest of the line ended in April 1956. In December 1987, the company applied for permission to abandon the section between Ilderton to Centralia, closing the section in 1988 and lifting the rails the next year. By 1 June 1989 the section was gone, with the metal shipped to a smelter in Pennsylvania. The short section between Hyde Park and Ilderton remained in use, as the Ilderton Subdivision, especially to service the collection of lumberyards at Ontario Highway 22, a short distance north of the wye in Hyde Park. The section south from Clinton to Centrailia also remained in service, retaining the original Exeter Subdivision name. This section was purchased by the Goderich-Exeter Railway, who continues to operate it as the Exeter Subdivision. The Ilderton Sub was abandoned some time in the early 1990s. ==Route== :From the Ontario Railway Map Collection, unless otherwise noted. The LH&BR; officially starts at the former GWR station in downtown London, a length of to Wingham Junction. However, the physical line starts at Hyde Park, a short distance west of London and now on the edge of its extended subdivisions. Measured from this point, the line is . From Hyde Park it runs north-northwest through Ilderton, Denfield and just west of Clandeboye. From there it turns more northward, running perfectly straight through Exeter (which gave it its later name), Hensall and Clinton. The land north of Clinton is somewhat hilly, and the line begins a somewhat more wandering route to the northeast, through Blyth and Belgrave before ending at Wingham Junction, just southeast of Wingham. There were two major connections, with the Buffalo and Lake Huron at Clinton, and the Wellington Grey and Bruce at Wingham Junction. It crosses the Guelph and Goderich Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway mainline to Sarnia, but did not connect with these. There were also two major spurs, one servicing a quarry a short distance north of Hyde Park, and much later, one servicing RCAF Station Centralia during World War II. ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * Category:Ontario railways Category:Standard gauge railways in Canada ","title":"London, Huron and Bruce Railway"},{"id":"56595570","text":"Harp Okulu SK, formerly known as Harbiye, is the sports club of the Turkish Military Academy based in Ankara, Turkey.

Likewise, Agile Learning proceeds in incremental steps and through an Iterative design which alternates between phases of learning and doing. The tutors rather have the role of a learning attendant or supporter.Longmuß, J., Höhne, B., Bräutigam, S., Oberländer, A. & Schindler, F. (2016). Agile Learning – Bridging the Gap between Industry and University. Proceedings of the 44th SEFI Conference. Tampere; https://www.sustainum.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SEFI_Agile- Learning_paper.pdfhttps://sites.google.com/a/scolibri.com/agiles-lernen/ In a narrower sense, it is intended to allow competence-oriented, media-based learning in the work process within companies. Beside this, the term can take several other meanings and is also often used within E-learning and Online Environments.Masullo, M., Messier, P., Tsantis, L. & Criscenti, D.: Agile Learning for Agile Manufacturing: An e-Learning Model; Society for Applied Learning Technology SALT'05 August 24–26, 2005 Arlington, VirginiaNoguera, Ingrid & Guerrero, Anna & Appel, Christine. (2015). The UOC's educational model: from collaborative learning to agile learning. Universitat Oberta de Catalunya == Background == Scrum is a framework for project and product management, in particular for agile software development. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. It has been developed from the experience that many development projects are too complex to be included in a full-scale plan, and an essential part of the requirements cannot be fully understood or defined up front. In order to eliminate these ambiguities, work is broken into actions that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints – with clear goals and regular feedback loops. During a sprint, progress and interim results are monitored in short daily meetings. At the end of a sprint, the results, the working process, and the cooperation are reflected upon and a new interval begins.Schwaber, K. & Sutherland, J.: The Scrum Guide - The Definitive Guide to Scrum: The Rules of the Game; http://www.scrumguides.org/ Nov. 2017 == Agile Learning in companies == === Requirements === The framework of scrum can be well adjusted to the requirements of companies for a dynamic, workplace- integrated competence development and the subsequent frequency and intensity with which employees have to educate themselves further and acquire new skills. As complexity and dynamics in the internal and external specialization and collaborations increase the need for training and competence development increases as well. In terms of competence development, organizations therefore have concrete needs that are not met well by classical forms of qualification (e.g. seminar courses, continuing education courses), namely: * \\"Reduce the time it takes an employee to acquire the necessary competencies to do their job in the most efficient and effective manner; * Change the learning context rapidly and in response to the real world; * Facilitate knowledge sharing within an organization; * Support a soft failure environment where mistakes have no impact on the real world, thus promoting a willingness to engage in measured risk-taking, focused on achieving a high level of polished performance in the real world:\\"Hansen, P. K.; Fradinho, M.; Andersen, B. & Lefrere, P. (2009). Changing the way we learn: towards agile learning and co- operation. In: \\"Learning and Innovation in Value Added Networks\\" - The Annual Workshop of the IFIP Working Group 5.7 on Experimental Interactive Learning in Industrial Management, 25–26 May 2009, ETH Zurich, Switzerland There is a need for the integration of knowledge and content management with collaboration technologies and for developing a new (online) manufacturing training methodology in order to train and build the manufacturing workforce of the future.Masullo et al., op. cit. Such learning environments and learning processes have as requirements: * High scalability, to enable qualification measures from a few hours to several hundred; * Content adaptability, to include new topics as quickly as possible; * Connectivity to existing organizational structures and software infrastructure in order to start with little effort So far, however, there are hardly any suitable continuing education formats for this need. One answer to this is the agile learning approach with its flexibility in relation to all three above mentioned requirements. In accordance with scrum and established psychological findings for an effective pursuit of goals,P. M. Gollwitzer, G. Oettingen: Goal pursuit. In: R. M. Ryan (Hrsg.): The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation. Oxford University Press, New York 2012, , S. 208–231 Agile Learning divides an extensive (learning) process into individual, manageable learning phases. Here, too, the three pillars of scrum of transparency, verification, adaptation apply. === Key elements === The key elements of agile learning in companies are: * Teams of peers with similar development goals and a broad spectrum of backgrounds * Coaches (internal / external) to support the learning process * Company stakeholders (management, human resource department) represented by a sponsor (\\"product owner\\" in Scrum). * Learning objectives which are broken down within the team into personal learning goals * Working on tasks from the actual working context * Sprints to reach sub goals/milestones. The coaches will closely guide this process * After completion the results will be presented to the project owner and be verified by him/her === Roles within agile learning === Parallel to Scrum, three roles can be described, which have slightly different tasks in Agile Learning. ==== Sponsor (\\"Product Owner\\") ==== * Defines the learning field and determines a suitable project * Creates the organizational framework * Is a liaison person into the organization * Receives the technical learning progress ==== Coach (\\"Scrum Master\\") ==== * Technical, didactic and methodical support * Moderate the process and guide the reflection * Support in the processing of learning objectives This role may be supplemented by topic/issue-specific experts ==== Team ==== * Personal learning goals in sprints * Collaborative, mostly digitally supported collaboration * Regular joint reflection on the learning process * Personal, social and professional developmentLongmuss, J., Grantz, T. & Hoehne, B.: Mediengestützte Arbeits‐ und Lernprojekte als Instrument der betrieblichen Kompetenzentwicklung. In: D. Ahrens, G. Molzberger (Hrsg.): Kompetenzentwicklung in analogen und digitalisierten Arbeitswelten – Gestaltung sozialer, organisationaler und technologischer Innovationen. Springer, Berlin 2017, == Agile learning in university == In agile teaching and learning, students take on the role of the client; the agile software development process in which the client is involved is replaced by the learning/teaching process with students and tutors as actors; the increments that implement new functionality in short cycles correspond to the continuous increase in students' abilities in the agile learning/teaching processB. Meissner, H.-J. Stenger: Agiles Lernen mit Just-in-Time Teaching. In: O. Zawacki-Richter (Hrsg.): Teaching Trends 2014: offen für neue Wege: digitale Medien in der Hochschule. Waxmann, Münster 2015, Agile methods can be incorporated into courses both as content and as the working method for students. Agile learning implies that learners create content and develop skills alongside teachers in a collaborative yet competitive environment mediated by technology. The role of the teacher is centered on facilitation and project direction from an informed perspective. Learners become self- directed, team-oriented, and individually resilient lifelong learners. A study on an implementation of the agile method into an online higher education context showed that the agile strategies incorporated into project-based learning facilitated team regulation and project management. == Potentials and limits of agile learning == In agile learning the participants may gain new competencies that are, unlike in classical formal education, directly linked to their work context. In pursuit of the individual problem-solving as well as in exchange with the learning team and the coaches, their competence increase becomes recognizable to themselves, so that successful learning strategies can also be harnessed in future. Therefore, the main potential of this approach lies in the practical relevance of the acquired competencies and in the demand-oriented communication of contents, techniques, and skills. Like any project-oriented teaching/learning method, agile learning reaches its boundaries when the goal is the systematic coverage of a pre-defined curriculum. Exemplary learning cannot ensure this. For subject areas where particular importance is attached to the completeness of learning content (e.g. safety at work or fire protection), classical further education formats are to be preferred. There, agile learning projects can only supplement training with a transfer supporting the sustainable implementation of the learning content in everyday working life. == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Learning Category:Projects ","title":"Agile learning"},{"id":"56595744","text":"Calliobothrium is a genus of cestodes in the order Tetraphyllidea.

It is a remake of the 2006 film of the same name by Susanne Bier. It stars Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, Billy Crudup, and Abby Quinn. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019, and was released in the United States on August 9, 2019, by Sony Pictures Classics. == Plot == Isabel (Williams), co-founder of an orphanage in India, travels to New York to meet a potential benefactor, Theresa (Moore), who is about to sell her company and seeking a worthy charity to donate to. Isabel is reluctant to travel to New York due to her responsibility at the orphanage and leave a boy whom she raised. Despite her frustration at having to travel halfway across the world, Isabel agrees to the meeting, which falls the day before Theresa's daughter Grace's (Quinn) wedding. Theresa invites Isabel to the wedding as a courtesy for her coming all this way to meet with her. At the wedding, Isabel is surprised to see Theresa's husband is her former flame, Oscar. During Theresa's wedding toast, she also discovers that Grace is in fact Isabel's own daughter by Oscar, who was supposed to have been given up for adoption. Isabel learns that after the couple parted ways, Oscar secretly returned and raised Grace himself, before meeting and marrying Theresa years later. Though denying she knew Isabel's identity beforehand, Theresa pushes Isabel to get to know Grace and reacquaint with Oscar, and finds repeated excuses to extend Isabel's stay. She even makes her (ever growing) donation contingent on Isabel remaining in New York. Eventually, it transpires that Theresa is dying of cancer—a secret she has kept from her entire family. Her efforts with Isabel have been to install her as a new mother figure for both Grace and Theresa's own eight-year-old twin boys. By the film's conclusion, all the secrets are out and the characters come to an understanding before Theresa's passing. Isabel briefly returns to her orphanage, inviting the boy she rescued and raised from infancy to join her in New York. == Cast == * Julianne Moore as Theresa Young, Oscar's wife and Grace's mother, a millionaire and benefactor whom Isabel must meet * Michelle Williams as Isabel Anderson * Billy Crudup as Oscar Carlson, Theresa's husband and Grace's father * Abby Quinn as Grace Carlson, Theresa and Oscar's daughter * Will Chase as Frank == Production == In February 2018, Julianne Moore was set to star in an American remake of the Danish film by Susanne Bier, and will see the leading roles changed from male to female. Diane Kruger was also cast. However, in April 2018, Michelle Williams replaced Kruger. In May 2018, Billy Crudup and Abby Quinn joined the cast. Principal production began in May 2018. == Release == The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019. Shortly after, Sony Pictures Classics acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, and set it for an August 9, 2019, release. == Reception == On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 44% based on 152 reviews, and an average rating of 5.76/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"After the Wedding benefits from solid casting and strong source material, yet proves stubbornly resistant to spark to emotional life.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Variety's Peter Debruge wrote: \\"This sensitive remake of Susanne Bier's overcooked Danish Oscar nominee has shrewdly been flipped from a male-driven meller to an emotional showcase for Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore.\\" Debruge praises the film for its subtlety, as it \\"strips away anything excessive, allowing subtext to surface in the quiet spaces between dialogue.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Bart Freundlich's American remake of the Bier film flips the gender of the main characters, yielding predictably strong performances from Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams but otherwise removing the teeth from a melodrama that grows increasingly preposterous as it crawls toward its weepy conclusion.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4, and wrote: \\"It's a morose and slow-paced and off-putting drama, in which even the joyous moments seem brittle and draped in melancholy.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a mixed review but praised Williams: \\"This is Williams’ spotlight, and it's worth slogging through some of the soapier-to-sludgier aspects to watch her ply her craft.\\" == References == == External links == * Category:2019 films Category:American remakes of Danish films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about families Category:Films set in Kolkata Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Mumbai Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films directed by Bart Freundlich Category:Films scored by Mychael Danna Category:Sony Pictures Classics films ","title":"After the Wedding (2019 film)"},{"id":"56595792","text":"Antonia \\"Toni\\" Bruha (born Antonia Spath; 1 March 1915 – 27 December 2006) was an Austrian resistance activist. After the war she became a translator and author. == Provenance and early years == Antonia Spath was born in Vienna shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. During the first six years of her life she and her elder sister grew up with their grandparents in Bohemia because their parents could not afford to feed them. Back in Vienna, once the financial situation improved for the girls' parents, she found her mother very strict. She grew up bilingual in German and Czech, later also adding Russian to her repertoire of languages. Her father, the son of an Erdberg coachman, who himself worked as a master-brewer at the Ottakringer Brewery, saw to it that she attended a Komenský (i.e. Czech language) school, and she was keen to pursue Slavic studies at a higher level, but this time her mother's uncompromisingly conservative convictions prevailed. In the end she embarked on an apprenticeship with Joseph Schindler, as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. She had made contact with Schindler through a Quaker Youth Group. Alongside her formal apprenticeship, the Quaker group provided English lessons. In return, she taught her colleagues, who had plans to set up a Quaker group in Prague, Czech. She was fascinated by the pacifist attitudes adopted by the Quakers: she found they fitted in well with the socialist precepts she had picked up from her father who had been politically active at the time of the Dual Monarchy. According to her own later recollections, Antonia Spath learned almost nothing about hairdressing, but she did manage to make three visits to Prague during her apprenticeship. == Gymnastics, politics and marriage == She became a member of a Czech workers' gymnastics club (\\"Dělnická Tělovýchovná Jednota\\" / DTJ). The times were becoming increasingly politicised, and membership of the club was restricted to Social Democrats. In 1933 Antonia Spath began writing, under the pseudonym Tanja Spatová, for the Czech language labour movement press, contributing to \\"Vídeňské dělnické listy\\" (\\"Vienna Workers' Pages\\") and \\"\\"Mladý dělnik\\" (\\"Young Worker\\"). It was at the DTJ that she met Josef Bruha, whom she later married. Bruha was a gifted gymnast and employed by Siemens as a factory foreman. He was also a former Republican Protection League (\\"... Schutzbund\\") member. In February 1934 he participated in the disturbances around the vast Rabenhof (apartment complex) and, as a result, lost his job. When the two of them married in 1935 their financial situation was dire, since Bruha had still been unable to find employment, and his wife's work as a hairdresser was poorly paid. Nevertheless, supported by her husband Antonia Bruha was able to fulfill \\"her life's dream\\" in 1936 when she enrolled at the university to study languages. It was partly in order to supplement the household income that she continued to provide poems and short stories, now under the pseudonym Tana Bruhova, to the Czech-language (and later also German-language) socialist press. However, an early casualty of the German annexation of Austria in March 1938 was the university's Faculty of Slavonic Studies which was closed down by the Nazis. Antonia Bruha never completed her degree. Inspired, no doubt, by developments in Germany, during 1933, Austria was also becoming increasingly fascist and dictatorial even before the German invasion. Josef and Antonia Bruha actively opposed Chancellor Schuschnigg's government. Together they would bicycle to the frontier with Czechoslovakia, in a wooded area near Preßburg, in order to collect bundles of Socialist and Communist publications, banned in Austria, that had been left for them by comrades. They then distributed the contraband publications in Vienna. == Anschluss and opposition == After the annexation Austria quickly became incorporated into an enlarged Nazi German state. Opposition activism became both more dangerous and, for the politically committed, more urgent. However, for the Bruhas the situation was complicated by Josef's work situation. Fourteen days after the Nazis arrived he was re- employed by Siemens not in his previous post as a foreman, but as a divisional head, in charge of a department containing 300-400 women, two mechanics and his own typist (according to his wife). In financial terms the Nazi take-over triggered a hitherto unknown level of prosperity for the couple. The Bruhas nevertheless joined the resistance group around Alois Houdek. Initially the group was restricted to members of the Czech minority, but it subsequently expanded to include members of the German speaking community who had not previously been politically engaged. Toni Bruha wrote and distributed leaflets encouraging opposition to the government. Group members escorted Jews, escaping from the evolving hardships and dangers of state-mandated antisemitism, to the Swiss frontier. Members also engaged in acts of sabotage. Josef Bruha believed that it was impossible to be certain that no one would be hurt when a target was attacked, so refused to engage in sabotage actions, but the time came when he was sent to Berlin on a training course: Antonia took advantage of his absence to participate. An action in which she took part involved setting fire to – one source uses the term \\"blowing up\\" – army facilities. Already pregnant, she cycled with comrades, carrying a large quantity of chemicals that had been smuggled out of a factory, to a block of ten military storage depots containing uniforms, weapons and food rations, in Lobau. No lives were endangered, she later maintained with evident satisfaction. Welcoming members from beyond the confines of the Czech minority made the group more vulnerable to infiltration, and towards the end of 1940 the group of worker-gymnast activists was penetrated by a Gestapo spy. Most would pay for their actions with their lives. The arrests began during the first part of 1941. By 1943 the authorities had detained one hundred group members of whom sixty-nine had not survived. Among those who perished, shot or beheaded, were Alois Houdek himself and Franz Narkowitz, who had been one of those involved, with Bruha, in the Lobau \\"event\\". Antonia Bruha had always wanted to have a child, but the timing of her pregnancy and of her daughter's birth, on 5 July 1941, was unplanned. It was shortly after Sonja's birth that Bruha became aware that their group contained a Gestapo informer. Her own arrest, together with that of her husband and her infant child, occurred around 15 October 1941. Josef Bruha was \\"of interest\\" to the authorities because of his former involvement with the Republican Protection League. However, they seem to have decided quite early on (and probably wrongly) that he was not involved in recent resistance activism, and after four days he was released for \\"lack of evidence\\". If fellow detainees had known of his involvement, they had stayed silent over it. Antonia Bruha was detained, however. == Under arrest == For two days following her arrest Bruha was held at the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna's Hotel Metropol in the Morzinplatz. Those first two days consisted of an unbroken series of interrogation sessions during which she was beaten \\"... with sticks. With all means possible\\". Soon after the interrogation began the infant Sonja was violently removed from her mother and taken away by a female member of the interrogation team. When Bruha moved to get her daughter back she was blocked, pushed and then beaten by two guards using their revolvers to hit her. For around a year the mother, whose parting memory was of Sonja's anguished yelling as she saw her mother beaten back by interrogators, was unaware of the child's fate. At least once she was told that her child was dead. Only after she had been transferred to Ravensbrück concentration camp, at least a year later, a fellow inmate would pass her a copy of a photograph sent by her husband from which she would be able to see that Sonja was alive. Then, on 8 October, she was placed in solitary confinement for around eight months in a building alongside the Elisabethpromenade in which the Gestapo were using the fourth floor.The sources are not consistent as to how long Antonia Bruha spent in each of several Vienna prisons where she was held before being transferred, in September or October 1942, to Ravensbrück. Her period of regular interrogations lasted around three months, during which time she was not permitted to change her clothes or wash herself. The sessions involved serious beatings which often left her unconscious. Sessions took place every two or three days. At the end of that she was required to sign both her own death warrant and those for twenty men and four women who had been in the resistance group with her. It later transpired that after being taken from her mother Sonja had been taken to the \\"Vienna Child Transfer Office\\" (\\"Kinderübernahmestelle\\"). There the chief nurse, without any authorisation, had sent the child to a foster family. This meant that Josef Bruha would be able to maintain contact with her. For the Gestapo Sonja was valued chiefly as a means to apply pressure to her mother, forcing her to testify against resistance comrades. Sources insist that Bruha resisted the pressure, however, and never betrayed anyone, despite being uncertain of her daughter's fate throughout the interrogations period.Elisabeth Welzig: Leben und überleben – Frauen erzählen vom 20. Jahrhundert, pp.27-32 == Ravensbrück == In September/October 1942 Antonia briefly faced a tribunal before being returned to the jail in Vienna. In October 1942 she was transferred to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in the damp flat countryside to the north of Berlin. She was one of thirteen women from the Czech and Slovak resistance sent together from the Vienna area. One of them was her friend Irma Trksak, sister to Franz Narkowitz who had been a member of the Lobau team (and paid with his life for his involvement). The journey lasted around for weeks. She was accompanied by a \\"Rückkehr Unerwünscht\\" (\\"Do not send back\\") instruction, which amounted to a death sentence. Through the mediation of Hermi Jursa they remained together on arriving, accommodated in the \\"Political Block\\" in which Rosa Jochmann was \\"Block senior\\" (\\"Blockälteste\\"). Jochmann's leadership went some way to mitigate the horrors of concentration camp life and, above all, to encourage camp inmates to coordinate opposition to the SS personnel running the camp on behalf of the Nazi authorities. Inmates were also encouraged to display practical solidarity with political detainees, the old and the weak. At the start Toni Bruha was set to work pushing \\"Lore\\", heavy little trucks on rails, after which she was sent to join the \\"tailoring\\" workshop. The camp medical centre was her third workplace. Her experiences here were the most horrendous she faced in the concentration camp. Nevertheless, thanks to her language skills her secondment here was probably what saved her life. A camp doctor, faced with the challenge of investigating 200 newly arrived prisoners from Poland, asked for a simultaneous translator. Antonia Bruha filled the vacancy. When a camp commandant came to collect her for \\"liquidation\\", the doctor exploded, \\"I can shoot her for myself. [Right now] I still need her!\\" (\\"Erschiessen kann ich sie selber. Ich brauche sie noch!\\"). Bruha lived through numerous brutal crimes by the SS \\"gynaecologists\\", Rolf Rosenthal and Percival Treite: agonising pseudo-medical experiments on the legs of Polish women, forced sterilisations, murders of newborns and recruitments for forced sex work. And yet, she was able to risk her life by smuggling drugs to internees in the political block and by carefully switching index cards in the medical centre. As a message-courier for the medical centre Bruha was also able to contribute in other important ways to the forced labour regime operating inside the camp, acting on behalf of the illegal international camp committee. She was, for example, involved in rescuing Toni Lehr, Gerti Schindel and Edith Wexberg. These three Jewish communists activists arrived at Ravensbrück from Auschwitz: they faced death. Death was also a major risk for any inmate caught helping them. Nevertheless, for weeks, while the SS personnel tried to find them among the inmates, they were successfully hidden in ever changing locations, while a Yugoslav inmate who was also a doctor operated on the arms of two of them to remove numbers from Auschwitz. (The third of them was too ill, with Typhus, to face the hazards of an operation at this point.) In the end all three were kept away from the camp authorities until, shortly before the war ended, they were smuggled out in a Swedish Red- Cross transport. As the Soviet army drew relentlessly closer from the east, a succession of so-called \\"evacuation marches\\" from the concentration camp at Ravensbrück set off on 28 April 1945, quickly becoming death marches. Those who could go no further were shot by the SS. Those too ill to march were simply left behind. Bertl Lauscher, Irma Trksak and Toni Bruha agreed that their best chance of survival would be to join one of the last columns to leave the camp, and then take the first opportunity to escape. By this point even the guards were simply running off, and the three succeeded in escaping through Poland and Czechoslovakia back to Vienna. The journey was not without adventure: it took them nearly four weeks to get home. Much of the city had been destroyed by bombs. The Bruhas' house was still standing, but it had no roof. Both with regard to family life and in respect of earning a living, re- establishing a \\"normal\\" existence presented huge challenges for the concentration camp survivors. == After Ravensbrück == By the time she arrived home Toni Bruha weighed just 20 Kg (44 pounds). The baby snatched from her back in 1941 was a toddler a few weeks short of her fourth birthday. The reunion was a fiasco as the child complained to her carer, \\"Auntie, this ugly old woman says she is my mother. My mother in the photo is a beautiful blonde lady! Send this one back, that's not my Mum\\". It would be some time before something approaching a normal mother:daughter relationship could be established. During her first year at home Toni Bruha was permanently ill as a result of her treatment and the conditions at the concentration camp. Nevertheless, once Sonja had started school, in 1946 she took a job with the \\"Russian Hours\\" section at \\"Radio Vienna\\" service of the national broadcasting company (RAVAG), translating German texts into Russian and Czech. She remained with the radio station for approximately ten years. (The Soviet occupation of eastern Austria ended early in 1955, after which audiences for Russian language radio programmes were no longer present in significant numbers.) She also wrote contemporary history contributions for the book \\"Österreich April 1945\\" (produced by Franz Danimann und Hugo Pepper) as well as providing contributions to the press, notably for \\"Vídeňské svobodné listy\\" (loosely: \\"Vienna Free Press\\"), the newly established Czech language newspaper in Vienna. == Against amnesia == Very soon after the collapse of Nazi Germany, Bruha was demonstrating a determination to ensure that the horrors of those times should not be forgotten. In 1947, as victim groups began to splinter along political lines, women who had survived the cells and concentration camps came together to form the \\"Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community\\" (\\"Oesterreichische Lagergemeinschaft Ravensbrück\\"). Toni Bruha was one of the founders. Fifty years later, along with fellow survivors and supporters, she was able to look back on some of the achievements to which she had contributed: an Austrian Memorial space set up at Ravensbrück, a Ravensbrück exhibition during the 1960s which was staged successively in Vienna, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Salzburg and other population centres, an accompanying Exhibition Booklet on Ravensbrück, designed principally for young people, which reached 40,000 copies, the organisation in Austria of international Ravensbrück meetings and much more. Antonia Bruha was also engaged over many years as the meticulous treasurer of the \\"Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community\\". Especially remarkable was her volunteer work after 1968 to create and built up the Ravensbrück Archive section in the Documents Centre of the Austrian Resistance. A collection of more than 800 files – documents, written memory pieces, trial documents covering the Ravensbrück and Uckermark concentration camps – provided and will continue to provide scholars and academics an important research resource. Long before 1978, after which visits by contemporary witnesses to the Nazi horrors were included on school curricula and organised by the Ministry for Education, Antonia Bruha was making her own arrangements to speak to groups of young people about her resistance and concentration camp experiences. She believed these presentations were hugely important. Her lively and direct narrative style penetrated the hearts of many young listeners and inspired the political and personal commitment in new generations, necessary to avoid any tragic repeat of those Nazi years. She also backed up her message with written contributions to magazines and newspapers. Finally, in 1984, her autobiography, \\"Ich war keine Heldin\\" (\\"I was no heroine\\"), appeared. Its focus was on the period between her arrest and the reunion with her daughter, four years later. By the time she addressed the annual \\"Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community\\" meeting as a ninety year old Antonia Bruha was suffering badly with Diabetes and undergoing regular hospital stays, though friends insist that her willin assertiveness of an energetic commitment to democracy and freedom remained impressive. She died on 27 December 2006, some weeks short of what would have been her ninety-second birthday. Her body is buried in Vienna's misleadingly named Central Cemetery. == References == Category:Ravensbrück concentration camp survivors Category:Austrian Resistance members Category:20th-century Austrian writers Category:Writers from Vienna Category:1915 births Category:2006 deaths ","title":"Antonia Bruha"},{"id":"56595802","text":"The Embassy of the United States of America in Pretoria is the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in the Republic of South Africa.

She moved to Los Angeles, California, in order to get into college. Her band, Winter, named after her last name, was conceived in Boston in 2012, and they soon released their first EP, \\"Daydreaming\\", on the next year, through Lolipop Records. The 4-track EP consists of dreamy-pop, indie rock compositions written by Winter. The band's next release was 2014's \\"Tudo Azul\\", also a 4-track EP; mostly of the lyrics on this release are sang on Portuguese. Winter's debut album, \\"Supreme Blue Dream\\", was released on March 10, 2015. Even though the album had moderated commercial success, it was critically acclaimed and spawned three singles: \\"Some Kind of Surprise\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Pretender\\", all of whom had music videos released. The band embarked on a 2-year international tour to support the album, touring mostly through the USA, Brazil and Argentina. Between 2016 and 2018, while still touring to support Supreme Blue Dream, Winter released several singles with accompanying music videos, including \\"All the Things You Do\\", \\"Jaded\\" and \\"Dreaming\\". The latter has reached over 200,000 plays on Spotify, becoming the band's most successful song so far. Meanwhile, the Winter band was joined by American duo Summer Twins, formed by sisters Chelsea and Justine Brown. Winter's second studio album, \\"Ethereality\\", was announced in February 2018, and is set to be released on April 6, 2018. \\"Ethereality\\" also marks the debut release by Everything Blue Records, Winter's official record label.Winter Facebook ===Samira's Infinite Summer=== While working with the Winter band, Samira also gave birth to a solo project entitled \\"Samira's Infinite Summer\\" in mid-2015. All of the demos for the project were recorded on Samira's bedroom and posted on Samira's Infinite Summer's Bandcamp page. A studio- recorded single, \\"Café\\", was released on December 2016 and promoted mainly through the Brazilian press, since its lyrics were written in Portuguese. However, the project's Facebook and Bandcamp pages were deactivated in 2017.http://www.samirasinfinitesummer.bandcamp.com ==Artistry== Samira is regarded for having a glittery, holographic aesthetic, which has accompanied her since her very first release as Winter. Her lyrics are known for mixing both English and Portuguese languages, which helped her to develop a following in Brazil and in the United States simultaneously. She also has a cult following in Japan. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! Year !

The network was started with $1M in donations from the Muslim community, and sought to grow by selling advertising aimed at young Muslims. It aimed to distribute its content through its website and apps, YouTube, Facebook, and occasionally in other outlets like movie theaters. The project was endorsed by Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, the Grand Mufti of Australia, and in April 2015 Irfan Yusuf endorsed the network in an editorial published in the Sydney Morning Herald. Guests have included Brian McDonald, the head of the AFP counterterrorism team, and in 2016 they interviewed Oliver Bridgeman, who alleged that he had been trapped in Syria after the Australian Government cancelled his passport. In October 2016 the OnePath Network produced Last Chance, a 45-minute film about a young Muslim man tempted into a life of selling drugs and violence, which was shown in movie theaters in Australia.

He studied at Charles University in Prague, and worked at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences for a while in 1956. At Charles University, he was gradually promoted to associate professor. However. Between 1954–1964, he was doing university research in Khartoum in Sudan. Between 1964–1965 he returned Prague but the Institute of Advanced Studies in Canberra, Australia attracted him between 1965 and 1968. After the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he wasn't quite embraced with open arms. So in 1971, he left for Ottawa, Canada where he founded and led a department of modern mathematics at Carleton University that has significantly influenced the world of algebra, probability, and statistics. Because his father was ill in the early 1980s, Dlab – as an alien – was allowed to visit Czechoslovakia and he restored his relationship with Charles University. In the late 1980s, he taught some courses again there, and he regained full professorship in 1992. ==Academic ancestry and collaborators== Dlab was a postdoctoral student of renowned Czech mathematician Eduard Čech. While in Canada, Dlab worked as the editor-of-chief of mathematical journals and chairman of assorted organizations and institutions. In 1977, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Claus Michael Ringel was the co-author of some of the most famous academic works by Dlab, such as the 1976 book Indecomposable representations of graphs and algebras. Dlab helped to educate numerous students of mathematics who became successful by themselves. ==Teaching of mathematics== In recent years, Dlab was very active in efforts to improve the mathematics education. In the Czech Republic, he's been often quoted as an authority that is skeptical towards modern methods to teach, e.g. the method of Milan Hejný. He emphasizes the key role played by the quality of teachers. ==See also== *Eduard Čech ==References== Category:1932 births Category:Czech mathematicians Category:20th-century Czech mathematicians Category:Charles University alumni Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Charles University faculty Category:Living people Category:Czech exiles Category:Canadian mathematicians ","title":"Vlastimil Dlab"},{"id":"56596474","text":"The 1991 Missouri Valley Conference men's soccer season was the 1st season of men's varsity soccer in the conference.

Her paintings have been exhibited in many public and private collections, including the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work has been included in the Bicentennial Exhibit of “American Painters in Paris” in Paris, France, Copley Society of Art, Boston, Dunfermline Fife, Scotland, and the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, Greensburg, Pennsylvania. ==Biography== Rochelle Blumenfeld was born in Pittsburgh, PA in 1936. Her grandparents were immigrants from the Soviet Union. Her father, Lawrence Reznik, was a sign painter, also making window displays. Blumenfeld's grandfather, Harry Fairman, was an artist and a decorator for the wealthy neighborhoods in the East End of Pittsburgh. He encouraged her to start painting and inspired her to pursue art. Blumenfeld started taking art classes at the Carnegie Museum starting in 5th grade. In High School, she took an advanced art class in painting at the Carnegie Tech, which later became known as Carnegie Mellon University. After graduation, she applied and was accepted as a Painting and Design student at Carnegie Mellon University. She completed one year and left the university to get married. Blumenfeld missed painting, and she enrolled in a class at the Young Men and Women's Hebrew Association, which was taught by Samuel Rosenberg (artist), who also taught Andy Warhol. Samuel Rosenberg was a big influence on her future as a painter. Rochelle Blumenfeld married Irving Blumenfeld in 1955. He was a co-founder of Gateway Paint Company in the Strip district of Pittsburgh. Together they had 3 children and 5 grandchildren. ==Life as an artist== Samuel Rosenberg (artist) introduced Blumenfeld to the world of abstract art. She was inspired by life around her to reflect and make statements in her paintings. Blumenfeld used bold colors, light, and movement in her art to express herself. She was inspired by the natural shapes of the world around her, and paintings represent a period of changes. The artist stated \\"Life continually alters its course on an unknown journey, and coping is not always easy\\". In 1958, Rochelle Blumenfeld started exhibiting professionally, when she was accepted into the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh. This started a long career of exhibiting her work through the United States and Europe. In the 1970s Rochelle Blumenfeld had a one-person show at the Carnegie Museum of Art. In 1976 her paintings were included in the Bicentennial Exhibition, “Americans in Paris”, Paris, France. Blumenfeld showed her work with the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh in Dunfermline Scotland to honor Andrew Carnegie at his birthplace. In the 1990s, Blumenfeld started a series of paintings representing Jewish holidays and Shabbat. Some of her Judaica paintings were included in the Hallmark Cards \\"Tree of Life\\" series in 1999. In 2000, Blumenfeld was inspired by seeing Revelations (Alvin Ailey), Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. She wanted to keep and share her memories of the dance, which started a series of paintings she named \\"Celebration of Spirit\\". In 2004, in conjunction with the Three Rivers Arts Festival, she had a one- person show of her ballet paintings at the One Oxford Centre in Pittsburgh. Blumenfeld's most recent exhibit \\"Hill District Paintings\\" is very different from her other exhibits, as it tells a story of her family and the streets of the city where she grew up. Cash Register - Hill District PaintingsIn 2011 Blumenfeld had a conversation with her grandchildren that inspired the artist to use her paintings to recreate memories of diverse neighborhood with people of different ethnic backgrounds, all struggling to make a living during the Great Depression and World War II. Her grandson wanted to know where the cash register came from that he played with. Blumenfeld said that the cash register came from her grandfather's store on Logan Street, Pittsburgh. It came to her house after the store closed. Cash register became her first painting in this series. Painting the cash register triggered her other memories and she completed a total of 14 Hill District Paintings. The last painting in the series is her memory of a patriotic parade on Fifth Avenue during World War II, honoring the soldiers. ==Publications== Blumenfeld's work has been published by Hallmark Cards, Kennedy Publishing, Allied Publications, and Hachai Publishing. == Awards== As a member of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh, Rochelle Blumenfeld received many awards including a Carnegie Museum of Art purchase award for their permanent collection in 1960., In 1966, Blumenfeld won first prize in a nationwide art contest, sponsored by Enjay Chemical Company. ==External links== *Artist's Homepage ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Carnegie Mellon University College of Fine Arts alumni Category:20th-century American painters Category:American women painters Category:American contemporary artists Category:Artists from Pittsburgh Category:American conceptual artists Category:Women conceptual artists Category:American Jews Category:Jewish American artists Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Rochelle Blumenfeld"},{"id":"56596591","text":"The 2007 Missouri Valley Conference men's soccer season was the 17th season of men's varsity soccer in the conference.

Two other names have been suspected to have been named the \\"Downtown Line\\" and the \\"Commercial Street Line\\". ==History== The original horse and mule powered street railway in Springfield, Missouri began operation around 1869. It operated on a line connecting the Square to the Commercial Street district along Boonville, then down Benton to what was then the passenger train depot. By 1929 the electric streetcar system covered what was then the entire city limits, giving citizens universal access to public transportation. Streetcar lines radiated in four directions from Park Central Square, creating a beehive of activity in the heart of the city. In 1936, the Springfield Traction Company announced that the next year the electric streetcars would be replaced by gasoline-powered buses. To them, it seemed “the modern thing to do.” A final streetcar parade was held on August 2nd, 1937, with people cramming into the cars for one last ride. ==References== https://thelibrary.org/lochist/history/paspres/ch7.html Category:1879 establishments in Missouri Category:1937 disestablishments in Missouri Category:Defunct public transport operators in the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Missouri Category:American companies disestablished in 1937 Category:American companies established in 1869 ","title":"Springfield Traction Company"},{"id":"56596717","text":"Salsuginibacillus kocurii is a Gram-positive, moderately halophilic, alkalitolerant, endospore-forming, rod-shaped and motile bacterium from the genus of Salsuginibacillus which has been isolated from sediments from Lake Chagannor in Mongolia. ==References== Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2007 ","title":"Salsuginibacillus kocurii"},{"id":"56596740","text":"Matsui Nursery is a California-based producer of potted orchids. ==History== Toshikiyo Andy Matsui was born in Japan in 1935. He was raised on a small farm where his family grew starch products. Matsui decided to join a farm program in the U.S. and moved to Mountain View, California in 1961, where he apprenticed in growing chrysanthemums (the national flower of Japan). He moved permanently with his wife and first daughter to California soon thereafter. In 1969 he bought 50 acres of land near Salinas, California building greenhouses for flowers. He grew chrysanthemums, then roses. In 1998 at age 63, Matsui switched to Orchids when stiff competition from other countries arose in traditional flowers. He is now the world’s largest potted orchid farmer. In March 2015, Matsui's daughter Teresa Matsui became the president of Matsui Nursery. ==Operations== Matsui Nursery switched from cut flower to potted orchids on a large scale in 1998. Matsui Nursery started the country's first grocery retail program for potted orchids. It grows millions of orchids, with hundreds of varieties, yearly. It is one of the world's largest potted orchid growers. It takes two to three years for the plants to grow from sprouts to store shelves. Matsui Nursery has about 10 million potted orchids continuously in production in 75 acres of greenhouse. The orchids are shipped across the U.S. and globally. ==Matsui Foundation== In 2004 Matsui formed an educational foundation to make grants to students among the company's workforce and their families. In 2013, the Foundation donated one million dollars to the CSin3 Program, which was developed to allow farm-worker children to attend college and obtain a degree in computer science. The program was developed by CSUMB and Hartnell College. The first class graduated in May 2016 with 22 students. In the process, Salinas hopes to turn into an agricultural technology hub. On November 2, 2017, Teresa Matsui, on behalf of the Matsui Foundation, made a gift of 215 acres of land north east of Salinas to the local Junior College. This is agricultural land on which strawberries are grown under lease, which generates about $500,000 in annual income, and expires in 2019. The land is valued at $20 Million. This gift is the largest that the Hartnell College Foundation has ever received. ==References== ==External links== *Matsui Nursery website Category:Floral industry Category:Farms in California Category:American companies established in 1969 Category:Salinas, California Category:Plant nurseries ","title":"Matsui Nursery"},{"id":"56596757","text":"Songs of Paapieye is the fourth album by Ghanaian musician SK Kakraba, released in October 2015 by Awesome Tapes From Africa, becoming the first album of original material released by the typically reissue-centred label. The album showcases Kakraba's mastery of the gyil, a type of wooden, 14-slatted xylophone originating from Kakraba's native Ghana that features a distinctive, buzzy rattle with a slow decaying sound caused by spiders egg sac silk walls pulled across the gourds' holes, known in Kakraba's Lobi language as pappieye, which gives the album its name. It is smoother in sound than his previous album Yonye and is fast-paced, showcasing complex, intricate rhythms, drones and dialogue between lower, buzzing basslines and higher, syncopated notes. Many tracks feature several modes and move between different sections. Kakraba recorded the album by himself without overdubs or accompaniment from other musicians, and used only the gyil. The tracks are song cycles, mostly drawing from Ghanaian traditional music, although there is original material on the album. Among the tracks, there are three funeral pieces. Upon release, where it was made available on a variety of formats, the album was one of only several albums of gyil music. It received critical acclaim, with critics highlighting the instrument's unusual sounds and timbres, the album's skillful pacing and Kakraba's virtuoso technique. ==Background== SK Kakraba is a master of the gyil xylophone, a Ghanaian instrument composed of calabash gourd resonators with 14 wooden slats strung across them. The buzzy rattle which sounds with each note, and with a decay pattern longer than the note, emits from the spiders' egg sacs' silk walls pulled across the gourds' holes, known in Kakraba's Lobi language as \\"pappieye.\\" While one hit is followed by another, the pappieye rattle from the first hit has yet to fully decay, creating a style of West African rhythms that are more complex than those of solitary notes. Kakraba performs, builds, teaches and sells the instrument. He first developed his skills on the instrument during his childhood days spent in Saru, Ghana, a farming village, and went on to become one of the most renowned and famous gyil players, especially after moving to Accra in 1997 around the age of 20, where Kakraba played his instrument around the zongos (Muslim ghettos) and Central Accra, which helped Kakraba get his \\"daily chop.\\" He later began teaching the instrument at the University of Ghana's \\"International Centre for African Music and Dance.\\" After marrying his American-born wife, whom he met in Accra, Kakraba moved to Los Angeles in 2011, where he began releasing albums. Prior to recording Songs of Paapieye, his latest album was Yonye, released via Drag City in July 2015. He had known Awesome Tapes From Africa founder Brian Shimkovitz since 2002 when the latter was a student in Ghana, and over the years the two stayed in contact with each other. When \\"hanging out\\" in 2015, they decided \\"it would be cool to release a record\\" for Shimkovitz's label. Songs of Paapieye was recorded in San Francisco in a studio owned by Kakraba's close friend Brian Hogan. Unlike Yonye, which features occasional added drums and bells, Songs for Paapieye is a solo project, recorded by Kakraba entirely by himself, playing live without any overdubs or accompanying guest musicians. This is unlike the traditional setting for gyil music, where two gyil players may play together with accompaniment from drums, bells and sometimes singing, and instead showcases Kakraba's \\"polyrhyhtmic force and creativity.\\" He used the album to showcase music that he had taken with him to Los Angeles from the central Accra ghettos. Shimkovitz has been credited by one writer for producing the album. ==Composition== Songs Of Paapieye contains six solo, instrumental recordings, and features Kakraba's \\"favourite song cycles, funeral dirges, improvised interpretations on traditional songs and original compositions.\\" Haydon Spenceley of Drowned in Sound called the album \\"a series of six song cycles.\\" Besides being an album of solo recordings as opposed to a group recording, Songs of Paapieye also departs from Yonye in that it is smoother in sound. The tracks nonetheless sound like ensembles, via the \\"animated dialogue\\" between the deep buzzing, looping basslines and the syncopated higher, clearer notes. The album includes three funeral songs, each with a rapid, stop-start nature, although these tracks are not dissimilar, however, to \\"Sopka,\\" which Kakraba claims is \\"happy hour music\\" played to \\"please your soul.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times felt that the majority of the album, including funeral pieces, displays a propulsive but unpredictable style of dance music. The album has been described as \\"a big wash of complex rhythms,\\" though the music does frequently exude melody. The Ghanaian gyil is the only instrument on Songs of Paapieye. The tracks approximate contrapuntal work in that they keep a rhythmic pace, boasting a shifting bassline, and then \\"work around the 'lead' line.\\" Sections of phrases become emphasised with \\"parallel attacks\\", such as octaves but typically other intervals, and the pieces' pattern is highlighted with improvisatory waves. The pieces, which typically feature a couple of modes each, are complex and fast, and the paapieye rattles compound the rhythmic complexity and avoid creating phase relationships. Aquarium Drunkard noted that although harmonic elements of the album's pulsing drones are shared with the works of minimalist composers Terry Riley and Steve Reich, Kakraba's feel is \\"jazzier, earthier, and more folk focused.\\" The album opens with the short track \\"Lubile Prai,\\" which was inspired by birdsong, and boasts stop- start shifts in tempo, working to build up anticipation for the succeeding tracks. The final third of the track features propelling cascades of melody. Kakraba says the nine-minute \\"Banyere Yo\\" is about a drunken blind man. The piece opens with a frantic yet intricate rallentando and diminuendo section that showcases the musician's virtuosity, with sounds akin to the paradiddle exercises (16th-note roll) of a drummer, before leading into a section based on a highly rhythmic riff, where extra elements are added and subtracted every time the riff cycles. The final section of the song features a shift in tempo. A two-note pattern resembling a siren emerges in the middle register at one point, surrounded by offbeat accent lines. \\"Dairfu\\" is similarly frenetic, yet features a permeating mournful tone and timbre, with offset bursts of cascading notes between bass-note patterns. By contrast, \\"Darikpon Variations\\" features a riff which, according to Spenceley, bears harmonic and melodic similarity to the \\"straight-ahead grooves\\" of rock guitarist Jimmy Page. The groove is built upon and variations soon appear, with the pulsing lower end allowing room for the higher melodic echelons of the gyil to dominate. The track is also a funeral piece and features several sections with a loping bass-note in 6/8. \\"Sopka\\" is a shorter piece which places more attention on the gyil's lower tones, while \\"Guun\\" is \\"a funeral song to dance to, a final send-off for the recently departed,\\" and displays the full potential of the gyil, with, as is characteristic of the album, tempo shifts and flowing melody. It features Kakraba's polyrhythms anchored by a singular loping bassline which alternates with \\"more exposed, almost scat-like improvisations.\\" The track's \\"fluidity and flexibility of gesture\\" have been compared to jazz, despite the gyil far predating the genre, and as such, the track has been described as a bridge between the musical elements of gyil music and jazz. ==Release== Titled in honour of the gyil, Songs of Paapieye was first announced in August 2015, the same time \\"Guun\\" was made available for streaming to promote the album. The album was then subsequently released by Awesome Tapes From Africa on 2 October 2015 on CD, vinyl, cassette and digital formats, complete with liner notes containing biographical and track- by-track information. It is the label's first release of new material, as up until that point, it had focused on re-releasing obscure African albums only initially issued as cassettes in the continent. Afropop Worldwide noted that there have been very few releases of gyil music over time, so it was likely that \\"[t]wo things about Ghanaian gyil music are likely to grab a first-time listener: the deep, resonant buzz of the bass notes, and the polyrhythmic virtuosity—the right-hand/left-hand limb independence of master players.\\" ==Critical reception== Songs of Paapieye received critical acclaim, especially for its unusual sound and Kakraba's virtuoso technique. Jakob Baekgaard of All About Jazz wrote that the music \\"embraces all aspects of life, from pieces meant to accompany a funeral to a type of ancient lounge music.\\" While he noted that information about each track is detailed in the liner notes, the music can nonetheless be enjoyed \\"simply as an exotic journey into an unfamiliar world of sound. The many tones and textures of the gyil, both muffled and clear, are captivating and the lively percussive rhythms speak about the life-affirming quality of the music.\\" Haydon Spenceley of Drowned in Sound wrote that \\"SK Kakraba won't, by any means, provide here an album for mass consumption, but, for the brave, or for the one who is much more a connoisseur, dig in. You might just come upon something special here.\\" Minna Zhou of Pitchfork described the effect of the paapieye as \\"somewhere between drone and a more stripped-down, rhythmically intricate Konono Nº1.\\" Ian Sinclair of Morning Star said: \\"Fascinating and mesmeric if a little repetitive — to my Western ears at least — it’s unlike anything you’ve ever heard before.\\" Jason Woodbury of Aquarium Drunkard called Kakraba's style \\"direct, sublime and utterly captivating,\\" and concluded that \\"Kakraba’s polyrhythms are enveloping, and Awesome Tapes’ first foray into modern sounds is as essential as its archival releases.\\" Stewart Smith of The List said that Kakraba's interpretations of Lobi songs impress throughout the album. He was impressed by the unlikely sound of the album's instrumentation: \\"Listeners could be forgiven for thinking there’s some Konono-style electronic processing involved, but the gyil is entirely acoustic.\\" Afropop Worldwide wrote that \\"Songs of Paapieye captures the richness of the traditional gyil repertoire, the sonic depth of the instrument, and the polyrhythmic complexity of Kakraba’s playing.\\" In their 2016 Bradt Travel Guides book Ghana, authors Philip Briggs and Sean Connolly wrote that both Yonye and Songs of Paapieye are \\"genuinely exciting documents of a centuries-old tradition that continues to impress in the modern era.\\" ==Track listing== All tracks traditional arr.

The release paid homage to R&B;/soul/hip-hop with old school elements from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was released exclusively through Apple Music. Critically, Smoove Jones received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews from music critics. In 2017, Smoove Jones received a nomination for Best R&B; Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held on February 12, 2017. Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, Mýa released a music video for the fan favorite \\"Coolin'\\". Filmed in Sydney, Australia, director Matt Sharp captures the singer's unmistakable beauty while she lets her vocals do the rest on a sandy beach. In late 2017, Mýa released the first single from the forthcoming studio album, Ready for Whatever on September 22, 2017. A music video for \\"Ready for Whatever\\" was produced and directed by Mýa co-starring R&B; singer Kevin McCall as her love interest. Less than two months, its follow up single and sequel, Ready, Part II was released on November 24, 2017. The song paid homage to R.Kelly's It Seems Like You're Ready. ==Composition== \\"You Got Me\\" is a song written by Mýa and Sydnii Raymor while production was handled by Lamar \\"MyGuyMars\\" Edwards. Described as a sexy, sultry slow jam, \\"You Got Me\\" features a combination of steady drums, sensual synths reminiscent of 90's R&B; and finger snapping with Harrison's signature breathy coos. Lyrically, the song embraces that sentiment painting a vivid image of love making with straightforward lyrics and a serene voice. ==Music video== Shot in Glendale, California, the simple, sexy, and energetic visual features Mýa seducing her love interest dressed in athletic attire at a dance studio equipped with mirrors that is reminiscent of the '80s fitness craze. Subsequently, Mýa turns up the heat when she's joined by her two female dancers. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Qobuz. *Mýa – vocals, songwriting *Sydnii Raymore – songwriting *Lamar \\"Mars\\" Edwards – composer ==Release history== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !Region !Date !Format !Label ! - !scope=\\"row\\"Various February 14, 2018    } ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Mýa songs Category:Songs written by Mýa ","title":"You Got Me (Mýa song)"},{"id":"56596789","text":"The coal-fired pizza oven at Lombardi's Pizza in Manhattan Coal-fired pizza is a pizza style in the United States. New York-style pizza and New Haven-style pizza are often cooked in coal-fired pizza ovens. A coal-fired oven can reach and cook a pie in two to three or five minutes. Pizzerias outside of the Northeastern United States that feature coal-fired ovens are uncommon enough to be noted in travel guides: for instance, Black Sheep Pizza with the first coal-fired oven in Minneapolis, or URBN in San Diego. As of 2007, coal-fired ovens were quite uncommon in the Western United States with only five west of the Mississippi: four in an Arizona chain and one more in Las Vegas. Coal Fire Oven has now opened up in Windsor, Ontario, Canada as the only oven in Eastern Canada. It is renowned for their coal fire pizza and wings - The Chelsea Coal Fire Pizza. They are now doing coal fire frozen pizzas too. The growing popularity of coal-fired pizza in the 2010s was identified as a major market for anthracite coal suppliers, most of whom are in Pennsylvania's Coal Region, who generally see a declining market due to alternate industrial and home heating fuel sources. ==Health concerns== Concerns have been raised about particulates, sulfur dioxide and CO2 emissions from coal-fired pizza ovens. ==Gallery== File:Sally'sPizza.jpgNew Haven-style pizza cooked in a coal- fired oven at Sally's Apizza ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:American cuisine Category:American pizza Category:Cooking techniques Category:Coal ","title":"Coal-fired pizza"},{"id":"56596847","text":"The \\"Prayer of a Midshipman\\" was written by William Nathaniel Thomas in 1938.

She is the William Wrigley Professor of the Stanford University School of Earth System Science, and the Gloria and Richard Kushel Director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford, University. Her academic career has centered on environmental science and policy related to global food systems and food security. == Biography == Daughter of Burton J. Lee III, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Pauline S. Herzog, an artist, Roz was raised in Greenwich, CT. She later moved with her mother to Colorado, where she attended high school and developed her passion for the environment. She graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1980 with a BA in Economics and Environmental Studies. She attended the London School of Economics on a scholarship, earning her MSc in Economics in 1981. Roz worked in the financial sector in San Francisco prior to enrolling in a PhD program in applied economics at the Food Research Institute at Stanford University in 1984. Her dissertation research focused on agricultural development and rural labor markets in Indonesia. She completed her PhD at Stanford in 1989. She was hired by Stanford’s first interdisciplinary institute in 1989, the Institute for International Studies, and has remained at Stanford throughout her professional career. Married to Lionel (Wally) Naylor in 1982 with one daughter, Jacqueline (Nicki) Naylor, they pursue an active outdoor lifestyle in their free time. == Research == Although trained as an economist, Naylor collaborates widely with scholars in the natural and physical sciences ===Early work studying wheat systems=== The field of global food security and agriculture-environment interactions is vast. Naylor’s early work centered on field experiments and surveys on intensive wheat systems of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico (the home of the Green Revolution for wheat). Naylor, along with Stanford’s Pamela Matson, launched the project focused on fertilization practices in a highly intensive agricultural system, and the outcomes of such practices on farm incomes, wheat yields, and the environment. The study was followed by a decade of work in the Yaqui Valley among a growing team of faculty and students at Stanford (and partner institutions). ===Orphan crops role in feeding the poor=== In addition to working on intensive, high-yield cropping systems, Naylor has researched orphan crops – classified as those that do not receive much investment and breeding effort, despite being critical for food security among the world’s poorest and most marginalized communities. In a collaborative effort she and several members of the McKnight Foundation Collaborative Crop Research Program including economists, geneticists, and ecologists addressed the question: Why are investments in biotechnology for orphan crop improvement important for food security? The research found that investments in genetic research in orphan crops can have positive spillover effects for major crops such as rice, what, and maize and vice versa. This paper was rated in the top ten Food Policy papers for several years following its publication. ===Aquaculture=== Naylor is widely published on aquaculture-environment interactions research dating back to the late 1990s. “Effect of aquaculture on world fish supplies” represented a global analysis and synthesis of the impacts of aquaculture on ecosystems and fish supplies. Over the course of the 2000s, the work by Naylor, colleagues, and many other researchers in the aquaculture field, helped to motivate industry improvements on feed efficiency and sustainable farming practices, and provided a foundation for the expanding literature on sustainable aquaculture practices (including the introduction of the journal Aquaculture Environment Interactions, which was launched in 2009). Naylor continues to publish on aquaculture and fisheries issues in prominent journals, and in 2017 her paper on Opportunity for Marine Fisheries Reform in China” with Cao et al. was nominated for the PNAS Cozzarelli Prize. ===Climate impacts on food security=== As the impacts of El Niño events became more prominent, Naylor examined the effects on food security in Indonesia and what the government might do to alleviate episodes of food insecurity during El Niño events. This study became a core component of Indonesia’s food security division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Naylor continues to collaborate on research examining the implications of climate variability and climate change on global food security, a focus area at The Center on Food Security and the Environment. ===Water resources potential in poverty alleviation=== Naylor has also focused on the potential of water resources to improve food and nutrition security. Working with FSE fellow Jennifer Burney, Naylor led a multi-year survey to measure the impacts of solar market gardens in Benin, West Africa. The introduction of distributed irrigation improved nutritional and social outcomes, and the research resulted in several publications outlining the effectiveness of the intervention including nutritional improvements, equity between and among households, marketing expansion, and educational impacts. ===Improving food and nutrition security=== In a culmination of collaborative work with colleagues at Stanford over the past two decades Naylor published The Evolving Sphere of Food Security. Designed primarily for university teaching purposes the book provides three novel approaches to understanding global food security. First, the individual chapters show how food security is tightly linked to many other forms of security: water, health, energy, environmental, climate, and even national security. The most effective intervention points for improving food security may not be in the agricultural sector per se, but instead in the water, energy or health sectors. Second, the chapters show that all countries, including the U.S., have food security challenges, but that the challenges change over the course of economic development. The third important aspect of the book is that it delves into food policy, integrating science and policy to understand the complex field of global food security. ===Tropical Oil Crops=== As global incomes rose, diets changed, and new global food systems emerged, Naylor turned her attention toward tropical oil crop systems. She has studied the effects of biofuels on food security and the environment, the impacts of soybean production in Brazil and palm oil production across the globe. Working closely with the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Naylor and a team of Stanford faculty, scholars, and students with expertise in sustainability launched the Poverty Alleviation through Sustainable Palm Oil Production project. In 2017 Naylor co-authored The Tropical Oil Crop Revolution which examines the major supply and demand drivers in oil crop production; the economic, social, and environmental impacts; and the future outlook to 2050. ==Role at Stanford== For the past 25 years, Naylor has taught courses at Stanford including; World Food Economy, Human Society and Environmental Change, Fundamentals of Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Security, and The Evolving Sphere of Food Security. Naylor has also i participated in and mentored students on numerous field- level research projects across the globe. ==Awards, honors, and memberships== * Gloria and Richard Kushel Director, The Center on Food Security and the Environment Endowment * William Wrigley Professorship Endowment * Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellow in Environmental Science and Public Policy, ‘99 * Pew Fellow in Conservation and the Environment, ‘94 * McNamara Post-doc Fellowship, The World Bank, ‘90-‘91 * Editorial Board, Aquaculture Environment Interactions * Fellow, Beijer Institute for Ecological Economics, Stockholm * Member of American Geophysical Union (AGU) * Member of American Economics Association (AEA) * Member of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) * Member, Board of Directors, Aspen Global Change Institute * Member, selection committee for Asian nominations, Pew Marine Fellows Program, Pew Charitable Trusts * Member, Scientific Advisory Board, Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy (IFAL), University of California-Davis World Food Center * Trustee, The Nature Conservancy, California Chapter *As of December 2017 == Selected works == * Matson, P.

As of 2020, she is the largest virtual YouTuber on YouTube with over 4 million subscribers across three channels (A.I Channel, A.I. Games, A.I Channel China) as well as another 1 million subscribers on the Chinese streaming/video sharing platform bilibili. Kizuna AI first posted her videos on her YouTube channel, \\"A.I.Channel\\" on 29 November 2016. A second channel, \\"A.I. Games,\\" was opened in March 2017 for gaming-related content. A third channel, \\"A.I.Channel China\\", launched in June 2019 for a Chinese audience. Kizuna claims to be the world's first virtual YouTuber, though the first channel to use a CG avatar for vlogging purposes on YouTube was the channel of English- Japanese Ami Yamato, who debuted her first video in 2011. Kizuna's video content is similar to many other YouTubers, consisting primarily of discussions, Q&A; videos, and more traditional \\"Let's Play\\" videos. Because Kizuna primarily communicates in Japanese, fans contribute translations for her videos, and there are entire unofficial communities built around these translators, filling the void of an official English community. Kizuna has performed at various anime conventions, and has also worked with many game companies. Originally since her conception in 2016, Kizuna AI was managed directly by the company that created her, Activ8, and later in 2018 by its in- house agency upd8. Nonetheless in 2020, Activ8 decided to move Kizuna AI from upd8 to a newly created company dedicated exclusively to her, Kizuna AI Inc. Before taken its current incarnation, Kizuna AI Inc. was known as Project A.I., until the official announcement on 24 April 2020 Kizuna. With the announcement, Japanese voice actress Nozomi Kasuga (春日望) also disclosed her role as the main voice model of Kizuna AI and advisor of the new company. The Kizuna AI Inc. started activities formally on 11 May, 2020, with Eriko Matsumoto (松本恵利子) as the CEO.https://twitter.com/KizunaAIinc/status/1253660698284101633https://sojapan.jp/2020/04/kizuna- ais-seiyuu-finally-revealed-new-company-set-up-to-handle-business-affairs/ == Production == Kizuna is an online virtual character completely constructed using software. As the identities of producers in the background are not revealed, video animators, producers, video editors, and players of games are unknown. Kizuna's YouTube channels are thought to be managed by an entire production crew, and the choice to remain anonymous comes from the wish to keep the concept of a virtual idol intact. Though this has caused speculation regarding the operation crew and technology. Kizuna's videos are produced by Tokyo-based digital production company Activ8. All crew members known so far to be involved in Kizuna's design are already well known. These include En Morikura in character design, Tomitake in 3D modelling, and Tda in modelling supervision. Morikura is an artist well known for illustrating artworks. Tomitake has designed many 3D models, and works alongside Tda, an expert in the MikuMikuDance 3D modelling field. The identity of Kizuna AI's voice provider has been unknown since her conception for a long time. However, on 24 April 2020, Kizuna AI revealed on Twitter that voice actress Nozomi Kasuga provides her voice.https://twitter.com/kasuga_nozomi/status/1253662616674725888 ===Personality=== Kizuna is aware that she is a virtual character, and claims that she is an independent artificial intelligence (hence the \\"AI\\" in her name). The main concept of a character in a virtual setting was created through Kizuna, so she is publicly recognized as the world's first \\"virtual YouTube user\\". An October 2018 article from BBC Capital noted a Mattel advertisement campaign for Barbie in 2015 with the same concept. In her first video, Kizuna introduces herself. Apart from the general meaning of \\"artificial intelligence\\", \\"AI\\" is also a pun on the kanji \\"愛\\", meaning \\"love\\". Kizuna is designed as a young and beautiful 2.5D animated girl with moe elements, which attracts many YouTube users. Kizuna's appearance age is roughly 16 years old, though she revealed that she is only five, with her birthday on the 30th of June. She has a height of 156 cm (~5'1\\"), a weight of roughly 46 kg (101 lbs.), and her three measurements are 85-59-83 (34-24-33). Kizuna's overall appearance uses a pink and white color palette. She has long flowing hair, coupled with a futuristic gradient hair dye of pink. She wears a pink wobbly hairband with a butterfly knot. The hairband has a double-leaf heart-shaped design, corresponding to the word \\"Ai\\", meaning \\"love\\", in her name. Kizuna's sleeveless white top brings about a futuristic feel as well. It is designed to put emphasis on her back and body, as well as to make her appear slimmer. Embroidered above her chest is the letter \\"A\\". Her arm sleeves and thigh highs are decorated with lace, while her thigh highs and shorts form an \\"absolute territory\\". Kizuna is a huge fan of Love Live! and Love Live! School Idol Festival; her favorite character is Nico Yazawa. During an interview with Panora, Kizuna mentioned that she pays close attention to idol groups such as Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46. Kizuna likes how idols follow their dreams just like herself. In her character design, she also likes to spend time in virtual space playing video games. === Technology used === Kizuna is able to livestream and record videos in a virtual environment; this is generally considered to rely on the freeware MikuMikuDance. After the production crew designs a 3D model, they manually control the model to make certain movements. Then, they hire a voice actor to give the animation a voice. MikuMikuDance has often been used in the videos of Vocaloid pop music, allowing users to import and control the 3D models of virtual characters such as Hatsune Miku. On the other hand, some netizens think that Kizuna's facial expressions and eye changes are done through facial tracking using facial recognition software such as FaceRig. The technology of FaceRig Live2D modules has already existed for a considerable amount of time. Some feel that Kizuna is a result of applying this technology to 3D models, similarly by projecting facial expressions onto a virtual reality model, thereby hiding the identities of creators and actors involved. At the same time, some think that omni- directional motion capture technology is being used. After recording the actions of real actors, this data is used to simulate movement of the character in a virtual reality setting. Both methods allow Kizuna to resemble real people more closely in terms of expressions and actions, overall making Kizuna's videos more similar to those of other female YouTubers. In 2017, Activ8 showcased a real-time animation system that enables a person to operate an animated character by attaching a sensor to the body and lip-sync the character according to the spoken words by analyzing the sound waves picked up by a microphone. == Activities == The YouTube channel \\"A.I.Channel\\" was created on 18 October 2016, though Kizuna only started posting videos on 29 November 2016. She creates, designs and hosts a series of videos with a mix of wacky and serious elements. These videos are designed to break the boundaries between virtual and real spaces, and involves activities such as television- like show-hosting and virtual reality. The production crew also wishes for the audience to get in touch with and experience the newest technology, even allowing users to interact directly with Kizuna in virtual space. Kizuna posts videos almost every day on YouTube, and is recognized as an active user of the video-sharing platform. With over two million subscribers as of October 2018, Kizuna is the most popular virtual personality on the site and one of its most-watched Japanese content creators. She is also gaining traction in regions around the globe. In January 2017, Kizuna joked that because her clothes are merely holographic projections, she is technically always naked. YouTube detected the use of the word \\"naked\\" and decided that the video contained inappropriate content, so \\"A.I.Channel\\" was banned. The content had to be posted on another video sharing site, Niconico. After several weeks, the channel was unbanned in February. Despite the ban, Kizuna's popularity grew tremendously and her subscriber count reached 100,000 on 25 February. By the end of March, Kizuna had already uploaded more than 60 videos. \\"A.I.Channel\\" had exceeded 200,000 subscribers and 5 million comments. On 31 March, Kizuna even started releasing gaming content on a new channel named \\"A.I.Games\\". \\"A.I.Games\\" was blocked for unknown reasons on 17 April but was unblocked and resumed posting videos within a day. \\"A.I.Channel\\" reached 2 million subscribers on 15 July 2018. \\"A.I.Games\\" also reached 1 million subscribers on 14 August 2018. === Other activities === Apart from her YouTube channels and official website, Kizuna has also created Twitter and Instagram accounts to facilitate interaction with fans. She also holds limited-time events occasionally, such as a Valentine's Day chocolate giveaway in 2017. Kizuna accepted an interview by PANORA, a website focusing on the topic of virtual reality. The interview was divided into four parts and posted on Kizuna AI's official website. Then, on 25 and 26 March 2017, Kizuna performed and then interacted with fans live on the stage of AnimeJapan. In April 2017, a collaboration between Kizuna and Japanese video game development company Asobimo was announced. On the newly-created \\"A.I.Games\\" channel, Kizuna would periodically post videos of her doing a commentary while playing Avabel Online, a MMORPG designed by Asobimo for smartphones. Kizuna would also appear directly in the game. Afterwards, there would occasionally be video advertisements for the game. Kizuna is the ambassador for one of the Japan National Tourism Organization's Come to Japan campaign and appeared in endorsements for SoftBank. She has also hosted a television variety show titled , which aired on Japan's BS NTV channel from 6 April 2018. She also voiced Website Manager Hachi in the anime television series Magical Girl Site, which aired from the same day. To celebrate reaching 2 million subscribers on \\"A.I.Channel\\" on 15 July 2018, Kizuna released her first eurodance digital single \\"Hello, Morning\\". On 1 March 2019, Dutch music duo W&W; released a song called The Light in which Kizuna features as a vocalist and as a dancer. == Videos == Similar to other YouTubers, Kizuna acts as a host on her YouTube channels, creating and uploading various original types of entertainment- related videos, thereby attracting viewers to subscribe to her channels. Kizuna's videos contain lots of content similar to other video bloggers. Kizuna will also imitate the interesting behaviour of other YouTubers. The style of these videos is comedic and uses technology to let Kizuna move smoothly. Videos sometimes add content of a more imaginative or animated style, though bugs in the software may cause her to move rather unnaturally. On average, Kizuna's videos are about 10 minutes long. Video content includes chatting, sharing life stories, answering questions, fulfilling requests, hosting discussions on trending topics, interviews, \\"Let's Plays\\", dancing, challenges, and drawing. She has discussed artificial intelligence, virtual reality, games, things she likes, and how she wants a Wikipedia page dedicated to herself. She has also talked about buying friends with money, and what furniture she wants to have. === Games === Kizuna often posts videos of herself giving commentaries while playing games on YouTube. As a virtual Let's Play show host, Kizuna's game operating techniques seem a little clumsy, though like other gaming YouTubers, she makes seemingly real comments and reactions to the games that she likes. The most viewed and most popular gaming video by Kizuna is her Let's Play of popular indie game Inside. Some of Kizuna's videos involve augmented and virtual reality games. Using omnidirectional motion capture technology, a 3D model of Kizuna playing a game can be developed. Virtual reality games played by Kizuna include extreme sports game The Climb, first-person shooter game Superhot, drawing software Tilt Brush, and more. Kizuna has also attempted to describe English words in Quick, Draw!, explore Tokyo virtually using Google Maps, and talk with other AI such as Apple's iPhone Assistant Siri. === Subtitles === The language used in all of Kizuna's videos is Japanese. This made it difficult for a large portion of viewers to understand specific content of videos. Afterwards, \\"A.I.Channel\\" and \\"A.I.Games\\" allowed bilingual fans to translate Japanese in videos to other languages. With the help of translations offered by fans, Kizuna's channels were able to offer content in many different languages including Japanese, English, Korean, Spanish, and many others. This has allowed global audiences to understand the comments made by Kizuna in her videos, and has helped to grow her audience outside of Japan. Korean and English comments take up similar portions in the comments section of Kizuna's videos. == Impact == Kizuna AI cosplayer Kizuna, also known, \\"AI-chan\\" among her fans, is the spearhead of the virtual YouTuber trend. Kevin Allocca, YouTube's head of cultural trends, singled out the meteoric growth of A.I. Channel over 10 months as an example of the growth of virtual personalities on the platform. Allocca also noted that the trend's popularity was mostly contained to Japan. Character designs such as Kizuna are seen as a revolutionary concept, and could be the precursor of a new trend in virtual reality, virtual YouTube users and live-streamers. 2D virtual characters such as Hatsune Miku have been getting more popular, and the audience of 2D has been widening. Therefore, the concept of Kizuna as a YouTube video host is becoming more widespread. The profession of live-streaming usually requests for the constant production of original or exclusive content for the audience, and 2D live-streaming can be a method of doing so. Also, in the regular YouTube market, virtual streaming can be an alternative for those who are unable or do not wish to reveal their face in front of the camera, because exquisite character designs can make up for the imperfections in real people. Virtual streaming also allows the production crew to create more than one character. For example, Black AI is another artificial intelligence who appears several times in Kizuna's videos, and seems to be animated in the same fashion. Tubefilter writer Sam Gutelle thinks that even though characters like Kizuna may be seen as oddities now, they will become more common in the future. The Verge columnist Rich McCormick feels that Kizuna is different from other content creators as she can technically play games as long as she wants without the need for food and sleep. This will bring channels more flexibility, and these types of videos may even be the future of YouTube. The BBC thinks that the selling point of virtual characters is that they are not like other YouTubers, as their appearance will never age and related development is still in its beginning stages. In 2018, Kizuna appeared on a program on NHK interviewing the Japanese Nobel Prize winners, which sparked debate on social media over female objectification, with several scholars deeming her appearance as inappropriate. Yuki Senda, a professor at Musashi University, claimed that Kizuna nodding along with the panel instead of contributing constructively to the conversation was more of an issue than her character design, due to her mannerisms reinforcing gender roles in women. Junko Saeki, a professor at Doshisha University, also suggested that Kizuna's quietness may be perpetuating a new wave of orientalism because of her role as one of Japan's primary cultural exports. === Fandom activities === On 25 December 2016, Kizuna's producers decided to put up her MikuMikuDance 3D model for free download and edits on her official site. This was to allow interested fans to produce doujin products. The 3D model can be used in MikuMikuDance, Unity, Unreal Engine and other spaces. The developers even made the model compatible with virtual reality. The virtual model is allowed use in videos and games, but for business purposes it is required that the developers are contacted. Finally, the use of the model in political, racial or religious settings or to create other models is prohibited. The derivative work of some fans is shared to the rest of the fanbase on Kizuna's social media accounts. On YouTube, there are many users who name their accounts \\"Kizuna AI\\", \\"\\" or other related names. Some repost her videos but only the official \\"A.I.Channel\\" offers subtitles for many languages. There are also dancing- related videos. ==References== == External links == * Category:21st-century Japanese actresses Category:21st-century Japanese singers Category:21st- century women singers Category:Female YouTubers Category:Fictional gynoids Category:Fictional robots Category:Japanese YouTubers Category:Virtual YouTubers Category:Japanese female singers Category:Japanese voice actresses ","title":"Kizuna AI"},{"id":"56597009","text":"The 1989 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was held March 8–11 at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California.

He was visiting surgeon at the Atkinson Morley's Convalescent Hospital in 1936, replacing Bryan Burns. He was dean of the Medical School from 1936 to 1956, whilst still actively at work as a surgeon.

In 1814 he founded an eight-bed infirmary that became the Royal Chest Hospital. ==Early life== Isaac Buxton was born on 6 May 1773 in Grange Walk, Bermondsey. He was a foundation scholar at St Paul's School and then was apprenticed for five years to his brother-in-law, a seed merchant named Wrench.\\"Isaac Buxton, 1773-1825. Founder of the Royal Chest Hospital\\", by Norah Schuster in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, April 1955, pp. 16–18. He was probably a dissenter and may have practiced as a dissenting minister but the evidence in unclear. In 1800 he went to the University of Göttingen to study medicine under J. F. Blumenbach. He acquired his doctorate in 1802, with a thesis likely to have been on a study of man as a ruminant, a topic possibly inspired by the enthusiasm in Göttingen at the time for comparative anatomy. While there he took the medical oath. Buxton married Janet Travers, the first cousin of the surgeon Benjamin Travers. ==Career== On his return to London in 1802, Buxton became dresser to Astley Cooper at Guy's Hospital and in 1805 received his medical licence from the Royal College of Physicians. He then spent time at the Surrey Dispensary in south London where records indicate there was \\"no rowdiness\\" in his clinics. He was then elected physician to the London Hospital in 1807 and began a successful practice in New Broad Street. He also promoted the chest hospital in Spitalfields. In 1810 he wrote an essay on heating and ventilation for invalids, the deficiency of which he had experienced during his time in Germany. It included a case study sent in by Edward Jenner and was abstracted in a French journal. The essay features in two histories of heating and ventilating. The topic preoccupied him at a time when it was not a common concern among physicians and he tried to keep his sick rooms at a constant temperature of 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months for any patient with a cough or consumption. In 1817 and 1818 an outbreak of fever in London's East End was causing concern at the London Hospital over the number of cases they were receiving. Buxton went back over the records of the last 70 years and compiled statistics showing the trend of admissions to the hospital from the disease. He concluded that although there had been a recent increase, the long term trend in cases was down. In 1814 he founded the Infirmary for Asthma, Consumption and other Pulmonary Diseases which subsequently became the Royal Chest Hospital. At first it had only eight beds and Buxton was its only physician for the first six years of its existence. It was located in Union Street, Spitalfields, before moving to City Road in 1849. He was elected to the Hunterian Society council in its second year but did not attend any meetings due to ill health. He retired for health reasons in 1822. ==Death and legacy== Buxton died on 1 July 1825 at Grosvenor Place, in Camberwell, and was buried in Bunhill Fields.Isaac Buxton. Munk's Roll, Royal College of Physicians. Retrieved 18 March 2018. He was criticised in E. W. Morris's History of the London Hospital (2nd edit., London, 1910) for having arranged his election to the London Hospital by some sort of trick but Norah Schuster writes in her article on Buxton's life that she found no evidence to support that claim or other criticisms of Buxton's character. ==Publications== *Essay on the Use of a Regulated Temperature in Winter-cough & Consumption: Including a Comparison of the Different Methods of Producing Such a Temperature in the Chambers of Invalids.

There is no certainty about Conrad's birthdate but most historians agree that it is around 1180, his death date is also uncertain but it is speculated to be around July 1254. Conrad was the forefather of the \\"Spino Secco\\" (dried thorn in English) branch of the Malaspina family. Conrad Malaspina's achievements were of fundamental importance for the way Italian territories were shaped. He had very close relationships with Emperor Frederick II as well as many intellectuals and political figures of the time. Coat of arms of the House of Malaspina (Spino Secco) == Biography == He was born approximately around 1180, his father was Obizzo II. He started his diplomatic career in 1198 when he himself confirmed the attornment of the knolls of the “Court of Gondola” to the city of Piacenza. The juridical procedures needed for this attornment had started to be composed years before by his uncles Alberto Malaspina and Morroello Malaspina. His diplomatic career hence began under the supervision of his uncles, who, until he turned 18, were acting in his name, he also worked alongside his cousins, they were tied by their common ancestor, the marques Obizzo I. In the period they worked together they had an intense diplomatic activity trying to solve the contrasts that arose with the Count-Bishop of the diocese of “Luni”, consequentially they signed agreements with the cities of Genoa, Milan, Piacenza, Tortona and Modena. == The controversy with the Count- Bishop of the diocese of “Luni” == Starting from the last decade of the XIIIth century the Malaspina family began to have some contrasts with the Count- Bishop of the diocese of “Luni” because of the considerable richness in lands they had acquired from the d’Este family, that had previously stolen them from the da Vezzano family. By 1202 a compromise was found: the parties agreed on reciprocal defense within the borders of the diocese of “Luni” as well as the equal division of the contended lands, under the promise that the bishop would pay an initial amount of money plus a yearly tax. == Other Agreements == Between 1210 and 1218 Conrad signed several agreements. Between 1210 and 1212 he signed pacts with Piacenza, Milan and Tortona to ensure the safety of Lombard merchants traveling on the Apennine roads. The Malaspina family was a strong supporter of Emperor Otto von Brunswick in his contrast against pope Innocent the third, Pavia and the marquessate of Monferrato. Even if Emperor Otto von Brunswick lost in the battle of Bouvines in 1214 the Malaspina family kept fighting against Pavia, which was impeding pilgrims from reaching Rome, siding with Milan and afterwards Piacenza. Between 1215 and 1216 Conrad tried to seize some strategic positions on the eastern coast of Liguria thus causing Genoa to react. On both the Genovese and Pavia’s front peace was achieved between 1217 and 1218. == The birth of the “Spino Secco” branch == the city of Mulazzo Between April and August 1221 Conrad and his cousin Obizzo, son of Conrad’s uncle Gugliemo, carried out the first separation of the family’s patrimonial assets. The Malaspina’s family domain was divided in two parts, one belonged to Conrad, who is the founder of the Spino Secco branch, the other belonged to Obizzo, who started the Spino Fiorito branch (Blooming Thorn). Such division was preceded by the preventive splitting of Alberto Malaspina’s heredity between uncle Guglielmo Malaspina and Conrad. Upon request, Emperor Frederic the second in 1220 confirmed the validity of the solution regarding the division of the land owned by Conrad and Obizzo in the territories of Liguria, Lombardy and of Lunigiana. Conrad was entrusted with lands in the “Appennino Lombardo”, amongst which: Val Trebbia (valley of the river Trebbia) and the castle of Pregola; in LunigianaE. Branchi, Storia della Lunigiana feudale, Pistoia 1897-1899, I, 134-165. he occupied Mulazzo and the lands on the right of the Magra river. G. Fiori, I Malaspina. Castelli e feudi nell'Oltrepo piacentino, pavese, tortonese, Piacenza 1995, Appendice, 275–276. == The relationship with Emperor Frederick the second == The relationship Conrad and his cousin Obizzo started with Emperor Frederick II was very prolific, even though they didn’t have a prominent position in his court, they followed him in northern and central Italy during his campaigns. Conrad was at Frederick’s side in the battles of Monterosi (1220), Capua (1222) and Pontremoli (1226). Conrad’s alliance with Frederick II was briefly interrupted in 1226, because the two cousins sided with Milan and Piacenza, against the Emperial Party. While Obizzo’s schism lasted even after the conflict, after a few months, Conrad went back to the emperor’s side. Hence in 1248 Frederick II gave all the Lunigiana to Pisa, except for Conrad’s land and the castle of Pontremoli, to thank him for his loyalty. After the emperor’s death (1250), Conrad went back to his family and managing his possessions, he then helped the Spino Fiorito branch to reestablish its position of power, as reported in a document stating that in 1253 the two cousins occupied for a short period Pontremoli. After July 1254 there are no documents about Conrad’s actions but it is known that in 1259 his wife (at the time) Agnesina was widowed (implying his death to be between 1254 and 1259). == Marriage and Offspring == Conrad had 7 children in total: Moroello, Franceschino, Albert, Manfredi, Federico, Selvaggia and Beatrice, he also raised as his own the illegitimate child of his cousin Frederik I Malaspina, Conrad Malaspina (the young) (also known as Corradino). His first wife is thought to be Costanza (daughter of Frederick II) but there is no written document confirming this, in 1259 the existence of a new consort is confirmed, Agnesina. == The Malaspina family and Patronage == The common management of the family’s assets and the political strategies, pursued by Conrad, and his uncles Alberto and Guglielmo Malaspina, reflected the spirit of the courtly period in which the family lived. The Malaspina family became patron to several Provençal Troubadours that were travelling to the northern Italian courts. Some of the most famous were: Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Abertet de Sisteron and Guilhelm de la Tor.G. L. Mannucci, I marchesi Malaspina e i poeti provenzali, in Dante e la Lunigiana, Milano 1909, 35-88.

MacDonald received a BSc in Physics from the University of Washington, funded by a NASA Space Grant scholarship, in 1999. Her mentor, Ruth Skoug, encouraged her to remain in research. MacDonald completed her postgraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, earning her PhD in physics in 2004. == Career == MacDonald specializes in plasma mass spectrometry, and has 23 years of expertise in instrument development and data analysis/interpretation. After completing her PhD, MacDonald joined Los Alamos National Laboratory. At LANL she was the Principal Investigator for the Z-Plasma Spectrometer on the Department of Energy Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System geosynchronous payload. She also led the Innovative Research and Integrated Sensing team. She was principal investigator for the Advanced Miniaturized Plasma Spectrometer. She received the Los Alamos Awards Program recognition three times. Between 2009 and 2011 she led the Department of Energy funded Modular Advanced Space Environment Instrumentation. In 2012 she became a New Mexico Consortium-affiliated researcher, working on the prototype for the Aurorasaurus citizen science project. She has served on scientific review panels for the National Science Foundation and Los Alamos National Laboratory grants. Today MacDonald works in the Goddard Space Flight Center. In 2018 MacDonald and her team announced the discovery of a new aurora called Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE). STEVE is farther from the poles than the aurora is typically seen. The European Space Agency Swam A satellite was used to identify that the charged particles in STEVE were around 6000 °C. It was observed by Canadian aurora enthusiasts in 2015. MacDonald attributes the faint purple glow to a subauroral ion drift. MacDonald published the finding in Science. She is working with NASA to crowd source sightings of STEVE. == Awards and honors == In 2018, MacDonald was named as a Walla Walla Public Schools Graduate of Distinction as a \\"pioneer in citizen science initiatives and mentor for aspiring scientists of all ages\\". == Public engagement == In 2016 in the journal Space Weather, MacDonald and co-workers reported that \\"citizen scientists are regularly able to spot auroras farther south of an area where prediction models indicated\\". MacDonald leads an interdisciplinary citizen science project called Aurorasaurus, which uses social media to predict the Northern Lights during the current solar maximum. To fund the program, she won a $1-million INSPIRE grant from the National Science Foundation together with Andrea Tapia of Pennsylvania State University and Michelle Hall of Science Education Solutions. After noticing a spike in tweets about an aurora borealis in October 2011, she established Aurorasaurus to track such geolocation information in order to improve forecasting, such as that done by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. In 2017 she described the aurora as a glitter bomb on the radio program Science Friday. In August 2017, she spoke at the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site about the 2017 solar eclipse.

She took an active role in mapping the northern Pacific Ocean and nearby seas as well as periodically being stationed in Chinese and Korean ports and protecting seal rookeries, principally from American poachers. She also took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901). Sivuch spent the winter of 1903-1904 iced in with the Royal Navy sloop-of-war and a United States Navy gunboat at Newchwang at the mouth of the Liao River on the Gulf of Pechili coast of Manchuria. The three vessels were there when the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904. When the ice broke up in the spring of 1904, Espiegle and the U.S. Navy gunboat left, but Sivuch remained. Newchwang and the Liao River were in Chinese territory, so initially the Russians disarmed Sivuch in recognition of Chinese neutrality, but as their concern over the possibility of a Japanese landing in the vicinity of Newchwang grew, they occupied the Newchwang area and rearmed Sivuch.Corbett, p. 273. Sivuch′s presence at Newchwang and on the Liao River was a matter of concern to the Imperial Japanese Navy during the early months of the war.

London Open Air Sanatorium, west wing, 1910 The Pinewood Hospital was a hospital in Pinewood, near Crowthorne, England, for the treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis. It was located in a pine wood as pine trees were thought to be beneficial in the treatment of the disease. It opened as the London Open Air Sanatorium in 1901 before becoming the Pinewood Sanatorium. It treated casualties of the First and Second World Wars and after the second, began to treat general thoracic patients as tuberculosis became less prevalent. It closed in 1966. ==History== The London Open Air Sanatorium was opened by the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1901 for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. They had purchased the 82 acre site in 1898, following a meeting convened at Marlborough House by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). It was sited in a pine forest at Pine Wood (later Pinewood) in Berkshire as pine trees were thought to be beneficial for tuberculosis patients, and initially accommodated 64 male patients. During the First World War the sanatorium was used to treat victims of gas warfare. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913, authorised the Metropolitan Asylums Board to treat those with tuberculosis. They acquired the organisation in 1919Pinewood Hospital, Wokingham. The National Archives. Retrieved 16 February 2018. and renamed it Pinewood Sanatorium. It opened on 7 July 1919. The Metropolitan Asylums Board was taken over by the London County Council in 1929 and the sanatorium became a Special Hospital under the council's public health department. During the Second World War, it took some civilians, but was used predominantly for servicemen and by the Canadian Red Cross and Air Force who enlarged it by building wooden huts.Pinewood Sanatorium. AIM25. Retrieved 16 February 2018. After the war, it became a cottage hospital. In 1952, a student rehabilitation unit was opened at the hospital. Up to 18 male students with tuberculosis from around the British Isles were offered convalescence in a \\"detached and self-contained ward\\". Entry criteria included being full-time, male and non-infectious, that is, sputum culture negative. The student patients were visited by their tutors so that their studies were not interrupted. In the main building, the first floor was used as the women's ward while the ground floor was used for surgical cases and the men accommodated in wooden huts. In 1954, Norah Schuster set up the first pathology department at the hospital, in a wooden hut adapted for the purpose, as tuberculosis became less prevalent and the hospital began to see more patients with general thoracic disease. For instance, over three years the hospital saw about 20 cases of aspergillosis.Schuster, Norah H. (1983) A Clinical Pathologist Day by Day 1916-1960. London: Norah H. Schuster. p. 23. In 1960, the hospital had 230 beds including a specialist unit for bronchitis patients and the student unit.British Medical Association. (1960) The Hospital Gazetteer. London: British Medical Association. p. 31. ==Buildings== The main buildings were laid out to form a south-facing arc with a medical residence in the middle and two-storey wings with 16 rooms per floor, each with large windows to provide patients with light and fresh air. At the back was a corridor allowing access to toilets and a kitchen, and a dining-hall which was also used for recreation. The kitchens and female staff accommodation was to the north with the disinfecting rooms, laundry, and boiler-house. To the east was an isolation block reserved for cases of acute exanthemata. Patients were charged three guineas per week and typically stayed for at least six months. == Clinical staff == Pathologist Norah Schuster worked at Pinewood Hospital from 1954 until her retirement in 1959.Schuster , Norah H.

It was a prototype Soyuz 7K-L1 launched by Proton. It was a crewed precursor to the Zond series. ==History== The spacecraft was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to conduct a flyby of the Moon and return to Earth. The primary focus was a Soviet circumlunar flight, which help document the Moon, and also show Soviet power. The test ran from the Zond program from 1967-1970, which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1's re-entry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped, ultimately replaced by the Soyuz 7K-L3. ==Objectives== Two test flights of the UR-500K/L1 system were performed in March and April 1967 under the designations Kosmos 146 and Kosmos 154. In April 1967, under the cover name Kosmos-154, the third model of the L-1 was placed into near- Earth orbit. Because of a control system failure that resulted in the premature jettisoning of the ullage motors, the main propulsion system of the Block-D did not ignite. Kosmos 154 was one of the first Zond attempts. It was supposed to flyby the Moon but achieved Earth orbit only. ==Mission== Kosmos 154 was launched using a Proton-K carrier rocket, which flew from Site 81/23 at Baikonur. The launch occurred at 09:07 GMT on 8 April 1967. Kosmos 154 was operated in an Earth orbit, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.6° and an orbital period of 88.5 minutes. Kosmos 154 had a mass of . Kosmos 154 reached Earth orbit but the Blok D translunar injection stage failed to fire (ullage rockets, which had to fire to settle propellants in tanks before the main engine fired, were jettisoned prematurely). Kosmos 154 burned up two days later when orbit decayed, on 10 April 1967. ==Gallery== File:ZOND.jpgAn illustration of Zond spacecraft during trans-lunar coast.

In 41, Secundus led a successful campaign against the Germanic tribe of the Chauci, who had settled on the North Sea coast between the Elbe and Ems rivers. These Germans had made themselves unpopular with the Romans by their raids and their connection with the neighbouring Frisii. The Chauci had also fought on the side of Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the year 9, in which the Germans destroyed three Roman legions, a vicious defeat the Romans remembered well. Secundus gained much prestige by recovering the last of the three battle eagles that had been lost in the battle.

Frederic Apcar (born Frédéric Stefan Apcar; September 16, 1914 – August 2, 2008) was a Russian-born French acrobatic dancer and producer/impresario best known for his pioneering \\"Vive Les Girls\\" and long- running \\"Casino de Paris\\" shows at the Dunes. These Parisian-inspired productions offered a colorful variety of acts featuring singers, dancers, magicians, comedians, acrobats, animal trainers and more. == Biography == Frederic Apcar was born September 16, 1914 in the French Embassy in Russia (today known as Tiflis, Georgia) of Parisian parents and later raised in Paris, France. Apcar first took interest in theater performance after watching the well-known opera, \\"Le Spectre de la Rose!\\" at the young age of 10. Between the ages of 12 and 16, Apcar tried his hand at several professions, working as a market laborer, coal stoker, bookkeeper, printer's devil, waiter and dock boy. Displeased with his last position, he turned his interest back to theater. Frederic Apcar and Florence Waren with the singer Édith Piaf, center. Frederic Apcar dancing with his partner Florence Waren as the adagio act \\"Florence and Frederic.\\" After working briefly as an usher in the Rex Theater in Paris, Apcar then went on to study classical, modern, and tap dancing. At the age of 16, Apcar became a professional dancer, performing first as a chorus boy at the Folies Bergère. Apcar quickly became principal dancer in Folies Bergère after demonstrating his talent and formed his own act, Florence and Frederic, just four years later. Together at Bal Tabarin (Paris), Florence Waren and Frederic Apcar became one of the most renowned ballroom dance teams in Europe, occasionally performing with Édith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier. In 1955, the adagio act expanded to a 14-member ensemble known as The Florence and Frederic Ballet, later making its American debut on Ed Sullivan's variety show. In 1959, producer Lou Walters brought Apcar and his troupe to the Tropicana to join the U.S. Edition of the Folies Bergère. A fan of his work, Dunes owner Major Riddle tested Apcar's production abilities before offering him the Dunes' main showroom. It was in 1961 when Apcar conceived and produced in entirety, his very first musical revue, \\"Vive Les Girls.\\" After proving wild success with it, Apcar launched \\"Casino de Paris\\" in December 1963, in a brand new theater built by Dunes management expressly for the new French spectacular. \\"Casino de Paris\\" ran for two decades at Dunes hotel, headlined by legendary French singer Line Renaud Beyond \\"Vive Les Girls!\\" and \\"Casino de Paris,\\" Apcar went on to produce other hit shows in Las Vegas, including “Bare Touch of Las Vegas,” “Hot Streak,” “Showbiz” and many more. Apcar continued to conceive, produce and direct shows throughout the United States until his retirement in 1993. He maintained Las Vegas as his home base until his death. In 2006, Apcar received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Entertainer/Artist Hall of Fame at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Apcar died on August 2, 2008 at the age of 93. Frederic Apcar is survived by his wife Olga, daughter Elisabeth, and son Frederic Apcar II, who carries his father's legacy producing shows in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. == References == Category:1914 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:People from Tiflis Governorate Category:French male dancers Category:French emigrants to the United States ","title":"Frederic Apcar"},{"id":"56598639","text":"An innate immune defect is a defect in the innate immune response that blunts the response to infection. These defects may occur in monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, basophils, mast cells or complement proteins. == Types == === Toll-like Receptor (TLR) immunodeficiencies === Several TLR immunodeficiencies have been described in which cellular proteins that should transmit the message from the TLRs to the nucleus are abnormal. These signaling defects result in a failure of cytokines to be produced in response to bacterial infection. Disorders of this type include MyD88 deficiency, IRAK-4 deficiency other UNC93B deficiency and TLR3 mutations. ==== MyD88 deficiency ==== Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 deficiency (MyD88) is a disorder of the innate immune system. It belongs to rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by an increased susceptibility to certain types of bacterial infections. Patients suffer from abnormally frequent and severe infections by a subset of bacteria known as pyogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, affected individuals have normal resistance to other common bacteria, virusesfungi, and parasites. MYD88 deficiency is caused by mutations in the MYD88 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. MYD88 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in stimulating the immune system to respond to bacterial infection. The MyD88 protein is part of a signaling pathway that is involved in early recognition of pathogens and the initiation of inflammation to fight infection. This signaling pathway is part of the innate immune response. Most people with this condition have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood. Infections become less frequent by about age 10. ==== IRAK4 deficiency ==== Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder of the immune system. This immunodeficiency leads to recurrent infections caused by the pyogenic bacteria, for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not by other infectious agents. Most patients with IRAK-4 deficiency suffer from invasive bacterial infections, which can cause sepsis, meningitis or they affect the joints that can lead to inflammation and arthritis. These invasive infections can also cause areas of tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses) on internal organs. In addition, patients are characterized by infections of the upper respiratory tract, eyes or skin. Although fever is a common reaction to bacterial infections, many people with IRAK-4 deficiency do not at first develop a high fever in response to these infections, even if the infection is severe. Most patients have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood. Infections become less frequent with age. ==== UNC93B and TLR3 deficiency ==== UNC93B1 is very important signaling molecule involved in the production of interferon which plays a key role in the killing of viruses. Signaling through TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 normally induces production of interferons that are binding to viral RNA and destroy the virus. Deficiency of UNC93B1 or TLR3 leads for example to susceptibility to encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) due to decreased production of interferons in the central nervous system. === Defects in IFN-γ/IL-12 signaling === Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway deficiencies belongs to rare innate immune defects. They are characterized by susceptibility to salmonella infections and also mycobacteria. Mycobacteria is the family of bacteria which cause tuberculosis and other related infections. This deficiency usually occurs in children's after tuberculosis vaccination. The other typical symptoms may be different skin infections, swollen lymph nodes or blood stream infections with an enlarged liver and spleen. == Diagnosis == Patients with innate immune defects have generally intact adaptive immune systems with normal antibodies and T-cells. The main symptom is increased level of eosinophils in the blood, but elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels may also be present. The diagnosis is made in suspected patients by measuring cytokine production by white blood cells, after stimulation by bacterial products. Testing of TLR function is becoming available through commercial reference laboratories. By abnormal tests is usually made repeat testing and also genetic testing. == Treatment == The common treatment for these defects usually involves antibiotic therapy to treat acute infections. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is also used. Some patients require immunoglobulin treatment. == References == Category:Immunology ","title":"Innate immune defect"},{"id":"56598673","text":"Stephen A.

In the journal Clinical Psychology Review (2009), three authors wrote that Ferrada de Noli and co-workers had found a new pathway in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour associated with PTSD. The review concluded that Ferrada de Noli and his co-workers \\"demonstrated that among refugees with PTSD, major depression was not substantially associated with heightened levels of suicidal behaviour\\". Meaning that the path to severe suicide attempts in PTSD victims was not mediated by depression - as it was thought before - but linked directly to PTSD. The discovery indicated modifications in prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour.Panagioti M, Gooding P, Tarrier N (2009). \\"Post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal behavior: A narrative review\\". Clinical Psychology Review. 29 (6): 471–82. doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2009.05.001. . Another finding was significant correlations between specific methods in suicidal behavior and methods used in torture inflicted to prisoners later diagnosed with PTSD.

In the Foundation's archive also are found two other documents containing Ferrada Noli's correspondence with Linda Bimbi, secretary of the scientific working committee established after the Tribunal session on Chile, Abril 1974. In Sweden, he continued in MIR until 1977 as head of MIR and Junta Coordinadora Revolucionaria counter-intelligence activity in Scandinavia, undertaking aimed the monitoring of Operation Condor.French newspaper Le Figaro described the activity as de Noli's \\"espionage assaying\\". In article (\\"In Russia, a curious thesis puts forward to exculpate Damascus\\") \\"En Russie, une curieuse thèse reprise pour exonérer Damas\\", authored by the newspaper's correspondent in Moscow and using a Swedish journalist source, affirms that Ferrada de Noli \\"sought refuge in Sweden, where, in addition to have assayed espionage, he would have pursued a scientific career...\\" In French, original text: «il s'est réfugié en Suède, où, en plus de avoir gôuté à l'espionnage, il aurait poursuivi une carrière scientifique, notamment à Harvard et à l'institut suédois Karolinska des Nobel.» In 1976 he started working as psychotherapist at health services for political refugees in Stockholm County, and 1989 in crisis therapy provided at the Swedish Red Cross Project for traumatized and torture-survivor refugees.\\"Professional work in psychotherapy and psychology\\", Academic CV Academic CV During mid-80s he participated in the Swedish Liberal Party. Following retirement, Ferrada de Noli founded the online magazine The Indicter , dealing with \\"human rights and geopolitical issues\\", as read in the magazine's banner. === Controversies === ====Early controversies==== Earlier academic controversies have involved articles in Swedish medical journals and media on his public opposition to the Swedish diagnose \\"utbrändhet\\" (work- related stress 'burnout'), which he said didn't have epidemiological ground.Torbjörn Friberg. \\"Burnout: From Popular Culture to Psychiatric Diagnosis in Sweden\\". Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry (2009) 33: 538. After he wrote in DN that one risk factor for \\"utbrändhet\\" in women could be stress caused by a double working load, at the job and then at home –contradicting the notion of an advanced Swedish gender equality,Dagens Nyheter, DN-debatt, 20 October 2000. \\"Utbrändheten mest en modetrend\\". Minister Mona Sahlin commented that his thesis was \\"a bid insulting, to say the least\\".Expressen. (\\"It is insulting\\"). \\"Det är förelämpande\\". Stockholm, 21 October 2000. Mona Sahlin (later the leader of the Swedish Social Democrat Party), meant that the problem was not rooted in whether men help women at home, but instead in poor organized environments in working places. The debate on his theses continued 2000-2002 in the journal of the Swedish Medical Association Läkartidningen. Later in 2005, Aftonbladet published a half front-page headline, \\"Professor in attack against the burned-out\\". It referred an interview where Ferrada de Noli stated that to be displeased with a job cannot be equated with a medical diagnosis,Aftonbladet. (\\"Stress-burnout is an invention\\"). \\"Utbrändhet är ett påhitt\\". Stockholm, 14 April 2005. and a new debate ensued in the Swedish media.Svenska Dagbladet. \\"Professor condemns sick leaves\\". \\"Professor dömer ut sjukskrivningar\\". 19 September 2002. In 1998, at that time professor in Norway, De Noli requested the legal extradition of General Augusto Pinochet, to be judged in a European court on allegations of torture and war crimes.Associated Press (AP). \\"Chilean in Norway files against Pinochet\\". Oslo, Norway. 1 November 1998.NTB/Dagbladet. (\\"Pinochet accused in Norge\\"). \\"Pinochet politianmeldt i Norge\\", Oslo, 1 Nov 1998. Svenska Dagbladet. Brännpunkt. (\\"Pinochet has to be taken to court\\"). \\"Pinochet måste ställas inför rätta\\". 6 November 1998. ====Assange case==== De Noli has been criticized in the Swedish media for his public defence of Julian Assange. He published the book Sweden vs. Assange. Human Rights Issues, claiming that the case was instead political.Libertarian Books Sweden (publisher), Stockholm, 2016 (2nd edition). 340 pages. ISBN . In a RT (TV network) interview, 2012, he said that \\"WikiLeaks is a lifeboat to democracy\\",RT (TV network). 'MSM blacks Assange as US seeks Manning link'. 27 March 2012. (Video-interview): \\"The disclosures made by Wikileaks aim to reveal the secrets that actually belong to the people which have elected those authorities which are abusing power by not telling the truth. In my opinion, Wikileaks is actually sending a lifeboat to democracy and democratic societies should instead be thankful for that effort, and not punish Wikileaks.\\" and 2011, via Jennifer Robinson (lawyer), he submitted to the London Court deliberating the extradition of Assange, a testimony based on his investigation \\"Swedish Trial by Media\\".However the testimony was received off court, the issue was referred in \\"Findings of facts and reasons\\" delivered by Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle. See \\"City of Westminster Magistrates' Court (Sitting at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court). Excerpts; \\"There has been considerable adverse publicity in Sweden for Mr Assange, in the popular press, the television and in parliament\\" (Judge Riddle); and, \\"There is significant prejudice because of trial by media\\" (Lawyer Hurtig). In 2012, Swedish Radio said in a broadcast that Ferrada de Noli has implicated \\"a social democratic feminist working together with 'arms-(exports) companies' trying to get Assange\\".Radio Sweden (Sweden's official international broadcasting station). \\"Whistleblower in row with newspaper –Wikileaks vs. Swedish tabloid Expressen\\". Stockholm, 8 March 2012. Ferrada Noli denied that and asked Swedish Radio for a retraction.

In a reportage about Ferrada de Noli's human rights undertakings done by the Italian newspaper L'Eco di Bergamo (January 2019), he was asked why he defended Assange's deeds \\"instead of regard it illegal or criminal\\". De Noli replied, \\"According to International Law, what could instead be considered as criminal is what Assange has denounced\\", Emanuele Roncalli (autor), \\"Primo piano.

De Noli's thesis was that the poison Novichok would have been developed in Uzbekistan, not in Russia, and its possession by other countries could not be ruled out. According to Dagens Nyheter, he would have declared in an interview done with him by the newspaper April 2, 2018, that the Skripal incident could be a case of False flag in anticipating an eventual confrontation sought by the United Kingdom against Russia.Dagens Nyheter, April 2, 2918.

She is a professor of mathematics at Franklin & Marshall College. ==Education== Crannell is the daughter of nuclear physicist Hall L. Crannell of the Catholic University of America, and solar physicist Carol Jo Crannell of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. As a high school student, her favorite subject was Spanish, and she was indifferent to mathematics. She entered Bryn Mawr College intending to continue her language studies, but was inspired to change majors to mathematics by professor Mario Martelli, who noted her talent in a calculus class and encouraged her to take a senior-level class in partial differential equations as a freshman. She graduated in 1986, with magna cum laude honors, and completed her Ph.D. in 1992 from Brown University, with Walter Craig as her doctoral advisor. ==Career== Crannell joined the faculty of Franklin & Marshall College in 1992. She was the founding Don of Bonchek College House (formerly South Ben College House), serving as don from 2005 to 2010. She was section governor of the East Pennsylvania Delaware section of the Mathematical Association of America (2014-2016), and was a member of the executive committee of the Association for Women in Mathematics from 2012 to 2015. She has also chaired the Nominating Committee of the American Mathematical Society (2003–2005). She has been the associate editor of Mathematics Magazine, published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), for over 15 years. ==Contributions== Crannell's dissertation, The Existence of Many Non- Traveling, Periodic Solutions of the Boussinesq Equation, concerned the Boussinesq approximation for water waves.

Hunter was granted 299 US patents, over 140 of them for electric railway apparatus. He played a key role in the development of \\"mixed control,\\" long the standard method of controlling the speed of electric streetcars and locomotives. Hunter later largely abandoned his work as a practical inventor and devoted himself to a futile (despite his claims of success) quest to transmute silver and other metals into gold. == Early life and education == Hunter's father, Robert, was a physician specializing in respiratory disorders. Canadian by birth, he married Sarah Barton, also Canadian, in 1846. Rudolph was born in New York City, the fifth of the couple's eight children who survived infancy. Robert Hunter, an inventor in his own right, was granted seven US patents for marine propulsion systems (including one for a mechanical toy fish). The last of those patents (No. 150,956), issued in May 1874, was for an innovative design that he had introduced in a canal boat in 1872. Lured by a $100,000 prize, he entered the boat in a New York State-sponsored contest to design a viable steam propulsion system for use on the state's canals. Hunter's design featured two stern-mounted, vertically oriented paddlewheels that rotated in opposite directions, in order to control wake. The pitch of the wheels' blades could be adjusted to steer the boat without the use of a rudder or to move it in reverse without reversing the engine. Unfortunately, the system proved impracticable, and the boat failed to complete its trial runs. From childhood Rudolph was strongly encouraged to invent,Hunter Testimony, p. 70; Interference Case No. 13,298, Sprague v. Hunter v. Van Depoele; Interference Case Files, 1836-1905; Records of the Patent Office, Record Group 241; National Archives at College Park, MD. and one of his early inventions appears to have been inspired by his father's canal-boat work. In 1878, at age 22, he sketched a rudderless submarine equipped with two side-mounted screw propellers. The propellers could be pivoted to point backward, forward, up or down, thereby moving the vessel in any direction. He refined the design and in the 1880s tried to sell it to the US Navy and foreign governments.Hunter, Rudolph M. (c. 1883). Hunter's submarine vessel and fish torpedo. Philadelphia?: Self-published?. [promotional brochure received by the US Navy Department Library in 1883] He failed to find a buyer, however, and he did not patent the design. Hunter attended schools in England, France and Canada before embarking, at age 15, on his career path. In 1871 he started work as a draftsman for Frank Millward, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Millward did engineering and patent work, and Hunter, while in his employ, diligently studied engineering. In 1874 Hunter took his newfound engineering skills to Olive Foundry & Machine Shops, in Ironton, Ohio, where he designed and built machinery. By 1876 he had moved to Chicago, Illinois, in part to seek proper care (most likely from his father, who had moved there from Cincinnati) for respiratory troubles. Later that year he moved to Philadelphia, where he resumed his formal education.Hunter Testimony, pp. 69-74; IC 13,298, Sprague v. Hunter v. Van Depoele; ICF 1836-1905; RG 241; NACP. Hunter, in testimony presented in this patent interference case, detailed his early work experiences and the means by which he became a skilled engineer. He studied mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic College of the State of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in 1878. He settled permanently in Philadelphia and in October 1879 married Emilie Phillips, daughter of a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, physician. == Career == left By late 1878 Hunter had established an office in Philadelphia to offer his services as a consulting engineer and patent attorney. In June 1879 he secured his first patent (No. 216,519), for a \\"process and apparatus\\" for making illuminating gas. He eventually held 299 US patents, 279 of them issued by 1902. He also secured seven Canadian and six British patents, all for inventions on which he also held a US patent. His inventions ranged from mechanical toys to industrial machinery, but most were for electrical devices and systems. Throughout his career as an inventor, he continued to work as a patent attorney, representing himself in numerous patent interference cases, in addition to serving outside clients. === Electric railways === Hunter's primary focus, early in his career, was on the development of electric railways. From 1881 to 1886 he struggled to secure financing to patent and commercialize his many inventions in the field. But with the formation of Electric Car Company of America (originally named Hunter Electric Co.), in 1887, he finally had the resources to build and market electric street-railway systems.Hunter Testimony, pp. 26-29, 64-68; IC 13,298, Sprague v. Hunter v. Van Depoele; ICF 1836-1905; RG 241; NACP. Electric Car's prospects quickly dimmed, however, largely due to the success of other inventors and to the efforts of major electrical firms to develop their own street-railway businesses. In 1888 Frank J. Sprague completed the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, widely considered the first successful large-scale electric street-railway system. Sprague had close ties to Thomas Edison's organization, and in April 1889 his company became part of the newly incorporated Edison General Electric Co. Over a year earlier, Thomson-Houston Electric Co. had bought out Sprague's chief rival, Charles Van Depoele, and in August 1889 Thomson-Houston bought partial rights to Electric Car's patents, the bulk of which were Hunter's. Edison General and Thomson- Houston were locked in fierce competition, one aspect of which was costly and time-consuming patent litigation. By early 1892 both companies were eager to end the rivalry, and in April they did so, by merging. One of the merger's key benefits was to consolidate control of the Sprague, Van Depoele, and Electric Car patents (and many other patents) in the resulting corporate giant, General Electric Co. Hunter's \\"castle\\" at 3710 Chestnut St., Philadelphia. The sale of Electric Car's patent rights, though it may have dashed any grand hopes Hunter had for the company, made him a wealthy man. In a December 1894 letter to Franklin Institute secretary William H. Wahl, Hunter intimated that the deal had netted him more than $600,000 (more than $15,000,000 in 2018 dollars).Rudolph M. Hunter to William H. Wahl, December 15, 1894. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, files 1836-1837 (combined). Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. That figure is unverified and may be exaggerated, but there is little doubt that Thomson-Houston considered his patents valuable. In an 1891 publication, the company listed the 82 \\"most important\\" electric railway patents under its control. A surprising 27 of them, more than for any other inventor, were Hunter's. And it is clear that his financial situation and lifestyle improved dramatically at about the time of the sale. In December 1889, after years of living in rented quarters, he moved into a castle-like mansion he built in West Philadelphia.Hunter Testimony, pp. 50, 68; Interference Case No. 15,832, Hopkinson v. Hunter; Interference Case Files, 1836-1905; Records of the Patent Office, Record Group 241; National Archives at College Park, MD. By 1893 he had crowned the structure with a rooftop street-railway line, which he used, he told The Philadelphia Press, to test and apply new designs. Working trolley line on the roof of Hunter's Chestnut St. home. In 1894, hoping to gain recognition for his electric railway work, Hunter entered an annual competition conducted by the Franklin Institute's Committee on Science and the Arts. In a June 26 letter to Wahl, he audaciously claimed to have invented the \\"modern electric railway\\" virtually in its entirety.Rudolph M. Hunter to William H. Wahl, June 26, 1894. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, files 1836-1837 (combined). Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. On his official entry forms, submitted a few days earlier, he was more realistic, claiming credit mainly for two of the electric street- railway's key elements: the \\"trolley system\\" (specifically, a viable underrunning trolley assembly) and the \\"series-multiple controller\\" (a speed- and torque-control switch, better known as the \\"series-parallel controller\\").Rudolph M. Hunter entry forms, June 21, 1894. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, files 1836-1837 (combined). Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. A report on Hunter's entry concluded that other inventors had received at least partial credit for the underrunning trolley and that it was up to \\"the courts,\\" not the Committee on Science and the Arts, to determine priority of invention.Subcommittee report to the Committee on Science and the Arts, November 28, 1894. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, files 1836-1837 (combined). Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. The committee declined, therefore, to give him an award. Hunter was outraged, though the committee's decision clearly was justified. Nearly two years earlier, the US Patent Office had granted priority of invention to Van Depoele, who had prevailed against both Sprague and Hunter in a landmark interference case.Decision of the examiner of interferences, December 15, 1892; IC 13,298, Sprague v. Hunter v. Van Depoele; ICF 1836-1905; RG 241; NACP. Van Depoele's patent (No. 495,443), issued posthumously and assigned to Thomson-Houston, was extremely valuable and, not surprisingly, hotly contested in the courts. In a string of infringement suits brought by Thomson-Houston on GE's behalf, the courts repeatedly affirmed the patent's validity, thereby giving GE a virtual monopoly on the practical underrunning trolley.The first and probably most significant of those suits was Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Winchester Avenue Railway Co. et al. (73 O.G., 2155). United States Patent Office (1896). Decisions of the commissioner of patents and of the United States courts in patent and trade-mark and copyright cases. 1895. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office. pp. 788–806. Winchester was a licensee of codefendant Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., so the case essentially pitted GE against its most formidable rival, Westinghouse. The series-parallel controller had also been the subject of an interference battle. Hunter held a US patent (No. 385,055), issued in June 1888, for the device, but a British patent (Great Britain No. 2989 of 1881) had been granted to electrical engineer John Hopkinson over six years earlier. Hopkinson applied for a US patent in 1892, triggering an interference case. Hunter presented evidence that he had conceived his controller before Hopkinson's formal (for purposes of the case) date of invention, but Hopkinson nonetheless was granted priority of invention. Hunter, the examiner of interferences explained, had failed to show sufficient diligence in reducing his device to practice, prior to Hopkinson's date of invention.Decision of the examiner of interferences, April 19, 1895; IC 15,832, Hopkinson v. Hunter; ICF 1836-1905; RG 241; NACP. Hopkinson's British patent expired, however, before the case was resolved. That made him ineligible for a US patent (which, if issued, would have expired concurrently with his British patent), and Hunter's patent therefore remained in force.Hopkinson v. Hunter (74 O.G., 653). United States Patent Office (1897). Decisions of the commissioner of patents and of the United States courts in patent and trade-mark and copyright cases. 1896. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office. pp. 1-5. Hunter's contribution to electric-railway motor control did not consist entirely of the series-parallel controller, however. Before the adoption of series-parallel control, rheostats were widely used to control the speed of cars. In November 1888 Electric Car's general manager, George H. Condict, secured a US patent (No. 393,323) for a switch that improved on Hunter's series-parallel design. His most important advance (though neither he nor Hunter, who acted as his patent attorney, realized it at the time) was to integrate the series-parallel and rheostatic methods in a single control mechanism. Condict's patent was among the many that Electric Car licensed to Thomson-Houston, and in 1892 (just after the Thomson- Houston—Edison General Electric merger was consummated) GE introduced a controller based largely on his design. The new device was extremely successful and, as a result, closely imitated by other companies. Thomson- Houston (on behalf of GE) and Electric Car countered with at least four suits for infringement of Condict's patent.The first of those suits was Electric Car Co. of America et al. v. Hartford & West Hartford Railroad Co. et al. (87 Fed., 733). Federal reporter: cases argued and determined in the circuit courts of appeals and circuit and district courts of the United States. 87. St. Paul: West Publishing Co. 1898. pp. 733–740. The courts fully upheld the patent at first, but a US circuit court, in a 1901 ruling, partially invalidated it. The court found that \\"mixed control\\" (the joint use of series- parallel and rheostatic control) had been anticipated in two Hunter patents (Nos. 431,720 and 385,180). Those patents describe the use of both control methods, but not by way of a single control mechanism. The court therefore recognized the contributions of both Hunter and Condict to mixed control: Hunter for the broad method; Condict for the method’s practical implementation, using a single switch.Thomson-Houston Electric Co. et al. v. Nassau Electric Railroad Co. et al. (108 Fed., 244). Federal reporter: cases argued and determined in the circuit courts of appeals and circuit and district courts of the United States. 108. St. Paul: West Publishing Co. 1901. pp. 244–253. === Electric power transmission === Hunter again entered the Franklin Institute competition, In 1896, claiming nothing less than to have invented the \\" 'step up and step down' transformer system of electrical distribution.\\"Rudolph M. Hunter entry form, June 2, 1896. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, file 1933. Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. He based that claim largely on patent No. 460,071, issued to him in 1891, and on drawings indicating that he had conceived such a system by 1881 and reduced a system to practice by 1884. The Committee on Science and the Arts, in its report on Hunter's entry, noted that, as early as 1838, Joseph Henry had used transformers to step a current up to higher voltage and back down to lower voltage. Hunter had not, therefore, been first to conceive the broad method. Nor, the report added, had he been first to demonstrate the method's practical utility. Marcel Deprez and Jules Carpentier, in a French patent application dated March 1881, had described the use of a step-up and step-down system to remotely activate a platinum filament. Hunter's claimed conception date was August 1881, several months after Deprez and Carpentier had filed their application. The committee again, therefore, denied him an award.Committee on Science and the Arts report, Nov. 2, 1896. Franklin Institute Awards Case Files, file 1933. Franklin Institute. Philadelphia. === Electric automobiles === One of the new company's first ads, as it appeared in The Philadelphia Times, June 9, 1898. In 1898 prospects for the electric automobile seemed bright, and Hunter, armed with his electric-railway expertise, joined forces with prominent Philadelphia businessmen to launch General Electric Automobile Co.\\"Profit taking was continued: prices moved irregularly and towards a lower level: good buying on decline\\". The Philadelphia Times. June 9, 1898. p. 8. Retrieved September 23, 2015. This recap of June 8, 1898, stock trading in Philadelphia and elsewhere notes that GE Auto's stock was introduced during the day and provides details regarding the new company's organization, capitalization, directors, etc. The new company (which was not affiliated with GE) touted its control of 69 patents, over half of them Hunter's, that it claimed to cover virtually every element of value in battery-powered vehicles.General Electric Automobile Company. Philadelphia? 1898? The patents are listed in this promotional booklet presumably published by the company at about the time of its founding. But they were more properly electric railway patents, the rights to which Electric Car had transferred to GE Auto.Hunter, R.M. (June 23, 1898). \\"Hunter car-control patents\\". The Electrical Engineer. 25: p. 713 – via Google Books. In this letter to the editor, Hunter explains that Electric Car, in its licensing agreement with Thomson-Houston, had retained the rights to its patents for use in battery-powered vehicles and that those retained rights had been transferred to GE Auto. Their value, for purposes of making automobiles, was therefore at least somewhat open to question. GE Auto produced passenger and commercial vehicles but apparently had little success selling them. In an April 1900 ad in The New York Times, John Wanamaker & Co. offered two passenger models for sale.\\"The Wanamaker store: automobiles and bicycles\\" [advertisement]. The New York Times. April 7, 1900. p. 4. Retrieved February 23, 2018. But the automaker was by then in deep financial trouble. A committee had been appointed, in late March, to seek consolidation partners or secure \\"adequate working capital,\\" and by mid May the company's stock price had collapsed.\\"Outside Securities\\". The New York Times. May 17, 1900. p. 11. Retrieved February 23, 2018. GE Auto's stock price effectively fell to $0 (no bid price, $2 ask price) as of May 16, 1900. The committee's efforts, and those of a second reorganization committee, failed, and in July rights to the 69 patents were sold at auction. The $29,000 sale price reportedly covered \\"less than half\\" of GE Auto's debt. There is evidence of at least one more reorganization attempt, but the company does not appear to have conducted any significant business after the sale of its patent rights. === Motor Trucks === In 1901, on the heels of GE Auto's demise, Hunter briefly turned his attention to non-electric vehicles. By the following year he had secured two patents (Nos. 670,405 and 696,143) for motor-trucks powered by gasoline engines (or other means). Both patents were assigned to Tractor Truck & General Power Co., yet another of his enterprises. The second patent, issued in March 1902, is for a self-contained (i.e., independently operable) truck designed to tow a semi-trailer. Hunter was probably not first to conceive such a vehicle; by 1899 Cleveland, Ohio-based Winton Motor Carriage Co. had converted an automobile into a tractor designed to tow a semi-trailer. But the Winton design was not patented, and Hunter's patent appears to be the first, in the US or elsewhere, for a vehicle that embodies all the basic features of the modern semi-tractor. His key innovation was to position the driver's seat on the tractor, not the trailer (as in previous patents). In so doing, he transformed the tractor from a source of motive power and directional control (essentially, a replacement for the horse) into an independent vehicle. === Transmutation === In 1903 Hunter largely turned his back on practical invention and turned to a much more speculative pursuit, the transmutation of elements. In a flurry of newspaper articles, the first appearing in July, he announced that he had discovered a process for changing silver (and other metals) into gold. He also announced plans for a $500,000 plant capable of producing \\"thousands of dollars worth of gold … daily,\\" and he established two firms, Mirabile Corp. and United States Assay and Bullion Co., to implement the venture. Hunter's claim to have mastered transmutation, though far-fetched, was at least tenuously grounded in advanced (for the day) atomic theory. He had embraced the theory that atoms, instead of being fundamental units of matter (and therefore immutable), consist of yet smaller particles that, depending on their number (and other factors) comprise the different elements. That led him to more or less accurately describe transmutation as a process in which the atom is \\"divided into its component ions [subatomic particles], and the ions reassembled in new combination.\\" He apparently failed to appreciate, however, how little he (or anyone in 1903) actually knew about the atom and subatomic phenomena. To create gold, he asserted, one needed only to deactivate the particles in silver atoms (by \\"de- electrifying\\" them), then \\"gather up 137,620 of them and impress upon them the proper electric charge … and set them into motion with new orbital range.\\" But that formulation, realistic as it may have seemed to Hunter, was highly speculative and based on faulty assumptions. He had, for example, badly miscalculated the numbers of particles in atoms of silver and gold, and he had assumed all subatomic particles to be the same, except for their electric charge, which he thought could be changed at will. Hunter on vacation in the Thousand Islands, c. 1906. Just as Hunter was unveiling his transmutation claims, chemists William Ramsay and Frederick Soddy reported one of the most important findings of early atomic science. Their study of radium radioactivity had revealed that radium, as it decays, transmutes into helium. Hunter, in response to that news, wrote Ramsay to tell him that he had already achieved the transmutation of silver into gold. Ramsay, intrigued, wrote Hunter \\"several times\\" and in September 1904 visited him in Philadelphia. In letters to his wife and, later, a good friend, Ramsay reported that Hunter was \\"no swindler\\" and had \\"based his conclusions on actual experiments.\\" But his enthusiasm no doubt waned as he observed, for years, samples of processed silver that Hunter had sent him. Hunter claimed that gold was \\"growing\\" in the silver, but Ramsay (and others he recruited) found no evidence to support that claim.Morrisson, Mark S. (2007). Modern alchemy: occultism and the emergence of atomic theory. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 116–117. . Morrisson, in recounting Hunter's interactions with Ramsay, mistakenly identifies him as \\"Robert Melville Hunter\\" (an error Morrisson has acknowledged via personal communication). The quotes from Ramsay's letters are as reported by Morrisson. Hunter continued to insist, however, that his process worked. In 1916 he went so far as to claim that he could make gold from \\"common mineral substances, even from water and stone.\\" But the gold-manufacturing plant never materialized, and Mirabile reportedly slipped, more than once, into controversy. There are reports of two 1905 lawsuits (one filed against the company and one on its behalf), both of which state that the transmutation process was invented not by Hunter, but by one of his associates at the company (a different associate was named in each suit). It does not appear, however, that either suit resulted in a judgement or settlement. Some 11 years later, in May 1916, the Galveston Tribune reported that Hunter had earlier been obliged to purchase more than $33,000 in Mirabile stock from disenchanted investors, and that his elder son, Rudolph Harding Hunter, was currently trying to seize control of the company. There is no hard evidence, however, that Mirabile (or US Assay and Bullion) intentionally misled or defrauded investors. So it is at least possible that the gold-making venture, no matter how misguided, was legitimate. It is hard to imagine, on the other hand, how someone with Hunter's expertise and experience could have failed to realize that his process did not work, so the possibility of fraud cannot be dismissed. == Later years == Even as he clung to his transmutation dreams, Hunter never fully abandoned his work as a practical engineer and inventor. He secured 20 US patents after 1902, nine of them for hydraulic equipment: nozzles, valves, and regulators. His last patented invention was a mold for reflective prism-glass; the patent (No. 1,925,096) was issued in September 1933. Hunter died March 19, 1935, at his home in Philadelphia, having never gained the level of recognition he sought as an inventor, and having never, apparently, renounced his transmutation claims. A stroke, The New York Times reported in its obituary, \\"contributed to his death.\\" His remains lie in Chelten Hills Abbey, a notable (but sadly deteriorating) art-deco mausoleum at Philadelphia’s Chelten Hills Cemetery. == References == === General references === Hursh, David D.

Baldwin (November 8, 1840 – February 26, 1910), known as \\"Chinese Champion\\", was an American missionary, teacher, translator, writer, and editor. She understood the religious and political problems of China, and the Chinese people, as perhaps no other woman in this country did at that time. She labored constantly to bring about a better understanding between the two nations. Baldwin was courageous in her advocacy of whatever appeared to her to be true, by whomsoever it might chance to be condemned or approved. She served as president of the New York Woman's Missionary Society for two decades. ==Early years and education== Esther E. Jerman was born in Marlton, New Jersey, November 8, 1840. Her father, the Rev. Mathias Jerman, was for many years an honored and successful member of the New Jersey Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Esther was constitutionally frail, sensitive and studious. Her first schooling was given her at home, where was laid the foundation of all her future usefulness. To this was added instruction in the public schools and in an excellent private school in Salem, New Jersey, followed by a full course in Pennington Seminary, New Jersey. She was graduated from that institution in 1859, or 1860, taking the highest honors. Baldwin became a Christian at the age of ten, and united with the church of her parents. ==Career== In 1860, she became a teacher of higher mathematics, Latin and French in a seminary in Virginia. At the beginning of the Civil War her sympathies were with the North, and she resigned her position and returned home. In the summer of 1861 she met the Rev. Stephen Livingstone Baldwin, of the Foochow Mission, then at home on furlough, and in April, 1862, they were married, and sailed for China the following June, arriving in November, after five months at sea. Besides her domestic responsibilities, she was soon entrusted with the supervision of several day schools and of a class of Bible women who were sent out to read the Bible to their country-women. In her thoughtful survey of the condition of woman and childhood in China, quickened by her personal observation and experience, she became deeply impressed with the need of educated Christian woman physicians. She saw that through this means, access and confidence could be gained and the way opened for missionary work. She was the first to ask for a medical woman to be sent to China. When the hospital for women and children was opened in Foochow, the first for such a purpose founded in that empire, she gave it her cooperation. For several years she translated the Berean Lessons into the Chinese language for the use of the Methodist Mission and of the American Board. For two years, she edited in the same language the Youth's Illustrated Paper. She saw the missions grow from small beginnings into strong churches. After eighteen years of this work, she became gravely ill, and her physician declared that a change of climate and entire rest were essential to recovery. The American pulpit was freely open to Dr. Baldwin, and his pastonal services were eagerly sought. For some years, he was the recording secretary of the Board of Missions of the M. E. Church. Baldwin's health was largely restored since her return to the United States, and she spent her time in active benevolence. She was extensively employed in the interests of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, being president for two decades of the New York branch of that society in the Methodist Church, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in lectures on various subjects, and in many charities. She was an ardent advocate of the equality of women with men, both in the State and in the Church. The \\"Chinese question\\" in all its aspects had her sympathies. The misrepresentation and abuse of the Chinese kindled her indignation. She was called to speak before large audiences in many places on the \\"Chinese question\\" and contributed numerous articles on the subject to various city papers. She carefully collected and forcibly stated both the laws and the facts bearing on the subject, and published them in a volume entitled Must the Chinese Go? which had three editions.

After a doctoral fellowship funded by the German Academic Exchange Service at Stanford University, he joined Boston University as a faculty member in 1996. == Scientific contributions == === Clinical Translational Research === Hofmann has been studying the nature of emotional disorders and the processes through which psychological treatments alleviate suffering by translating discoveries from emotion research and neuroscience into clinical applications. === Pharmacological Augmentation of Psychotherapy === An important mechanism of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is extinction learning. Hofmann has shown that d-cycloserine, a partial agonist of the glutamate receptor can augment extinction learning and speed up exposure therapy of anxiety disorders. === Emotion Research === Some of his other major contributions are on Mindfulness and research on Emotion in therapy. In particular, he advanced the concept of Interpersonal emotion regulation. === Processes-Based Therapy === Model of PBT In collaboration with Steven C. Hayes, he has been identifying the processes that underlie effective psychological treatments. === Neuromarkers of Psychotherapy === He has been using Magnetic Resonance Imaging to predict the response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). == Awards and recognition == Hofmann has published more than 400 peer-reviewed scientific articles and 20 books and is listed by Clarivate Analytics as a highly cited researcherhttps://publons.com/researcher/1264183/stefan-g-hofmann/.

In her Broadway musical debut, the 22-year-old Elaine Stritch delivered the most notable song of the revue, \\"Civilization,\\" which went on to become a standard. Although she only had one song in the revue, Stritch was said to have gotten the loudest applause. Also in the cast were Eileen Barton, Eugenie Baird, Nadine Gae, Peter Hamilton, Robert Stanton, Viola Roache, Johnny Barnes, Janet Gaylord, Alan Green, and Bill McGraw. == Song List == == References == == External links == Category:Broadway musicals Category:Revues Category:1947 musicals Category:Tony Award-winning musicals ","title":"Angel in the Wings"},{"id":"56598869","text":"Dominic Thiem was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to Fernando Verdasco.

In 2007 Lovell won the first Aperture Portfolio Prize for her work entitled Catastrophe, Crisis, and Other Family Traditions. However, Lovell is most well known for her work entitled Dear Erin Hart, in which she found, followed, and photographed her identity thief, Erin Hart. More recently Lovell obtained her private investigator license, as part of her artwork entitled D.I.Y. P.I. (Do It Yourself Private Investigator). Lovell resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she teaches at the University of New Mexico and is represented by Central Features Contemporary Art. == Dear Erin Hart, == For her artwork Dear Erin Hart, Jessamyn Lovell found, followed, and photographed her identity thief Erin Hart. Lovell's wallet and phone were stolen, but in February 2011, when she was summoned to appear in court for a petty crime for which she was not involved, she learned her identity was also stolen. She tracked down Hart with the help of a private investigator, incorporating the photographs and experience into her art practice. Lovell speaks about not being sure if she wanted to confront Hart and, through the process of making art, begins to empathize with her. She eventually decided to not confront her but did send her a letter including an invitation to the exhibition, to which Hart never responded. The images that resulted reference surveillance photography and ask questions about the ethics of photography in a situation where the subject initially violated the privacy of the photographer. Dear Erin Hart, has been exhibited at San Francisco Camerawork, Center for Contemporary Arts Santa Fe, CENTER, Central Features Contemporary Art, Colorado Photographic Arts Center, Carol Calo Gallery, and Sorenson Center for the Arts. A book of the work was published by SF Camerawork in 2015.

Mount Carmel West was the oldest hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System founded in 1886 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The hospital was situated between Ohio State Route 16 and U.S. Route 62, and accessible from exits on Interstate 70 and Ohio State Route 315. The Mount Carmel College of Nursing is located on hospital grounds. U.S. News & World Report regionally ranked Mount Carmel East and West Hospitals the number 18 best performing among hospitals in Ohio and high performing in four specialties and procedures. Mount Carmel West was a tertiary hospital with many specialties located on its grounds, but in late 2016 a $46 million plan was announced to transform it into an outpatient facility with a fully functioning emergency department in a new location on the premises. The inpatient services will be moved to a new location under construction in Grove City while the Level II Trauma Center will be moved to the existing Mount Carmel East hospital near Reynoldsburg. The majority of the hospital will be demolished with demolition plans to be completed in 2020. This will see the expansion of the College of Nursing and closure of the inpatient Psychiatry unit with it being moved to a new facility near Mount Carmel East. ==History== The demolished hospital site in front of the College of Nursing, 2020 Mount Carmel West main entrance in 2017 What would become Mount Carmel West was first known as Hawkes Hospital of Mt. Carmel, and was founded by Dr. W. B. Hawkes (1812–1883). Before the building was completed, Dr. Hawkes died and buried in Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. Dr. John W. Hamilton (1823–1898) was tasked finish construction, and secured the services of the Sisters of the Holy Cross to operate the hospital. The hospital was formally opened in 1886. The hospital was opened intending to serve the needs of infants and women. In 1906 a second building adjoining the old one containing a chapel and 120 additional patient rooms was started. The Training School for Nurses was opened in 1903 to train nurses including eight sisters in the first graduating class. It has since become the Mount Carmel College of Nursing. It was not until 1921 that an additional 120 patient rooms were added on as well as 20 rooms with recreation halls, three classrooms, and a library to help to the Mount Carmel School of Nursing which is what the nursing school was known as at the time. In late 2016 a plan was agreed that will begin in 2019 of the transformation of Mount Carmel West from a full inpatient hospital to a facility based on outpatient services while still retaining a full-service emergency department. Mount Carmel Health System plans to begin demolishing the majority of Mount Carmel West hospital by spring 2019 after moving inpatient services will be moved to a new 210-bed hospital being constructed in Grove City. The Emergency department is being rebuilt in a new location. The College of Nursing will also be expanded. All planned work should be finished by 2020. ==Mount Carmel College of Nursing== College of Nursing campus in 2020 The Mount Carmel College of Nursing was founded by the Sisters of the Holy Cross in 1903. It has since become one of the largest baccalaureate nursing programs in the state of Ohio. It is still located to this day on the campus of Mount Carmel West. Both freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus with both coed dorms and single student apartments. Today, it is a private, coeducational and Catholic church affiliated institution with around 1100 full-time students. It was accredited with the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) until that body was dissolved in 2014. It has since maintained accreditation with NCA's successor organization, the Higher Learning Commission. The courses offered on campus include a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Nursing Administration, Family Nurse Practitioner and Nursing Education, Master of Science in Adult Health, and a Dietetic Internship. During the 100 year anniversary of the College of Nursing it was announced that a Graduate program would be started with a Master of Science degree. ==Services== Mount Carmel West was a tertiary hospital with many specialties including:  style=\\"width:50%; vertical-align:top; text- align:left; border:0;\\" * Bariatrics * Cardiology * Cardiothoracic Surgery * Colorectal Surgery * Critical Care * Emergency Medicine * Endocrinology * Endovascular and Vascular Surgery * ENT * Family Practice * Gastroenterology * General Surgery * Gynecology * Infectious Disease * Internal Medicine * Nephrology  style=\\"width:50%; vertical-align:top; text-align:left; border:0;\\" * Neurology * Neurosurgery * Obstetrics * Oncology (Medical & Surgical) * Ophthalmology * Orthopedic Surgery * Physical Medicine & Rehab * Plastic Surgery * Podiatry * Pulmonology * Psychiatry (includes inpatient unit) * Radiology * Thoracic Surgery * Urology * Urogynecology * Women's Health ==Transformation== The hospital's emergency department, 2017 In late 2016 a $46 million comprehensive and controversial plan was agreed that will begin in 2019 of the transformation of Mount Carmel West from a full inpatient hospital to a facility based on outpatient services while still retaining a full-service emergency department in a new location on campus. Mount Carmel Health System plans to begin demolishing the majority of Mount Carmel West hospital by spring 2019 with all demolition work to be completed by the end of 2020. Inpatient services are being moved to a new 210-bed hospital being constructed in Grove City. The Emergency department is being rebuilt in a new location with the Level II Trauma Center being moved to Mt. Carmel East. Plans for how to redevelop the 37-acre campus are still be being finalized while receiving local and community input. The existing plans call for Mount Carmel to keep the four parking garages, some of which directly connect to outpatient offices, and their 2011 parking spaces. The plans call for the equivalent of 1,500 full-time employees will transfer to the Grove City hospital with just 300 staying at Mount Carmel West. This will also involve the inpatient Psychiatry unit which is being demolished and a new facility to be built on the east side with plans to build a new 80-bed behavioral-health hospital quadrupling the amount of beds at Mount Carmel West. Investments will also be made to the College of Nursing whose enrollment is expected to grow by 200 to 400 students over the next three to five years from the 1,100 students it currently has enrolled. Some in the community have welcomed the proposed changes to develop the college of nursing, the possible public park spaces and considerations for affordable housing on the existing hospital grounds. Not everyone in the community have welcomed the possible changes. Some of expressed concern for the amount of full-time staff Mount Carmel will keep in its Mount Carmel West emergency department and about older residents who will soon have to travel longer distances to receive treatment especially in emergencies. The plan for the West campus is to ensure access to behavioral- health and substance-abuse treatment in Franklinton, and the surrounding area but it was unclear how those services would be provided after the transformation. ==Mount Carmel Medical Group== Mount Carmel West was part of Mount Carmel Medical Group, representing more than 250 primary care and specialty care providers. This is a network of providers for care that is not of an emergency nature. The hospital was also affiliated with Mount Carmel Health Partners – a network of up to \\"1,200 primary care and specialty physicians\\" – and with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. This expanded the network of care providers in the central Ohio area that were associated with Mount Carmel, although unlike the situation with providers in the Mount Carmel Health System, items such as medical records may not be transferred automatically. ==Transport== The hospital was accessible by public transport via COTA bus services operating throughout metropolitan Columbus, Ohio. Mount Carmel West was also situated between Ohio State Route 16 and U.S. Route 62 and close enough to be seen from Interstate 70 and Ohio State Route 315 allowing for multiple points of access in downtown Columbus. It was also able to be served by a variety of airports in the region supporting medical evacuation flights and an on-site helipad. ==References== Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area Category:Hospital networks in the United States Category:Healthcare in Columbus, Ohio Category:Hospitals in Columbus, Ohio Category:Medical and health organizations based in Ohio Category:1886 establishments in Ohio Category:Hospitals established in 1886 Category:Demolished_buildings_and_structures_in_Ohio Category:2019_disestablishments_in_Ohio Category:Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio ","title":"Mount Carmel West"},{"id":"56598954","text":"Antoni Gąsiorowski (born 24 November 1932 in Poznańhttp://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3904528 Encyklopedia PWN on- line].) is a Polish medievalist historian, professor of humanities, member of the członek krajowy korespondent of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Jastrzębiec. He had four brothers and six sisters. ==Early life== He studied abroad (Padua, Rome, Madrid). In 1545 he received the Poznań canon. After returning from Italy, he stayed at the court of King Zygmunt August, where he became known as a man especially talented for foreign languages and for service in diplomacy. Hence, in 1560, after the death of Queen Bona, he was sent to Madrid in Spain, where he spent 10 years, trying to regain the so-called. Neapolitan sums. After returning to Poland, he was again sent to Spain after the death of Piotr Barzego, the castellan of Przemyśl and a Polish deputy who made wrong decisions in state matters, which required immediate intervention and repair. As a member, he was also sent to Pope Gregory XIII. His diplomatic successes were due to very good knowledge of Italian, French and Spanish. Canceled from Spain, he returned to Poland in 1573. ==Episcopal career== In recognition of his diplomatic talent, Henryk Walezy appointed him in 1574, at the coronation sejm of the Crown Deputy, and then Stefan Batory as the Grand Chancellor of the Crown in 1576 and the Bishop of Przemyśl. Shortly thereafter, he submitted the chancellor's seal to Jan Zamoyski, and having not yet approved the papacy for the diocese of Przemyśl, he was nominated for the bishopric in Płock, where his rule lasted from 5 July 1577 until his death on 28 August 1590. In 1575 he signed the election of Emperor Maximilian II Habsburg.Leszek Kieniewicz, Senat za Stefana Batorego, (Warszawa 2000), p. 299. In 1589, he was a signatory of the ratification of the Bytom-Będzin treaty at the pacification parliament.Codex diplomaticus Regni Poloniae et Magni Ducatus Lituaniae, wydał Maciej Dogiel, vol.I, (Wilno 1758), p.237. As a bishop of Płock, he twice conducted a diocesan synod in Płock and Pułtusk (1586 and 1589), which contributed to the reception of the reform undertaken at the Council of Trent in the diocese of Płock. He built the bishop's palace in Wyszków (1589); he renewed the collegiate church in Pułtusk. He was also known as a bibliophile - imported from abroad books he had set in light yellow parchment and brown skin. Accumulated books were donated by the Kraków Academy (about 1000 volumes) and the library of the Płock chapter (130 works). ==References== Category:Bishops of Płock Category:Year of birth unknown Category:16th-century births Category:1590s deaths Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Piotr Dunin Wolski"},{"id":"56599210","text":"Océane Avocat Gros (born 23 April 1997) is a French ski jumper..

His father, Rev. John Knox D.D., was the head pastor of the Collegiate Dutch Church for forty years, and his mother was the eldest daughter of John M. Mason. Knox attended Columbia College, graduating in 1841, before studying theology at the Seminary of the Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1845, he was licensed to preach by the classis of New York, and was ordained in September 1846 by the presbytery of Newton, New Jersey. ==Career== Following his ordainment, Knox led an illustrious career as a pastor throughout the northeast. For the first five years, Knox preached at the Presbyterian Church in German Valley, New Jersey, where he was described as \\"one of the most popular and efficiency pastors that the church ever had.\\" He then went to the Reformed Dutch Church in Easton, Pennsylvania, for a period of two years, where he began a relationship with nearby Lafayette College, eventually joining its board of trustees. Following this, he was the pastor for sixteen years at the First Presbyterian Church in Germantown, Pennsylvania, before being transferred to Bristol, Pennsylvania where he spent the next ten years. Knox was called out of the ministry while at Bristol to accept the role of president of Lafayette College as its eighth president in 1883. The board of trustees at Lafayette had chosen Knox unanimously upon the resignation of his predecessor, William Cassady Cattell. Cattell, who has just resigned after a long twenty-year tenure, was a popular figure in the city as he helped steady the very financially troubled college during his term. Knox continued in his predecessor's success, by making sure the college's endowment was filled and interest in the school was still high. In an attempt to raise the college's endowment, Knox was instrumental in securing a donation from Daniel B. Fayerweather, who ran the world's largest leather manufacturing business in the world, known as Fayerweather & Ladew. Fayerweather left many small fortunes to colleges around the country, and to Lafayette he left the amount of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), and later had a dormitory on campus named after him. Knox resigned the presidency in June, 1890, and spent the next two years in Europe before returning to the United States, choosing to live in Baltimore. He was elected as vice-president of the Presbyterian Historical Society in 1890, a position in which he served until his death. ==Personal life== Knox was married twice. His first wife was Louise Wakeman, whom he married on September 17, 1846. Together they had two children, and in 1871 Louise died. On December 16, 1869, Knox married Helen R. Thompson, and together they had one son. In 1861, Knox received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from his alma mater, Columbia College. Later, he received the honorary degree of Legum Doctor from the same college in 1885. He was also a member of the Victoria Institute in London. After his presidency at Lafayette, the college recognized his service by dedicating to him a building, named Knox Hall. Knox died of pneumonia on January 21 in his home in Baltimore. ==References== Category:1824 births Category:1903 deaths Category:20th-century Presbyterian ministers Category:American Presbyterians Category:Presidents of Lafayette College Category:Educators from New York City Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:Lafayette College trustees ","title":"James Hall Mason Knox"},{"id":"56599278","text":"The FS Class E.431 was a class of three-phase AC electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS). ==History== The E.431 was a class of 37 locomotives, built between 1922 and 1925 by Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB), divided into three batches, the last in collaboration with Ansaldo. The locomotives were designed and constructed to be suitable for hauling heavy trains at 100 km / h which, at the time, was considered the limit for the three-phase system. The extension of the electrified network with the three- phase system had come to involve the regions of Piedmont, Liguria and part of Lombardy. This included the cities of Turin, Genoa and indirectly Milan. With associated lines, international transits were possible. These lines were used by fast and important international trains with heavy loads (up to 20 carriages) hence the need for machines suitable for this type of service. In practice, the E.431 did not live up to expectations. In particular, the cascade connection of the motors at the lower speeds gave insufficient tractive effort, affecting performance during starting and uphill travel. They were not, therefore, used on the Frejus and Brenner lines, while on the remaining climbs, in particular on those that lead from the Ligurian coast to the hinterland, they were always used in multiple. These problems were solved, even if not definitively, with Class E.432 which had different control systems. On the flat, the E.431s could show off their speed, hauling the trains for which they were designed, but even here they sometimes worked in multiple. Some attempts to improve performance when running in cascade mode were made during the early years of service but they were not very successful. With the conversion of the three-phase lines to direct current operation, the E.431s were progressively withdrawn but some locomotives remained in service on local trains until the end of the three-phase system occurred in 1976. ==Technical features== ===Mechanical part=== The E.431 was the first three- phase locomotive for passenger trains to have four-axle drive, to increase the adhesive weight. Each end drive axle was linked to the adjacent carrier axle by a Zara bogie. This arrangement, also adopted in many other locomotives, allowed better curve registration given the generally tortuous route of the lines in Italy. The two motors drove through a triangular connecting rod and horizontal coupling rods transmitted the motion from the driving axle to the coupled axles. The wheels were of the type used on steam locomotives, with balance weights and cranks at 90 degrees. On a sturdy frame there was a central cabin in which the two traction motors, which were dismountable from below, were placed. At the ends there were two short bonnets which contained the auxiliary equipment, including fans, rheostat, compressors and brake reservoirs, as well as a reversing switch for the selection of the direction of travel. ===Electrical part=== The electrical part consisted of two traction motors whose stators were switchable between six or eight poles. With the cascade connection, in which the current induced in the rotor of one motor fed the stator of the other motor, both motors ran at half speed. The available speeds were: * Cascade connection, 37.5 and 50 km / h * Parallel connection, 75 and 100 km / h The current limitation during starting and switching was obtained through a liquid rheostat containing a 2% solution of sodium carbonate in water as electrolyte. The electrolyte was cooled by a heat exchanger which transferred heat to another liquid circuit containing fresh water. Current was picked up from the overhead line through two trolley poles with \\"spades\\" - a pattern common in three-phase locomotives of the time. ===Multiple unit control=== After the encouraging results obtained with the small-wheeled locomotives FS Class E.551 and FS Class E.554, it was decided to extend the experiment with \\"Ligurian\\" multiple unit control to some large- wheeled locomotives. The locomotives chosen for the experiment included two Class E.333 and E.431.023 and 026. The chosen machines, modified in the early months of 1960, behaved well in multiple control, demonstrating the validity of the solution adopted. The success of the \\"Ligurian\\" multiple control led to the idea of adopting it as standard equipment on all three-phase locomotives, excluding only the oldest types. For Class E.431 the transformation of a further eight units was arranged, but it was only performed on two of them. These were E.431.018 and E.431.036. On this pair of locomotives, a high voltage coupling was added which allowed the second unit to operate with lowered trolleys, in order to avoid a speed limit imposed on double-traction locomotives on the Turin - Fossano - Ceva line. ==Preservation== E.431.027 is exhibited at the Savigliano site of the Piedmont Railway Museum (MFP) and E.431.037 is in the Technical Museum of Speyer, in the Rhineland-Palatinate. ==References== ==Further reading== * Mario Loria, Storia della trazione elettrica ferroviaria in Italia, Firenze, Giunti, 1971 * Erminio Mascherpa, Le nostre locomotive.

Little is known about his youth. We know that before taking over the bishop's throne in Poznań he was the office of the Archdiocese of Poznań. In July 1324, the Poznań chapter elected him another bishop. This election was approved by Janisław - Archbishop of Gniezno, who made episcopal ordination in the autumn of the same year in Sochaczew. Belonging to the Doliwów family, Jan belonged to the trusted king Władysław Łokietek. In the last months of 1324, Bishop Jan sent food to reinforce Pyzdry, and in June 1325 he belonged to the signatories of a covenant between the king and the West Pomeranian princes against Brandenburg in Nakło. In the same year, Pope John XXII appointed him the conservator of the Owińska monastery, ordering him also to extort Prince Bolesław III the Spendable to separate the Duchy of Legnica's brother. In February 1326 Jan took part in the synod of the Gniezno metropolis, and in 1329 during Łokietek's stay at the Poznań castle, he belonged to his immediate surroundings. In March 1331, the bishop, together with the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Cracow bishop, were appointed by the Pope to be the executors of the atonement to be given to the Chełmno bishopric for the losses suffered, and in the event of a refusal they had the right to lay a curse on the order. In July of the same year, the Teutonic invasion ravaged the bishop's estate - destroying Słupca and many villages belonging to the bishop, as well as many other cities in Greater Poland, such as Pyzdry, Środa Wielkopolska and Kostrzyn, where churches were burnt. In the Warsaw trial, the court found that the damage, without the temptation of the temples, amounted to 8,200 silver fines. After the death of Łokietek, the bishop concelebrated the coronation mass of Casimir the Great. During his term of office, the parish church in Krerów was founded, the estate of the bishops lying in both Greater Poland and Mazovia was merged, several villages were located, and a privilege for millers in the estate of the diocese was issued. The modern bishop calendar of Włocławek described him as a good and generous man, while Jan Długosz showed him in a negative way, accusing him of extravagance and lack of care for those in need. ==References== Category:Bishops of Poznań Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th- century births Category:1335 deaths Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Jan Doliwa"},{"id":"56599295","text":"Ksenia Kablukova (born 16 June 1998) is a Russian ski jumper..

It is an encyclopedic compendium or summa of Mahayana Buddhist doctrine. The Dà zhìdù lùn was translated into Chinese by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) and his student Sengrui. The colophon to this work claims it is written by the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (c. 2nd century), but various scholars such as Étienne Lamotte have questioned this attribution.Ramanan, Krishniah Venkata, Dr. (1966). Nāgārjuna's Philosophy as presented in Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra . Charles E. Tuttle Company of Rutland, Vermont and Tokyo, 1966. page 13. According to Hans-Rudolf Kantor, this work was \\"fundamental for the development of the Chinese Sanlun, Tiantai, Huayan, and Chan schools.\\"Hans-Rudolf Kantor, Philosophical Aspects of Sixth-Century Chinese Buddhist Debates on “Mind and Consciousness, pp. 337–395 in: Chen-kuo Lin / Michael Radich (eds.) A Distant Mirror Articulating Indic Ideas in Sixth and Seventh Century Chinese Buddhism, Hamburg Buddhist Studies, Hamburg University Press 2014. ==Textual history== The DZDL survives only in the Chinese translation of 100 scrolls made by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva from 402 to 405 CE.Ramanan, Krishniah Venkata, Dr. (1966). Nāgārjuna's Philosophy as presented in Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra . Charles E. Tuttle Company of Rutland, Vermont and Tokyo, 1966. page 14. According to the primary sources, the Indic text consisted of 100,000 gāthās (lines), or 3,200,000 Sanskrit syllables, which was condensed by Kumārajīva by two-thirds to obtain the 100 scrolls of the Chinese translation. Kumārajīva translated the first 34 scrolls in full, and abridged the rest of the material.Lee, Youngjin, Traditional Commentaries on the Larger Prajñāpāramitā It was translated by Kumārajīva, working together with his student Sengrui, who “stopped writing, argued for the right translation,” and “checked his translation against the original for the entire day” as well as with the Qin emperor Yao Xing. The DZDL became a central text for the East Asian Sanlun ( J. Sanron) or Madhyamaka school and also influenced all the major schools of Chinese Buddhism. The DZDL acted as a kind of Mahāyāna encyclopedia for East Asian Buddhist thought, similar to the status of the Abhisamayalamkara in Tibetan Buddhism. Traditionally, it is held that the text is by the Indian Madhyamaka philosopher Nagarjuna. Against the traditional attribution of the work to Nagarjuna, Étienne Lamotte as well as Paul Demiéville, concluded that the author must have been a Buddhist monk of the Sarvāstivāda or Mulasarvāstivāda school from Northwest India, learned in Abhidharma, who later converted to Mahāyāna and Madhyamaka and then composed \\"a voluminous exegetical treatise which is like a Mahāyāna reply to the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma\\". This is because the Abhidharma and Vinaya material found in this text coincides with that of the north Indian Sarvāstivāda tradition.Ray, Reginald A.Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations, page 406 This is a widely accepted view among modern scholars. Lamotte also remarked on the internal evidence of the text which shows that its author was likely from a region that was within the Kushan Empire.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, page 876-877. Hikata Ryusho however argues that there is an ancient nucleus of material in this text that could be attributed by Nagarjuna (as well as a large amount of later accretions).Zürcher, Erik, The Buddhist Conquest of China: The spread and adaptation of Buddhism in Early Medieval China, Brill Archive, 1959, p. 410. R. Hikata argued that while a part of the text was by Nagarjuna, it also included many “additions or insertions by Kumārajīva.”R. Hikata, Suvikrāntavikrāmi-pariprcchā Prajñāpāramitā-Sūtra (Fukuoka: Kyushu University Press, 1958), lii-lxxv. The Chinese scholar Yin Shun meanwhile, argues for the traditional attribution to Nagarjuna. In a recent study, Po-kan Chou has argued that the DZDL is a product of the editorship of Sengrui (352?-436?), Kumārajīva's student, co- translator and amanuensis. ==Content== The text is primarily Mahayana and explains basic Mahayana doctrines such as Prajñāpāramitā, and the other bodhisattva paramitas, but also includes much Sarvastivada Abhidharma, Jataka and early Buddhist content. As noted by Lamotte, \\"the Treatise cites, at length or in extracts, about a hundred sūtras of the Lesser Vehicle; the majority are borrowed from the Āgama collections\\".Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron. The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - (Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra) Vol. II Chapters XVI-XXX, page 494-495 It also cites various Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra and the Vimalakirti Sutra, the Dasabhumika Sutra, Gandavyuha Sutra, as well as various Jataka stories and Avadana literature.Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.

The DZDL contains 90 chapters (p'in) in 100 rolls (kiuan). It comprises two series of chapters, according to Lamotte the first series of 52 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 57c-314b) \\"appears to be an integral version of the Indian original\\" while the second series of 89 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 314b-756c) seems to be an abridgement.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Volume V Chapters XLIX – LII and Chapter XX (2nd series), p. 1772. The content of the first series, which has been translated by Etienne Lamotte (Fr.) and Karma Migme Chodron (Eng.) is as follows: * Chapters 1 to 15 comment on the prologue or nidana of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā sutra (Taisho, T VIII, no. 223).Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. I Chapters I – XV, 2001. * Chapters 16 to 30 provide an extensive commentary on a short paragraph of the sutra which focuses on the six transcendent virtues or pāramitās.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. II Chapters XVI-XXX, 2001. * Chapters 31 to 42, according to Lamotte: \\"this part, the most technical and without a doubt the most interesting part of the Traité, has as its subject the practices forming the Path of Nirvāṇa and the attributes of the Buddhas.\\"Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, p. 909. This includes the thirty-seven bodhipākṣikadharmas, the \\"eight complementary classes of dharmas of the Path\\" (such as the three samadhis and four dhyanas) and \\"Six other classes of dharmas of the Path\\" (such as the Nine aṣubhasaṃjñās and the Eight anusmṛtis). For each of these topics, the views of Sarvastivada Abhidharma are explained alongside the views Prajñāpāramitā which often critique the Abhidharma understanding.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, pp. 910-911. The Agamas are also cited in these explanations. *Chapters 42 to 48 discuss the Bodhisattva vehicle, bodhicitta, merit, the abhijñas, emptiness (taught in the schema of the \\"eighteen emptinesses\\" 十八空), Madhyamaka, and the practice (śikṣā) of Prajñāpāramitā.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Vol. IV Chapters XLII (continuation) – XLVIII, 2001. *Chapters 49 to 52 discuss further topics such as the vows of a bodhisattva (in two sets of 24 vows and 38 vows) as well as causality, Dharmata, the divine eye (divyacakṣu), and the four great elements.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Volume V Chapters XLIX – LII and Chapter XX (2nd series). == Translations == One third of this work was translated by Etienne Lamotte as Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse.Werner, Karel (2003).

He was a son of Mikołaj from Będlewo, nephew of the bishop of Poznań, Jan of the Łodzia coat of arms. He studied law in Italy, finishing his doctorate with decrees, which he obtained before 1365. After returning to Poland (between July 9, 1365, and January 27, 1368) he became a cantor in Poznań. He also related to the court of Bodzanta, Bodzanty, who appointed him the court judge, in 1359 a canon of Cracow, and in 1364 as the vicar of Bishop. In 1366, the Pope appointed him a canon of Gniezno, and in 1368 he received the provost of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Kraków. He was also a papal sub-collector, and from 1365 or 1366 to 1372 he was the office of the Chancellor of Greater Poland. Thanks to this last office, he established close relations with the court of King Ludwik Węgierski, which allowed him to remove political opponents, the most powerful of which was the Crown Deputy Chancellor Jan of Czarnków. Probably Nicholas contributed to accusing him of profaning the tomb of Casimir the Great and stealing the coronation insignia, which meant that Jan was deprived of office. After the death of Jan of Lutogniew, the Poznań bishop's office slowed down. On May 7, 1375, he received the sacrament and sat on the throne of the Poznań bishop.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 408 As a bishop he began reconstruction in the Gothic style of the Poznań Cathedral and surrounded Słupca with walls. In politics, he was asking for favors and further assignments for the bishopric of the Mazovian Piasts, but otherwise he did not show any particular political line. In the consciousness of successive generations, his negative picture was fixed by Janek of Czarnków, who described him as a dishonest and corrupt man.

Wielkopolski słownik biograficzny, (Warszawa-Poznań 1983), PWN He was one of the most powerful men in Poland of his generation. ==Early life== He was the son of Łukasz I and Katarzyna Szamotulska. As a child, he was destined for the clergy. In spite of poor health, he studied at the Kraków Academy until 1453, and then in Italy and Germany, to study again in Bologna in 1463. The father tried for him numerous church prebends: in 1449 he became a Poznań canon, in 1453 Gniezno and Łęczyca, in 1467 Płock, Sandomierz and Kraków. In 1454 he received the position of Poznań provost, and in 1468 Gniezno. Such accumulation of dignity in the hands of one person required a special permission from the Roman Curia. In 1473, thanks to the support of his father, he was appointed royal chancellor, even though he had no previous experience relating to that office. In 1478 he was in Rome as a royal deputy. During this stay, he received from the Pope the office of a papal payments collector for the Archdiocese of Gniezno, which he probably held until 1486. During this period, he established numerous relations with the Western European, and especially Nuremberg, banking houses, and Polish and Italian burgers in Polish cities. In the years 1473 - 1474 he was the administrator of the Archdiocese of Gniezno and, at the request of the king, he called a provincial synod to Łęczyca, who established the payment obligations of the clergy to the state. After the death of Andrzej Bniński in 1479, he took the Poznań bishopric promised to him, while at the same time resigning from the office of the Crown Chancellor. His period of office on the bishop's throne in Poznan is poorly documented, but it is known that he was patron of the artists. He also brought records from Vischer's factory to his and his father's graves. He also ordered a service at the Albrecht Dürer plant. He witnessed the release of the Piotrków Privilege in 1496.Jan Wincenty Bandtkie, Ius Polonicum : codicibus veteribus manuscriptum et editionibus quibusque collatis, Warszawa 1831, s. 358.

It served as the first county town of Kincardineshire. The settlement gradually developed around Kincardine Castle. The origin of the castle is not known, although it has been popularly identified as the place of death of Kenneth II. The Carnegies were made stewards of the castle during the reign of William the Lion. In 1296, it was the location where John Balliol confessed to rebellion against Edward I of England. It was kept in good repair over the following centuries, and was visited by Mary Queen of Scots. By 1532, the castle was a secondary residence of William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal, and appears to have been at the centre of small town, occupying about two hundred yards between gates on the main road. The Earl petitioned for Kincardine to be declared as a free burgh and county town for the Mearns. The petition claimed that the sheriff courts for the Mearns were already being held in the town, and that it was reputed to have previously been made a free burgh, but that the charter had been lost. He was successful, and on 27 January 1531/2, Kincardine became the county town of the newly created county of Kincardineshire. By 1600, the burgh was in decline, and the sheriff and his deputes complained to the king that the accommodation for them was unsuitable, no tolbooth having been constructed; they were successful in having the county town moved to Stonehaven. Without county town status, Kincardine quickly dwindled, and the castle fell into ruin. By the 1830s, it was described as a \\"mere hamlet\\" and it was noted that \\"only the foundations of the [castle] walls can be traced\\", and by 1870 there were no surviving houses. The castle foundations survive today, forming a Scheduled Monument. The cemetery of the former St Catherine of Siena Chapel also survives, with part of its wall and an 18th-century gravestone. ==References== Category:Former county towns in Scotland Category:Geography of Aberdeenshire Category:Ghost towns in Scotland Category:Kincardineshire ","title":"Kincardine, Aberdeenshire"},{"id":"56599813","text":"Morato or Morató is a surname.

He then went to the University of Padua, where he obtained the same field in 1405. PhD title. Already in 1392 he became a provost of Włocławek and held this office until 1414. Also in 1392 he began his diplomatic career by serving the great master of the Teutonic Knights Konrad von Wallenrode. In 1397 he became the chancellor of Queen Jadwiga, and a year later (in 1398) the Włocławek Chapter wanted to be elected a bishop, but Andrzej himself abandoned the throne supported by King Mikolaj Kurowski. Before 1402 he became a canon of Płock, and in 1405 he was the chaplain of the German King Ruprecht Wittelsbach. In 1409 he became a papal collector in Poland and also took part, together with his relatives, the Poznań bishop Piotr Wysz, in the Council in Pisa and pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1411, together with Jakub Śledz, he sent John XXIII to the anti pope-John Paul II, complaining to him about the Teutonic Knights breaking the First Peace of Toruń. His spiritual career was also developing. Already in 1413 he was the dean of Kracow Cathedral, the canon of Gniezno and Poznań. A year later (in 1414) he became a papal protector and bishop of Poznań.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 408 In the meantime, from 1412 to 1414 on behalf of Władysław Jagiełło he appeared as a prosecutor in the trial between Poland and the Teutonic Order and then went as a member of the official Polish delegation to the Council of Constance, where he mainly participated in the work of the commission for faith and in the trials between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. He also became known there as a supporter of church reform and conciliarist. In 1419 he was in the procession of the king during his congress with the emperor in Nowy Sącz, and in 1420 he was in the legation to the Diet of the Reich, which took place in Wrocław, during which the emperor considered Polish-Teutonic disputes. In the same year he took part in a synod called by Mikołaj Trąb to Wieluń. In 1422, he again took part in the trial with the Teutonic Knights, appearing as a witness this time, and in 1423 he took part in the Council in Pavia. In 1424, together with Paweł Włodkowic, he sent to Rome, where they repudiated the charges against the Pope. During this stay, he also resigned from the episcopal throne, which, however, was not accepted.

Dougall assumed office during the 55th legislative session, replacing David Litvack.https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=113608 Dougall has received bipartisan praise for his accomplishments as state auditor. ==Early life and education== Dougall was born in Hollywood and raised in Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering, and he earned his Master of Science in electrical engineering from BYU the following year. He earned his MBA from BYU in 2000. Dougall has worked at various technology companies in Silicon Valley. ==Political career== Dougall was first elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 2002, winning against a crowded field of Republican Party primary opponents. During his 10-year tenure in the House, he sponsored various bills related to transportation, government transparency, and tax reform, including tax cuts in 2006 under governor Jon Huntsman. He also sponsored the controversial HB477, which would have amended the Government Records Access and Management Act to increase restrictions on public access to government documents. The bill was signed into law in March 2011 by governor Gary Herbert, but it was repealed two weeks later after public backlash and harsh criticism from The Salt Lake Tribune. Despite this, Dougall has generally been regarded as an advocate for transparency in the Utah state government. Dougall was elected Utah State Auditor in 2012, defeating fellow Republican incumbent Auston Johnson. As state auditor, Dougall has led audits that have revealed mismanagement and unethical or illegal behavior at various levels of government in Utah, and some of his investigations have targeted members of his own party. For these actions, he has earned bipartisan praise as state auditor. Dougall briefly considered challenging Mitt Romney in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 2018, but ultimately decided against it.

Jan Długosz once considers him a Pole, sometimes as a German, while contemporary sources do not give any guidelines to establish this. Initially, he was to be the provost of the cathedral chapter of Włocławek. During the reunion in Jędrzejów, with the participation of princes and nobles, he appeared as the chancellor of the prince Kazimierz the Just. This congress dates back to the end of 1167 or the beginning of 1168. In Jędrzejów he performed as a chancellor in Wiślica, after Kazimierz became a chancellor of the district in 1173, and from 1177 he was the chancellor of the same prince. It is not known how long he operated on this office, in 1189 sources mention his successor in the person of Chancellor Mrokoty. Prior to this event, Stefan took over the new office. As a bishop of Kujawy, he is certified for the first time in the document of Kazimierz the Righteous from 1187.Jan Fijałek, Ustalenie chronologii biskupów włocławskich, Kraków 1894, p.12.

He probably became a bishop in support of the same prince after the death of Bishop Onold (died after 1180). In 1187 he took part in the settlement of the dispute over the chapel in Płock, in 1191 he participated in the dedication of the collegiate church in Sandomierz. He supported the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno with tithing, he gave the nuns a mill in Kwieciszewo in exchange for the village of Otłoczyn. The Oliwa Cistercians gave the right to free burial. Before 1198, he consecrated the church of Saint. Of the Trinity in Lubiszewo and tithed from two villages. In 1198 he consecrated the church in Świecie and had some participation in donations for the benefit of the Knights of St. John in Starogaradzie Gdanski. Jan Długosz and the cathedral tradition give the erroneous date of the bishop's death on 1197 and the Włocławek cathedral as the place of burial. He died for sure after November 11, 1198 (the date of the consecration in Świecie), and before 1206/7, when his successor Ogierz was documented. ==References== Category:Bishops of Poznań Category:Year of birth unknown Category:12th-century births Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:12th-century Polish people ","title":"Stefan, Bishop of Kujawy"},{"id":"56600083","text":"Kim Ji-soo (Hangul: 김지수; born 22 July 1994) is a South Korean skeleton racer.

Bouton was educated for a teacher, and took the highest position awarded to any lady as teacher in high school at Toledo, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois, but resigned them to engage on journalistic work on the Toledo Blade, which position she held for many years. She also wrote works on health and beauty for women which were published, and one on etiquette, beside pamphlets, all of which won for her an enviable reputation as a writer of books as well as for the newspaper press. She served as editor of the \\"Household,\\" the \\"Saturday Salad\\", and the \\"Home Talk\\" columns of the Toledo, Ohio Daily Blade. She was the author of Social Etiquette, Health and Beauty, and other works more or less directly relating to women. ==Early years and education== Emily St. John Bouton was born in New Canaan, Connecticut, February 13, 1837 (or February 15, 1837). Her parents were Daniel Webb and Almina (St. John) Bouton. On her father's side, she traced her ancestry to one of the partisans of William the Conqueror, who was knighted for saving the king when in danger. The family bore a prominent part in the American Revolution among the Connecticut patriots. Her father moved to the West when she was yet a child. She was educated at Binghamton, New York, and graduated at sixteen in the Sandusky High School as valedictorian in 1857, but had previously taught a primary school in Sandusky, Ohio, when only fourteen years of age. ==Career== After graduating, she became assistant high- school teacher in Milan, Ohio, then in Tiffin, Ohio, and then, for several years, she filled the same position in the Toledo High School. She occupied the chair of English literature in the Chicago central high school for two years, but relinquished her work on account of failing health, going to California for rest and recuperation. In 1877, she returned to Toledo and became a member of the editorial staff of the Toledo Blade. To many American households, she was endeared as the \\"household editor\\" of the paper. She was also a literary critic, and an \\"all round\\" newspaper worker. She did much regular editorial writing in political campaigns in the columns of the paper with which she was connected. Her leaders on political topics were marked by direct and close reasoning, her diction was clear, and her logic was convincing. In her later years, she was not called on so frequently to do that kind of writing, leaving her time free for the, to her, more congenial fields of purely literary work and the management of her own department of the paper. Her special field was in work for women. She was a believer in equal rights for women, and her labors were directed to the advancement of woman's sphere through the personal advancement of every women. Her literary style was so clear and pleasing that it seemed to convey an idea of her personality to her readers. She wrote several successful books on topics pertaining to the home circle. Besides her work upon the Toledo Blade, she wrote stories, letters and essays for other papers and magazines. Bouton's family circle consisted of her mother, her widowed sister and two nephews. Bouton worked in societies advocating religious freedom. She was one of the founders and supporters of the Industrial Home for Working Girls, Toledo. She lectured upon literary subjects and their influence upon great movements for humanity’s good. Bouton was a member of the Executive Board of Toledo Suffrage Society. She was the author of Health and Beauty, Social Etiquette, Life's Gateways, and The Life Joyful. She was a member of the Toledo Woman's Association, Ohio Newspaper Association, honorary member of the Educational Club of Toledom the Wauseon Woman's Club, Sorosis, and Emerson Class and Writer's Club of Toledo.

He developed or supervised the development of numerous high-yield sugarcane cultivars, which established India as the world's second largest sugar producer and sustained the sugar industries of numerous other nations, including South Africa, Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the United States. ==Early life and career== Venkataraman was born in Salem, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu) to an orthodox Tamil Brahmin family; though initially religious, he renounced religion by the age of 16. After graduating from a secondary school in Tiruchirapalli, where he was a brilliant scholar, he enrolled at Presidency College, Madras, where he decided to study botany over zoology, as he strongly disliked dissecting insects and other animals. In 1905, he graduated with a first-class honours B.A. in botany and briefly studied for an M.A. at Madras University before his appointment to the Agricultural College, Saidapet (now a constituent college of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) as an assistant to Charles Alfred Barber, then a botanist in the Madras Presidency government service. In 1908, the college was moved to Coimbatore, where Venkataraman would spend the rest of his career. He soon demonstrated an aptitude for research, attempting to grow hybridised varieties of eggplant in his spare time. ==Research and development of the Coimbatore sugarcane cultivars== In the early 1900s, the extremely poor yields of Indian sugarcane varieties necessitated the import of sugar from the Netherlands East Indies, which was a heavy burden on the government exchequer. The British government eventually decided to establish a Sugarcane Breeding Institute to study sugarcane breeding and to develop an indigenous sugarcane industry. Coimbatore was selected due to its ideal climate, and Barber was appointed Government Sugarcane Expert in October 1912, with Venkataraman as his assistant. According to Venkataraman's biographer and sole graduate student, J. Thuljaram Rao, the two scientists' observation of wild sugarcane (Saccharum spontaneum) growing near the Agricultural College campus inspired them to use it in their trials. Though the first hybrid sugarcane crosses between the wild sugarcane and a cultivated sugarcane species, Saccharum officinarum, did not survive, by 1914, Venkataraman had succeeded in producing viable hybrid seedlings. As sugarcane breeding was a new field of research, Venkataraman relied on meticulous planning and observation along with the pioneering of new techniques, including artificial induction of flowering through photoperiodic treatments, nobilization and outcrossing plants to improve their genetic diversity. He also pioneered the detailed study of sugarcane root systems, which became vital in understanding the plants' yield potentials. In 1918, the first hybrid sugarcane variety produced by the Institute, Co. (\\"Coimbatore\\") 205, was recorded as generating yields 50% greater than those of indigenous varieties, which were entirely replaced by Co. 205 within 6–8 years. Along with another variant, Co. 285, the new varieties were soon commercially marketed in the Punjab, where they also proved capable of being cultivated under stressed conditions, including in waterlogged fields. Following those successes, Venkataraman developed a tri- species hybrid by crossing S. spontaneum and S. officinarum with Saccharum barberi, a North Indian variety which Barber had researched. The resulting hybrid, Co. 244, became commercially cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Subsequently, tetra-species hybrids were also produced after a fourth parent, Saccharum robustum, was incorporated into the breeding programme. The hybrid cultivars, with a sugar content nearly 35 times that of their parent stocks, were soon recognised for being fast-maturing, for their ease of propagation and their resistance to waterlogging, drought and the red rot (Glomerella tucumanensis) and sereh diseases. In 1918, Venkataraman was promoted to full gazetted rank; he succeeded Barber as head of the Institute the following year, initially in an acting capacity while the British Indian government attempted to locate a European replacement to serve as director. After this proved unsuccessful, Venkataraman was eventually confirmed in his post and served as the permanent head of the Institute until his retirement. Over the next two decades, Venkataraman and his two research assistants, P. Thomas and N.L. Dutt, developed many more hybrid sugarcane varieties suitable for a wide range of environments and climatic conditions. While initial research had focused on developing hardy varieties that could sustain the colder winters in northern India, in 1926 research commenced into breeding plants for the South Indian and similar tropical climates. Apart from the successful Co. 205 and Co 285 cultivars, Co. 213, 421, 427 and 453 became popular in North India, notably in present-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, while Co. 419, developed by Dutt, achieved tremendous success across South India and supported the region's sugarcane industries for four decades after its commercial introduction. In 1927, the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, visited the Sugarcane Breeding Institute and praised Venkataraman's work, subsequently ordering all those connected with sugarcane cultivation to pay a visit. In 1928, Venkataraman presided over the agricultural section of that year's Indian Science Congress, delivering a lecture on \\"The Indian Sugar Bowl.\\" He visited Java the following year to attend the annual meeting of the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists, presiding over the varietal section. In 1932, he was appointed to the Indian Agricultural Service. By the 1930s, Coimbatore sugarcane cultivars were in high demand and were being successfully grown around the world. In the United States, Co. 281 and Co. 290 supported the sugar industry in Louisiana; Co. 281 also sustained production in South Africa and Cuba as it was readily adaptable and high-yielding even in poor soils and less forgiving climates. Co. 290 achieved popularity in Australia, while the tropical-friendly Co. 419 and Co. 421 became mainstays of sugarcane growers in Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana (now Guyana). In later years, N. Co. 310, first cultivated in South Africa from seed exported from the Sugarcane Breeding Institute, became the most popular commercially-grown sugarcane cultivar in the world. At one point in the 1960s, Coimbatore- developed varieties were supporting the sugarcane industries of 22 countries. In the 21st century, Coimbatore cultivars continue to be cultivated and used as breeding stocks in Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan. ==Research into intergeneric sugarcane hybrids== In 1930, Venkataraman successfully developed intergeneric hybrids of sugarcane and sorghum with the objective of producing short-duration sugarcane hybrids. Though the project was ultimately a commercial failure due to issues with sterility, his work subsequently helped inspire Janaki Ammal to develop a sugarcane-maize hybrid. In 1936, he attempted to develop a further intergeneric hybrid of sugarcane and the indigenous Bambusa arundinacea bamboo, intended to combine the height of the latter with the sugar percentage of the former. Under controlled conditions, sterile male sugarcane cultivars were used as pistil parents, which were dusted with bamboo pollen. Though some seedlings were produced to much acclaim amongst plant geneticists, with Venkataraman presenting his findings at the 1939 International Genetics Congress in Edinburgh, studies later suggested the seedlings were the result of apomixis, which was less understood at the time. In his researches, however, Venkataraman anticipated the modern development of intergeneric hybrids on a far wider scale. ==Later career and life== Venkataraman was elected President of the 1937 Indian Science Congress, delivering his address on \\"The Indian Village\\" and discussing the improvement of villages in the country as a priority: \\"Our duty then is clear, namely, to improve the village, the nucleus of our country life and inject its chief agent, the villager, with a chosen culture of the virus of [the] modern age through education and industrialisation.\\" He again presided over the agricultural section of the Indian Science Congress in 1938, delivering a lecture on sugarcane hybridisation, and attended the 1939 International Genetics Congress at Edinburgh, where he was recognised as a \\"wizard\\" of sugarcane. Though he was scheduled to retire as head of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in 1939, Venkataraman obtained a three-year extension and finally retired in 1942, when he was succeeded by his assistant Dutt. The year of his retirement, a Current Science article observed \\"the breeding work carried out by Venkataraman – aided by ample tariff protection – has been responsible for converting India from an importer of white sugar (1 million tons) to a position where the future of the Indian industry is in urgent need of securing export markets.\\" By the end of his tenure at Coimbatore, it was estimated Venkataraman's efforts had saved India roughly 15 crore (150 million) rupees. Following his retirement, Venkataraman agreed to conduct a survey of sugarcane research in India, but gave it up on health grounds. He subsequently retired to Madras, where he spent his time reading philosophical works and frequently writing letters to The Hindu on various subjects. When the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists decided to hold its 1956 conference in India, he chaired the section on cane breeding; during the conference, a plaque commemorating the development of the Co. 205 cultivar was unveiled at the Sugarcane Breeding Institute. Venkataraman died in Madras on 18 January 1963, aged 78. He was married, and had one son, Ramamurti, who later became an assistant director of the National Physical Laboratory of India. ==Awards and honours== Venkataraman was extensively recognised for his achievements. In 1920, after the commercial success of the Co. 205 cultivar, he was given the title of Rao Sahib by the British government, and was raised to the title of Rao Bahadur in 1928. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1937 New Year Honours list. In the 1942 New Year Honours list, he received a knighthood, becoming the first Indian agricultural scientist to be thus honoured, and was formally invested with his knighthood at the Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) in New Delhi on 21 February 1942 by the then Viceroy, the Marquess of Linlithgow. In 1956, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government. Among his other distinctions, Venkataraman was conferred an honorary D.Sc. by Andhra University. In 1941, he was elected the first President of the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding, serving a single one-year term. He was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc) in 1934, serving as its Vice-President in 1934–35, and was elected as a Foundation Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences of India (FNI, now the Indian National Science Academy) in 1935. He was also a member of the International Genetics Congress Association, the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding and the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists, and was an Honorary Fellow of the South African Sugar Technologists Association. ==References== ==Notes== Category:Indian geneticists Category:Indian botanical writers Category:Indian agronomists Category:20th-century Indian botanists Category:Indian agriculturalists Category:Plant breeding Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in science & engineering Category:Indian knights Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire Category:Rai Bahadurs Category:Rai Sahibs Category:Indian recipients of British titles Category:Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category:Fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences Category:Indian Tamil people Category:Presidency College, Chennai alumni Category:Scientists from Tamil Nadu Category:People from Salem, Tamil Nadu Category:People from Salem district Category:1884 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Coimbatore ","title":"Tiruvadi Sambasiva Venkataraman"},{"id":"56600219","text":"The 2018 Trofeo Faip–Perrel was a professional tennis tournament played on hard courts.

Precisely, given a group S-scheme G, a left action of G on an S-scheme X is an S-morphism :\\\\sigma: G \\\\times_S X \\\\to X such that * (associativity) \\\\sigma \\\\circ (1_G \\\\times \\\\sigma) = \\\\sigma \\\\circ (m \\\\times 1_X), where m: G \\\\times_S G \\\\to G is the group law, * (unitality) \\\\sigma \\\\circ (e \\\\times 1_X) = 1_X, where e: S \\\\to G is the identity section of G. A right action of G on X is defined analogously. A scheme equipped with a left or right action of a group scheme G is called a G-scheme. An equivariant morphism between G-schemes is a morphism of schemes that intertwines the respective G-actions. More generally, one can also consider (at least some special case of) an action of a group functor: viewing G as a functor, an action is given as a natural transformation satisfying the conditions analogous to the above.In details, given a group-scheme action \\\\sigma, for each morphism T \\\\to S, \\\\sigma determines a group action G(T) \\\\times X(T) \\\\to X(T); i.e., the group G(T) acts on the set of T-points X(T). Conversely, if for each T \\\\to S, there is a group action \\\\sigma_T: G(T) \\\\times X(T) \\\\to X(T) and if those actions are compatible; i.e., they form a natural transformation, then, by the Yoneda lemma, they determine a group-scheme action \\\\sigma: G \\\\times_S X \\\\to X. Alternatively, some authors study group action in the language of a groupoid; a group-scheme action is then an example of a groupoid scheme. == Constructs == The usual constructs for a group action such as orbits generalize to a group-scheme action. Let \\\\sigma be a given group-scheme action as above. *Given a T-valued point x: T \\\\to X, the orbit map \\\\sigma_x: G \\\\times_S T \\\\to X \\\\times_S T is given as (\\\\sigma \\\\circ (1_G \\\\times x), p_2). *The orbit of x is the image of the orbit map \\\\sigma_x. *The stabilizer of x is the fiber over \\\\sigma_x of the map (x, 1_T): T \\\\to X \\\\times_S T. == Problem of constructing a quotient == Unlike a set-theoretic group action, there is no straightforward way to construct a quotient for a group-scheme action. One exception is the case when the action is free, the case of a principal fiber bundle. There are several approaches to overcome this difficulty: *Level structure - Perhaps the oldest, the approach replaces an object to classify by an object together with a level structure *Geometric invariant theory - throw away bad orbits and then take a quotient. The drawback is that there is no canonical way to introduce the notion of \\"bad orbits\\"; the notion depends on a choice of linearization. See also: categorical quotient, GIT quotient. *Borel construction - this is an approach essentially from algebraic topology; this approach requires one to work with an infinite-dimensional space. *Analytic approach, the theory of Teichmüller space *Quotient stack - in a sense, this is the ultimate answer to the problem. Roughly, a \\"quotient prestack\\" is the category of orbits and one stackify (i.e., the introduction of the notion of a torsor) it to get a quotient stack. Depending on applications, another approach would be to shift the focus away from a space then onto stuff on a space; e.g., topos. So the problem shifts from the classification of orbits to that of equivariant objects. == See also == *groupoid scheme *Sumihiro's theorem *equivariant sheaf *Borel fixed-point theorem == References == * Category:Algebraic geometry ","title":"Group-scheme action"},{"id":"56600259","text":"Julian Knowle and Adil Shamasdin were the defending champions but chose not to defend their title.

These controllers came in the form of two paddles connected to the console with cables. The controls on these paddles consisted of a simple dial in order to control the on-screen paddles in the system's built in game library. ==Nintendo Entertainment System== A Nintendo Entertainment System controller The Nintendo Entertainment System controller is an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout. It consists of two round buttons labeled \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", a \\"START\\" button, and a \\"SELECT\\" button. Additionally, the controllers utilized the cross-shaped joypad, designed to replace bulkier joysticks used in earlier gaming consoles’ controllers. The NES controller could also be unplugged as the NES featured two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console. ==Super Nintendo Entertainment System== The North American SNES controller The controller used for the SNES introduces two face buttons X and Y. The four face buttons on the right side are arranged in a diamond shape. Two shoulder buttons are also added and is more ergonomic over the NES controller. The controller was designed by Lance Barr. The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporate the colors of the four action buttons into the system's logo. The North American version's buttons are colored as follows: the X and Y buttons are lavender with concave faces, and the A and B buttons are purple with convex faces. Several later consoles derive elements of their controller design from the SNES, including the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox, and Wii Classic Controller. == Virtual Boy == Virtual Boy controller with battery pack The controller for the Virtual Boy has 4 surface buttons: select, start, B, and A. The face also includes dual directional-pads meant to be used for controlling games in a 3D space. Finally, two small shoulder buttons are placed on the back of the controller's grips and the system's power button is placed in the center of the controller. The Virtual Boy system is powered by 6 AA-batteries held in the battery pack on the controller or by an AC power adapter which also connects to the back of the controller. Additionally, the power cable used in the power adapter is the same power cable and power supply used for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. While the Virtual Boy controller differs greatly in design from Nintendo's other controllers, the directional pads closely resemble the directional pad of the Game Boy but larger and with a steeper slope inwards. Since the Virtual Boy was designed for single player use, the system only has a single controller port on the underside of the console. Due to this single port, the Virtual Boy only ever sold with one controller per unit. ==Nintendo 64== A gray Nintendo 64 controller The Nintendo 64 controller is Nintendo's fifth generation controller and features ten buttons, an analog control stick, and a directional pad. The controller is in the shape of an \\"M\\", and was designed to be held in three different positions. First, it can be held by the two outer grips, allowing use of the D-pad, right-hand face buttons and the \\"L\\" and \\"R\\" shoulder buttons (but not the \\"Z\\" trigger or analog stick). It can be also held by the center and right- hand grip, allowing the use of the single control stick, the right-hand buttons, the \\"R\\" shoulder button, and the \\"Z\\" trigger on the rear (but not the \\"L\\" shoulder button or D-pad). Finally, the controller can be held by the center and left-hand grip, allowing for a combination of the D-pad, L-shoulder, analog stick and Z button (but not the \\"R\\" shoulder button or right-hand buttons). The design is versatile, but it is also controversial because a player is unable to access all the buttons with the player's hands in any one position. Accessing all buttons would require the player to switch hand positions. The controller also includes four \\"C buttons\\" on the top, which were originally intended to control the camera in the N64's three- dimensional environments. However, since the pad only contains three other face buttons, the C-buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions. ==GameCube== An indigo GameCube controller The GameCube controller is Nintendo's sixth generation controller, released along with the GameCube in 2001. The standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design and features a total of six digital buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad and two hybrid analog triggers/digital buttons. The primary analog stick is on the left, with the D-pad below it. The four main face buttons are to the right of the controller. The face buttons include a large green \\"A\\" button in the center, a smaller red \\"B\\" button to its bottom left and the kidney-shaped \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" buttons to the right and top of the \\"A\\" button, respectively. There is also a yellow \\"C\\" stick below the main face buttons. A Start/Pause button is located in the middle of the controller. On the shoulders of the controller there are two analog triggers marked \\"L\\" and \\"R,\\" as well as a \\"Z\\" button above the \\"R\\" trigger. The standard GameCube controller provides haptic feedback by way of a built-in rumble motor rather than using an external Rumble Pak add-on like the Nintendo 64 controller. ==Wii== A Wii Remote and Wii Nunchuk The Wii Remote ditches the traditional gamepad controllers of previous gaming consoles for a one-handed remote control-based design. This was done to make motion sensitivity more intuitive, as a remote design is more optimal for pointing. Another goal with this design was to help the Wii appeal to a broader, non- gamer audience. The body of the Wii Remote measures long, wide, and thick. The controller communicates wirelessly with the console via short-range Bluetooth radio, with which it is possible to operate up to four controllers as far as 10 meters (approx. 30 ft) away from the console. However, to utilize pointer functionality, the Wii Remote must be used within five meters (approx. 16 ft) of the Sensor Bar. The controller's symmetrical design allows it to be used in either hand. The Wii Remote can also be turned horizontally and used like a Famicom/NES controller or steering wheel. The Wii Remote has a large \\"A\\" button in the front, and a curved \\"B\\" button in the back resembling a trigger. Under the \\"A\\" button is a plus and minus, and at the bottom of the remote is a \\"1\\" and \\"2\\" buttons. In the middle of the Wii Remote, between the plus and minus button is a small \\"home\\" button that resembling a home/house. There are also blue LEDs indicating player number that are labeled using small Braille- like raised dots instead of Arabic numerals, with \\"1\\" being \\"•\\", \\"2\\" being \\"••\\", \\"3\\" being \\"•••\\", and \\"4\\" being \\"••••\\". The blue LEDs also show how much battery power remains on the Wii Remote. By pressing any button, besides the power button while the controller is not being used to play games, a certain number of the four blue LEDs will light up, showing the battery life: four of the LEDs flash when it is at, or near, full power. Three lights flash when it is at 75%, two lights when at 50%, and one light flashes when there is 25% or less power remaining. The Wii Remote also features an expansion port at the bottom which allows various functional attachments to be added. The most popular attachment is the Wii Nunchuk. It connects to the Wii Remote via a cord that is about long. It features an analog stick similar to the one found on the GameCube controller and two trigger buttons(oval-shaped \\"C\\" and rectangle-shaped \\"Z\\") and works in tandem with the main controller in many games(including Mario Kart Wii). There is also a Classic Controller. ==Wii U== The Wii U GamePad The Wii U GamePad is the standard controller for Nintendo's eighth generation video game console. It incorporates traits from tablet computers and also has traditional input methods, such as buttons, dual analog sticks, and a D-pad. It also features touchscreen and motion controls. The touchscreen can be used to supplement a game by providing second screen functionality or an asymmetric view of a scenario in a game. The screen can also be used to play a game strictly on the GamePad screen, without the use of a television display. Conversely, non-gaming functions can be assigned to it as well, such as using it as a television remote. There is also a Wii U Pro Controller. ==Nintendo Switch== Detached grey Joy-Con The Joy-Cons are the primary controller(s) of the Nintendo Switch video game console. They consist of two individual units, each containing an analog stick and an array of buttons. They can be used while attached to the main Nintendo Switch console unit, or detached and used wirelessly. When detached, a pair of Joy-Con can be used by a single player, or divided between two as individual controllers. When the Joy-Cons are removed from the console, two shoulder buttons, SL and SR, are revealed on the inner side of the railing. Notably, there is some controversy surrounding the quality of the joysticks used on the Joy-Cons. Specifically, after extended use the joysticks often cease to sense certain directional inputs or sense directional inputs when none are given. This problem is colloquially known as Joy-Con drift. There is also a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. ==References== Controllers ","title":"List of Nintendo controllers"},{"id":"56600350","text":"Geng Wenqiang (; ; born 11 September 1995) is a Chinese skeleton racer.

He is a regular speaker and commentator on anti-Semitism in the modern era and on strategies to combat abuse on online platforms. ==Early life== Rosenberg was born and raised in New York City, the son of two Jewish educators and the grandson of Holocaust survivors. He attended Harvard, where he majored in Jewish studies and history, and served as the films editor of The Harvard Crimson. Rosenberg wrote his senior thesis on Albert Einstein's 20-year friendship with an eclectic Orthodox rabbi, translating the two men's German correspondence and conversations about the Talmud, Zionism, race, and God. ==Writing== Rosenberg covered the 2012 and 2016 U.S. elections, as well as the 2014 Israeli elections, and his work on these and other subjects has appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, and the Wall Street Journal, among other outlets. He has interviewed and profiled multiple White House chiefs of staff and cabinet members. He also elicited a correction from the US Supreme Court on a point of Jewish history. As of 2018, he is a senior writer at Tablet magazine, where he covers politics, culture, and religion, tackling topics ranging from American Jewish responses to modern critical scholarship of the Bible, to contemporary Islamophobia to the forgotten history of Mormon-Jewish relations. In particular, he has chronicled the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe and in America. He is also known for his satirical send-ups of anti-Semites on Twitter, and more serious efforts to combat abuse on online platforms. A frequent speaker and commentator on these topics, he has addressed audiences in locales as varied as New York, Seattle, Austin's South By Southwest, Jerusalem's Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism, and the Limmud conference in Melbourne, Australia.

Rosenberg also wrote about his experience and efforts to combat online abuse in the Times. ==Music== Rosenberg is a singer and composer of original Jewish music. In March 2020, he released his first two singles, Shalom Aleichem and Lecha Dodi, and announced a forthcoming album. His collaborators include singers Arun Viswanath and Abbaleh Savitt, as well as producer Charles Newman. \\"Rosenberg is not the only musically inclined member of his family,\\" reported Jewish Insider, \\"his grandfather was a Hasidic composer who, as a young man, escaped Nazi Europe with the assistance of Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara, who issued him a visa.

He also served as an assistant state attorney general and held executive positions at State Street Bank and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. ==Early life== Cutler was born in Boston to Roger W. and Leslie Bradley Cutler. His father was a noted rower who had been captain of the Harvard Crew in 1911 and competed in the 1914 Henley Royal Regatta as a member of the Union Boat Club. ==Athletic career== Cutler attended the Noble & Greenough School, but later transferred to Kent School. He did not make the Kent varsity crew as a starter, but in 1932 went to the Henley Royal Regatta as a substitute. He went on to Harvard College. During his sophomore year (1935) he was promoted from No. 2 on the junior varsity crew to varsity pace setter. He returned to the JV squad in 1936, but was promoted to varsity No 2. in May. That same year, Cutler was also a member of a Riverside Boat Club crew (which consisted of himself, his brother Robert, William Haskins, J. Paul Austin, and Edward Bennett) that sought to make the U.S. Olympic team. On July 4, 1936, The Riverside Boat Club qualified for the Olympics by defeating the Washington Huskies. In the Olympic men's coxed four, the Riverside Boat Club was eliminated in the semi-finals. Cutler graduated from Harvard College in 1937 and Harvard Law School in 1940. ==Personal life== On July 1, 1937, Cutler married Elsie Russell of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and Keene, New Hampshire. She was a niece of U.S. Senator Leverett Saltonstall. The couple had two daughters. On March 17, 1958, a widespread search for Elsie Cutler was made after she vanished from the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Her body was found in the Housatonic River on July 11, 1958. The cause of death was ruled to be drowning and declared to be \\"presumably a suicide\\" by the medical examiner. In 1959, Cutler married Elizabeth Dieterich of Omaha. On March 14, 1964, Cutler's daughter Clare was killed in an automobile accident in Pleasant Valley, New York. She was 20 years old. ==Professional life== During World War II, Cutler was a major on the staff of General Harry J. Collins, commander of the 42nd \\"Rainbow\\" Infantry Division. He earned a Bronze Star. After the war, Cutler served as an assistant attorney general under Massachusetts Attorney General Clarence A. Barnes. He then moved to New York City, where he held various banking positions. In 1954 he returned to Boston as vice president of the State Street Bank's trust division. In 1956, Cutler served as chairman of a citywide Red Cross Drive. In 1966, Cutler retired from State Street Bank to become director of development and public relations for Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, which was in the midst of expansions. He had previously served as a trustee and secretary to the board at Brigham since the 1950s and two of his uncles (Elliott and Robert Cutler) also held positions there. Cutler retired from Brigham in 1971. Cutler died on May 30, 1986, in Needham, Massachusetts, at the age of 70. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1986 deaths Category:American bankers Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:American male rowers Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Cutler family Category:Harvard Crimson rowers Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Kent School alumni Category:Olympic rowers of the United States Category:Sportspeople from Needham, Massachusetts Category:Rowers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:United States Army officers ","title":"Roger W.

The framework is notable as one of the few open-source operating systems not derived from a proprietary OS, such as Unix. The characteristic design philosophy is that a small trusted computing base is of primary concern in a security-oriented OS. Genode can be used as a basis for a desktop computer or tablet OS or as a virtual machine monitor for guest operating systems. The framework has been used as trusted component of secure virtualization systems for both x86 and ARM. The small codebase of Genode makes it a flexible alternative to more complex Unix-derived operating systems. For this reason the framework has been used as a base system for research in such fields as virtualization, inter-process communication, IP stack isolation, monitoring, and software development. ==History== Genode was first conceived as the Bastei OS Architecture research report at the Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden). The focus of the report was to determine the practicality of a component-based OS using capability-based security. This report was motivated in part by research into L4 microhypervisors conducted during the same time. Following the success of an early prototype, the authors of the report founded the company Genode Labs to develop Bastei as the Genode OS Framework. ==Releases== The project is developed publicly as an open source project released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License with a commercial entity offering alternative licensing. Releases are scheduled at three-month intervals to make changes to the system application binary interface (ABI), application programming interface (API), and issue documentation. The OS framework is available in source code form and following the 18.02 release a general purpose derivative named Sculpt is provided with on-target binary deployment. ==Architectural features== Genode builds on the general philosophy of microkernels: the smaller and simpler the code, the easier it is to verify for trustworthiness and correctness. Genode extends this philosophy to user space by composing complex applications from small components. Each component exists in a strict hierarchy of parent-child relationships. Any component acting as a parent may apply resource and inter- process communication (IPC) access policies to its children. This hierarchical system layout yields intuitive partitioning and privilege deescalation as specialized subsystems are nested within more general subsystems, mitigating the confused deputy problem endemic to centralized or superuser system policy. The framework is designed to be hosted by microkernels, however the features of any given microkernel fall mostly within a common set, and monolithic kernels implement a superset of those features. Abstracting these features allows Genode to act as user space for variety of L4 microkernels, and Linux. ==Criticism== ===C++=== Genode is often criticized for the choice of its implementation language, C++ (a few other operating systems implemented in C++ include BeOS, Fuchsia, Ghost, Haiku, IncludeOS, OSv, Palm OS, ReactOS, Syllable, and all major browser engines). This critique usually asserts that C++ is a poor choice for implementing system libraries and APIs because of the inherent complexity of C++ and the difficulty in analyzing code for correct behavior. While Genode does make use of multiple inheritance and templates in its system library, the use of the C++ Standard Library is not allowed and language features that rely on implicit global state, such as thread-local storage and the global allocator, have been removed from the language runtime. Comprehensive static analysis of C++ is not possible. However, the Genode project publishes unit tests for empirical analysis. ===XML=== Genode components consume and publish state using structured data serialized in XML, in contrast to the plain text model of Unix derivatives. The Genode framework makes use of XML in effectively all of its components because XML is easily parsed and generated programmatically while still being possible to understand and edit manually. ===Local namespacing=== Genode lacks any practical global namespace; there is no global file system or registry of processes or IPC endpoints. This is in contrast to systems such as Unix which feature a ubiquitous file system and allow a superuser context to arbitrarily manage any process within the system. Explicitly declaring the permissions and routing of components may be perceived as labor-intensive relative to Unix. However, compartmentalizing administration allows subsystems to be managed by mutually untrusted system administrators on the same machine without resorting to virtualizing, a common isolation method. ==Sculpt== The Genode project publishes a desktop operating system named Sculpt that targets contemporary consumer laptops. Sculpt is a small base system with automatic device detection and configuration, some GUI control interfaces, and frontends to the Genode package manager. The system does not feature a full desktop environment, but requires users to deploy virtual machines hosting traditional OSes for a fully featured desktop. Sculpt is distinguished from the Genode operating system framework in that it relies heavily on dynamic reconfiguration using privileged control components in contrast to specialized systems with static policies. ==See also== * HelenOS, a desktop microkernel based operating system * QNX, a proprietary Unix-like operating system hosted by a microkernel * Qubes OS, a desktop operating system that provides security through virtualization * Subgraph (operating system), a Linux distribution that provides security through sandboxing * Capability-based security * Secure by default ==References== ==External links == ; Official websites * ; Research projects * KV-Cache: A Scalable High-Performance Web-Object Cache for Manycore * TrApps: Secure Compartments in the Evil Cloud * Development of an Embedded Platform for Secure CPS Services * Secure-OS project of IIT Madras * Kernel isolation of a Capability-based security Operating System * Mobile Device Security with ARM TrustZone Category:ARM operating systems Category:Capability systems Category:Free software operating systems Category:Free software programmed in C++ Category:Microkernel-based operating systems Category:Operating system security Category:X86 operating systems Category:X86-64 operating systems ","title":"Genode"},{"id":"56601170","text":"Hi-Jacked is a 1950 American film noir crime film directed by Sam Newfield and starring Jim Davis and Marcia Mae Jones.http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/feature-articles/sam-newfield/ ==Plot== A parolee, working for a tracking line, struggles to clear his name after being accused of involvement with hijackers. ==Cast== * Jim Davis as Joe Harper * Marcia Mae Jones as Jean Harper (as Marsha Jones) * Sid Melton as Killer * Davis Bruce as Matt * Paul Cavanagh as Hagen * Ralph Sanford as Stephen Clark * House Peters Jr. as Hank * Iris Adrian as Aggie * George Eldredge as Digbey * William E.

Between 1919 and 1922 he led the new Czechoslovak military mission in Budapest, coordinating its intelligence- gathering activities. Returning to Czechoslovakia, he advanced through the ranks as a cavalry officer, ultimately coming to command the 3rd Fast Division. Eminger left the country following the German occupation of the Czech lands in 1939 but was persuaded by Alois Eliáš to return to help lead the creation of the new Government Army, of which he became the first commander in August. As inspector-general of the Government Army, Eminger was made General 2nd Class on November 11, 1939, and promoted to General 1st Class on August 1, 1942. During his time leading the Government Army, Eminger pursued a program of outward cooperation with the German authorities while quietly working to ensure the army's operational incompetence and turning a blind eye to resistance activities on the part of soldiers. In 1943 the Government Army was deployed in an attempt to capture parachutist drop sites in Bohemia and Moravia used by resistance fighters and the Allies. According to one account, when asked by a subordinate officer what Protectorate soldiers should do in the event they successfully intercepted parachutists, Eminger replied, \\"if there are few you will ignore them, if there are many you will join them\\". In the spring of 1944, Ferdinand Schaal requested Emil Hácha order the deployment of the Government Army to Italy to assist German military operations there, a deployment Eminger protested in vain. One of Eminger's final acts as commander of the Government Army came on May 5, 1945, when he ordered the army's 1st Battalion to turn their weapons against the Wehrmacht in the Battle of Czechoslovak Radio. ==Arrest and exoneration== Eminger was arrested after the end of World War II and, in April 1947, went on trial on charges of collaboration with Germany. He was acquitted of all charges, with the court recording the verdict that Eminger was \\"a loyal Czech and a brave man\\". He lived the rest of his life in secluded retirement. ==See also== * Josef Ježek ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Czech military leaders Category:Czechoslovak military personnel of World War II Category:People from Čáslav Category:People from the Kingdom of Bohemia Category:Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ","title":"Jaroslav Eminger"},{"id":"56601237","text":"Nate Jensen is an American football coach.

It argues that the Enlightenment values of reason, science, and humanism have brought progress; shows our progress with data that health, prosperity, safety, peace, and happiness have tended to rise worldwide; and explains the cognitive science of why this progress should be appreciated. It is a follow- up to Pinker's 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature. ==Thesis== A commonly-held lay public perception holds that the world is in terrible shape; for some, 2016 was the \\"worst year ever\\" and the death of liberalism. In contrast, Pinker argues that life has been getting better for most people. He sets out 15 different measures of human wellbeing to support this argument, with the most obvious being the uncontroversial fact that, statistically, people live longer and healthier lives on average than ever before. As another example, while fears of terrorism are often voiced in U.S. opinion polls, Pinker shows that an American is 3,000 times more likely to die in an accident than in a terrorist attack. As in Pinker's previous The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker ascribes modern improvements to trends of liberal humanism and scientific rationality that first took root in Europe around the 17th and 18th centuries. Pinker argues that economic inequality \\"is not itself a dimension of human wellbeing\\" and cites a study that finds inequality is not linked to unhappiness, at least in poorer societies. He also points out that the world as a whole is becoming more equal, and states that even within increasingly unequal areas, the poor are still getting wealth and benefit from technological innovations. For example, it is clear to Pinker that an innovation that makes the poor slightly richer and the rich massively richer is a positive rather than a negative achievement. In contrast, critics hold that enhancing social mobility and combating \\"inequality as a result of unfairness\\" are important legitimate ends in and of themselves, beyond any effects of reducing poverty. On topics such as nuclear weaponry, Pinker places the blame on anti-Enlightenment forces. Scientists working on the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons did so because they needed to beat Hitler; Pinker states \\"Quite possibly, had there been no Nazis, there would be no nukes.\\" In contrast, critics point out that science lacks any ethical logic of its own. They argue that scientific progress is liberating but also threatening, and can present dangers precisely because of how hugely it expands human power. Pinker expresses concerns about potential human extinction from nuclear weapons or from global warming, but categorizes existential risks overall as a \\"useless category\\", stating that \\"Sowing fear about hypothetical disasters, far from safeguarding the future of humanity, can endanger it\\". In particular, Pinker departs from scholars such as Nick Bostrom regarding the possibility of accidental existential risk from artificial general intelligence, and makes a controversial reductio ad absurdum argument that self-driving cars provide evidence that artificial general intelligence will pose no accidental existential risk. The book concludes with three chapters defending what Pinker sees as Enlightenment values: reason, science, and humanism.Can Science Justify Itself? Ada Palmer. Harvard Magazine, March–April 2018. Pinker argues that these values are under threat from modern trends such as religious fundamentalism, political correctness, and postmodernism.ENLIGHTENMENT NOW: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. (2017). Kirkus Reviews, 85(24), 1. In an interview about the book published in Scientific American, Pinker has clarified that his book is not merely an expression of hope—it is a documentation of how much we have gained as a result of Enlightenment values, and how much we have to lose if those values are abandoned.The Secret behind One of the Greatest Success Stories in All of History. Gareth Cook. Scientific American, February 15, 2018. ==Marketing== In January 2018 Bill Gates tweeted praise for Enlightenment Now, calling it \\"my new favorite book\\". Gates stated he agreed overall with the techno-optimism of the book, but cautioned that Pinker is too \\"quick to dismiss\\" the idea that artificial superintelligence could someday lead to human extinction. Citing reader interest due to Gates' endorsement, Viking Press moved the publication date from 27 February 2018 to 13 February 2018. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly gave the book a glowing review, concluding that \\"In an era of increasingly 'dystopian rhetoric,' Pinker’s sober, lucid, and meticulously researched vision of human progress is heartening and important.\\"\\"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress\\". (2018). Publishers Weekly, (51). 157. The Times also gave the book a positive review, stating that Pinker's arguments and evidence are \\"as entertaining as they are important\\", and expressing hope that Pinker's defense of the forces that have produced progress will be successful.Aaronovitch, David. \\"Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker — don’t believe the false doom-mongers\\". The Times, February 17, 2018. The New York Times described the book as \\"an excellent book, lucidly written, timely, rich in data and eloquent in its championing of a rational humanism that is — it turns out — really quite cool.\\" The Economist agreed with Pinker that \\"barring a cataclysmic asteroid strike or nuclear war, it is likely that (the world) will continue to get better\\". In Skeptical Inquirer Kendrick Frazier concurs that Pinker \\"argues [his] case eloquently and ... effectively, drawing on both the demographic data and our improved understanding of human biases that get in our way of seeing the truth.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"overstuffed\\", and noted though Pinker is progressive, \\"the academically orthodox will find him an apostate\\". The Guardian and The Financial Times dismissed Pinker's contention that the left is partly to blame for anti-reason rhetoric and objected to Pinker's criticism of groups such as postmodernists, de-growth environmentalists, and people whom Pinker deems to be \\"social justice warriors\\". British philosopher John Gray criticized Pinker as promoting scientism and discussed historical examples of strong desire for human progress leading to the misuse of science for immoral policies. Gray also argued that Pinker had misunderstood Friedrich Nietzsche. Some reviewers disagreed with Pinker's quantitative approach to assessing progress. Booklist stated that \\"(Pinker's) seemingly casual dismissal of ethics concerns surrounding the Tuskegee experiment is troubling to say the least.\\"Mondor, C. (2018). Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Booklist, (9-10). 20. Pinker had written that the Tuskegee experiment \\"was patently unethical by today’s standards, though it’s often misreported to pile up the indictment,\\" and when properly reported, \\"when the study began, it may even have been defensible by the standards of the day.\\" In Nature, Ian Goldin wrote that Pinker should have focused more on future risks, although Pinker did devote a chapter to existential threats, and concludes with \\"But for the many overwhelmed by gloom, it is a welcome antidote.\\" A review in the London Evening Standard agrees with Pinker's summary of how rationality has improved the world, and state \\"On Islamism, where his optimism falters, we have the interesting phenomenon of Muslim youth — not least in countries like Afghanistan — becoming less liberal than their parents\\"McDonagh, Melanie. \\"Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker - review: 'The human condition is a little more complex than Mr Cheerful makes out'\\" Evening Standard, February 15, 2018. although they do not provide a source for this claim. Writing in the democratic socialist Jacobin, Landon Frim and Harrison Fluss posit that Pinker's Enlightenment \\"is shorn of its most egalitarian and democratic elements — it no longer resembles the intellectual ferment of the French Revolution. Instead, Pinker’s 'Enlightenment' mimics the hierarchy, conservatism, and authoritarianism of the ancien régime — that historical enemy of Radical Enlightenment.\\" In Quillette, the behavioral geneticist Saloni Dattani writes that the book's critics \\"are eager to flaunt their aversion to the very values Pinker sets out to defend – reason, science, humanism, and progress – and that their critiques display the traits and tics of exactly the kind of counter-Enlightenment thinking he attacks,\\" and summarizes the book's case as \\"a refutation of the arguments of the counter- Enlightenment which, it turns out, have been wrong all along.\\" In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Stanford University historian Jessica Riskin summarizes the book as \\"a knot of Orwellian contradictions\\". She states that Pinker believes that skepticism is a negative influence on society, and objects that the very Enlightenment heroes Pinker praises, such as Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Denis Diderot and Adam Smith, were all advocates of skepticism. She concludes, \\"What we need in this time of political, environmental, and cultural crisis is precisely the value Pinker rejects but that his Enlightenment heroes embraced, whatever their differences of opinion on other matters: skepticism, and an attendant spirit of informed criticism.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Enlightenment Now on stevenpinker.com Category:Works by Steven Pinker Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:English-language books ","title":"Enlightenment Now"},{"id":"56601288","text":"Gunfire is a 1950 American film directed by William Berke.Memories of a Movie- Mad Girlhood By CARYL RIVERS.

The group's main members consisted of songwriters Tommy Talton and Scott Boyer, alongside a rotating group of musicians. They released four albums on the Capricorn Records label in the 1970s: Reach for the Sky (1970), 5'll Getcha Ten (1971), Boyer and Talton (1974), and Cowboy (1977). The song \\"Please Be with Me\\"–perhaps their best- known song–featured a performance from Duane Allman. It was also later covered by Eric Clapton on his album 461 Ocean Boulevard (1974). The group's sound has been compared to Hearts & Flowers, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Pure Prairie League. Steve Leggett of Allmusic considered Cowboy \\"one of Capricorn Records' and Southern rock's best-kept secrets during the genre's golden age in the 1970s.\\" The group reformed in 2007 and recorded an album, released a decade later as 10'll Getcha Twenty. In addition, this iteration also issued a live album, Boyer & Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010. ==Biography== Cowboy was formed in 1969 in Jacksonville, Florida by singer-songwriters Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton, with pianist/guitarist Bill Pillmore, bassist George Clark, guitarist Pete Kowalke, and drummer Tom Wynn rounding out the original lineup. The six musicians, all from around the Orlando/Jacksonville area, rented a home in Jacksonville where they lived and rehearsed together. Previously, Boyer had played with Duane Allman and his brother, Gregg, in the folk-rock group the 31st of February. Duane, at that point of the Allman Brothers Band, suggested them to Phil Walden, owner of Capricorn Records. Leggett writes that the band's lineup was ever-changing during this time, besides \\"Talton and Boyer, both of whom became de facto members of the Capricorn house band, playing with the Allman Brothers, Gregg Allman, Alex Taylor, and Bonnie Bramlett.\\" Their debut album, Reach for the Sky, was released in 1971, and their second, 5'll Getcha Ten, followed later that year. The latter album featured \\"Please Be with Me\\", which featured Allman on dobro. Eric Clapton later covered the song for his album 461 Ocean Boulevard (1974). By 1972, much of the original Cowboy lineup departed. \\"People just started moving in different directions. I don't remember there being any animosity about it,\\" Talton recalled in 2014. He and Boyer continued on as Cowboy, supporting Gregg Allman on his first solo effort Laid Back in 1973, and accompanying him as his backing band on its ensuing tour, which was captured on the 1974 live album The Gregg Allman Tour. The band's third album, Boyer & Talton, saw release the same year. Their final, self-titled record was released in 1977. Leggett also notes that \\"the 1976 album Happy to Be Alive, attributed to the trio of Tommy Talton, Bill Stewart, and Johnny Sandlin, might be considered a Cowboy album in all but name.\\" Boyer and Talton continued to work together sporadically over the years. They reformed Cowboy thirty years after their dissolution in 2007. This iteration recorded at least an album's worth of music with Sandlin at his studio, Duck Tape Studio, in Decatur, Alabama. When asked about the album in an interview some years later, Boyer told AL.com that \\"the project fell to the wayside. We ran into some technical difficulties.\\" In 2010, they performed their first concert in over thirty years, billed as Cowboy/Boyer & Talton, at the Cox Capital Theatre in Macon. They were joined by Stewart on drums, Stan Robertson on bass, and Randall Bramblett on keyboards, saxophone, and vocals. It was issued the following year as a live album, titled Boyer & Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010. Boyer died on February 13, 2018. His musical partner Talton said, \\"No one could write a more beautiful ballad than Scott Boyer. I love him and I miss him more than anything that can be said.\\" Later that year, the band's final reunion album, titled 10'll Getcha Twenty, was released. It features the recordings made in 2007, and marks not only the original members' final recordings, but producer Sandlin's as well. ==Discography== ;Albums ;;Studio albums * Reach for the Sky (1970) * 5'll Getcha Ten (1971) * Boyer & Talton (1974) * Cowboy (1977) * 10'll Getcha Twenty (2018) ;;Live albums * Boyer & Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010 (2011) ;; Compilation albums * Why Quit When You're Losing (1973) * The Best of Cowboy - A Different Time (1993) ;Singles * \\"It's Time\\" (1970) * \\"A Patch & A Pain Killer\\" (1974) * \\"I Will Be There (Pat's Song)\\" (1977) * \\"Takin' It All The Way\\" (1977) * \\"10'll Getcha Twenty\\" (2018) ==References== ==External links== * Category:American country rock groups Category:Capricorn Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1969 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2007 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1977 Category:Musical groups from Jacksonville, Florida Category:Southern rock musical groups ","title":"Cowboy (band)"},{"id":"56601356","text":"Grand Canyon is a 1949 American Western film starring Richard Arlen.

His parents were Leoncio Baluyut and Casimira Julao. In 1904, Baluyut was given the opportunity to study at the expense of the government in the United States. After he studied in Santa Ana Central and High School in California and the University Summer School of Illinois, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Iowa. In 1911, Baluyut returned to the Philippines, where he went to work for the Office of Public Works as an assistant engineer in the provinces of Pampanga and Cavite. Afterwards, from 1912 to 1919, he was district engineer for the provinces of Isabela, Antique, Ilocos Norte, Bulacan and Pangasinan. He also worked on the San Jose-Santa Fe Road. In 1920, he became an engineer for the Pampanga Sugar Development Corporation. In 1925, Baluyut was elected governor of the province of Pampanga. He was re-elected three years later. During his term of six years as governor, he was responsible for the construction of many schools, hospitals, roads and bridges. One of the larger projects that was realized in his term was a long paved road straight through the province. After his second term, Baluyut was elected in 1931 and re-elected in 1934 as a member of Senate from 3rd Senatorial District. In the Senate, among other things, he enacted the law which led to the establishment of National Electric Power and Development Corporation. At the end of 1937, Baluyut was elected governor of the province of Pampanga for a third term. He was appointed as Secretary of Labor from 1938 to 1940 while serving as governor.

It was released on April 6, 2018 by eOne and Chaos & Glory as the planned lead single from her mixtape Fantasea II: The Second Wave. Production of the song was handled by Junior Sanchez, while the song was penned by Banks, Sanchez, Dorian Strickland, Kevin James, and \\"Shug\\". The song is named after Anna Wintour, who is the editor-in-chief of Vogue, and is about self empowerment. The music video was released on May 24, 2018 and surpassed 1 million views in 48 hours. ==Production== While Banks was signed to Interscope Records, Junior Sanchez was commissioned by the label to do a remix of Banks's song \\"Ice Princess,\\" from Broke with Expensive Taste (2014), with the working title of the track being \\"Anna Wintour\\". One of the initial plans for the song was for it to feature Mel B, however, this concept was ultimately scrapped due to scheduling conflicts. Another concept that Banks had envisioned for the song was for it to feature Nicki Minaj. When discussing her reasoning for the title of the song, Banks stated: :\\"My choice to name this song 'Anna Wintour' is telling; I relate to Anna Wintour so much as a strong, powerful and larger than life soul in a petite, tidy and feminine body. While others may see Anna as intimidating, I see a woman who was born into this world with an absolute certainty about her place in it.\\" ==Critical reception== Shaad D'Souza of the website Noisey stated, \\"The song is a fun, upbeat vogue track, and it features Azealia rapping and singing some of her sweetest lines ever. \\"I feel in love babe, I really know that your love is enough,\\" she sings on the chorus, \\"I'm so lucky you found me in the day.\\" It's beautiful! The song is called \\"Anna Wintour,\\" I assume, because it's a vogue track, and Anna Wintour is the editor of Vogue. Wordplay! I'm feeling really positive about Fantasea II, and \\"Anna Wintour\\" is a great start to a new era for Azealia. Myles Tanzer of The Fader commented on Banks' vocals, stating: \\"...she hits soulful high notes in the pre-chorus, glides through a pop section with her trademark fluid delivery, screams over the song's breakdown, and even stops to rap a ferocious verse.\\" Dazed put \\"Anna Wintour\\" on its 20 best tracks of 2018 list, saying the song \\"showed, once again, that the rapper really knows how to make a dance floor anthem. Channeling the energy of Vogue’s iconic editor with the same glow she exhibits while “stuntin’ in front row”, “Anna Wintour” felt like it could have been a real comeback moment for Banks, marking an upwards artistic trajectory as she embarked on her new album.\\" The Line of Best Fit placed it on 25th spot in its Fifty Best Songs of 2018, remarking that \\"its impossibly catchy 90s house beat plays host to both Banks’ powerful voice and unstoppable bars. It treads the pop/rap line in a way that no other artist is doing in 2018. It feels retro but not dated, and sticks to Banks’ signature sound without feeling too same-old.\\" Pitchfork ranked it on its 100 best songs of 2018 list, saying that \\"the rapper’s messy public persona yields the floor to a bracing showcase of her dexterity. She pulls triple duty as house diva, raging wraith, and cold-blooded killer, nailing each part and metabolizing Junior Sanchez’s fiercely generic Ibiza track into a raw energy source. “Anna Wintour” joins “Thank U, Next” and “Honey” among the few songs about self-love released this year that betray greater depth than vapid Instagram inspo, and it offers a reminder of what makes the often-frustrating Banks so great: Like this song’s namesake, she knows how to keep us looking.\\" ==Music video== Comparisons to Teyana Taylor's dance for \\"Fade\\" ignited a dispute between the two artists On May 24, 2018, Banks released the music video for \\"Anna Wintour\\". The video features Banks in and around an abandoned warehouse dancing and was directed by choreographer and long time backup dancer Matthew Pasterisa. Prior to the music video's release, Banks responded to accusations that her music video was too similar to Kanye West's 2016 video for \\"Fade\\", claiming that Teyana Taylor stole the choreography from Pasterisa and didn't give him credit until lawyers were involved. Taylor denied these claims and called on Pasterisa to comment, to which he said he wasn't directly involved with \\"Fade\\" but received credit regardless. ==Track listing== *Digital download #\\"Anna Wintour\\" – 4:33 ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2018) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - } ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Azealia Banks songs Category:Entertainment One singles Category:Songs written by Azealia Banks Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Cultural depictions of business people Category:Cultural depictions of publishers Category:Cultural depictions of journalists Category:Cultural depictions of American women Category:Songs written by Junior Sanchez ","title":"Anna Wintour (song)"},{"id":"56601416","text":"Evelina Trojanska (; 15 November 1929 – 2000) was a Bulgarian chess player.

It elects one member via first-past-the-post voting. Under the current constituency numbering system, it is designated as constituency 24. It is located in northwestern Lower Saxony, comprising the city of Emden and the district of Aurich. Aurich – Emden was created for the inaugural 1949 federal election. It was abolished in 1965 and re-established in the 1980 federal election. Since 2013, it has been represented by Johann Saathoff of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). ==Geography== Aurich – Emden is located in northwestern Lower Saxony. As of the 2021 federal election, it comprises the independent city of Emden and the district of Aurich. ==History== Aurich – Emden was created in 1949. In the 1949 election, it was Lower Saxony constituency 1. From 1953 to 1965, it was constituency number 23. Originally, it comprised the city of Emden and the districts of Aurich and Norden, the latter of which was incorporated into the former in 1977. Aurich – Emden was abolished in the 1965 election. The city of Emden and the Norden district became part of the Emden – Leer constituency, while the Aurich district became part of the Wilhelmshaven constituency. Aurich – Emden was re-established in the 1980 election. Thereafter, it was constituency 19. In the 1998 election, it became constituency 25; it has been constituency 24 since the 2013 election. Its borders have not changed since its re-establishment. ==Members== The constituency has been held continuously by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) throughout both its incarnations. It is a traditional stronghold of the SPD, often one of the party's safest constituencies. Its first representative was Georg Peters, who served from 1949 until the constituency's abolition in 1965. After its re-establishment, it was won by Carl Ewen, who represented it until 1994. He was succeeded by Jann-Peter Janssen, who served until 2005; he was in turn succeeded by Garrelt Duin. Johann Saathoff was elected in 2013, and re-elected in 2017. { class= ! colspan=2 Election ! Member !
