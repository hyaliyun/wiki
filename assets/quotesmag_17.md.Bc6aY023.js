The square was developed after Lutsk received Magdeburg Rights. Over the years, Market Square has been the commercial, social and political center of the city. Previously, the Square was surrounded by administrative buildings and hosted multiple major public events. The market held in Market Square was also the main trade center for the city. The Square has been destroyed by fire several times during its history. After the Town Hall burned down in the 18th century, new buildings reduced the space for the market, but it still remained the trade center of Lutsk until World War II. Currently, Market Square is a historical landmark surrounded by old townhouses and churches. ==History== Magdeburg Rights According to geological research, the central hill of the Lutsk suburb was often flooded as it wasn't sited high enough above the Styr River. The area was first populated in the 10th century. Active trade was established due to commercial activity of local and foreign artisans, which encouraged development of trade routes and cultural interaction. The city was divided into typical quarters designed around the main churches. In 1432 Lutsk was granted Magdeburg Rights by King Jogaila. Jogaila The Magdeburg Law legalized tendencies formed long ago. Social development caused the nascence of a new middle class – the bourgeoisie. They lived in a special quarter in Lutsk. The city was divided into three main areas – the Upper Castle, Roundabout Castle and bourgeoisie territory, which was located west of the castles. The clergy, ministers, princes and magnates lived in the castles. The privileged classes were prohibited from living on the bourgeoisie territory. The Magdeburg Law mostly concerned the Market square and managed bourgeoisie rights and obligations. According to the Magdeburg Law, an elective government was created – a magistrate consisting of two houses: a higher Court led by a vogt and a lower Council led by a mayor. These Houses were settled in the Town Hall and there were municipal trade measures and scales established. The square was used for trade and social and political events such as royal and magistrate declarations, executions, and other meetings. Lutsk was granted the privilege of holding three annual fairs. Trade in the square assisted many coins corresponded to political and commercial relations between Volyn and other regions. There were many coins from Kiev and Novgorod, soms from the Golden Horde, Prague groschen, Lithuanian and Polish coins and others. In 1385–1388 Lutsk had a mint that produced coins of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Economic relations Lutsk emblem 1550–1650 Lutsk maintained economic relations with the Hanseatic League. In 1341, residents of Toruń were granted rights for trading in Lutsk. Artisans brought goods as noted in Toruń customs register of the 14th century. In 1374, Toruń advisor T. fon der Linde sent fabrics to Lutsk Flemish. There are examples of Rhine stone products among archeological artifacts. One of Toruń's merchants, a relative of Nicolaus Copernicus by the mother of the family Watzenrode, died in Lutsk in 1386. In addition to cities of the Hanseatic League, Lutsk traded with other European cities and countries. Wool and silk fabrics, wine, sugar, gold and luxuries, fish, and pharmacy products were imported from French regions; wine, copper, and knives from Hungary; cloth from Czechoslovakia. While Lutsk exported honey, wax, fish, bread, cattle, leather, resin, tar, etc. Lutsk was the main bread trade center in Volyn for a few centuries. The closest cities to Lutsk – Lublin, Lviv, Kraków, Volodymyr, Kamianets etc. – were also commercial partners. The Market square was shaped as a rectangle with a church situated at each angle: three Orthodox churches and one Catholic, (Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral). Later, an Armenian church was settled near the Market. The Town Hall, gutted by fire in the 18th century, was situated on the south side of square. The market was surrounded by brick buildings with very deep cellars. ==Decline== After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Volyn was annexed by the Russian Empire. As the Magdeburg Law was repealed, the Market square began to decline. In the 1930s the square was still filled with low market stalls, but they were destroyed during World War II. A Jewish ghetto was established in the square during the German occupation which resulted in the death of 17,000 Jews by 1942. In the 1950s–1960s, a bus station was built in place of the former Town Hall and a fountain with sculpted swans was built in the middle of the square. In recent years Market square has become quiet. It is now just an empty triangular square with no trade activity or meetings. The square is surrounded by quaint old brick buildings. Within the square stands a sculpture dedicated to the 2000th anniversary of the Nativity of Jesus. The sculpture is set in the middle of Market square while the Lutsk Orthodox Fellowship buildings are located north of the square itself. ==Gallery== File:ЛуцькРинокКостел.jpgSaint Peter and Paul Cathedral File:ЛуцькДрагомановаКінець.jpgStreet File:ЛуцькДрагоманова7.jpgOld building ==Sources== * Терський С.

In a career which lasted from September 1989 until September 1994, he ran thirty-four times and won seven races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old maiden in 1990. In the following seasons he won major races in France, Italy and Canada, before retiring as a seven-year-old. At the time of his retirement he held the record for prize money won by a European- trained horse, although the precise total of his earnings was difficult to determine because of the number of different currencies involved. ==Background== Snurge was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred at the Kilcarn Stud near Navan in County Meath, Ireland. Before his racing career began he entered the ownership of the British businessman Martyn Arbib, who named the colt after a nickname he received while in school. Snurge was sired by the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Ela-Mana-Mou out of the French-bred mare Finlandia. The horse was trained by Paul Cole at Whatcombe, near Wantage in Oxfordshire and ridden in all but two of his races by Richard Quinn. ==Racing career== 1989: two-year-old season Snurge made his first appearance in the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes over one mile at Newbury Racecourse on 22 September and finished third of the nine runners behind Tanfith. A month later he ran in a ten furlong maiden race at Nottingham. He took the lead briefly before finishing second to Blue Stag, a horse who went on to be the runner-up in the 1990 Epsom Derby. In November, Snurge was sent to France and moved up in class to contest the Group One Critérium de Saint-Cloud. He finished first by three lengths from Intimiste, but was \\"controversially\\" disqualified and placed second by the racecourse stewards. 1990: three-year-old season Snurge missed the early part of the 1990 season before reappearing at the Ascot Heath meeting after Royal Ascot in which he contested the Churchill Stakes, finishing second by a head to Middle Kingdom. After a break of two months, Snurge returned to the racecourse in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. He started the 22/1 outsider of the five horse field, which was headed by the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Belmez. Snurge took the lead in the straight and stayed on strongly before being caught in the last strides and beaten a head by Belmez. On 15 September at Doncaster, Snurge started second favourite for the St Leger at odds of 7/2, with the filly Hellenic, the winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks starting favourite at 2/1. The two leading horses in the betting dominated the closing stages of the race with Snurge taking the lead from Hellenic in the straight and running on strongly to beat the filly by three quarters of a length. He was recording his first ever win, becoming the first maiden to win the St Leger for seventy-seven years. In October, Snurge contested the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp, the most prestigious race of the European flat-racing season. In a finish dominated by three-year-old colts he finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and half a length by Saumarez and Epervier Bleu. 1991: four-year-old season Snurge began his four-year-old season by winning the Listed Aston Park Stakes at Newbury and was then sent to Italy where he won the Group One Gran Premio di Milano. After a mid-summer break, Snurge started favourite for the Grand Prix de Deauville and won by a neck. Snurge's three victories led to his being considered a serious contender for the 1991 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and he started the 8/1 fourth favourite behind the three- year-olds Generous, Suave Dancer and Pistolet Bleu. He failed to produce his best form and finished last of the fourteen runners. Later in October, Snurge was sent to Italy where he finished third in the Gran Premio del Jockey Club in Milan before winning the Premio Roma Vecchia in Rome. 1992: five-year- old season Snurge began his five-year-old season by finishing third in Yorkshire Cup before running unplaced in the Coronation Cup and the Gran Premio di Milano. He then ran second in four successive races, finishing runner-up in the Grosser Preis von Berlin, the Aral-Pokal, the Grand Prix de Deauville and the Irish St. Leger. He was then sent to Canada to contest the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack on 18 October. Snurge finished second by half a length to the French-trained colt Wiorno, but was awarded the race on a disqualification, after the racecourse stewards' found that Wiorno had repeatedly bumped the third place Ghazi in an \\"incredibly tight finish\\". The beaten horses included Urban Sea and Mashaallah. The disqualification was appealed but Snurge's victory was confirmed by the Ontario Racing Commission in November. On his final appearance of the season he returned to Europe and finished unplaced in the Premio Roma Vecchia. 1993-1994: later career Snurge ran six times as a six-year-old in 1993. His progress was hindered by a viral infection in the early part of the season. His only success came in August when he defeated Petit Loup by a short head to win the Grand Prix de Deauville for a second time. He finished sixth behind Vintage Crop when favourite for the Irish St. Leger three weeks later. In 1994, Snurge continued to compete in major middle-distance races but failed to win. His best performances came when he finished second in the Gran Premio di Milano and the Prix Maurice de Nieuil and third in the Aral-Pokal. He was injured when finishing last of the six runners in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot in September and was retired to stud. ==Stud career== Snurge stood as a stallion in France at the Haras du Val Henry and before being moved to Ireland. He was based at the Arctic Tack Stud in County Wexford and then the Grange Stud in County Cork where he represented the Coolmore Stud as a National Hunt stallion. Snurge sired the winners of more than 300 National Hunt races, but none at the highest level. He died of colic at the age of nineteen in November 2006. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1987 racehorse births Category:2006 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-m Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Snurge"},{"id":"35914747","text":"Atylostagma is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

Since 2012 it has been the capital of the Sioma District. The current mayor of the Town is Amani. He initially went there to explore, but during his visit he saved a resident from a wild dog attack, resulting in him gaining popularity in the area. Using this popularity to his advantage, Amani soon entered politics and ran for mayor. ==Geography== Sioma is located on the west bank of the Zambezi River north of Sesheke and south of the provincial capital Mongu. The town is situated approximately south of the town of Senanga which marks the southern extent of the Barotse Floodplain. Vegetation in the area is predominately Dry Kalahari woodland. ==History== An Early Iron Age site was excavated at Sioma which has been dated to the mid centuries of the first millennium. Some of the pottery at the site resembles that which is found in Nqoma, Angola. In the 1880s the Portuguese explorer Alexandre Alberto da Rocha de Serpa Pinto and American James Dabney McCabe both described the settlement as a hamlet. Pinto also described how the Lui government forced local residents to act as porters for canoes attempting to get around the nearby Ngonye Falls. Expansion of the town started in 1957 when the catholic Irish Capuchin Franciscans established the Saint Anthony mission station on the Zambezi river at the town. In 2012 the town was made the capital of the newly created Sioma District. ==Weather== Annually, the town gets an average of of rain. == References == Category:Populated places in Western Province, Zambia ","title":"Sioma"},{"id":"35914795","text":"Afzalabad (, also Romanized as Āfz̤alābād) is a village in Neh Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The buildings were constructed during the 1630s and 1640s, and were the political center of the Orthodox people of Volyn. The Lutsk fellowship began to decline at the turn of the 18th century, and the buildings deteriorated. They were damaged by fire during the 18th century, and the church was almost completely destroyed a century later. While the monastery building remains nearly as it was designed, the church has been rebuilt many times; the apse and reconstructed dome are its only original parts. The monastery is an apartment building; the church is used by the Volyn Fellowship of Saint Andrew, heir to the Lutsk Orthodox Fellowship. ==History== Sigismund III Vasa In 16th-century Rus', a hospital, the church of Saint Lazar and a cemetery were located on the northern side of Lutsk Island near Glushets bridge; they were destroyed by fire in 1619. On 20 February 1619, Sigismund III Vasa (king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) authorized the Fellowship to build a new hospital, church and school on the church site. The Fellowship owned the former Rus' hospital, and approved plans for new construction by the end of 1619. The following year, a new wooden church and school were built. The Lutsk Orthodox Fellowship had sufficient funds for their activities, and expanded. Since it was impossible to build all the required infrastructure in their own area, the Fellowship purchased neighbouring lands. Some fellowship buildings were located on land belonging to Olexandr Zubcewski, who bequeathed his property to it. Church plan A new brick church was built during the 1630s. Its founders were Fellowship members, individual Orthodox donors, clergy and szlachta families (including the Hulewicz, Puzyn, Semashko, and Chetvertynski families of Volyn). The need for a school, a print shop, a hospital and a monastery created a demand for new construction. In 1645, King Władysław IV Vasa authorized a new brick hospital and administrative house with the aid of Olexandr Mozelli. Mozelli allocated 40,000 złoty for construction, which began the following year. In 1647, two-story houses (a school, hospital, library, print shop and monastic cells) were completed. Nineteenth-century ruins In 1713, the Lutsk Fellowship began to stagnate and the Order of Saint Basil the Great took over the monastery. In 1761 the monastery building was damaged in a fire, and was restored by 1774 when a new church entrance was created through a wall. In 1795, the Orthodox Church again purchased the church. During the 19th century, the church nearly collapsed due to neglect; only the altar remained, and relics were kept in a chapel from 1888 to 1890. Alexander III of Russia visited the church on 27 August 1890, granting 3,000 rubles to the fellowship; O. Tereshchenko also donated 2,000 rubles. The church and its iconostasis were reconstructed, and new bells cast. During the 1950s the church was again reconstructed, and is part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate. ==Architecture== The architecture of the church embodied two concepts: a trilocular design used in Ukrainian wooden churches, and a three-nave construction used in Byzantine architecture. The iconostasis, consisting of 16 icons, was originally made of carved oak and gold leaf during the 19th century. The icons were divided by six carved gilt columns with complex shapes. The second tier of the iconostasis consisted of two sides of the icons. Sculptures of angels, the inscription \\"Christ is Risen\\" and a central icon are set above them. An icon of Jesus Christ was set on top of the iconostasis. ==Gallery== File:ЛуцькБрЛеман.jpgChurch in 1916 File:ЛуцькБрІк.jpgIconostasis File:ЛуцькБрЕл2.jpgFragment of the wall File:ЛуцькБрВі.jpgStained glass ==Sources== * Луцьк.

At its introduction, it was in the middle of Pentax's DSLR range, above the now-discontinued entry-level K-r, and below the semi-pro K-5 and successor K-5 II. ==Overview== It has a stainless steel chassis, and unlike most DSLRs of its class, is fully weather sealed. It can shoot continuously at up to 6 frames per second with a maximum shutter speed of 1/6000th of a second. It can capture video at 1080p at either 30, 25, or 24 fps. Like all current and recent Pentax dSLRs it features in-body shake reduction, removing the need for each lens to have image stabilisation. The Pentax K mount allows use of legacy lenses dating back to the 1970s, or even earlier with an M42-mount adapter, for which the K-mount is fully compatible. The autofocus system (SAFOX IXi+) is an advance over the K-5 and features 11 AF points, 9 of which are cross-type (i.e. sensitive to vertical as well as horizontal edges). For maximum flexibility, the camera can either use the proprietary supplied lithium battery, or, with an optional adapter, use the universally available AA battery type. ==References *Pentax K-30 - Pentax US *Pentax K-30 - Pentax UK Notable reviews: *Pentax K-30 Camera Review - Pentax Forums *Pentax K-30 review: A good camera doesn't have to be fragile by the Verge *Pentax K-30 Review by dpreview.com *Pentax K-30: Weather-resistant warrior by Pocket-lint *Pentax K-30 review by Imaging Resource *Pentax K-30 Review: Tough Body, Sensitive Soul by Gizmdo *Pentax K-30 review by CNET Australia *Pentax K-30 review by ITProPortal.com K-30 Category:Live-preview digital cameras Category:Cameras introduced in 2012 Category:Pentax K-mount cameras ","title":"Pentax K-30"},{"id":"35915001","text":"Gymnopsyra is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

From a practical point of view, Classora is a digital repository that stores structured information and allows it to be displayed in multiple formats: analytically, graphically, geographically (through maps); as well as carry out OLAP analysis. The information contained in Classora comes from public sourcesInterview in R Technological Magazine (Spanish) and is uploaded into the system through bots and ETL processes. The Knowledge Base has a commercial APIClassora API in Official Weblog for semantic enhancement, and an open web through which any user can access to part of the information collected (it also allows users to complete data and share opinions). Internally, Classora is organized into Knowledge Units and Reports. A «Knowledge Unit» is any element of the World about which information may be stored and presented in the form of a data sheet (a person, a company, a country, etc.) A «Report» is a group of Knowledge Units: a ranking of companies, a sport classification table, a survey about people, etc. In fact, one of the technical capabilities of Classora is that it allows the comparison of reports and knowledge units gathered from different sources, thereby generating an added value for the media in which this information is published: digital media, interactive TV, etc. == Key definitions ==  Knowledge unit  The units of knowledge (also known as entries) in Classora are data sheets that have a certain semantic equivalence with the articles on the Wikipedia: they store information about any element of the world, be it a film, a country, a company or an animal. However, they differ from Wikipedia in that Classora stores structured information, enriched with a metadata layer; and therefore it is able to automatically interpret the meaning of each unit of knowledge.  Data report  A report is a group of units of knowledge in which the repetition of elements is not allowed. This definition includes any list, poll, ranking, etc.; and, in general, any consultation that involves more than one unit of knowledge. Classora excels at the reports management due to its visualization capabilities, being able to display data in the form of tables, graphs and maps. Types of reports: * Sports scores: Sports competitions results sanctioned by the competent institution. * Rankings and lists: All types of interesting and curious lists, whether they have an implicit order or not. * Polls: Units of knowledge that are ranked according to users’ votes. * Queries to the Knowledge Base: Questions from users using CQL. * Networks of connections: automatically calculated from the reports and the taxonomy of each Knowledge Unit.  Organizational taxonomy  An organizational taxonomy (also referred to as entry type) is a data sheet that brings together the common attributes of a set of units of knowledge. For instance, the organizational taxonomy F1 Driver displays attributes such as date of debut, team, etc.; and the organizational taxonomy Football Club presents attributes such as city, stadium, etc. In Classora, taxonomies are hierarchically organized, so that they inherit attributes from their parent taxonomies. For instance, F1 Driver is a subsidiary taxonomy of Sportsperson, which is a subsidiary taxonomy of Person, which in turn is a subsidiary taxonomy of Organism. The simplest type of entry in Classora is Classora Object. All the other taxonomies are its subsidiaries and inherit its attributes. In fact, the only attribute Classora Object possesses is name (all units of knowledge are required to have one name at least). == Architecture of Classora ==  Data Extraction Module  The Data Extraction Module consists of a set of robots coordinated by software that also manages the potential incidents. Most of the information available in Classora is automatically uploaded through those robots, which connect to the main online public sources to gather all types of data. There are three categories of robots: * Extraction robots: responsible for the massive uploading of reports from official public sources (FIFA, CIA, IMF, Eurostat...). They are used for either absolute or incremental data uploading. * Data scanner robots: responsible for looking for and updating the data of a unit of knowledge. They use specific sources to perform this task: Wikipedia, IMDB, World Bank, etc. * Content aggregators: they don’t connect to external sources. Instead, they generate new information using Classora’s internal database.  Participatory Module  In Classora’s Open Website, Internet users may participate providing their knowledge as they would on the Wikipedia. There are different ways to participate: adding or correcting data in the Knowledge Base, voting in surveys (participatory rankings) and creating new Knowledge Units and Data Reports.  Connectivity Module  The Knowledge Base is designed to be embedded in multi-platform, multi-channel systems, thus enabling its integration into mobile devices, tablets, interactive TV, etc. This integration may be carried out through specific plugins (for navigators or other devices) or an API REST that provides content in XML or JSON formats. The API is divided into three blocks of operations. The first one is the block of general utility tools (ranging from autosuggest components about geographical hierarchies to operations to obtain the list of today’s celebrity birthdays, using CQL). The second one is the block of operations for widget generation (graphs, maps, rankings) using information from the knowledge base. Finally, there is a block of operations designed for the publication of free-source content.Post about API in Classora official weblog == Project statistics == As of April 2012, 2,000,000 Knowledge Units, 15,000 Reports, around 10,000 Maps and several million potential Comparative Analyses had been added to Classora. According to the site of web metrics Alexa, Classora Open Website is ranked at 100,557 globally and at 2,880 in the Spanish traffic ranking.Alexa metrics for Classora Open Web Users spend an average of 9 ½ minutes in Classora. == External links == * Open Website of Classora Knowledge Base == References == Category:Knowledge bases Category:Data management Category:Semantic Web Category:Knowledge representation software Category:Science and technology in Galicia (Spain) ","title":"Classora"},{"id":"35915043","text":"Nethersole is a surname.

She was also Duchess of Bourbon by marriage to Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. ==Life== Anne's mother died when she was around eleven years of age. Her father remarried two more times; she gained several half-siblings from her father's third marriage to Margaret of Sancerre. Duchess of Bourbon Anne was betrothed to her cousin Louis when she was ten years old. The marriage contract was signed at Montbrison on 4 July 1368 and the pair were married in person at Ardes in January 1370. Due to the fact that the couple were cousins, a papal dispensation was required; this was granted to them by the Pope on 15 September 1370. Countess of Forez On 15 May 1372, Anne's uncle, John Count of Forez, died leaving no children. Anne was his heir, as all of John's siblings had died including Anne's mother Jeanne and she had been the only one to leave a child, namely Anne. At the time of her accession, Anne was still only a minor (aged fourteen) so her grandmother, Joan of Clermont, acted as regent until Anne reached her majority, at which time she ruled together with Louis. Dauphine of Auvergne In 1400, Anne's father died and he left her the Dauphinate of Auvergne, which she ruled over for the next seventeen years. Anne also founded an anniversary for her stepmother Margaret La Mure (1675/1860), Tome III, Preuves, 114 bis, p. 145. Ten years after the death of her father, Anne was widowed; her husband, Louis, died in 1410 at Montlucon and their older son John succeeded him as duke. Anne ruled over her Dauphinate for another seven years, until her own death at Moulins on 22 September 1417. She was outlived by her son John and daughter Isabelle; her son inherited Forez and her grandson, Louis I, Count of Montpensier, eventually inherited the Dauphinate. ==Issue== # Catherine of Bourbon (b. 1378), d. young # John of Bourbon (1381-1434), Duke of Bourbon # Louis of Bourbon (1388 - 1404), Sieur de Beaujeu # Isabelle of Bourbon (1384 - aft. 1451), engaged to Eric of Pomerania but eventually became a nun. Of their four children, John and Isabelle reached adulthood; only John having had children of his own. ==References== * Dominique Laurent, « Anne Dauphine, duchesse de Bourbon, comtesse de Forez et dame de Beaujeu », in Forez et Bourbon.

Only certain specific individuals (most frequently in roles such as sales, customer service and field consulting) were designated as \\"customer-facing\\" personnel. Organizations further limited outside access to internal employees through filtering mechanisms such as publishing only a main switchboard number (whether routed through a live receptionist or an interactive voice response system) and generic \\"sales@\\" or \\"info@\\" email addresses. The Cluetrain Manifesto (written by Rick Levine, Christopher Locke, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger and published in 1999) was among the first books to predict the demise of this old order and the emergence of more open business models, though most of the business world was slow to adoptCass, John.

Thirteen years later, authors Dion Hinchcliffe and Peter Kim added structural underpinnings to the cultural shifts outlined in The Cluetrain Manifesto in their book, Social Business by Design.

The focus will be on answering questions and providing information rather than overt sales or promotion. * Presence – these conversations may originate on the company's website or elsewhere online (e.g., publication websites, industry portals, or social networking sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook). * Intelligent – organizations will use in-depth analytics to monitor connections, social interactions and presence; measure corresponding business results; and continually adjust and improve practices for increased effectiveness. == Technical and functional requirements == While much of the change inherent in adopting the social business model is cultural, it also requires process changes enabled by social business technology.

Three days after Medine started the website in 2010, it was featured in Refinery29. Within days, she was also featured in the fashion websites Style.com, Gawker, The Cut, and Fashionista. In 2012, Medine was featured in Forbess \\"Top 30 Under 30\\" as one of the year's \\"most influential trendsetters,\\" while Man Repeller was recognized in TIME's \\"25 Best Blogs of 2012\\", and received \\"Best Overall Blog\\" at the 2012 Bloglovin' Awards.Bloglovin' Awards Medine released her first book, an essay collection and memoir titled Man Repeller: Seeking Love, Finding Overalls, in 2013. ==Early life and education== Medine was born on December 20, 1988 in Manhattan. Her father Mois Medine is of Turkish-Jewish descent, and her mother Lyora \\"Laura\\" Medine is of Iranian-Jewish descent. She grew up in an Orthodox Jewish household. Medine attended the Ramaz School in Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the New School's Eugene Lang College in May 2011. ==Career== Early career Medine's first foray into online writing began in 2009, while a student at the New School. After studying abroad in Paris, Medine started a blog called Four Months in Paris using the hosting service Blogger. She later renamed it to Boogers and Bagels (stylized as Boogers + Bagels). The blog primarily covered fashion trends, humor, personal stories, and feminist issues. Its final post was published on April 19, 2010, shortly after the launch of Medine's second, and better known, blog, the Man Repeller. Man Repeller Medine started the Man Repeller blog in May 2010 as a hobby. The idea for the blog came during a trip to Topshop with friend Rachel Strugatz, now an online editor at Women's Wear Daily. Medine recalled, \\"We were laughing at how everything was so man-repelling: acid- washed harem pants and enormous shoulder pads, and I just said, 'That's it! That's the blog.'\\" A few days after it launched, the blog was featured on the fashion website Refinery29. It became popular enough that Medine began collaborating with major magazines like Lucky and Harper's Bazaar. The blog became so commercially successful through a combination of traditional advertising, sponsored blog posts, appearance fees, and designer collaborations that Medine decided to work on the blog full-time after graduation. In its early years, the blog solely consisted of Medine. Now, there are now 14 employees that edit, write, and promote the website. The blog also covers current events, lifestyle, and feminism. In September 2013 Grand Central Publishing published her book Man Repeller: Seeking Love. Finding Overalls. Medine has collaborated with designers on limited collections of clothes and accessories, including Gryphon, shoe companies Del Toro and Superga, jewelry line Dannijo, and clothing line PJK. Additional brand collaborations include Michael Kors, Maje, BaubleBar, Stuart Weitzman, and Saks Fifth Avenue.http://www.businessoffashion.com/2012/07/the-business-of- blogging-the-man-repeller.html Business of Fashion: The Business of Blogging  The Man Repeller In 2012 Medine signed with the Creative Artists Agency, an entertainment talent agency headquartered in Los Angeles, California. In 2016 Medine launched MR by Man Repeller, a line of loafers, flats, metallic booties, and heels exclusive to Net-a-Porter which embodied her not too serious and irreverent style. MR by Man Repeller was followed by Medine's eponymous shoe brand Leandra Medine, which is sold at Barneys NY, Harvey Nichols, and The Webster. Medine announced in June 2020 that she would “step back” her involvement in Man Repeller after allegations emerged that she had failed former staffers of colour. In September 2020, the site was rebranded to Repeller and Medine is still listed as the founder on the contributor page. ==Personal life== In December 2011 Medine announced her engagement to Abie J. Cohen, a financial advisor at the Swiss investment bank UBS, whom she had met when she was 17 years old.http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/10/the-15-most-cringe- worthy-bits-from-man-repeller-seeking-love-finding-overalls.html Following the announcement, many responded negatively, questioning her commitment to the principles of “man repelling” outlined in her blog.

Konami published the game for its Japanese release. It was also released for PC systems in 1999 and for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. A variant of the game for the Game Boy Color was developed by Digital Eclipse and released in 1999. ==Plot== The player takes control of the eponymous Tarzan, an orphan child who was adopted and raised by gorillas. At the beginning of the game Tarzan is still a young kid who has to learn different skills from the gorillas such as climbing trees, swinging down branches or fighting small but aggressive wild animals. He eventually grows up to be a strong and skilled man who must defend himself and his fellow animal brothers' home, the jungle, from hunters led by the evil Clayton. ==Gameplay== Disney’s Tarzan is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer, with gameplay taking place on a two-dimensional plane but featuring three- dimensional models and environments. The player controls the eponymous character of Tarzan, both as a child and as an adult, though 14 different levels. Along with running and jumping through levels, Tarzan is able to slam the ground in order to break open certain objects, as well as revealing hidden items and secret areas. Tarzan's main method of attacking enemies is by throwing assorted fruits, which can be thrown both overhand and underhand for varying throwing distances and come in 4 different levels of power marked by their colors. A knife can also be found in certain levels and used as a close- combat weapon, and certain other weapons, such as a spear and a parasol, are exclusively used in specific levels. Tarzan's health status is represented by a life bar that depletes as he is harmed by enemies and other hazards. The health bar can be refilled by collecting bananas, which are hidden in banana trees and other areas throughout levels. Levels feature several different collectible items, such as coins that earn the player an extra life when 100 of them are collected, and four pieces of a pencil sketch which are hidden throughout the level and unlock a bonus level when collected. Scenes from the game's respective film can be unlocked by locating 6 letters (T-A-R-Z-A-N) in each level. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. In the easy and medium difficulties, little Tarzan gets tips from his friend Terk. Tarzan's enemies are monkeys, baboons, eagles, and different animals such as snakes and bushpigs, and some humans such as Clayton. ==Development== The Game Boy Color version of Disney's Tarzan was developed by Digital Eclipse, who had previously developed several ports of older games including Klax, Joust and Paperboy. It was Digital Eclipse's first completely original video game which they had developed and designed from scratch, as their previous efforts had all been ports of other games. The game's development team was given 3 months to develop the game, and consisted of two programmers, ten artists and three level designers. According to the game's technical director, Mike Mika, the initial design concept for the game was “quite ambitious,” with several gameplay mechanics needing to be nixed due to time constraints. According to Mika, the team wanted to include gameplay objectives which were given to the player by talking to and interacting with non-playable characters, and had concepts for several mechanics which went unincorporated, such as levels which involved riding on top of birds and levels that featured Tantor the elephant as a playable character. ==Reception== Disney's Tarzan received positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising the game's graphics and its faithfulness towards the film's story.http://ew.com/article/2015/04/07/goofy-movie-anniversary-songs/ Rick Sanchez reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Tarzan is a solid, if uninspired, title that gets by mostly on its looks. Serious gamers won't find much of value, but it might appeal to the kiddie set flocking to the film.\\" The PlayStation version of Disney's Tarzan received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Rick Sanchez reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Disney Interactive borrowed the best platform gaming tricks and put them together in one package. While there's nothing new or original in Disney's Tarzan, it is still a decent game.\\" ==References== Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Windows games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Video games set in Africa Tarzan Category:1999 video games Category:2000 video games Category:Platform games Category:3D platform games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Eurocom games Category:Activision games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Konami games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Disney's Tarzan (video game)"},{"id":"35915319","text":"Fight of the Tertia () is a 1952 West German family film directed by Erik Ode and starring Brigitte Rau, Wolfgang Jansen and Horst Köppen.

As a girl she babysat U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin’s children. Her mother worked as a teacher. Bustos graduated from Springfield High School in 1979. She attended Illinois College, then transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park, from which she received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1983. She went on to receive a master's degree in journalism from the University of Illinois, Springfield in 1985. In 1985 she moved to the Quad Cities to work as a night-shift police reporter for the Quad-City Times. Bustos worked there for seventeen years, first as a reporter, and then as an editor.

She has been criticized for voting for a $624,000 project to improve 10th Street in East Moline, which runs adjacent to Bustos's house; the Schilling campaign dubbed it the \\"Bustos Parkway.\\" Schilling's claim was called \\"reckless, irresponsible fiction\\" by the editorial board of the Quad- City Times. After being elected to a second term in May 2011, Bustos resigned in September 2011 to focus on her run for Congress. Committee assignments *East Moline Downtown Revitalization Committee (Founded and Chaired) == U.S. House of Representatives == 2012 election The Bustos campaign publicly stated it received the endorsement of about two dozen unions active in the 17th Congressional district, including the Illinois AFL-CIO, AFSCME and the United Auto Workers. During the primary, Bustos received the endorsement of U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. Durbin asked state Senator Dave Koehler and George Gaulrapp to drop out of the race to clear the way for Bustos, who is a close family friend of Durbin. Gaulrapp reported that during a meeting with Durbin about withdrawing, Durbin said that Bustos had babysat for his family and was a close friend. Bustos won the Democratic primary on March 20, 2012, defeating Freeport Mayor George Gaulrapp and businessman Greg Aguilar 54%–26%-20%.

Bustos was endorsed by the Quad-City Times for the general election. In November, she defeated incumbent Republican Bobby Schilling 53%–47%. She'd received a significant boost from redistricting, which replaced Quincy, Decatur and the district's portion of Springfield with the more Democratic portions of Peoria and Rockford. She is the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Peoria since 1927, and only the second Democrat since the 1850s to represent a significant portion of Rockford. After entering the House, Bustos made national headlines by \\"interviewing colleagues and posting the short videos on her Snapchat account.\\" 2014 election Bustos was challenged by Schilling for re-election in 2014. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune editorial board in 2012, Bustos expressed her support for legislation which would cut congressional pay by 10 percent. When asked by a member of the editorial board if she would voluntarily give up 10 percent of her pay should the legislation fail, Bustos said that she would. During the campaign in 2014, she stated: \\"When I was in Chicago, I said something that I shouldn't have said, but I never said it on the campaign trail. I never made it as a promise to the people in the 17th congressional district.\\" The Chicago Tribune endorsed Schilling for the general election.(October 14, 2014) – \\"Schilling Among Tribune Endorsements for Congress\\".

Calling her \\"one of the party's rising stars,\\" Politico quoted her as saying, \\"I'm a little bit of a different kind of Democrat.\\" 2018 election For the 2018 election, Bustos was challenged by Bill Fawell, a real estate broker who has attracted media attention for his conspiracy claims that the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks were an inside job perpetrated by the United States Government. Bustos was re-elected with 61.9% of the final vote tally over Fawell's 38.1%.

Waste reduction Bustos' first sponsored legislation would create a congressional government waste reduction board. Jobs In a July 2012 article, Bustos wrote that she was running for Congress in order to create good-paying jobs for middle-class Americans, including many \\"whose jobs are being shipped to China.\\" Bustos wants to create a \\"manufacturing triangle\\" connecting Peoria, the Quad Cities, and Rockford and anchored by Caterpillar, John Deere, and the aerospace industry, respectively. She supports putting in place job-training programs at area community colleges to better prepare workers for skilled jobs in manufacturing. In July 2017, Bustos and two House colleagues charged in a CNN op-ed that thanks to Republicans, \\"the economy isn't working the way it should,\\" and promised that their own economic plan would create \\"millions of good-paying, full-time jobs\\" and \\"build an economy that puts Americans first.\\" Defense In March 2012 she called for cuts in defense spending. Health care Bustos strongly supports the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare). In October 2012, her congressional campaign website said, \\"The new reform law is not perfect, but makes real improvements in our health care system. It lowers costs for small businesses and makes sure you have coverage that cannot be taken away. It stops insurance companies from denying coverage of preexisting conditions and allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance for longer.\\" Bustos, a Catholic, supports legalized abortion.Cheri Bustos on Abortion — OnTheIssues.org She also supported President Barack Obama's order that all health plans cover birth control and \\"morning after\\" pills. Taxes Bustos opposed a full extension of the Bush tax cuts. Congressional pay cut Bustos supports a 10% pay cut for members of Congress with no further pay raises until the federal budget is balanced. She has been critical of Republicans' approach to balancing the budget and reducing taxes. Bustos favors reducing waste and fraud, ending \\"tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas,\\" and ending \\"corporate handouts.\\" She does not support lowering salaries or pensions for federal government employees. Undocumented immigrants Bustos supports the DREAM Act. Trade During a debate, Bustos opposed the three trade agreements approved by Congress in 2011 as \\"NAFTA-style\\" and said they would result in job losses for Illinois. Education Bustos wants to change No Child Left Behind to offer more assistance for teachers while de- emphasizing \\"teaching to the test,\\" expand Head Start, reform student loans to address rising tuition costs, \\"protect and expand college scholarships like Pell Grants\\" and \\"improve vocational and job training opportunities for children who decide not to attend college.\\" Sexual assault Responding in 2016 to People v. Turner, Bustos claimed that there is a need for more women in Congress in order to bring greater attention to the issue of sexual assault. Minimum wage laws Bustos in 2016 sponsored legislation exempting minor league baseball players from minimum wage laws.[.https://apnews.com/cb183f59e88948e8b9cd49ad07bde807] Iran In August 2015, Bustos announced her support for President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal. \\"While the agreement is not perfect, it is the right step for our national security and the security of the global community,\\" she said. \\"With this agreement, Iran's stockpiles of enriched uranium will be reduced and the country will be opened up to strict transparency and monitoring, including robust on-the-ground nuclear inspectors.\\" Cuba In October 2015, Bustos went to Cuba on a trip organized by the Illinois Cuba Working Group. In January 2016, she backed a bill to remove barriers to trade with Cuba. In March 2016, Bustos was part of the Congressional delegation that took part in Obama's trip to Cuba and said that Cuba represented a \\"huge trade opportunity\\" for the US \\"when it comes to agriculture.\\" Women In February 2018, Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan announced that a group of three legislators, including Bustos, would serve on an independently funded panel that would \\"lead a statewide discussion about the role of women in the Democratic party and how to 'change the culture of politics.'\\" In April, however, she withdrew from the panel, citing criticism by the House Ethics Committee and legal advisers. Donald Trump In a December 2016 interview, Bustos said she would \\"make every attempt to work with President Donald Trump where we can find common ground\\" but \\"if he takes us down a dark place, then we're going to have a fight on our hands.\\" During an April 2017 interview, however, she \\"verbally thrashed President Trump.\\" In the same month she said that his first 100 days in office had been \\"a disaster\\" and that his health care plan would rip out \\"the beating heart of rural America.\\" Politico described her as \\"practically...taunting Trump.\\" She said that if she were president, \\"in my first 100 days, I'd want to have a lot of wins—and, you know, I wouldn't want to have wins that I have to lie about.\\" In June 2017, Bustos argued that her party's \\"anti-Trump\\" message was not a winning electoral formula. In December 2017, Bustos signed a letter asking for a House investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct made against Trump. ==Electoral historyPersonal life== She met and married Gerry Bustos, a Quad Cities local, not long after moving to the Quad Cities.

The street is 730 metres long, and is the main street of the northern and eastern areas of the Glushets suburb of Lutsk. There have been at least ten churches and monasteries located on the street. The street began to develop with more intensity during the eighteenth century when the city began to extend along the street's path. It became the main street in the city in the early 19th century. In the 1980s, it became a pedestrian-only street. The street was renamed to Lesya Ukrainka in the 1990s. Lesya Ukrainska has many architectural landmarks and has become an important trade artery of the city. ==History== The street was formed in the 12th century due to the presence of Saint Mary Monastery granted by Mstislav I of Kiev. Running over hills, it was separated by the river Glushets from the island containing the central city. The Prince of Volhyn, Vasilko Romanovich, founded the monastery of Saint Basil on a neighboring hill in the 13th century. These hills were known as Pomostychi and were surrounded by strong defensive constructions. The terrain of these hills was advantageous for both economical and defensive purposes making it a suitable place to build churches and monasteries. In the 15th century, it is likely that many churches were built along the main road. By the 16th century, there were eight churches and monasteries. The Bernardine monastery was built nearby. Post card - Jagiellon street The street began to develop rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. It became very important and prestigious because it was a part of the Kiev-Brest highway that crossed through the city in the 1860s. The street was paved with cobblestones at that time and, although it was renamed to Highway street, it kept many of the same public institutions. The North side of the street was dominated by the imposing presence of the circus and amusement rides. The first public city park was created near Trinitarian monastery in the 1870s. There were 2 electric theatres opposite the park - Modern and Renaissance. At the end of the 19th century, there was progress in improving the street's architectural coherence. Many buildings were built in a brick nonplastering style characterized by a special kind of decoration using colored, figured bricks, usually yellow and red. The Cornices of every building, crowded by attics, had original ornaments and facades were decorated by alabaster relief ornaments and forged details such as balcony grating, flowerpots, shelters, fences, railings etc. In 1894 the Lutsk Orthodox Fellowship granted the construction of the Iverian chapel near the street. A Granite-bronze statue of Alexander III of Russia was built behind the church. At that time, the wealthy Jewish Kronshtein family constructed several buildings with magnificent architecture in Italian Renaissance and Russian styles. The street had become a kind of open-air museum representing modern, eclectic, brick-style buildings. Post card from 1920s - Jagiellon street. In 1920–1939, when the town was part of Poland, the street was called Jagiellon street. Half of the buildings on the street were destroyed following the invasion of Poland. After World War II, it was renamed Soviet street. Smaller shops joined together and building façades were reconstructed to make big shop windows. The street changed shape again during post-war reconstruction. Poor planning controls in the 1970s and 1980s had a negative impact on the vitality and presentation of Soviet street. Inappropriate reconstruction and design of the new buildings led to the demolition of historic properties. Brick-style façades were plastered over and many architectural details were destroyed in spite of their landmark status. The street was renamed to Lesya Ukrainka in the 1990s. ==Current status== Currently, Lesya Ukrainka street is the central pedestrian street running from the square Fellowship Bridge to Central Theatre square and is one of the city's most crowded streets. The street's architecture is generally rooted in the 19th - first half of the 20th century, though Soviet-era buildings do remain. Landmark buildings on Lesya Ukrainka Street include numbers 2, 5, 13, 32, 53 and 61. There are many shops and restaurants on the street. There are also 2 garden squares on the street and the landmark Trinitarian monastery. ==Buildings== { class= ----- ! width=4%  Number ! width=26%  Description ! width=10%  Photo -----  align=\\"center\\" 2  align=\\"center\\" Kronshtein house, built in 1890–1894.

Continuous dialysis or hemofiltration have proven to be the most effective treatment. Nutritional support and sodium benzoate have also been used to treat THAN. ==Signs and symptoms== Hyperammonemia occurs when the body produces excess ammonia. This ammonia primarily exists as ammonium ion that has a concentration less than or around 35 μmol/L in normal referenced serum levels. Excess ammonia is processed in the liver through the urea cycle to produce urea. Excess ammonia can be produced by bacterial hydrolysis of intestinal compounds, purine nucleotide cycles, the transamination of amino acid in voluntary muscles, and other metabolic events of filtration organs(kidneys and liver). In THAN, symptoms of hyperammonemia are observed within 24 hours of birth, and the causation of hyperammonemia must exclude urea cycle disorders. If the amount of ammonia entering the brain is increased, neurological disorders such as urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, Reye syndrome, seizures, and encephalopathies may occur. The most common indicator of THAN is respiratory distress syndrome. In newborns with THAN, the primary cause is thought to be genetic, but it has not been narrowed down to one gene or locus so the exact cause remains unknown. Observable CNS depression, comatose, metabolic acidosis, feeding difficulties, cyanosis, abnormal EEG, increased intraventricular hemorrhage, hypotonia, and irratibility are common symptoms of THAN. Individuals that develop hyperammonemia after birth are more likely to have hyperammonemia as a result in urea cycle enzyme deficiency (UCED). ==Pathophysiology== The pathophysiology for this disorder is mostly unknown but there have been a few propositions for its origin. One study suggested that a transient platelet activation of the infant's portal system is responsible for this hyperammonemia. Another study proposed that this occurs due to a shunting of blood away from the portal system of the liver through the ductus venosus directly into the systemic circulation. This causes the blood to skip the step of ammonia removal in the liver. ==Diagnosis== Since the etiology is unconfirmed, diagnosis is generally accomplished when there is hyperammonemia present within 24–36 hours of birth and urea cycle defects can be excluded. Organic acidemias and other metabolic errors must also be excluded. The diagnostic criteria for hyperammonemia is ammonia blood levels higher than 35 μmol/L. This is accomplished by observing urine ketones, organic acids, enzyme levels and activities, and plasma and urine amino acids. Mild Transient Hyperammonemia is diagnosed when ammonia levels are between 40-50 μM, lasts for about 6–8 weeks, and has no related neurological problems. Severe Transient Hyperammonemia is diagnosed when ammonia levels are above 50 μM up to as much as 4000 μM. Severe Transient Hyperammonemia causes neurological problems as ammonia levels in the brain are too high, which can cause infant hyptotonia as well as neonatal seizures. Severe Transient Hyperammonemia can also cause respiratory distress syndrome. Chest x-rays may resemble hyaline membrane disease. Differentiating between UCED and THAN A study was done by Hudak to find the differences between transient hyperammonemia of the newborn (THAN) and urea cycle enzyme deficiency(UCED) on 33 THAN victims and 13 UCED victims. Some of the clinical findings were not able to be measured in the THAN patients due to lack of equipment or lack of reported information in these 33 cases, so the numbers shown represent the number of positive clinical findings/out of the number cases in which the symptom could be observed or was documented. The results were as follows: Respiratory distress occurred in 22/23 of THAN patients and only in 0/13 of UCED patients. Abnormal chest radiographs were found in 23/25 THAN victims, and 0/9 in UCED patients. The gestational age was less than 36 weeks in 25/31 THAN patients, but only 1/13 UCED patients. The birthweight was less than 2.5 kg in 27/31 THAN patients and in 2/12 UCED patients. A coma that lasted 48 hours or longer occurred in 12/17 THAN patients but only occurred in 1/12 UCED patients. Free ammonia (NH4+) levels greater than 1500 μM occurred in 17/29 THAN patients but only 1/13 UCED patients. ==Treatment== Although the etiology is unconfirmed, transient hyperammonemia is known to be caused by increased levels of ammonia in the blood stream, as well as a failure of the urea cycle to convert enough of the ammonia into urea. Since transamination of proteins is a leading producer of ammonia, protein restriction may be recommended as a therapy to reduce the symptoms of the episode. THAN can also be treated by avoiding amino acids in TPN or total parenteral nutrition or by giving a high caloric diet to limit catabolism of the tissues and therefore to minimize the breakdown of endogenous protein. The most common treatments are dialysis (both peritoneal and hemodialysis), sodium benzoate, and arginine. Sodium Benzoate combines with glycine to be excreted in the form of hippuric acid. The goal of these treatments is to convert nitrogen to a compound that can be excreted more easily. ==Prognosis== The mortality rate for THAN is relatively high unless immediate treatment is obtained. The duration of hyperammonemia is directly correlated to morbidity as well as the associated neurological conditions. After the first hyperammonemic episode, there is no increased risk for future hyperammonemic episodes, and normal protein consumption can be continued. ==Epidemiology== Although this data may be underestimated as a result of misdiagnosis and failure to report illnesses in fatal cases, the current estimates are fairly representative of neonates with hyperammonemia. The United States has an estimated frequency of UCED of 1 per 25,000 live births. The international prevalence is between an estimated 1:8,000-1:44,000, varying widely by location. In order for THAN to be diagnosed, urea cycle deficiencies must be excluded, and the diagnosis must be made within 24–36 hours of birth. In 1996, one study said that there were only a confirmed 33 cases of THAN worldwide in literature. This study also admitted that at first they did not consider the possibility that the infant did not have a urea cycle deficiency. The hospital that this case occurred in did not have equipment to measure urea cycle enzymes, so they confirmed the diagnosis post mortem with an autopsy. Therefore, it is important to consider that many infants diagnosed with regular hyperammonemia, may have actually had THAN, but the urea cycle deficiency was not excluded and therefore did not meet the criteria for diagnosis.Ballard RA, Vinocur B, Reyocur B, Reynolds JW et al.

He received the 1992 German Crime Fiction Prize for One Man, One Murder.Ziegler Visiting Speaker Series Presents Jakob Arjouni . University of British Columbia. == Life == Jakob Arjouni was born in Frankfurt am Main. He ended his university studies and published his first novel Happy Birthday, Türke! (1985) at the age of 20. This was the first in his Kayankaya series of crime novels, featuring private detective Kemal Kayankaya, and set in Frankfurt am Main where Arjouni resided. The series brought him recognition both in Germany and abroad: the books were translated into 10 different languages. In 1987, he received the Baden-Württembergischen Autorenpreis für das deutschsprachige Jugendtheater for his play Nazim schiebt ab. In 1992, he received the German Crime Fiction Prize for One Man, One Murder. He died, aged 48, in Berlin, after a long fight against pancreatic cancer. == Themes of his works== Arjouni's works are usually about contemporary problems, and he writes about the environment he is familiar with. Although Kayankaya was adopted and brought up by a German family, he subjected to racism due his ethnic Turkish appearance, and the others made fun of him. Kismet, another detective novel about Kayankaya, is about the Yugoslav civil war. In his works Magic Hoffmann, Hausaufgaben and Edelsmanns Tochter, he talks about the rising nationalism, historical revisionism and anti-Semitism in the reunified Germany. His novel Chez Max takes place in Paris in the year 2064. In this novel, he writes on the future of the society, which would be closely monitored to enhance security as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. One can easily relate Chez Max with the scenes in George Orwell's novel 1984. In one of his last novels, Der heilige Eddy (2009), Arjouni departed from his previously serious themes and wrote a lightweight contemporary picaresque. Peter Henning, a critic from the German newspaper Die Zeit, commented that it is a \\"German screwball prose with 246 floating slightly staged pages\\". His thriller novel Cherryman jagt Mr. White (2011) has an 18-year-old protagonist in rural Brandenburg who has to face brutal violence by young Nazis of his own village. To overcome his subdued feelings, he turns them into the cartoon adventures of hero \\"Cherryman\\" and gangster \\"Mr. White\\". == References  External links == * * Biography * WorldCat * Author page, UK publisher (No Exit Press) Category:1964 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Writers from Frankfurt Category:German crime fiction writers Category:German science fiction writers Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:German male novelists Category:20th-century German novelists Category:20th-century German male writers ","title":"Jakob Arjouni"},{"id":"35915462","text":"Pseudomallocera auriflua is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Pseudomallocera.Bezark, Larry G.

It was sold in kit form but only a few were completed. ==Design and development== The Holiday is wood framed and fabric covered throughout. Its high wing, built around two spars, has constant chord and rounded tips. It is braced to the lower fuselage longerons with two V-form pairs of struts, assisted by jury struts. The tail unit is braced, with the tailplane set at mid-fuselage height. The fin is straight edged, the rudder generous, rounded and fitted with a trim tab. The rectangular cross-section fuselage is deep behind the cabin, its upper surface at wing height. The cabin is under the wing with the windscreen at the leading edge and its glazing extending rearwards beyond the trailing edge. Access is via trapezoidal side doors. The conventional fixed undercarriage has mainwheels with low pressure tyes on faired V-struts and half axles hinged on an underside cabane. The main unit is rubber sprung; the tail skid is spring steel. Some Holidays have had wheel fairings, others not. The prototype Holiday first flew powered by a 56 kW (75 hp) Régnier 4D.2 four cylinder inverted inline air-cooled piston engine, but there was a wide range of suitable engines, both inline and flat fours, in the power range 44-63 kW (59-85 hp). The second prototype, for example, had a 48 kW (65 hp) Continental A 65 flat four. Though the inline Régnier engine was fully cowled, some of the flat fours have had exposed cylinder heads. ==Operational history== At least seven Holidays have appeared on the French civil register. In 2010 four remained; one French-built Holiday is now (2012) on the UK register. Some of those currently registered may not be active. Several of the Holidays first flew around 1950 but at least one was not completed until 1998. In France, the type was usually referred to as the AS.80 Lavadoux. ==Specifications (Régnier engine) References== Category:1940s French sport aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:High-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1947 ","title":"Starck AS-80 Holiday"},{"id":"35915531","text":"Arviz (, also Romanized as Ārvīz; also known as Ābrīz and Arbīz) is a village in Neh Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He was elected to a sixth term as sheriff in the nonpartisan blanket primary on October 12, 2019. ==Background== The son of Sheldon Perry Prator (1926–2001), Prator's paternal roots are in Cass County, in east Texas. His grandparents were Joseph Bell Prator (1893–1962) and the former Erne Ruth Simpson (1896–1990). He has a brother, David Perry Prator of Kingwood, Texas. He is married to the former Carolyn Craig and has three children. He was born in Clarksville in Montgomery County in northern Tennessee. Prator received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Louisiana State University Shreveport. He also graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Executive Institute in Quantico, Virginia. He attended basic police academy at LSU in Baton Rouge. ==Career== In 1973, Prator became a Shreveport police officer. In 1990, Hazel Beard, the first Republican mayor of Shreveport since Reconstruction, named Prator chief of police, an appointive position. In 1999, he stepped down as police chief to run for sheriff, when the incumbent Don Hathaway did not seek a sixth four-year in office. Prator was elected to the first of his thus far four terms in that position. In that first campaign, Prator led with 37,739 votes (70.5 percent), compared to 13,858 (25.9 percent) for the Democrat Marshall W. Nelson, and 1,921 votes (3.6 percent) for the No- Party candidate, Robert N. Creamer. Creamer also ran against Prator in 2003.Adam Duvernay, \\"Prator's 10th anniversary\\", Shreveport Times, July 25, 2011 Prator's term began on July 1, 2000, when Don Hathaway retired after twenty years as sheriff. Upon taking office, Prator streamlined certain operations and saved $3 million in expenses. Prator introduced \\"community- oriented policing\\" and developed a network of volunteer programs. He opened the first centers to deal with juvenile truancy, including a temporary holding facility. He supported the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program in public schools, which Hathaway had first instituted in Shreveport. Prator established bicycle patrols, neighborhood watch teams, and a drug interdiction unit. He developed a work-release program for inmates at the Caddo Correctional Center. Prator is a member of the Louisiana Sheriff's Association, Cops for Christ, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. He was named in 2008, along with his then colleague, Larry Deen, former sheriff of Bossier Parish, to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Criminal Justice, a multi-agency program. Prator is active in the Louisiana State Fair Board, the LSUS Foundation, and the Norwela Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Prator was instrumental in the establishment of \\"Safety Town\\" located between Walker Road and Jewella Avenue near the South Park Summer Grove Baptist Church. \\"Safety Town\\" teaches children how to avoid danger and how to protect their own safety. Bob Griffin of KTBS-TV and KEEL (AM) has worked with Prator to promote the project. In 2014, Prator launched a program to train children between eight and twelve years of age in gun safety. The course is taught at a gun safety camp sponsored by the sheriff's department. In the election held on October 22, 2011, Prator defeated the Democratic candidate, Craig Smith, 37,799 (78.7 percent) to 10,216 (21.3 percent). Robert Creamer did not file for the position though he had indicated that he had planned to do so. On July 1, 2014, Prator took on the role of director of the Caddo Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, a state agency responsible for disaster and emergency preparedness and response efforts. Previously Caddo and Bossier parishes had operated a mutual Homeland Security office, but Bossier Parish elected to establish its own facility. The sheriff's office will fund the Homeland Security office for Caddo Parish. Prator won a fifth term as sheriff in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. He defeated the Democrat Eric Hatfield, 37,112 votes (73.2 percent) to 13,561 (26.8 percent). Prator drew criticism for holding a press conference on October 5, 2017 in which he complained that new legislation aimed at reducing the prison population would harm his office's bottom line by causing the system to lose \\"the ones you can work\\". One of the critics of the sheriff's comments was ACLU of Louisiana Executive Director Marjorie Esman, who said in a release, \\"Jails are not supposed to incarcerate people just because they need work done - that is slavery\\". ==References * Profile at SourceWatch Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Louisiana sheriffs Category:American police chiefs Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:People from Clarksville, Tennessee Category:People from Shreveport, Louisiana Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:People associated with the Boy Scouts of America ","title":"Steve Prator"},{"id":"35915572","text":"Tropimerus is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

There are many saints and philosophers with the same name in Puranas. ==Life== Jaabaali spent many years meditating on the banks of the Narmada River. The cave and marble rocks in this area were sometimes used as shelters. Jaabaali lived and practiced tapas in the sacred location of Tirumala, a place known today as \\"Jabali Theertham\\", near Tirupati. People now visit this place to solve serious Graha Doshas and worship the Gods Hanuman and Vigneswara. ==Jabalis in history== Jabali of the Valmiki Ramayana The Ramayana of Valmiki was altered later to depict Jabali as a Charvaka Nastik or a Buddhist, however both Charvaka and the Gautama Buddha had come generations or centuries after Rama, as Rama is claimed in Buddhist scriptures as a past incarnation of the Gautama Buddha. In the altered Ramayana, Rama strongly opposes and targets atheists as seen in Ayodhya Kanda of Ramayana, which reads, \\"atheists (nastikavadins) are fools who think they to be wise and who are experts in leading people to doom and ruin.\\" Dasharatha’s council of priest-ministers headed by a religious authority, Sage Vasishtha, included sage Jabali, a materialist and atheist. Charvaka philosophy of atheism and materialism was widely discussed within Hinduism. Rama strongly condemns atheism, but Dasharatha’s council of ministers included Jabali, who is a proclaimed Naastik. Bauddhavatara was accepted during the period. Hence, followers of atheism enjoyed the same privileges as the religious followers. The Indian Government recognizes Buddhism, which is considered Nastic by Hindu Orthodoxy and enjoys the privileges of secularism and religious tolerance provisions under the law. In Ramayana after performing last rites to Dasharatha, Bharata proceeds to the forest where Rama lives and begs him repeatedly to come back to Ayodhya and assume the responsibilities of a king, though it would call for breaking his promise given to his father to take care of the welfare of the citizens of Ayodhya, which is a priority for him. He finds strong support from Jaabaali, one of the members of Dasharatha's council of priests. Jaabaali, with his Naastikavaada (Atheistic arguments), tries to convince Rama that it would be fitting and proper within the framework of Kshatriya Dharma to do so. Rama became quite upset by his distorted arguments and wrong council. His outburst is as follows. > I denounce the action of my father who picked up (as his consular priest) > you (Jaabaali), a staunch unbeliever, who has not only stayed away from the > path of righteousness but also whose mind is set on wrong path (opposed to > the dharmic Vedic path), (nay) who is moving about (in the world) with such > an ideology (conforming to the doctrine of Chaarvaaka, who believes only in > the world of sensual pleasures) as has been set forth in your foregoing > speech. > It is well known fact that a follower of Buddha (condemning the Vedas) > deserves to be punished precisely in the same way as a thief (inasmuch as > heretic robs people of their faith); and know an unbeliever (a follower of > Chaarvaaka philosophy) to be on par with Buddha. Therefore (amongst such > unbelievers) he who is most tamable should undoubtedly be so punished in the > interest of the people; for no other cause should a wise man (even) stand > face to face with an unbeliever (but should shun him). = Mentions in Balakanda = Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, \\"Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly...\\" [1-12-4, 5] Book I : Bala Kanda - Book Of Youthful Majesties, Chapter [Sarga] 12 Jabali of the Jabali Upanishad In the Jabali Upanishad, Jabali tells the Pasupata philosophy about Jiva (\\"pasu\\") and Tsa (Pasupati). Jabali wrote \\"Jabala Upanishad\\" \\", and the story of Satyakama Jabali from Samaveda- Chandogyopanishad. It explains the true form of “maatru” devata, the duties a woman has to perform before she takes up the seat of “maatru” devata. It involves the relationship between the three forms or bodies of mother and child (gross, subtle and causal). It covers the true form of satya and how satya is the first step for attaining “Brahma Vidya”. It also covers the true form of “gotra”. This is an excerpt of Jabali literature explaining one of the duties a woman has to perform before she takes up the seat of \\"maatru\\" devata: > Jaabali lived in a small shack of sticks and straws - a menage of crocks and > clay-pot, where one earned out of hands and ate out of bracts. She threw a > few twigs of firewood under the three stones and blew hard on them to kindle > the fire. Then, she put a pail of water on the stove for heating. Those > blasted twigs - they would burn, and go out quickly, belching smoke. The > smoke would rise and spread everywhere. It would reach her eyes, and hurt > them. So, she sat near the stove, she reflected. She had to keep on putting > in the twigs of sorrow, just to keep alive. Only then could she expect a > little warmth of happiness, and a flame of hope to rise. At times, sorrows > and anguish wouldn't budge off from her neck, like the wet twigs - no matter > how hard she blew upon them, the fire would fail to rise. It brought a > dizziness to her mind, and tears to her eyes. The whole future seemed to > plunge into darkness. Jabali of Nellitirtham (Sri Somanatheshwara Cave Temple) Jabali Maharshi Brindavana was recently constructed at Sri Somanatheshwara Cave temple, Nellitheertha, Karnataka. The Nellitheertha Somanatheshwara Cave temple is a holy temple in South Kanara. The main deity of the temple is Sri Somanatheshwara (Shiva), but it also honors Ganapati and Jabali Maharshi himself. In typical Tulu-nadu tradition, the temple also has its set of “Bhootas“. Bhootas are considered as the “Ganas” or warrior-assistants of the demigods. The main bhootas of the Nellitheertha temple are Pili-Chamundi (Pili means Tiger in Tulu), Kshetrapala, Raktheshwari and Doomavathy. Jabali of Venkatachala Hill, Tirumala The temple here in Jamalpuram, Telangana is known as Jabali Tirtha. It is here that a Jabali Rishi performed penance and worshiped Vishnu. There is also a Venkatachala Purana, which was compiled. At this pilgrimage centre, Vishnu today is worshiped as Lord Venkatachala. Jabali of Papavinasam Thirtham A Jabali had also meditated and performed penance here. Papavinasam Theertham is around 2 miles from Tirumala and is a beautiful waterfall. Like the Venkatachala Hill, at this pilgrimage centre, Vishnu today is worshiped as Lord Venkatachala. Hanuman is also worshiped here. Jabali of Jalore There was also a Jabali of Jalore, Rajasthan, of whom little is known. The city Jalore used to be known as Jabalipura. Jabali of Valad Jabali of this village in Gujarat had a daughter named Bala, who is said to have founded the village and after her it became known as \\"Balapuri\\", and eventually as \\"Balad\\" and \\"Valad\\". It was also said that bala eventually married Suryadev (sungod). There is a temple in valad devoted to Suryadev, Balamata, and the sun chariot. There is still an idol of Saint Jabali in the village.P. 416 Gujarat State Gazetteers: Gandhinagar By Gujarat (India) The Adhram of Madhavtirth is also situated here. ==References== Category:Vedic period ","title":"Jaabaali"},{"id":"35915582","text":"Nigel Traverso (born 18 November 1958) is an American field hockey player.

The program is jointly administered by the Canadian Wildlife Service (and its Bird Banding Office) and the United States Geological Survey. The program is responsible for many aspects of bird banding in the United States and Canada: it grants permits to bird banders, fills orders for bands of various sizes, collects data from banding stations, receives reports from people who have found birds carrying bands, and makes its database available to appropriate parties. The Patuxent center also operates its own banding station on the refuge grounds. ==History== North American naturalists in the nineteenth century made efforts towards banding birds for later identification. In 1803, John James Audubon tied silver wire around the legs of nestling eastern phoebes and found two of the birds on their return to Pennsylvania the following spring. In Manitoba, Ernest Thompson Seton used printer's ink to mark snow buntings in 1882. It is Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution who is credited with the first modern banding in the U.S.: he banded 23 black- crowned night herons in 1902. Leon J. Cole of the University of Wisconsin founded the American Bird Banding Association in 1909; this organization oversaw banding until the establishment of federal programs in the U.S. (1920) and Canada (1923) pursuant to Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916. The relevant legislation, respectively, is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The U.S. program was led by Frederick Charles Lincoln from 1920 to 1946. Lincoln espoused the flyways concept of avian migration and introduced the Lincoln index method for estimating bird abundance from recaptures. In 1996, the North American Banding Council (NABC) was formed, with the mission of training banders in safe, ethical practices in the capture and handling of wild birds; the NABC also conducts optional certification at the Assistant, Bander, and Trainer levels. ==The program today== Today, approximately 6,000 banders are active in Canada and the U.S. As of January 2011, more than 64 million banding records have been received, and 3.5 million birds have been recovered and reported to the banding offices. On average, the BBL receives 1.2 million banding records annually. Beyond the conventional leg band, field researchers use several other marking and data collection and analysis tools, among them colored bands visible in the field, radio and satellite transmitters, blood and feather samples, and advanced statistical modeling techniques. While studies of bird migrations are still important, banding in this century supports many other endeavors, including studies of avian behavior, ecology, and populations; preservation of endangered species; and regulating hunting of game species. In addition, banding activities provide information relevant to concerns for human health and safety—for example, West Nile disease and bird strikes near airports. Results from banding studies support international conservation programs like Partners in Flight and the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. To receive a permit, an application is made to the federal agency of the country where the banding is to take place; additional permits from the province or state may also be required. An applicant must be fully trained prior to applying, and must submit a resume of past banding experience, references, and a research proposal. The prospective bander must be able to determine the species, age, and sex of the species to be banded. A bird found with a band can be reported online. (In the past, reports were also accepted by telephone.) On request, the finder receives an electronic Certificate of Appreciation. ==References * North American Bird Banding Program / Bird Banding Laboratory *North American Banding Council Category:Ornithological equipment and methods ","title":"North American Bird Banding Program"},{"id":"35915654","text":"Art Dealers Jason Vartikar and Sarah Christian Artist dealer Austin Thomas at Pocket Utopia, unveiling a Mathew Miller painting Hansel and Gretel Picture Garden Pocket Utopia was a contemporary art enterprise in New York City.

For instance, the international code has only two symbols, dots and dashes, but the American code has several lengths of dash. There is a distinction between \\"L\\" () and \\"T\\" (). Also, in the international code the space between symbols within a character is always the same, but American Morse has two different spaces. The letters \\"S\\" (), \\"C\\" (), and \\"R\\" () all consist of three dots, but the timing is different in each case. A frequently quoted, but possibly apocryphal, story from the historical period concerns the similarity of \\"L\\" and \\"T\\" in the American code. A company in Richmond, Virginia received a request for quotation for a load of \\"undressed staves\\" (rough sawn wood intended for the manufacture of barrels), but the telegraph operator had sent (SLAVES) instead of (STAVES) thus attempting to order \\"undressed slaves\\". The company replied reminding the customer that slavery had been abolished.Walter Polk Phillips, Sketches Old and New, pp. 222-223, J. H. Bunnell, 1897 . Another example given in the literature is \\"please fill me in\\" becoming \\"6naz fimme q\\". One commentator has called this the 19th century autocorrect.

Mavio's goal is to shut down the ring of organized crime and flush out the source of the counterfeit money, an operation that is perhaps the worst in history. The gang is led by two Irish thugs from Hell's Kitchen, Mickey O’Shay and Jimmy Kahn. These two violent criminals have been terrorizing the Upper West Side for years, and are involved in more than just a counterfeit operation—the local police have been investigating them for many years in connection with countless unsolved homicides. O'Shay and Kahn have inflicted gruesome deaths on numerous victims by bludgeoning, stabbing, shooting, and cutting into pieces the bodies of those who got in their way or refused to cooperate with their treacherous schemes. This brutality has even earned them some fear from the Mafia. Mavio's undercover role takes him deeper and deeper into the gruesome world of O'Shay, Kahn, and the rest of the West Side Boys. His life undercover is brutal and dangerous, and not only detrimental to his own well- being, but puts at risk the lives of Katie, his pregnant wife, and his dying father. ==Reception== The book received generally favorable reviews.Horror Drive-In review BookReview.com called it \\"an interesting police procedural\\"BookReview.com while one Booklist reviewer stated, \\"This is a gripping thriller, similar to the novels of Gerald Petievich, the Secret Service agent turned author (To Live and Die in L.A. is his most well-known title), but with more emotional and moral depth.

The website was launched in March 2004 and was privately held with backing by VantagePoint Venture Partners, Point Judith Capital, Transcosmos, and private investors. Multiply had over 11 million registered users. The company was headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida but moved to Jakarta, Indonesia early in 2012 and recently announced intentions to switch to e-commerce, dropping the social networking aspect entirely. Quantcast estimates Multiply had 2.47 million monthly U.S. unique visitors at their peak on July 30, 2012. On Multiply, a user's network was made up of their direct contacts, as well as others who are closely connected to them through their first-degree relationships. Additionally, users were encouraged to specify the nature of their relationship with one another, making it possible to share content with their entire network of closely related people, or subsets thereof including friends, family, professional contacts, and so on. May 31, 2013 officially marked the closing of their operations after more than 9 years and 2 months following its inability to make a profit and was later dissolved and have its assets redistributed after filing articles of dissolution due to financial difficulties whilst expressing the hope that the website might reorganize, retain Jakarta, Indonesia as headquarters, and reopen as a social networking service in the future, but although plans to revive the website as a social networking services have been proposed. When business stabilized, the management began to re-open the site and to recovering hosted blogs, videos, photos and messaging. ==History== Multiply Inc. was founded in 2004 by Peter Pezaris, Michael Gersh, and David Hersh. With headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, United States, Multiply is the second largest social network in Southeast Asia, with millions of users in the US, Brazil, India and more. Multiply initially carried out the main function as a social network where users shared photos, blogs, videos, and others. In its development, Multiply changed its function to become an electronic trading site. On September 20, 2010, most of Multiply.com's shares were acquired by Naspers Limited (NPSN- JSE), an electronic trading expert company in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. In September 2005, Multiply gathered one million users worldwide. In June 2007, Multiply staff through its blog stated that the number of users reached five million users. In October 2008, Multiply was used by ten million members worldwide. Based on the Alexa site record in December 2008, the majority of users of the Multiply site came from Indonesia, which was 21.7%. While the United States itself, where Multiply's head office is located, contributes 20% to Multiply's users. ==Blogging Paired with Media Sharing and Storage== Multiply Logo (2003-2013) Multiply screenshot as of August 23, 2008 Multiply tried to be the one-stop shop for a user's Web 2.0 experience. Its bid is enhanced by the capabilities with which it empowers its users. There was a blog module, of course, but beyond that, users could upload videos, and host them on their pages rather than on third-party pages. Videos could also be added from major sites, notably YouTube. The user could also upload unlimited photos into their albums, hosted in the photo module. There were also modules for music, reviews, links, recipes, and a personal marketplace. A blog traditionally followed a linear format (each entry rests above the other in chronological order regardless of the type of content that is included in the post). Though it is possible to have a traditional style blog on Multiply, content could also be organized according to the type of post (text, video, photo, etc.) or by topic (using tagged content boxes). By organizing posts based on topic or type of media, a user can essentially create a personal web page. Multiply provided blog cross-posting; blog entries posted to Multiply could be automatically posted to a LiveJournal, Blogger or TypePad account. There was also an option to post via e-mail or MMS, enabling posting from mobile phones. Users could also post reviews (of movies and books, for example), and share a calendar of events. Multiply also reintroduced the Marketplace and Recipes modules, which allowed users to share interests in purchases, and favorite foods and drinks. Multiply was especially flexible in that users could choose to edit their background and theme colors, but the ability to incorporate CSS makes customizing more extensive. Many users had pages far different from the base theme due to their mastery of CSS. Traditional Blogging Blog posts on Multiply included the ability to easily change font style, type, color or size. Photos could be added and moved about within the post. A poll could be included and files could be attached. Users could use Multiply's WYSIWYG blog editor or edit HTML directly. As with all types of posts on Multiply, users could set privacy settings on a per post basis, enabling a user to essentially run a private blog for friends and family right on top of, or embedded within, a public blog. (In other words, a user can post thoughts on politics to a public audience while reserving posts on the cute things the kids did for only friends and family. Both types of posts were treated the same by Multiply in terms of alerts to the poster and the poster's contacts, but the privacy settings limit the content to only those that the user wants to give access to.) Unlimited Photo Sharing All accounts on Multiply included the ability to add an unlimited number of photos. In addition to being able to share photos with contacts on Multiply, users could also let non-Multiply members see even their private photos by using the \\"share\\" link. Multiply offered limited editing capabilities for photos: Photos could be rotated and a variety of picture frames can be added. Using the Multiply Media Locker users could crop photos, eliminate red eye, retouch photos, adjust contrast, exposure, and saturation. There was also an Auto Fix function that adjusted photos with one click. All of the adjustments were reversible until clicked to apply them. Photos in albums could be embedded into other posts or replies on Multiply, or they could be hotlinked outside of Multiply, in which case a watermark is added. Multiply had partnered with QOOP for photo printing and other photo services. Multiply had an Auto Uploading tool which automatically uploads your photos into your Media Locker where they are stored until you choose to share them. For premium users the full size original was stored indefinitely. Videos Users could easily upload videos directly to Multiply, or they could pull video in from YouTube, Photobucket, Google Video, Metacafe, or myspacetv.com. Free users could upload up to 10 minutes (or 100mb of video footage). Premium members had a limit of 20 minutes (or 200mb). Calendar Users could post calendar entries for themselves, for their contacts, their network or even for public access (enabling users to keep personal entries, such as doctor appointments, private, while allowing a wider audience for such entries as a fund raising event that is open to the public). Users had access to an aggregated calendar on their Inbox page that collects all of their calendar entries as well as those of their contacts and displays them in one calendar feed. Calendar entries, as with all entries on Multiply, could be discussed within the calendar entry post, enabling members to not only announce an event, but discuss it as well. Reviews Users could add reviews to their website, not only rating and explaining their view on the product, but discussing it as well with friends and family. Reviews used a 5 star system so both those who post and those who reply can rate how well they liked a product. Recipes The recipe section was a component of Multiply at the time of its launch in 2004, but it was removed for a time. The recipe and marketplace sections were returned in 2007 due to popular demand. Marketplace The marketplace section was designed to be a way to showcase items that a person may want to pass on to contacts or to search for an item that a user's contacts may have. Music Since its inception the website had allowed users to upload music playlists to their profile page. Initially users could upload up to 10 songs at a time with an unlimited number of songs allowed on any given playlist (they could upload more songs after the first ten by starting a second upload and specifying that they should be added to a pre-existing playlist.) This brought the site initial popularity due to the ease with which people could share copyrighted digital music. Originally one could download each track individually in mp3 format. In order to combat illegal music sharing (as the intent was for users to be able to share only music that they had the legal right to), the site cut the maximum uploads at one time to five, and then to three. They then removed the ability to easily right click and download each individual track and instead put a link to a *.m3u playlist file. However users could simply save that file and open it with a text editor, and then cut and paste the individual file links and save the mp3 files. In July 2008, the site removed the ability to download the *.m3u playlist file and replaced it with an embedded music player. However users can still use third party software to obtain the original mp3 files (which are also stored in a computer's download cache.) Nonetheless, these changes (as well as the large number of users forcibly removed from the site due to copyright violations) have affected the size of the user base. ==Inbox newsfeed== Multiply had a newsfeed since its inception, variously called the \\"Explore\\" page, \\"My Multiply\\" and the \\"Inbox\\". This feed aggregates not only the user's posts, but those of the user's contacts, network and groups as well, using technology that Multiply has patented. The inbox alerts users not only to new posts by their contacts or within their network, but it also notifies users of new replies to posts that users have shown an interest in. If a user ignores a post, then the post is not popped to the top of the page no matter how many new replies are made. In this way, users don't need to \\"clean up\\" their inbox because uninteresting posts simply \\"drop off\\" the page. The feed was highly customizable, allowing the user to set filters to show specific posts. Filters could be saved and users can easily switch between them. In this way, users were only alerted to posts and replies that are interesting to them, though they can switch to a \\"wider\\" view of network or group activity when that is preferred. ==Groups== In addition to networking with your \\"real life\\" friends and family, Multiply also provided a way to meet and socialize with other members through groups. Registered users could create groups on Multiply. These groups exist outside of the \\"network\\" structure, enabling people with certain interests to share the aforementioned types of media with others who share their interests, but may not be closely connected to them through relationships. Groups were categorized as Business, Computers & Internet, Cultures & Community, Entertainment & Arts, Friends & Family, Games, Government & Politics, Health & Wellness, Hobbies & Crafts, Money & Investing, Places & Travel, Recreation & Sports, Religion & Beliefs, Romance & Relationships, Schools & Education, Science & History, and Other.  Migration from MSN Groups  In February 2009, MSN Groups closed to make way for the new Windows Live Groups. Communities hosted on the old MSN Groups service can not be migrated across to the new platform. As such MSN have worked with Multiply to create a tool which allowed group owners to move their MSN Groups community over to the Multiply service. This move by MSN and Multiply succeeded in killing off a large number of MSN Groups communities. This was due to the fact that the migration process was rather complex, essentially creating a new group, importing content from the old one. This meant that all existing MSN users had to re-join the new group, and if the old community located on MSN Groups was not closed by the owner after the migration process, any changes made afterward were to be lost when the service closed. Details of the migration process could be found on the MSN Groups homepage which has subsequently been removed and now directs to a Microsoft Account log in page, however information regarding Groups' closure and migration to Multipy has been preserved on a Windows Live blog. With the announced closure of Multiply's social networking sites, members who used the site for that purpose are looking for alternatives offering similar features. While Multiply has not announced a partnership with any other web site or sites for the purposes of migration as MSN did, the CEO did promise to provide \\"easy ways for you to either download your stuff (photos, blogs, content, etc), or migrate it to other online services\\" with details to be announced at a later date. ==Personal website== Though Multiply did provide a profile page for users, that was not the main focal point of a user's Multiply presence. Rather, each user had a home page where all of their recent content was aggregated. The content boxes on this home page could be rearranged and could be aligned into a one or two column format (or a mixture of both). Tagged content boxes could also be added and unwanted boxes could be hidden. Users could customize the overall look of their site using either one-click customization tools that Multiply provides or by adding customizations with CSS. ==Awards & recognitions== In 2008, Multiply was named Open Web Awards finalist. ==Headquarters moves to Indonesia== As Multiply expanded to include e-commerce, the announcement was made that the company was moving from its headquarters in Florida to Indonesia. ==Multiply announces closure of social networking site== An official announcement by Multiply's CEO, Stefan Magdalinski, was made on August 9, 2012, that the social networking portion of Multiply would be discontinued, including hosted blogs, videos, photos and messaging, in order to focus solely on e-commerce. Multiply International ceased its social network on March 21, 2013. One month later, Multiply announced that all services of both Indonesian and International would close, making the site entirely defunct, and PT Multiply Indonesia would cease to exist as a company on January 1, 2017 and it is filed for bankruptcy at the Central Jakarta Commercial Court, as it is no longer able to operate on May 11, 2017, and was eventually liquidated, the affair generally involves the sale of all of the company’s property (such as social networking portion) and holdings, followed by the complete dissolution and closure of the site. For their reason is that if there would be another Multiply as a social networking site, the computers are wouldn't be complete without Multiply.com. Legacy As the social networking site, Multiply is best remembered for social networking service and to compete with other social networking services, and it to recover all hosted blogs, videos, photos within the few years to come. ==See also== * E-commerce * Social network service * List of social networking websites * Comparison of video services ==References * Multiply * Multiply Secures Second Round of Funding Archival collection * Folksonomy.org Interview with Multiply Founder * WPTV: West Palm Beach * Multiply's Multimedia and Networking Capabilities Category:Blog hosting services Category:American social networking websites Category:2004 establishments in Florida Category:Internet properties established in 2004 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2013 Category:2014 disestablishments in Indonesia Category:Defunct social networking services Category:2013 disestablishments in Florida ","title":"Multiply (website)"},{"id":"35915711","text":"Nancy Neiman (married name Nancy Neiman Baranet) is an American cyclist, and the first American to compete in a European stage race.

MLSS is an important part of the activated sludge process to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of active biomass available to consume the applied quantity of organic pollutant at any time. This is known as the food to microorganism ratio, more commonly notated as the F/M ratio. By maintaining this ratio at the appropriate level the biomass will consume high percentages of the food. This minimizes the loss of residual food in the treated effluent. In simple terms, the more the biomass consumes the lower the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) will be in the discharge. It is important that MLSS removes COD and BOD in order to purify water for clean surface waters, and subsequently clean drinking water and hygiene. Raw sewage enters in the water treatment process with a concentration of sometimes several hundred mg/L of BOD. Upon being treated by screening, pre-settling, activated sludge processes or other methods of treatment, the concentration of BOD in water can be lowered to less than 2 mg/L, which is considered to be clean, safe to discharge to surface waters or to reuse water. The total weight of MLSS within an aeration tank can be calculated by multiplying the concentration of MLSS (kg/m3) in the aeration tank by the tank volume (m3). == Overview == MLSS is responsible for removing the biochemical oxygen demand make-up of a large portion of the solids that are retained in the activated sludge process within the water treatment process. They are the \\"active\\" part of the activated sludge process. Mixed liquor suspended solids are the solids under aeration. MLSS is measured by filtering a known volume of the mixed liquor sample, which is the same way that suspended solids are measured in wastewater. Some of the MLSS may be an inorganic material. Sometimes this may represent a large percentage of the solids present in the wastewater. Environmental engineering focuses on the particles suspended in water and the suitable operation of water treatment plants. Therefore, it is important to measure the total mass of suspended solids, which is the MLSS, as well as the mass of organic matter suspended in the activated sludge unit. These measurements allow engineers to adjust the flow rate of return sludge from the secondary clarifier into the secondary treatment reactor. This ensures that influent organic matter will be treated with a correct concentration of microorganisms. == Mixed liquor volatile suspended solids == The portion of the MLSS that is actually eating the incoming food is referred to as the Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS). The volatile solids concentration in a sample of mixed liquor will consist mostly of microorganisms and organic matter. As a result, the volatile solids concentration of mixed liquor is approximately equal to the amount of microorganisms in the water and can be used to determine whether there are enough microorganisms present to purify the water. == Separation and Removal process == MLSS is separated from the treated or purified water by settling in a settling tank in the activated sludge process. The excess sludge has to be removed from the system. == Effects in water treatment ==  If content is too high  * The process is prone to bulking of solids and the treatment system can become overloaded. * This can cause the dissolved oxygen content to drop; this may reduce the efficiency of nitrification and the settleability of the sludge. * Excessive aeration will be required which wastes electricity. it will create thick foam on upper layer.  If content is too low  * The process may not remove sufficient organic matter from the wastewater. * The sludge age may be too low to enable nitrification. The typical control band for the concentration of MLSS is 2 to 4 g/L for conventional activated sludge, or up to 15 g/l for membrane bioreactors. One of the easiest control procedures for activated sludge systems is the Constant Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids method. In this method, the operator selects a certain MLSS concentration or range of mix liquor concentrations that produces the best effluent and the highest removal efficiencies. This specific value or range must be calculated depending on COD or BOD load [kg/d]. When the operator finds the optimum MLSS concentration for each plant, he attempts to maintain this value by adjusting the sludge wasting or sludge excess rate. One rule of thumb for activated sludge systems is that for every pound of BOD removed in the secondary system a half a pound of new solids is generated through reproduction of the organisms and addition of new organisms from the influent wastes. So, the operator tries to waste the proper amount of solids to keep his selected optimum mix liquor concentration constant. If the MLSS concentration is above the desired concentration, the wasting of the excess solids will have to be started or increased. If the MLSS concentration is below the desired concentration level, wasting should be decreased or stopped. == Calculations == MLSS (g/L) = SV [mL/L]/SVI [mL/g] or SVI [mL/g] = MLSS (g/L)/SV30 [mL/L] Where: SVI = sludge volume index (mL/g) SV30 = Volume of settled solids per 1 litre after 30 minutes In fact SVI is a calculation from two analyses : SV30 and MLSS. 0=(Q+Qr)(X')-(QrX'r+QsX'r) Where: Q = wastewater flow rate (m3/d) Qr = return sludge flow rate (m3/d) X' = MLSS (kg/m3) X'r = return sludge concentration (kg/m3) Qs = sludge surplus (or excess) flow rate (m3/d) This equilibrium formula for settling tanks is mostly calculated for the initial flows in m3/h. This formula describes that the incoming amount of MLSS in a settler should be equivalent to the outcoming amount of MLSS via the return sludge flow. This equilibrium is only valid if the effluent water contains a low concentration in suspended solids. In normal conditions the excess amount is very low in comparison to the return amount, and for that reason many times the excess amount is neglected. In that case the formula will be : (Q+Qr)(X') = (QrX'r) == Performance== Materials: Obtain a sample of mixed liquor. Transfer the sample into a laboratory in order to analyze it. Measure the volume weight of the sample. Remove two filter papers from a desiccator and record the weight of each. Place the filter holder on a vacuum flask and then place another filter on top of the filter holder by using a pair of tweezers. Stir the sample of mixed liquor in order to get a good mixture for the experiment. After sample is mixed, pour 5 mL into a graduated cylinder. Turn on the vacuum pump and pour the sample into the filter holder. After all the mixed liquor has gone through, run three portions of 10 mL distilled water through the filter holder to rinse any particles that may have stuck to the glass. Allow the vacuum pump to run an additional three minutes. This will help remove any extra water from the filter before drying. Switch the vacuum pump off and remove the filter from the filter holder and place in the corresponding weighing dish. Repeat above process for as many trials as needed. Place the filter(s) into a drying oven, which is set to 103°–105° C, for one hour. Upon drying, replace filters into a desiccator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes in the desiccator, the filters are to be weighed.  Calculations  MLSS (g/L) = [(A - B)]÷[Volume of sample in liters] Where: A is the sample and filter weight in gram B is the weight of the filter in gram ==References== *Davis, Mackenzie Leo, and David A.

He is also president of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of Greater Phoenix. He is a driving force behind the development of the Orthodox Jewish community of Phoenix since 1965. ==Early life and education== Rebibo was born in Rabat, Morocco to a Sephardic family. He attended the Yeshiva of Aix-les-Bains (Ecole Supérieure Talmudique or Yeshivat Chachmei Tsorfat) in Aix-les-Bains, France. He also studied law at the University of Paris. He received his rabbinic ordination from Rabbi David Ashkenazi. In 1953 Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz of the Mir yeshiva of Brooklyn, New York, met Rebibo in France and hired him as his translator while he met with local Jewish leaders. Afterward Kalmanowitz advised Rebibo to move to the United States where he would find more opportunity for rabbinical positions. Kalmanowitz helped Rebibo obtain a student visa, whereupon the latter came to study at the Mir yeshiva for one year. Kalmanowitz helped Rebibo find his first teaching job at Yeshiva Magen David in Brooklyn. Rebibo next assumed the pulpit of a small synagogue in Memphis, Tennessee. During this time he took undergraduate and graduate coursework at Memphis State University. ==Move to Phoenix== Rebibo was recommended by Joseph Kaminetsky, then head of Torah Umesorah – National Society for Hebrew Day Schools, as the best choice to open a Jewish day school in the southwestern US city of Phoenix, which then had a population of 10,000 Jews. In 1965 Rebibo and his wife moved to Phoenix, where he threw himself into the task of opening the city’s first Jewish day school, the Phoenix Hebrew Academy. Rebibo's efforts were opposed by the city's non- Orthodox rabbis, who believed that Jewish students should be absorbed into the larger community. Since most of the student body did not come from Orthodox homes, Rebibo calmed parents' fears that their children would be \\"converted\\" to Orthodoxy by setting a policy accepting children from all streams of Judaism. In time, some of the parents most active in the school were those belonging to the local Reform temple. Phoenix Hebrew Academy opened on 7 September 1965 with 40 students in kindergarten and grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. A few weeks before opening day, Rebibo spotted a \\"for sale\\" on a house at 337 East Bethany Home Road and acquired it as the school's first campus. In the 1970s, the school purchased a larger facility at 515 East Bethany Home Road, its current location. Rebibo has served as dean of students since the school’s inception. Also in 1965, Rebibo founded the Greater Phoenix Vaad Hakashruth kosher certification agency, which he continues to head. The following year he established Beth Joseph Congregation, an Orthodox congregation, where he is senior rabbi. In 2000 he co-founded the Greater Phoenix Israel Kollel, and in 2005 he led the effort to install a neighborhood eruv. Rebibo is a strong supporter of the State of Israel and often speaks at Israel solidarity rallies. ==Family== Rebibo and his wife Odette have five children. One son, Joel, served as associate rabbi of Beth Joseph Congregation and educational director of the Phoenix Hebrew Academy before making aliyah in 1983; he has since worked as an editor at The Jerusalem Post and the English-language Hamodia newspaper. A daughter, Debbie Fox, a mental health professional, also taught in her father's day school. ==Honors and awards== * The Prime Minister’s Medal of Devotion to the State of Israel, 1975 *UJA Federation Leadership Award *Israel Bonds Man of the Year * Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz Memorial Award (Mir yeshiva), 2004 ==References *Beth Joseph Congregation website *\\"Interview with David Rebibo\\" (Transcript of oral interview, 17 November 1992) *\\"Harav Shmuel Kamenetsky Visits Phoenix\\" Category:American Orthodox rabbis Category:Moroccan emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:People from Rabat Category:Moroccan Jews Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Jews and Judaism in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Religious leaders from Arizona ","title":"David Rebibo"},{"id":"35915801","text":"Chahdashi (, also Romanized as Chāhdāshī; also known as Chāh-e Dā’ī and Chāh-e Dāshī) is a village in Neh Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

She had her first film role in 1952 in the family movie Fight of the Tertia. In 1954 she married her professional colleague Gunnar Möller with whom she was seen in the same year in the music movie Love and Trumpets. She continued her acting career after her marriage under her birth name. From her marriage with Gunnar Möller she had three children. Under the direction of Peter Beauvais she played in Ist Mama nicht fabelhaft? in 1958. She also acted at the side of her husband, so in Familie Werner auf Reisen, a TV series. Here she gave Brigitte Werner, wife of Hans Werner, the student councillor, whom her husband impersonated. In the TV series Die Gäste des Felix Hechinger (directed by Rolf von Sydow) Brigitte Rau played the role of Monika Lenz, in the series part Ehe in Gefahr her husband played her husband Peter Lenz. In the 1970s, Gunnar Möller and Brigitte Rau appeared predominantly together in theatre productions, among others also at the Landesbühne Hannover. In 1977 they both appeared on stage in Heinz Coubier's comedy Aimée directed by Helmut Käutner. == Circumstances of Death == In 1979, Möller killed the 45-year-old Rau in London in an affair as a result of a dispute over her divorce petition. At that time, the couple's marriage was already considered to be disrupted by side-jumps, alcohol and disputes. The family had previously changed residence several times before settling in the Hampstead district of London's artists. After the crime, Möller turned himself in to the police. His case was tried in court in London, and the actor was sentenced to five years in prison, of which he served two years. ==Selected filmography== * Fight of the Tertia (1952) * Christina (1953) * Annie from Tharau (1954) * Money from the Air (1954) * A Life for Do (1954) * Love and Trumpets (1954) * Ball at the Savoy (1955) * The Ambassador (1960) * Oh!

The hospital contains one-hundred nursing home beds, and operates a Level II trauma center. Good Samaritan Hospital opened in May 1959, and it has expanded several times since opening. It has been Magnet-designed for its quality nursing since 2006, and is a member of Catholic Health Services of Long Island. ==History== Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center was established by the Daughters of Wisdom. It opened on May 18, 1959 on a 60-acre parcel adjacent to the Great South Bay. From 1963 to 1967, Robert Moses was the chairperson for the hospital's annual ball. On July 29, 1981, Robert Moses died at Good Samaritan Hospital at age 92. It has undergone major expansions six times: to the east in 1966; to the south with the 120-bed Baxter Pavilion in 1970; to the west with two additional patient floors in 1973; to the north in 1983 with a five-story addition which included eight new operating rooms and new radiology and pediatric departments; and in 1996 with a four-story addition for the teaching, mammography, pathology and surgical programs. The sixth expansion, begun in 1998, was a new two-story structure connected to the main building by a corridor. The Center for Emergency Medicine and Trauma, which was dedicated on April 22, 2001, encompasses the first floor. In February 1980, Good Samaritan acquired the former Sayville Nursing Home for elderly patients who could no longer live home alone. The structure at the corner of Elm and Candee Avenues was totally refurbished as the Good Samaritan Nursing Home with skilled nursing facilities for 100 patient-residents. In 1992, the West Islip Breast Cancer Coalition asked Good Samaritan to open a breast cancer center, and in February 1994, Good Samaritan opened its Breast Health Center. It became Long Island's the first comprehensive breast health center. According to The New York Times, the center offers mammography examinations, biopsies, surgeries, after care, counseling, a boutique, and support groups. In 1997, the Breast Health Center was one of four places in the United States that was conducting clinical trials for new filmless digital mammography technology. In 1997, the Bishop John R. McGann of the Rockville Centre diocese dismissed the separate boards operating Good Samaritan Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Mercy Medical Center, and St. Charles Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, and placed the four hospitals under the management of the newly created Catholic Health Services of Long Island in response in changes in the health care industry and in order to aid the poor and needy. Richard Angelo, \\"Angel of Death\\" In the autumn of 1987, Good Samaritan Hospital nurse Richard Angelo (\\"The Angel of Death\\") was arrested following a urine analysis of Good Samaritan patient Geralomo Kucich that showed the drugs Pavulon and Anectine in his system. Following his arrest, the remains of some of the patients Angelo had treated were exhumed and 10 of the deceased patients also tested positive for the drugs. Angelo eventually confessed to authorities, telling them during a taped interview, \\"I wanted to create a situation where I would cause the patient to have some respiratory distress or some problem, and through my intervention or suggested intervention or whatever, come out looking like I knew what I was doing. I had no confidence in myself. I felt very inadequate.\\" He was charged with multiple counts of second-degree murder and was ultimately convicted of two counts of depraved indifference murder (second-degree murder), one count of second degree manslaughter, one count of criminally negligent homicide and six counts of assault with respect to five of the patients and was sentenced to 61 years to life. ==Graduate medical education== Good Samaritan Hospital operates a number of osteopathic residency programs accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. Good Samaritan Hospital hosts residency programs in family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics & gynecology, podiatry, and emergency medicine. Good Samaritan Hospital also operates a dual pediatric and emergency medicine program. ==References== Notes ==External links== *Official website Category:Christian hospitals Category:Hospitals in New York (state) Category:Hospitals established in 1959 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1959 Category:Buildings and structures in Suffolk County, New York Category:1959 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center (West Islip, New York)"},{"id":"35916098","text":"Franz Bernreiter (born 13 February 1954) is a German former biathlete.

Holle and backed by a company called the Commercial Aeroplane Wing Syndicate, which took over Holle's patents from the Varioplane company, and was associated with Blackburn Aircraft,\\"New Companies Registered\\"Flight 28 September 1919 who carried out the construction and testing work. A test aircraft was built, with the wing mounted high above the fuselage of a D.H.6 re-engined with a Bentley BR2 rotary engine. This was first flown in January 1921 by Capt.

Called the Alula Monoplane, with a span of 28 ft 6 in and an area of 106.25 sq ft this was entered for the 1921 Aerial Derby with Frank Courtney as pilot, but Courtney was unhappy with its ground handling characteristics, due to the combination of a high centre of gravity and a narrow-track undercarriage, and it was not flown in the competition.\\"The Alula Monoplane\\"Flight 21 July 1921 After the original landing gear has been replaced by one having a much wider track it was flown by R.

Moving to automobile racing as a result of safety concerns, Sharp competed in local stock car races, moving up to the NASCAR Busch Series in 1993, competing two events with a best finish of 14th at Bristol International Raceway. He then moved to compete in the American Speed Association's national tour, competing with only moderate success for several years, both as a driver and as a crew chief. Sharp's career as a crew chief saw success in the ARCA Racing Series, where he was the 1999 champion crew chief with driver Bill Baird. He also served as a crew chief in the Sprint Cup Series for a number of races in the late 1990s with BAM Racing and drivers Shawna Robinson and Hermie Sadler. ==Team owner== Sharp's initial foray into team ownership was in 1999 in the ARCA Re/MAX Series; the effort proved unsuccessful and soon closed, however after some time away from the sport Sharp returned, founding Eddie Sharp Racing in 2005; competing in the ARCA Re/MAX Series, the team scored its first win at Kentucky Speedway in July 2007 with driver Michael McDowell. The team won the 2009 ARCA championship with Justin Lofton. After a failed attempt to break into the NASCAR ranks with Woodard & Sharp Racing and driver Boston Reid in 2006, ESR began competing in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in 2010, and scored its first win in the series with Justin Lofton at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May 2012. ==Motorsports career results== NASCAR =Busch Series= ! ! =Craftsman Truck Series= ! ==ReferencesCategory:Living people Category:1964 births Category:Sportspeople from Clearwater, Florida Category:Racing drivers from Florida Category:NASCAR team owners Category:NASCAR crew chiefs Category:NASCAR drivers Category:CARS Tour drivers Category:Hydroplanes Category:American Speed Association drivers ","title":"Eddie Sharp"},{"id":"35916416","text":"Kalateh-ye Seyyed Ali () may refer to: * Kalateh-ye Seyyed Ali, Gonabad, Razavi Khorasan Province * Kalateh-ye Seyyed Ali, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan Province * Kalateh-ye Seyyed Ali, South Khorasan ","title":"Kalateh-ye Seyyed Ali"},{"id":"35916418","text":"crosses crosslet fitchée gules as many bezantsVivian, p.255 Francis Crossing (1598–1638) of Exeter, Devon, was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1626 to 1629.

Its parish is part of the Diocese of Oxford. Its earliest parts are 12th-century and it is a Grade I listed building. The church is a Norman building. All but one of the windows were replaced later in the Middle Ages with Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic ones, and the Perpendicular Gothic west tower is also a later addition. ==Administration== An active church in the Church of England, the Church of St Peter and St Paul is part of the diocese of Oxford, which is in the Province of Canterbury. It is in the archdeaconry of Oxford and the deanery of Henley-on-Thames. It forms a benefice with the churches at Ipsden, North Stoke, Stoke Row, Whitchurch and Woodcote.The Langtree Team Ministry ==History== The foundation of the church at Checkendon has been strongly associated with Saint Birinus who landed on the south coast in 634 and made his way to Dorchester-on-Thames where he converted Cynegils, the Saxon King of Wessex. There was probably a wattle and daub church on the same site soon after. In 636 Birinus sent for masons from Italy who started work on the Abbey at Dorchester. Bede wrote: \\"Many churches were built and endowed by Birinus.\\" These were often built of wattle and daub, and the windows glazed with horn. Birinus established a small chapel for himself on Berin's Hill, about from Checkendon. He was an ardent missionary and it seems probable that he also converted Caeca, after whom Checkendon is named. Birinus' favourite saints were Peter and Paul.\\"Saint Peter & Saint Paul – Checkendon\\", pamphlet available at the church, dated July 1978, no author credited The present church was built in the late 11th- or early 12th-century, except for the tower and porch which were added in the 15th century. It is generally accepted that the present church is Norman. The flint and mortar work, however, suggests the possibility of an earlier date. Alternatively, it is possible that the Normans built onto an existing and partially ruined church. The method of construction, placing flint in herringbone fashion, separated by broad bands of mortar, is distinctly Saxon. It is possible that the Normans employed Saxon workmen who were expert in such flintwork. The church could have been built by Alured the Saxon, or possibly by Sir Robert Marmyon his successor, or by Milo de Crispin, Lord of Wallingford. The date, plan, material and construction of the church are the same as those of Swyncombe which lies about five miles away - both churches have a half round apse, a square choir and a nave comprising two squares. Both are without buttresses. The church at Swyncombe was the work of the monks from Bec Abbey in Normandy. ==The Nave== Arches and roof The great arches were built at the same time as the church walls and originally their bases were level with the floor. The eight carved capitals are preserved undamaged. They are close to the Byzantine tradition but it is not known if they were carved in situ by the monks of Bec or were imported completely finished. The two on the northern pillars of the choir-nave are particularly fine. The Tudor roof is supported by ten corbels and was restored in 1956. The size of the corbels shows that they would once have supported the beams of the first Norman roof. Two corbels are carved into heads in a style that is much earlier than Tudor. When the church was redecorated in 1976, the bosses, the work of local craftsmen, were gilded. About the centre of the nave's north wall is an exquisitely carved small angel with a book, dating from 1300. Kennington sculpture and memorial window Filling the old north door of the nave is an unfinished sculpture by noted artist and sculptor Eric Kennington. Kennington, who was a friend of Lawrence of Arabia and illustrator of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, was a former churchwarden of the parish. The fine diamond-point engraved window in the south wall is a memorial to him. Commissioned by his wife it was designed by Lawrence Whistler and completed in 1962. Symbolic in character, it shows the Holy Grail at the centre, seen as if a vision, floating in mid-air and ringed by light. Below is the Wheat of the Sacrament, rising as if from a bare hill crowned by a Celtic Cross, representing the history of Christianity in the British Isles. The sunflowers turned towards the Cup were used in Kennington's own work, and had great reverence for the earliest Celtic Christianity. The armed figures guarding the Grail on each side are partly derived from figures in the 1943 drawing Resurgence by Kennington. Lancing rays of light strike down on all from the Eye of God at the apex. The landscapes below represent night and day over England. The right-hand scene, with a glimpse of the sea, recalls the county of Dorset, for which Kennington had a particular fondness. Font, iron-work and wall tablets The 15th- century font is at the west end of the church. There is also an iron-bound oak chest of the 18th-century or earlier. The iron-work of the church lighting is the work of local craftsmen of living memory and the kneelers throughout the church were embroidered by ladies of the village. The wall tablets commemorate members of local families; one on the north wall is in memory of Admiral Isaac George Manley, of nearby Braziers Park who, as a midshipman, sailed with Captain James Cook on his first voyage round the world in . The canopied pulpit and box pews from the nave, were removed by Victorian renovation work. == Chancel and Apse== Brasses and tiles The 15th-century brasses include three memorials to the Reade family who still own land in and around Checkendon. The small brass on the north side shows a soul with clasped hands being borne to heaven in a winding sheet. The translation of the inscription is: \\"Here lies Walter Beauchamp son of William Beauchamp, Knight: on whose soul may the Lord have mercy. Amen.\\" The inscription on the brass of the woman with the folded skirt translates as: \\"Here lies Anna Bowett wife of Richard Bowett, Knight: one of the daughters of John Gaynesford, Knight and of Katherine his wife of Crowhurst in the County of Surrey. Anne died on the 6th day of January in the year of our Lord 1480. May God deal mercifully with her soul.\\" On the south side of the chancel one brass to John Rede \\"servant of the king\\" bears the date 1404. This very impressive brass shows a figure is dressed in a fur-lined gown, cassock and hood of the great man's office, that of Sergeant-at-law. Alongside the brasses on the north wall is a series of mediaeval encaustic tiles, presumably collected and re-laid here during the 19th century, probably came from Chiltern factories. 13th-century fresco in the chancel apse of Christ in Majesty flanked by his apostles Wall paintings The church has an early 13th-century wall painting of Christ in Majesty above a procession of Apostles. When restoration work was carried out in 1868 the red ochre fresco paintings were discovered under the plaster which the covered the apse wall. The painting of Christ is above the east window and below this are two groups of six apostles. The left group is headed by St. Peter and the right by St. Paul, the patron saints of the church. Two and a half of the twelve apostles were in fact ‘lost’ when a window was pierced in the south side of the apse in the 15th century. It is not known why the figures on the left are higher than those on the right. The former are by a more masterly artist. In 1950 the frescoes were painstakingly and artistically restored by the noted authority on wall paintings, Eve Baker, but more recently this has been considered over-restoration. The polished yew altar and communion rails, the wood for which was locally grown, were made by local craftsmen in 1960. The finest wall monuments are in the choir and perhaps the most notable is to Christian Braybrooke, 1629, a relief carving in alabaster with additional black marble. Detail of one of the apostles on the left (north) side of the chancel ceiling ==Tower== The bell tower, added to the church in the 15th century, has a ring of eight bells. Four were cast by Lester and Pack in 1765, two were cast in 1879 by Mears and Stainbank. The bell inscriptions are: * 1. LESTER & PACK OF LONDON FECIT 1765. * 2. LESTER & PACK OF LONDON FECIT 1765. * 3. MUSIC’S MEDICINE TO THE MIND. * 4. OUR VOICES SHALL WITH JOYFUL SOUND MAKE HILLS 8: VALLEYS ECHO ROUND. * 5.

TOBBITT CHURCH- WARDENS. GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST. Two more bells, cast by Mears and Stainbank, were added in 1967.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers, Reading Branch The bell ropes were replaced in 1978. The turret clock is by Tucker of London and is dated 1853. ==Porch== The porch was added in about 1500. The Holy Water stoup on the east wall is of the same date. The semi-circular Norman archway decorated with triple moulding leads into the church. There are traces of scarlet paint on the archway and capitals. There appear to be parts of an old Norman slab at the porch entrance. ==Lychgate== The lychgate is a memorial to those who died in the two World Wars. There is also an illuminated Book of Remembrance at the west end of the church. In the churchyard there is a plot set aside for the Polish Catholic community who live in the area. There was a Polish re-settlement camp at Scot's Common, near Checkendon, after the Second World War. For many years a Polish Mass was celebrated yearly in the church on the Sunday nearest to All Souls' Day. ==Rectors and Patrons== {  !width=\\"90\\"Date !width=\\"250\\"Rector !width=\\"250\\"Patron - align=\\"center\\" 1222 align=\\"center\\" Geoffrey de Rudeham align=\\"center\\" Abbot of Coventry -bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" 1271 align=\\"center\\" Thomas de Stratton align=\\"center\\" William Marmion - align=\\"center\\" 1274 align=\\"center\\" John de Wydehall align=\\"center\\" Adam de Stratton -bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" 1291 align=\\"center\\" Nicholas de Bluntson align=\\"center\\" \\" - align=\\"center\\" 1312 align=\\"center\\" John de Thormaton align=\\"center\\" John Marmion -bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" 1330 align=\\"center\\" John Pachat align=\\"center\\" \\" - align=\\"center\\" 1335 align=\\"center\\" John Gaunt de Brachle align=\\"center\\" \\" -bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" 1350 align=\\"center\\" Nicholas de Liechfeld align=\\"center\\" John de Stratton - align=\\"center\\" 1351 align=\\"center\\" Henry de Stratton align=\\"center\\" -bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" 1372 align=\\"center\\" Laurence de Morgan align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" 1381 align=\\"center\\" William Fery align=\\"center\\" G.

Many sources contributed to and influenced the development of Moroccan religious customs, including the Shulchan Aruch, the Livorno minhag, the Ashkenazic minhag and even the presence of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Morocco. Minhag Morocco can be considered a sub-class within the Sephardic minhag but has many differences and unique traits. A related concept that falls under Minhag Morocco is the Moroccan Nusach, which more specifically refers to the variations in the prayer service. Minhag Morocco itself is not monolithic. Even within the Moroccan Minhag there are variations, most notably those between the Spanish- Moroccan community and the French-Moroccan community. Furthermore, there are variations from city to city (Fes versus Meknes, for example). The Spanish community historically resided in the northern tip of Morocco in such cities as Tangiers and Tetouan while the French community resided in the larger southern zone which included Casablanca, Marrakesh, Fes, Meknes, among others. The Moroccan Minhag is extant today in the small Jewish community that remains in Morocco as well as in many \\"diaspora\\" communities outside of Morocco. As Moroccan Jews emigrated to Israel, France, Canada, the United States, Venezuela, etc., they transplanted the customs of their community to wherever they settled and in most cases were able to establish synagogues that suited their ritual preferences. Indeed in casual religious parlance, a synagogue that has adopted the Moroccan Minhag as its official rite is known as a \\"Moroccan\\" synagogue. ==Nusach Morocco== In general, the Moroccan rite follows the template of the more general Sephardic rite. As such, a person normally accustomed to another Sephardic Nusach and is praying among Moroccans or using a Moroccan siddur will not encounter many differences for the most part. The observer of a typical Moroccan Jewish prayer service will note the presence of Oriental motifs in the melodies. However, unlike the tunes of Eastern rites (Syrian, Iraqi, etc.), which were influenced by Middle Eastern sounds, Moroccan Jewish religious tunes have a uniquely Andalusian feel. Furthermore, just as Eastern liturgical melodies are organized into Maqams, Moroccan liturgy can be classified by Noubas. The Moroccan prayer rite itself is also unique among Sephardic customs. The Moroccan nusach has many unique components but has also incorporated numerous Ashkenazic customs due to the country's proximity and exposure to Europe Kabbalat Shabbat After Minha prayers on Friday the prevalent custom is to read the Song of Songs, which is known in Hebrew as Shir Hashirim. In other Sephardic customs, this is read prior to Minha. As is common in other parts of the prayer service, Shir Hashirim is usually divided up among the congregants with one congregant reciting one of the eight chapters in the Song. Shir Hashirim has its own unique cantillation. The Song is prefaced by a Leshem Yehud prayer whose purpose is to unify the name of the Almighty and to instill the proper spiritual intent among the readers. Prior to the first chapter, verse 2:12 is sung. The last few verses (some communities start at 8:8, others at 8:11) are then sung in unison, and finally a concluding prayer is said. Unlike other communities, many Moroccan communities sit during Lecha Dodi. As well this song is sometimes sung by the entire congregation in unison and at other times one congregant sings each of the nine stanzas. After the last stanza the prevalent custom is to recite 4 verses from the Shir Hashirim (1:2, 4:16, 2:8 and 5:1), which were arranged as an alternative for someone who was not able to recite the whole song in its entirety. Motzei Shabbat Prior to the Arvit prayers following Shabbat, several Psalms are recited. Most prayerbooks include the \\"Alpha Beta\\" (Psalm 119), followed by the 15 Songs of Ascents (Shir Hamaalot in Hebrew). A more common custom is for the congregation to recite Psalm 15, Psalm 16, Psalm 144 and then Psalm 67. It is not unusual for some communities to omit Psalms 15 and 16 and to begin with Psalm 144 with its characteristic tune. In many communities that include the first two, Psalm 16 (Michtam LeDavid) is given with a unique tune and with one congregant individually singing each verse. The Internet abounds with recordings of Psalm 16 sung in the Moroccan tune. Unique among Sephardic customs, the Moroccan nusach includes the recitation of the blessing commencing with the words Yiru Enenu (Heb. יראו עינינו, translation: Our eyes shall see) immediately preceding the Amida of Motzei Shabbat. Many Ashkenazim say this passage every weekday night after Hashkivenu. This custom is discussed in Tosafot of Tractate Berakhot 4a. There are Moroccan communities that also recite Yiru Enenu during Arvit immediately following the end of Yom Kippur. Hallel The recitation of Hallel in the Moroccan minhag is unique in that two possible blessings may be recited. Almost all other Sephardic customs require a blessing only when Hallel is recited in its entirety, such as during Sukkot. The blessing in this case is \\"Ligmor et haHallel\\" (Heb. לגמור את ההלל, lit. \\"To complete the Hallel\\"). When the abridged Hallel is recited, such as on Rosh Hodesh, no blessing is said at all. Among Ashkenazim, the prevailing custom is to use the blessing \\"Likro et haHallel\\" (Heb. לקרוא את ההלל, lit. \\"To read the Hallel\\") whether the full or abridged Hallel is read. In the Moroccan nusach, the \\"Ligmor et haHallel\\" blessing is said when the full Hallel is recited, and the \\"Likro et haHallel\\" blessing is read with the abridged Hallel. ==Other customs== Havdalah A unique feature in the Moroccan Minhag is the recitation of the introductory song Avarech et Shem (lit. \\"I shall bless [the Almighty's name]). During Havdalah all sorts of fragrant herbs and spices are used in the Moroccan community, including fresh spearmint leaves, rose water, cloves and myrtle branches. Some include the recitation of the Priestly Blessing as well as the Torah portion dealing with Pinhas ben Elazar (Numbers 25:10-25:12) as both of these portions have the theme of peace. Sefer Torah One distinguishing feature between Ashkenazic and Sephardic synagogues are the types of decorative coverings used for the Torah scroll. Moroccan synagogues are known to use the Ashkenazic-type covering in addition to the hard case used by other Sephardim. ==See also== *Moroccan citron ==References== *A Treasury of Sephardic Laws and Customs, Herbert C.

His activities in Greece were interrupted by a spell of religious persecution which was finally resolved through diplomatic negotiations between the United States' and Greek governments. ==Biography== He graduated from Williams College in 1816, and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1819, and was ordained to the ministry of the Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on 17 December 1819. He then pursued missionary work in South Carolina for six months and returned to Andover for a year of graduate work. When Amherst College was founded in 1821, he was appointed professor of the oriental languages and literature, and held the chair until 1828, though he spent the years 1823-1825 working for the Palestine mission of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Syria distributing Bibles and preaching. To prepare himself for his missionary duties outside the United States, he had gone to Paris and studied Arabic under De Sacy. After a brief stay in the United States in 1827/8, he was invited to accompany one of the vessels sent with supplies to the Greeks. He married a Greek woman in 1829, resumed his connection with the American Board in December of that year, and in 1831 moved to Athens, where he spent the rest of his life as a missionary. In 1832 he had established five schools, and in 1835 began to instruct a class in theology. In 1839 a schoolhouse was finished. King's teachings soon attracted the attention of the authorities of the Greek Orthodox Church, and in 1845 he was excommunicated by the synod of Athens. In 1846, and again in 1847, he was cited to appear before a criminal court. In 1847 a series of articles entitled \\"The Orgies of King\\" appeared in an Athens newspaper purporting to describe shameful ceremonies that had been enacted at the missionary's house. In consequence of a popular clamor, King fled to Italy, but in 1848 a friendly ministry came into power, and he returned to Athens. In 1851 he was appointed U. S. consular agent in Athens, and on 23 March 1851 some Greeks, who had come to one of his services at his house for the purpose of making a disturbance, were dispersed only by his display of the American flag. After this a new prosecution was begun against him, and in March 1852 he was condemned to fifteen days' imprisonment and to exile. He had been accused of \\"reviling the God of the universe and the Greek religion,\\" though he had done no more than preach the ordinary Calvinistic doctrines, and though Greece enjoyed nominal religious freedom. King appealed from his prison to the Areopagus, which refused to reverse the decision of the lower court, and he then formally protested against his sentence in the name of the U. S. government. King was then temporarily released, and in the following summer George P. Marsh, then minister to Turkey, was charged by the U. S. government with the special investigation of his case, and also to look into King's title to a lot of land, the use of which he had been deprived of by the Greek government for 20 years with no compensation. The diplomatic correspondence, which fills 200 printed pages of executive documents, resulted in the issue of an order by the king of Greece in 1854, freeing him from the penalty that had been imposed. The action of the U. S. government in this case was of great service to the cause of religious liberty in Greece. In 1865, King was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory After this, King remained in Athens until his death. A Greek Protestant church was erected in Athens in 1874 as the fruit of his labors. Princeton gave him the degree of D.D. in 1832. ==Writings== He revised and translated into modern Greek sixteen volumes, among which were Baxter's Saints' Rest and Lyman Beecher's Sermons on Intemperance. He published a \\"Farewell Letter\\" in Arabic to his friends in Syria (1825), which was translated into various European languages, put on the Index Expurgatorius at Rome, and produced a great effect in the Eastern Churches.

His plays have been staged in Croatian theaters as well as internationally, and some of them have been adapted into feature films. As a composer, he is best known for his film and theatrical music. He has won five Golden Arena awards at the Pula Film Festival. ==Biography== Matišić was born in Ričice, near Imotski. At the age of six, he moved to Zagreb, where he finished elementary and high school. Matišić graduated from the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb, but he never practiced law. Between 1996 and 1998, Matišić worked as a dramaturge in Jadran Film. Since 1998, he works at the Croatian Radio. He is also a docent at the Academy of Dramatic Art, University of Zagreb, where he is head of the Department of Dramaturgy. He is married and a father of three. Literary work Matišić began to write in his senior year in high school. He wrote his first play, Namigni mu, Bruno!, in 1985; it premiered in the Croatian National Theatre in Split in 1987 as Bljesak zlatnog zuba. Upon seeing the play, film director Krsto Papić asked Matišić to help him with the screenplay for My Uncle's Legacy (1988). This was Matišić's first screenwriting credit, and the beginning of collaboration with Krsto Papić, with whom he worked on three more feature films. Matišić's plays have been described as \\"shocking\\". His most controversial play, Angels of Babel (Anđeli Babilona, 1996), staged in Gavella Drama Theatre, features a rural politician that has a sexual intercourse with a sheep, which some interpreted as an allusion to the President of Croatia and some other high-ranked Croatian politicians. From comedies that marked his early career, Matišić moved towards dark humor and more sombre subjects, with death as one of his major themes. Matišić's plays have been staged in Croatia (Split, Rijeka, Varaždin and Zagreb), Macedonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Russia. His more recent theatrical work, Posthumous Trilogy (Posmrtna trilogija, 2006) is a collection of three plays: Sons Die First (Sinovi umiru prvi), No One's Son (Ničiji sin) and The Woman Without a Body (Žena bez tijela). Although these three plays share some common motifs such as fatherhood, belonging and family, and all three end in suicide of the protagonist, Matišić described them respectively as a tragicomedy, a drama, and a dark-humored psychological thriller. No One's Son and The Woman Without a Body have been adapted into feature films, No One's Son and Will Not End Here, both released in 2008. Matišić received Golden Arena awards for Best Screenplay for the films On the Other Side (shared with Zrinko Ogresta) and What a Country!. Music , Matišić composed film music for all five Vinko Brešan's feature films, winning Golden Arena for Best Film Music for two of them: Marshal Tito's Spirit in 2000 and Witnesses in 2003. He won his third Golden Arena for Best Film Music for No One's Son in 2008. Apart from film scores, he composed music for theater and television. Matišić is a multi-instrumental musician and a member of Hot Club Zagreb, a gypsy jazz band with international experience. His long-standing interest is music of Django Reinhardt, which has been the subject of his research for more than two decades. ==Works== Plays: * Bljesak zlatnog zuba (1985) * Legenda o svetom Muhli (1988) * Božićna bajka (1989) * Cinco i Marinko (1992) * Anđeli Babilona (1996) * Svećenikova djeca (1999) * Sinovi umiru prvi (2005) * Ničiji sin (2005) * Žena bez tijela (2005) * Balon (2009) * Fine mrtve djevojke (2013) Feature film screenplays (author or co-author): * My Uncle's Legacy (1988) * Story from Croatia (1991) * When the Dead Start Singing (1998) * Fine Dead Girls (2002) * Infection (2003) * No One's Son (2008) * Will Not End Here (2008) * Flower Square (2012) * The Priest's Children (2013) * On the Other Side (2016) * What a Country!

Cooke was born in Davis City, Iowa, son of Jacob and Lena Stoneburner Cook. Orphaned at 12, he was raised by relatives. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an Apprentice Seaman on 22 November 1920, and progressively rose in rank through Petty Officer and Warrant Officer to Lieutenant Commander before retiring on 1 May 1951. After leaving the Navy, he formed and operated his own engineering firm. Cooke began professional writing in 1934, and continued with multiple-edition technical books throughout his life. He was married to Catherine Elizabeth Rice of Washington, DC, in 1926; they had one daughter, Isabelle E. Cooke, born in 1931. Nelson Magor Cooke died of leukemia at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in November 1965; his home at that time was in Great Falls, Virginia. ==United States Navy== As a youth, Cooke's primary interest was in the emerging radio technology. Without funds for studying engineering at a university, he turned to the Navy for obtaining a technical education and entered military service at age 16. Through on-the-job training and independent study (called “striking for rate”), he attained the Petty Officer rating of Electrician's Mate in minimum time. (During the 1920s and 1930s, technicians with this rating were responsible for radio maintenance.) Training in Navy schools After passing a rigorous admission examination, in 1928 Cooke attended the six-month Radio Materiel School (RMS) at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Bellevue, District of Columbia. His performance at the RMS was such that on 16 October 1928, he received a Warrant Officer appointment as a Radio Electrician, one of the youngest persons ever to receive such appointment. His first assignment after receiving this appointment was on a seaplane tender, the USS Wright (AV-1), where he served for six years. In 1934, Cooke attended the Warrant Officer's Radio Engineering School (RES), also located on the NRL campus. Upon graduating, Cooke was promoted to Chief Radio Electrician (the highest level Warrant Officer) on 18 October 1934. He then returned to the Wright and a year later was transferred to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-3).”Biography: Lieutenant Commander Nelson M. Cooke,” Office of Information, Internal Relations Division, U.S. Navy, 17 August 1967 Instructor in Navy schools In July 1938, Cooke was assigned to the staff of the Radio Engineering School; here he served four years as the Senior Instructor and also as a special advisor and lecturer at the companion RMS. During this time, he developed an extensive set of lecture notes that, published by McGraw-Hill, became his first full book.Cooke, Nelson M.; Mathematics for Electricians and Radiomen, McGraw-Hill, 1942 Cooke also developed a special slide rule that, with an extensive instruction manual, was manufactured and sold commercially by Keuffel and Esser, the primary supplier of engineering slide rules. The Cooke Radio Slide Rule had a 2π scale that was useful in many electrical calculations.K&E; Type 4139 Duplex; http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KEModels/ke4139family.htm Electronics Training Program During the final weeks of 1941, Cooke served on an ad hoc committee formed by the Personnel Division of the Bureau of Navigation (BuNav, then responsible for all training in the Navy) seeking a solution to the crisis in training electronic technicians. The Navy had, or had in production planning, hundred of ships with advanced electronics (radar, sonar, and high- frequency communications), but qualified personnel for maintenance were almost non-existent. It was agreed that persons with an electrical engineering (EE) degree, or at least were graduates of the Warrant Officer's RES, would best fill this need, but they were unavailable in the numbers needed (BuPers was projecting needs in the tens of thousands). The ad hoc committee, coordinated by William C. Eddy and with Cooke, several other leaders from existing schools, and BuNav training specialists as members, developed plans for a training program that would, in 10 months of 12-hour study days, cover all of the key topics in a normal college EE curriculum, as well as having laboratories involving the most current hardware. This activity, commonly called the Electronics Training Program (ETP), was approved by BuPers and initiated in mid-January 1942. To identify personnel potentially capable of being successful in such intensive training, a selection test (commonly called the Eddy Test) was devised. In a published paper by Cooke, it was noted that persons passing the test had an average of 1.5 years of prior college and were in the top two percent on the intelligence-quotient scale.Cooke, Nelson M.; “Mathematics for Electricity and Radio,\\" invited paper, Mathematics-Science Panel of the New York Society for the Experimental Study of Education, 23 March 1943. Published in The Mathematics Teacher, vol. 36, Dec. 1943, pp. 329-332 In its entirety, the ETP was conducted across the Nation and continued until the end of the war. Of the estimated 500,000 persons who took the Eddy Test, only about 30,000 passed, entered the Navy or Marine Corps, and eventually graduated from the ETP.Watson, Raymond C. Jr.; Solving the Naval Radar Crisis: The Eddy Test – Admission to the Most Challenging Training Program of World War II, Trafford Publishing, 2007, The ETP had a Primary School (officially called EE&RM;) and a Secondary School (officially called Advanced RMS). Primary School was mainly given by six engineering colleges across the Nation and, in three months, covered all topics normally in the first two years of an EE curriculum. The Secondary School was given at four Naval facilities, including the RMS Bellevue. For completeness, Bellevue also initially gave a Primary School, and on 15 August 1942, Cooke was commissioned a Lieutenant (jg), and made the Officer-in-Charge of the Bellevue Primary School. He served in this position until May 1943; he was then promoted to Lieutenant and named the Executive Officer of the overall RMS Bellevue. One of his first actions was to transfer the Bellevue Primary School to a college, thus making space for greatly increasing the size of the Secondary School. Further promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 3 October 1945, he remained the leader of RMS Bellevue until late 1946; at that time, the activities were transferred to the Naval Training Center, Great Lakes. For service during his tour of duty at the NRL-RMS, Cooke received a Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy, with authorization to wear the Commendation Medal. The citation includes the following: :For exceptional meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service to the United States Department of the Navy as the leader of the electronics training school at the Naval Research Laboratory, Lieutenant Commander Cooke contributed materially to the successful prosecution of the war against the enemy.Letter of Commendation. From the Secretary of the Navy, 10 Oct. 1945, Service Record. Nelson Mangor Cooke, U.S. Navy Soviet Blockade of Berlin In February 1947, Cooke was assigned to the Staff of Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Germany, as Assistant Technical Officer (Electronics and Aeronautics). Between June 1948 and May 1949, he was responsible for radio communications in the airlift during the Berlin Blockade, for which he was awarded the Medal for Humane Action. In August 1949, Cooke was assigned to the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C., where he headed the Installation Engineering Section until his retirement on 1 May 1951.Biography, U.S. Navy, op. cit. ==Entrepreneur: Cooke Engineering Company== In mid-1951, Cooke established Cooke Engineering Company in Alexandria, Virginia. After operating as a sole-proprietorship firm for 10 years, he took the company public.”Cooke Engineering Files for Stock Offering,” Securities and Exchange Stock Digest, 13 Sept. 1961; https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1961/dig091361.pdf Cooke Engineering also had an operation in San Mateo, California. After Cooke's death, the firm was acquired by Dynatech Corporation in 1968. Under Government contracts, Cooke Engineering engaged in providing engineering services and in developing and manufacturing electronic products. Representative work included analysis of factors affecting naval shore communication stations,”Handbook of Naval Shore Station Criteria,” Cooke Engineering Company, Dec. 1956; http://www.virhistory.com/navy/manuals/92675/92675-00.pdf effects of radiation from buried cables,”Buried Cable Radiation Study, Cooke Engineering Company, Defense Technical Documentation Center, 1959 and electromagnetic coupling between power and control cables.”Power Line Induction Harmonic Tests,” Cooke Engineering Company, Defense Technical Documentation Center,1961 Cooke's Manufactured products included power supplies, amplifiers, and patch panels.”Multi-circuit Switching Connector,” Cooke Engineering Company; http://www.ptodirect.com/Results/Patents?query=PN/3665129 Cooke also formed a Medical Research Division that designed and built microtitration devices (microplates) that were widely used in virological, serological, and immunological laboratory analysis.”The Microtiter System,” Cooke Medical Research; http://jimmunol.org/content/88/3/local/advertising.pdf ==Technical book author== Although lacking a college education, Cooke, through self-study and Navy schools, had acquired considerable mathematical and technical knowledge and a skill for writing about complex subjects in a very readable manner. His publisher, McGraw-Hill, in a 1962 catalog, stated: :Nelson M. Cooke's 1942 book on applied mathematics, Mathematics for Radiomen and Electricians, remains unsurpassed for providing clearly understandable material for radio technicians, and his new book, Basic Mathematics for Electronics based on this earlier masterpiece, is equally of value for the technical college classroom.\\"Books for Technology,\\" McGraw Hill Book Company, Catalog, 1962 Cooke began his experience as a writer in 1934, co-authoring “Preparation for Candidates, Radio Materiel School,” a manual published by the Naval Research Laboratory. His notes as an instructor at the Radio Materiel School and the Warrant Officer's Radio Engineering School were published as Mathematics for Electricians and Radiomen by McGraw-Hill in 1942; widely used as a textbook during the war years, this remains in the reference domain today. After designing a new slide rule for Keuffel and Essel (K&E;) in 1942, he wrote the detailed booklet, “Instruction Manual for the 4139 Cooke Radio Slide Rule.” Cooke's first book specifically for the public was Mathematics Essential to Radio and Electronics: Including Principles of Direct-Current and Alternating-Current Circuits; co-authored by Joseph Orleans; it was published by McGraw-Hill in 1943. Cooke also began a relationship with the Allied Radio Corporation in 1943, editing the \\"Radio Data Handbook: A Compilation of Formulas and Data Commonly Used in the Field of Radio and Electronics\\"; this very popular publication ultimately went through 16 editions.\\"Radio Data Handbook,\\" Allied Radio Corp., fourth edition, 1947; http://www.repeater- builder.com/tech-info/pdfs/allied-data-handbook-4th.pdf In 1945, Cooke teamed with John Marcus, editor of the magazine Electronics, to compile the Electronics Dictionary, published by McGraw-Hill in four editions. A similar book, also co-authored by Marcus, was Electronics and Nucleonics Dictionary, published by McGraw-Hill in 1960. As an outgrowth of his book Mathematics for Electricians and Radiomen, Cooke wrote Basic Mathematics for Electronics, first published by McGraw Hill in 1960. This became a popular textbook in technical schools and was later revised by Herbert Adams and several associate authors through seven editions, the last in 1992. In a recent history of McGraw-Hill, the success of this book is singled out, stating that it had total sales in excess of 485,000 copies.McGraw-Hill Incorporate Company Profile, 2011: http://www.answers.com/topic/the-mcgraw-hill-companies- inc#ixzz1x8uyHZqo Cooke and Adams also co-authored Arithmetic Review for Electronics, published by McGraw-Hill in 1968, after Cooke's death. ==References * Category:20th-century American educators Category:Technical writers Category:1903 births Category:1965 deaths Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:People from Davis County, Iowa Category:People from Great Falls, Virginia ","title":"Nelson M.

In such a centralized system the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important, and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced InfiniBand systems to three-dimensional torus interconnects.Knight, Will: \\"IBM creates world's most powerful computer\\", NewScientist.com news service, June 2007 The term also applies to massively parallel processor arrays (MPPAs), a type of integrated circuit with an array of hundreds or thousands of central processing units (CPUs) and random-access memory (RAM) banks. These processors pass work to one another through a reconfigurable interconnect of channels. By harnessing many processors working in parallel, an MPPA chip can accomplish more demanding tasks than conventional chips. MPPAs are based on a software parallel programming model for developing high-performance embedded system applications. Goodyear MPP was an early implementation of a massively parallel computer architecture.

Another line from Copmanthorpe to Cross Gates was authorised in 1846 and would have joined the line from Harrogate just north of Tadcaster station, but aside from a bridge across the River Wharfe it was never built. Unlike other railway stations on the line, Tadcaster had fully enclosed platforms under a single station canopy. The station building was designed by G. T. Andrews in Gothic style. A lattice footbridge connected the platforms. There were two signal boxes. The northern one controlled the level crossing north of the station and some private sidings beyond it, the southern one which appears to have been closed and dismantled by 1909 controlled the goods yard tracks. The station had a goods office, a goods shed, and an adjacent water tower. Malt houses, breweries, and a flour mill were major freight customers. Much of the passenger traffic resulted from special trains for the students of Tadcaster Grammar School; the number of advertised passenger services was low. The station closed to passenger traffic on 6 January 1964; goods traffic ended on 30 November 1966. The site was bought by Tadcaster Rural Council, and after obtaining permission in 1971 it was completely demolished, with some of the stonework being reclaimed for new housing in the town. Nothing now remains of the station and the site now forms part of an industrial estate just off Station Road with much of the trackbed in the area now largely removed, built on or integrated into the fields which it used to run over. Part of the trackbed is still visible over a bridge over the River Wharfe at nearby Boston Spa.

Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Since the mid-1960s, various allegations have been made about the identities of the men and their involvement in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. ==Early allegations: E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis== E. Howard Hunt and one of the three tramps arrested after JFK's assassination The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination. The men later became known as the \\"three tramps\\". According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw. Appearing before a nationwide audience on the January 31, 1968, episode of The Tonight Show, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination. Later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis. Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield. Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in Rolling Stone and Newsweek. Frank Sturgis and one of the three tramps Dan Carswell, a CIA agent, was allegedly arrested in Dealey Plaza disguised as a tramp hiding in a railroad car behind the grassy knoll, from where witnesses claimed to have heard gun shots The Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), participated in the assassination of Kennedy. The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the \\"derelicts\\" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis, \\"were not shown to have any qualification in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman\\". Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, \\"a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis\\" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men were Hunt or Sturgis. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the \\"tramps\\" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Crisman. According to the Committee, only Crisman resembled any of the tramps; but the same Committee determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination. According to Mark Lane, Sturgis became involved with Marita Lorenz in 1985, who later identified Sturgis as a gunman in the assassination.Lane, Mark. Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK? (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press 1992), pp. 294-97, pp. 298-303. ==Other allegations: Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt== In September 1982, contract killer Charles Harrelson, the father of actor Woody Harrelson, while wanted for the murder of federal judge John H. Wood Jr. \\"confessed\\" to killing Wood and President Kennedy during a six-hour standoff with police in which he was reportedly high on cocaine. Joseph Chagra, the brother of Jamiel Chagra, testified during Harrelson's trial that Harrelson claimed to have shot Kennedy and drew maps to show where he was hiding during the assassination. Chagra said that he did not believe Harrelson's claim, and the AP reported that the FBI \\"apparently discounted any involvement by Harrelson in the Kennedy assassination\\". According to Jim Marrs in 1989's Crossfire, Harrelson is believed to be the youngest and tallest of the \\"tramps\\" by many assassination researchers. Marrs stated that Harrelson was involved \\"with criminals connected to intelligence agencies and the military\\" and suggested that he was connected to Jack Ruby through Russell Douglas Matthews, a third party with links to organized crime who was known to both Harrelson and Ruby. In September 1991, private investigators John Craig and Philip Rogers, who were working on a book about an unsolved murder case, claimed that Charles Rogers, who disappeared in 1965 after the dismembered bodies of his parents were found in a refrigerator, was a CIA operative who was identified by his friends and relatives as one of the \\"tramps\\". According to the Houston Chronicle, a homicide detective who worked on the original murder case of Rogers' parents described the scenario as \\"far-fetched\\". Three months later in a 1991 Newsweek article about Oliver Stone's JFK, Chauncey Holt received national attention for various claims he made regarding the assassination of President Kennedy, including that he was one of three CIA operatives photographed as the \\"tramps\\".Presentation by Mary Holt at the November In Dallas Research Conference 2000. Holt also stated that he was with Harrelson in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination. According to Holt, he was ordered to Dallas to deliver phony Secret Service credentials, but was not involved in killing Kennedy nor did he have knowledge of who did. John Craig and Philip Rogers' 1992 book The Man on the Grassy Knoll eventually connected Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt by alleging that they were the three tramps photographed in Dealey Plaza. According to that book, Harrelson and Rogers were sharpshooters on the grassy knoll, who were assisted by Holt. ==Historical explanation: Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John Gedney== In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney. According to the arrest reports, the three men were \\"taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot\\", detained as \\"investigative prisoners\\", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later. An immediate search for the three men by the FBI and others was prompted by an article by Ray and Mary La Fontaine on the front page of the February 9, 1992, Houston Post. Less than a month later, the FBI reported that Abrams was dead and that interviews with Gedney and Doyle revealed no new information about the assassination. According to Doyle, the three men had spent the night before the assassination in a local homeless shelter where they showered and ate before heading back to the railyard. Interviewed by A Current Affair in 1992, Doyle said that he was aware of the allegations and did not come forward for fear of being implicated in the assassination. He added: \\"I am a plain guy, a simple country boy, and that's the way I want to stay. I wouldn't be a celebrity for $10 million.\\" Gedney independently affirmed Doyle's account, and a researcher who tracked down Abrams' sister confirmed that Abrams lived the life of an itinerant train hopper and had died in 1987. Despite the Dallas Police Department's 1989 identifications of the three tramps as being Doyle, Gedney and Abrams and the lack of evidence connecting them to the assassination, some researchers have continued to maintain other identifications for the tramps and to theorize that they may have been connected to the crime.Fetzer, James H. Assassination Science : Experts Speak Out on the Death of JFK (Open Court, 1998). Photographs of the three at the time of their arrest have fueled speculation as to their identities, as they appeared to be well-dressed and clean-shaven, they claim unlikely for rail riders. Some researchers also thought it suspicious that the Dallas police had quickly released the tramps from custody, apparently without investigating whether they might have witnessed anything significant related to the assassination, and that Dallas police claimed to have lost the records of their arrestsRay and Mary La Fontaine, The Fourth Tramp, Washington Post, 8/94. as well as their mugshots and fingerprints.Groden, Robert J., The Killing of a President, Studio, 1994. . ==See also== *Babushka Lady *Badge Man *Umbrella Man (JFK assassination) ==Further reading== * ==NotesReferences== Category:John F.

State Library Victoria, Unpublished letter. Black sailed to Australia on board the Ariadne and docked in Port Adelaide in 1839. He had the idea of investing in Australian pastoral properties with his partner Mr Alexander Struthers Finlay, of Castle Toward, Argyleshire, Mr Thomas Steuart Gladstone, of Capenock, Dumfriesshire and Mr William Steuart of Glenormiston, Peeblesshire, Scotland. He realised the land was too expensive in Adelaide and visited Melbourne and Sydney. He decided to settle in Port Phillip because he felt it was more of a “Scotch settlement”. He purchased a 17,612 hectare run near Lake Terang in the Western District which he named 'Glenormiston' in 1840. He also bought a run nearby called 'The Sisters' in 1844. The partnership, which was highly remunerative after 1846, continued until 1868 when the property was divided. Black bought Gladstone's portion, now known as Mount Noorat, and resided on it until his death on 15 May 1880. In the 1850s Black visited Scotland again, he lived there for five years where he met Grace Greenshields Leadbetter. They were married in 1857. Black and his wife had three sons, Archibald John, Steuart Gladstone and Niel Walter. Black’s personal papers are held by the State Library of Victoria. His diaries and many letters provide insights into many aspects of life in the Western regions of Victoria in the nineteenth century. They include some revealing commentary on the way he thought land could best be acquired. His journal entry for 9th of December 1839, reads: > The best way [to procure a run] is to go outside and take up a new run, > provided the conscience of the party is sufficiently seared to enable him > without remorse to slaughter natives right and left. It is universally and > distinctly understood that the chances are very small indeed of a person > taking up a new run being able to maintain possession of his place and > property without having recourse to such means — sometimes by wholesale — > but I do not think that this is by any means common, and it its only outside > that they are ever called upon to act in so brutal a manner, it, however, > seems to be little thought of here as it is only done in defense of self or > property … I believe, however, that great numbers of the poor creatures have > wantonly fallen victims to settlers scarcely less savage though more > enlightened than themselves, and that two thirds of them does not care a > single straw about taking the life of a native, provided they are not taken > up by the Protectors. He represented the Western Province from February 1859 to May 1880 in the Legislative Council, and was also a magistrate for the southern bailiwick. As a politician he was a staunch Conservative, and opposed the introduction of free education. ==References==  Journal Articles  * Clark, Ian D. \\"Squatters' Journals - No 43 Autumn 1989\\". latrobejournal.slv.vic.gov.au.

These farmers had been traveling the country trying to find lawyers to listen to their story. As described by John Boyd, President of the National Black Farmers Association (NBFA), “We visited with 14 lawyers, including Johnnie Cochran—all of them turned down the case. Pires and Fraas were the only ones willing to do it.” Pires told the farmers he believed their claims could only succeed if they could get several hundred other farmers with similar claims to join them in a class action. The claims were years and often, decades old, which means that the statute of limitations had long since expired. Pires theorized that if they could show that USDA’s discriminatory practices regarding black farmers was pervasive and longstanding, the case would have wide appeal and the statute of limitations problem could be solved somehow. Pires, Fraas, and the farmers began touring the South, holding meetings to discuss and explain the case. Within a year they exceeded the goal. In September 1997 Pires and Frass filed Pigford v. Glickman in US District Court for the District of Columbia, naming hundreds of plaintiffs and asking the court to certify a class.Pigford v. Glickman (now Pigford v. Vilsack), U.S.D.C., District of Columbia, No. 1:97-cv-1978-PLF Within a few months, noted civil rights leader and attorney J.L. Chestnut of Selma, Alabama joined Pires and Fraas. Battling the Government, Pires succeeded in getting class certification. In 1999 Pires, Fraas, Chestnut, and their colleagues entered into a consent decree that offered two tracks of relief for class members. Under \\"Track A,\\" farmers could obtain a cash payment of $50,000 along with debt relief if they could show that they tried and failed to borrow money from the USDA and that similarly situated white farmers had been approved at the same time they were denied. \\"Track B\\" allowed class members to secure additional relief if they could meet a higher standard of proof. More than 98% of class members chose Track A after Pires explicitly assured the district court that it had access to the data necessary for practically every farmer to meet the requisite standards. When tens of thousands of farmers filed claims, Pires and his fellow attorneys began missing deadlines, leading the judge to observe that their conduct \\"border[ed] on legal malpractice.\\" At one point in the litigation, Pires stated that he had never intended to meet the district court's filing deadlines, and the judge solicited pro bono assistance from law firms in the District of Columbia. Ultimately, over 22,000 people filed claims. By the end of the claims process, over 15,000 claimants had been compensated (an average of $50,000 plus $12,500 to pay taxes on the award) for a total payout of $1.1 billion —making it one of the largest civil rights cases in history. In part because of decisions made by Pires and his co-counsel, thousands of farmers were also denied relief despite Pires's assurance that there was \\"certainty\\" in their success. In 1999 Pires and Fraas filed a Pigford-style case against USDA on behalf of Native American farmers.Keepseagle v. Vilsack, 99-cv-3119, U.S.D.C District of Columbia (EGS) Joseph Sellers of Cohen Millstein and other lawyers took over the lead in the case, which settled it in 2010 for $760 million. In 2000 Pires filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of 435,000 tobacco farmers against the tobacco industry alleging the defendants violated antitrust laws by bid rigging at tobacco auctions.DeLoach, et al. v. Philip Morris Co., et al., U.S.D.C., Middle District of North Carolina, No. 1:00-cv-01235-WLO Due to the heavy demands of the Pigford case, Pires brought in the Washington, DC law firm of Howrey Simon to litigate DeLoach. In 2003 a settlement was reached with all defendants except Reynolds, who settled in 2004. The combined value of the settlement to the plaintiff class was over $1 billion. In addition to Keepseagle, Pires filed Pigford-style cases on behalf of women (Love v. Vilsack)Love v. Vilsack, U.S.D.C., District of Columbia, No. 1:00-cv-02502 and Hispanic (Garcia v. Vilsack)Garcia v. Vilsack, U.S.D.C., District of Columbia, No. 1:00-cv-02445 farmers against USDA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In the summer of 2012, the USDA announced a voluntary administrative process through which women farmers and Hispanic farmers could apply to receive compensation for discrimination by USDA dating back to 1981—in essence validating the claims of the plaintiff in those lawsuits. The total amount of funds available to pay these claims was $1.25 billion. == The Highway One Group == In 1989, Pires formed the Highway One Group, which owns music venues, bars, restaurants and hotels in Delaware. As of 2019, the company employed 475 full and part-time employees at the Bottle & Cork, Rusty Rudder, northbeach, Jimmy's Dewey, Outlet Liquors, Dewey Beach Liquors, Hotel Dewey,ivy, and Hudson Fields. In 2014 Pires and Vikki Walls partnered with Live Nation and Redlight Management to create Delaware Junction, a three day camping country music festival featuring Jason Aldean, Toby Keith, Florida Georgia Line, Cole Swindell, and Thomas Rhett. Pires and Walls also established Hudson Fields (with a capacity of 6,000) which opened in 2017 and has featured Old Dominion, Cole Swindell, Jake Owen, Dirty Heads and Soja. ==Community Bank Delaware== In 2005, Pires started Community Bank Delaware, based in Lewes, Delaware. Since the Bank’s inception, he has served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and, in 2015, he became its CEO. As of June 2020 CBD has assets of $240 million. ==Mayor Cupcake== In 2009, Pires co-wrote, produced and directed the film Mayor Cupcake, with a personal investment of $400,000. The film was shot entirely in Delaware and tells the story of an uneducated cupcake baker who becomes the mayor of a small town. The film, featuring Lea Thompson, Judd Nelson, Frankie Faison, and Dorian Harewood, was selected by various film festivals and is available on demand at Netflix, Comcast, Amazon Prime, and Showtime. ==Teaching== Pires served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center from 1998-2000 where he co-taught a course in Civil Discovery with Diane Cooley. Pires also taught real estate and business law at the University of Maryland. == 2012 Senate campaign == Pires ran as the Independent Party of Delaware candidate in the United States Senate election in Delaware, 2012. He lost to incumbent Senator Tom Carper. == Personal life == Pires is married to Diane Cooley, a lawyer, and has two children. ==References == Category:Delaware lawyers Category:Businesspeople from Delaware Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Candidates in the 2012 United States elections Category:Independent Party of Delaware politicians Category:Boston University alumni Category:University of Miami alumni Category:George Washington University Law School alumni ","title":"Alex Pires"},{"id":"35916916","text":"The Shuo Yuan (), variously translated as Garden of Stories, Garden of Persuasions, Garden of Talks, etc., is a collection of stories and anecdotes from the pre-Qin period (先秦) to the Western Han Dynasty.

Blackett, Independent minister at Southminster, England, where he was born 9 October 1831. Having served his time as a pharmaceutical chemist, he arrived in Melbourne in January 1853, and became a member of the first council of the Pharmaceutical Society, and ultimately its secretary and president. He was also for five years editor of the journal published by that society. On the passing of the Pharmacy Act in 1877, the Government appointed him one of the members of the Pharmacy Board, and on the retirement of Mr. Bosisto he was elected President. He was examiner in chemistry to the College of Pharmacy, and for some time acted as lecturer on chemistry, materia medica, and botany, pending the arrival of Professor A. H. Jackson, B.8o. In 1879 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Fitzroy in the Conservative interest. Mr. Blackett was President of the Royal Technological Commission; and when the Central Board of Health was formed he was offered the position of president, but declined it. In 1882 he was again returned for Fitzroy, but was defeated at the next general election, owing to his pronounced free-trade views. Mr. Blackett was appointed Government Analytical Chemist on the death of Mr. Johnson, in 1887, and is also a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London, and was co-examiner in chemistry to the Melbourne University, until he resigned the office. Mr. Blackett married Miss Margaretta Palmer in May 1870 at Stokesley, England. ==References== Category:1831 births Category:1902 deaths Category:19th-century Australian politicians Category:People from Maldon District ","title":"Cuthbert Robert Blackett"},{"id":"35916953","text":"Anton 'Klin' Ostrovsky (; born on June 6, 1982) is an Israeli actor and rap singer. ==Biography== Anton was born in Novocherkassk, Rostov Oblast, USSR (now Russia) in 1982 as the eldest son.

shopping activities both online and in-stores such as walking into stores, scanning items, making in-app or in-store purchases and submitting receipts. Users are awarded \\"kicks\\" for these actions, and can exchange them for rewards in the form of mobile gift cards. The app is currently available for iOS (both iPhone and iPad) and Android devices. Kicks can be redeemed for various rewards such as gift cards to places like Target, Walmart, and Starbucks as well as donations to charities such as Feeding America and the American Red cross. Most reward denominations start at $2 for various retailers such as TJ Maxx and American Eagle. Shopkick also aggregates deals, sales, and coupons from local brands and retailers for users. Partner stores currently include Best Buy, American Eagle Outfitters, Carter’s, 1800Flowers.com, Torrid, Marshalls, Yankee Candle, TJ Maxx and others. Over time, product kicks have been offered by major brands including P&G;, Unilever, Mondelez, and L’Oreal. Shopkick’s business model is pay-for-performance, with partners working with the company to determine their specific ROI – like in-app content views, products scanned or sold. Shopkick only earns money when the action is completed.Sarah Perez. Shopkick’s rewards shopping app expands to grocery stores. TechCrunch. April 11, 2017. As of April 2017, Shopkick had driven over 200 million store visits, over 270 million product scans in aisle, and over $2.5 billion in total sales from brand and retail partners and was ranked the most engaging shopping app by App Annie in 2017. In October 2014, Shopkick was acquired by SK planet, subsidiary of SK Telecom, the largest telecommunication carrier in Korea, which is also a part of SK Group, a Fortune 100 company. In early 2016, Shopkick acquired the technology and team of Theneeds. In April 2017, Shopkick launched Shopkick Grocery, a product that lets users earn more \\"rewards\\" on their grocery shopping. New products included branded video, list-building, branded content integrations, and \\"kicks\\" for receipts. In August 2017 Shopkick launched Mobile Shopping with partners like eBay, Groupon, Apple, Boxed and Jet.com. Users can now get rewarded for browsing and making purchases online as well as in stores. \\"This is an opportunity to get in front of a captive audience that wouldn’t necessarily be native to us—this is a new audience for us,\\" said Marie Langhout-Franklin, head of partner marketing at eBay.April Berthene. Mobile rewards app Shopkick expands into rewarding online shoppers, and eBay wants in on its loyal mobile audience.. Digital Commerce 360. Aug 15, 2017. In July 2019, Israeli company Trax announced that it had acquired Shopkick. ==Background== Shopkick, based in Redwood City, California (in Silicon Valley), was co-founded by Cyriac Roeding, Jeff Sellinger, and Aaron Emigh in 2009 and has investors that include venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, as well as Reid Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn Corp) and Greylock Partners. The company raised over $20 million in venture funding before being purchased by SK Planet. CEO Cyriac Roeding, founder and EVP of CBS’s mobile unit, created the concept of rewards for walking into stores while an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins. The Shopkick app was released in August 2010, initially with five national retail partners on board: Macy’s, Best Buy, Sports Authority and American Eagle Outfitters, and the Simon Property Group. Other retailers that also have participated or currently are participating in the Shopkick program include Target, TJMaxx, Marshalls, BevMo, Old Navy, Carter’s and OshKosh, Saks Off Fifth, Reebok, Disney Stores, Crate & Barrel, JCPenney, Bare Escentuals and Bed Bath & Beyond. ==Technology== Unlike other location- enabled applications, Shopkick doesn't rely solely on GPS triangulation, because GPS technology is too inaccurate to detect the presence of consumers in stores. Instead, Shopkick uses an inaudible audio signal, unique to each store, which can be detected by smartphone users who have the Shopkick app installed, when the app is open. Once a Shopkick signal is detected, the app delivers reward points called \\"kicks\\" to the user for walking into a retail store, trying on clothes, scanning a barcode and other actions. The audio signal is broadcast through a small transmitter in the store. Shopkick also rolled out a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) presence solution (Apple iBeacon- compatible) in its audio/iBeacon hybrid, called shopBeacon. ==Awards and accolades== * 2017 Appy Award Finalist for Shopkick Grocery in Best App in Marketing/Branding/Advertisinghttps://www.mediapost.com/appyawards/finalists/ * Golden Bevies Solution Provider of the Year (2015)http://www.ebevseries.com/2016/02/05/congratulations-to-the-winners-of- the-2015-golden-bevies-awards/ * Inc's 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies (2014)https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2014/ *World Economic Forum, Tech Pioneer 2013http://www.weforum.org/videos/technology-pioneer-2013-cyriac- roeding-shopkick *The Wall Street Journal, Top 10 Apps of 2010https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/12/31/the-top-ten-iphone-and-android- apps-of-2010/ *Fast Company, World’s 10 Most Innovative Companies in Retailhttp://www.fastcompany.com/1738961/the-10-most-innovative-companies-in- retail *Mashable, Top 10 Apps to Watch in 2011http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/10-apps-to-watch-in-2011/ ==References== Category:Software companies based in California Category:Software companies of the United States ","title":"Shopkick"},{"id":"35917102","text":"Su Liqun (born 16 October 1972) is a Chinese former volleyball player who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese women's volleyball players Category:Olympic volleyball players of China Category:Volleyball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in volleyball Category:Volleyball players at the 1990 Asian Games Category:Volleyball players at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1990 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Asian Games silver medalists for China ","title":"Su Liqun"},{"id":"35917108","text":"is a simulation video game developed and published by Kairosoft for the Android and iOS operating systems. It was released on March 2, 2012 for Android and iOS.https://itunes.apple.com/app/dungeon-village/id530445196?mt=8 The player is placed in control of a role-playing video game's town, and tasks the player with expanding the town and attracting heroes to live in it. It received mostly positive reviews from critics. ==Gameplay== Dungeon Village places the player in control of a village in a stereotypical RPG setting. The main goal of the game is to attract heroes to your town and direct them to fight monsters outside of the city's limits. In order to attract heroes, the player must have the city hold events which attract outside attention and fame, and must improve their city by building new buildings. As monsters arrive, the player can direct heroes to perform quests and give them gifts so they become more favorable to the city. ==Reception== The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the setting and gameplay. IGN's Peter Eykemans called Dungeon Village one of the best Kairosoft games that had been released, noting that the setting was charming and the gameplay was addictive. Eurogamer Chris Schilling highlighted the game as the website's \\"App of the Day\\", praised the addictive gameplay as well, and complimented the developer's sense of humor for playing on storied video game character names for the heroes' names. Gamezebo's Andy Chalk felt that despite the game's simplicity and confusing instructions, that it was incredibly hard to put down. Pocket Gamer Damien McFarren called the game, \\"a resounding success for Kairosoft\\", and praised the game's premise as being more original than other titles in their game library had been. Criticisms of the game mostly focused on its lack of re-playability. IGN's Peter Eykemans felt that the game had little point in a playthrough after beating it once, feeling that the high score system did not give the player enough incentive to play again. Pocket Gamer Damien McFarren echoed Eykemans's criticism about the lack of re- playability. ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:City-building games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Dungeon Village"},{"id":"35917119","text":"Correo Central.

Daguragu community is situated on Aboriginal land held under perpetual title. As of 2006, Daguragu Community Government Council provided \\"municipal and other services to the township and surrounds of Kalkarindji (formerly known as Wave Hill Welfare Settlement) and to Daguragu [Community], a community settled on land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976\\". The total council area was about . Kalkaringi was within a gazetted township area, with the land being leasehold under the auspices of the Northern Territory Government. Daguragu's boundaries and name were gazetted on 4 April 2007. It is named after the Aboriginal community located within its boundaries where in 1975, then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam presented the title to the land granted to the Gurindji people following the events of the Wave Hill walk-off in 1966. As of 2020, it has an area of . Daguragu Community was amalgamated into the Victoria Daly Shire on 1 July 2008. Daguragu is located within the federal division of Lingiari, the territory electoral division of Stuart and the local government area of the Victoria Daly Region. The 2016 Australian census reported that Daguragu had a population of 242 people of whom 233 () identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. ==Heritage sites== The Wave Hill walk-off route was listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 23 August 2006 and on the Australian National Heritage List on 9 August 2007. There are also seven other associated sites on the National Heritage List, of which five are in the Kalkaringi area and two within Daguragu. ==2020 Wave Hill native title== A native title claim was lodged in 2016 by the Central Land Council on behalf of the traditional owners, as there were mining interests in area covered by Wave Hill Station's pastoral lease. On 8 September 2020, the Federal Court of Australia recognised the native title rights of the Gurindji people to of the Wave Hill Station, allowing them to receive royalties as compensation from resource companies who explore the area. Justice Richard White said that the determination recognised Indigenous involvement (Jamangku, Japuwuny, Parlakuna-Parkinykarni and Yilyilyimawu peoples) with the land \\"at least since European settlement and probably for millennia\\". The court sitting took place nearly south of Darwin, and descendants of Lingiari and others involved in the walk-off celebrated the determination. The owners will participate in the mining negotiations and exploration work, from which royalties may flow in the future, which may allow people in the Kalkarindji and Daguragu communities to create their own businesses. Just as important is the right to hunt, gather, teach and perform cultural activities and ceremonies, and allow the young people to connect with their land. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Article by the author of the 2017 book A Handful of Sand: The Gurindji Struggle, After the Walk-off. ** Category:Populated places in the Northern Territory Category:Victoria Daly Region ","title":"Daguragu, Northern Territory"},{"id":"35917225","text":"Zhang Jingsong (born 2 September 1973) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players from Shanxi Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Taiyuan Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Basketball players at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games ","title":"Zhang Jingsong"},{"id":"35917241","text":"Zheng Wu (; born 7 August 1967) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics and in the 2000 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players from Zhejiang Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Hangzhou Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Basketball players at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1994 Asian Games ","title":"Zheng Wu"},{"id":"35917258","text":"Dragan Plamenac (born DraganCroatian sources often incorrectly cite his birth name as Karl.

His Trois poèmes de Ch. Baudelaire for voice and piano, he published in 1915 already as Plamenac. Siebenschein; 8 February 189515 April 1983) was a Croatian Jewish composer and musicologist. Plamenac was born as Karl Siebenschein in Zagreb on 8 February 1895. His father, Robert Siebenschein, and grandfather, Josip Siebenschein, were leaders of the Israelites Zagreb community. His father was also the president of Croatian Music Institute from 1919 to 1929. Plamenac graduated at the law school of the University of Zagreb. He studied composition with Franz Schreker in Vienna in 1912-13 and with Vítězslav Novák in Prague in 1919. He studied musicology with André Pirro at the Sorbonne in Paris and in 1925 completed his doctoral dissertation on motets and chansons by Johannes Ockeghem, supervised by Guido Adler at the Universität Wien. From the time of his stay in Paris, he had close contacts with Geneviève Thibault de Chambure (Comtesse de Chambure) and Nanie Bridgman [both well-known French musicologists from his generation], who also studied with Pirro. He first worked as the piano accompanist at the Städtische Oper (today Deutsche Oper Berlin; 1926–27). Then in 1928 he began teaching musicology at the University of Zagreb as the private assistant professor. In 1939 Plamenac went to the United States as the Yugoslav representative to the congress of the American Musicological Society in New York City, and decided to remain in New York due to frequent persecution of Jews in Europe and World War II, becoming an American citizen in 1946. Plamenac was professor of music at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1954 to 1963, visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh (1964–65) and the University of California at Santa Barbara (167). He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Illinois in 1976. Plamenac was the first to indicate to the value of the works of Croatian renaissance and baroque periods, particularly compositions by Ivan Lukačić and Tomaso Cecchino) which he published in modern editions. Plamenac died on 15 April 1983 in Ede, Netherlands. In Plamenac's honor, Croatian Musicological Society awards every year Dragan Plamenac Award to best scientific achievement, primarily related to Croatian musical culture, Croatian or foreign scientists in the field of musicology. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:1895 births Category:1983 deaths Category:People from Zagreb Category:Croatian Jews Category:Austro-Hungarian Jews Category:Croatian Austro-Hungarians Category:Croatian musicologists Category:Croatian composers Category:Jewish classical composers Category:20th- century classical composers Category:Male classical composers Category:20th- century musicologists Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Dragan Plamenac"},{"id":"35917272","text":"Chen Ke (born 16 May 1979) is a Chinese basketball player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players from Beijing Category:Bayi Rockets players Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Asian Games silver medalists for China Category:Basketball players at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games Category:2002 FIBA World Championship players ","title":"Chen Ke (basketball)"},{"id":"35917283","text":"Zhang Yunsong (born 20 March 1977) is a Chinese basketball player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Beijing Ducks players Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players from Beijing ","title":"Zhang Yunsong"},{"id":"35917285","text":"Press illustration of Act 3, scene 2, of Verdi's Jérusalem (1847) showing Molinier as a herald (presumably in front, just to the right of the platform, holding a scroll) MolinierInfrequently spelled Molinié (Tamvaco 2000, vol. 2, p. 740). was the stage name of François Gély (1807–1859), a French operatic baritone who mostly performed minor roles at the Paris Opéra.Tamvaco 2000, vol. 2, p. 740.

The poem is a product of Leopardi's yearning to travel beyond his restrictive home town of Recanati and experience more of the world which he had studied. It is widely known within Italy. == Themes == Portrait of Giacomo Leopardi The poem, though vague and ethereal in its composition, conveys elements of the philosophical and classical worlds, the latter visible in the selection of the word ermo, from ancient Greek rather than using a more conventional 'solitario' to convey the isolatedness of this hill. This personification of natural environment is prominent throughout the poem and is typical of another theme or movement often associated with Leopardi; romanticism. There is also a keen sense of mortality throughout the poem, conveyed in the dying of seasons and drowning of thoughts, akin to Leopardi's belief that he would not live long, a belief affirmed when he died aged only 38.() == Original Text == Sempre caro mi fu quest’ermo colle, e questa siepe, che da tanta parte dell’ultimo orizzonte il guardo esclude. Ma sedendo e mirando, interminati spazi di là da quella, e sovrumani silenzi, e profondissima quïete io nel pensier mi fingo; ove per poco il cor non si spaura. E come il vento odo stormir tra queste piante, io quello infinito silenzio a questa voce vo comparando: e mi sovvien l’eterno, e le morte stagioni, e la presente e viva, e il suon di lei. Così tra questa immensità s’annega il pensier mio: e il naufragar m’è dolce in questo mare. == Literal English Translation == Always dear to me was this solitary hill and this hedge, which, from so many parts of the far horizon, the sight excludes. But sitting and gazing, endless spaces beyond it, and inhuman silences, and the deepest quiet I fake myself in my thoughts; where almost my heart scares. And as the wind I hear rustling through these trees, I, that infinite silence, to this voice keep comparing: and I feel the eternal, the dead seasons, the present, and living one, and the sound of her. So in this immensity drown my own thoughts: and sinking in this sea is sweet to me. ==Alternate translation== This lonely hill was always dear to me, and this hedgerow, which cuts off the view of so much of the last horizon. But sitting here and gazing, I can see beyond, in my mind’s eye, unending spaces, and superhuman silences, and depthless calm, till what I feel is almost fear. And when I hear the wind stir in these branches, I begin comparing that endless stillness with this noise: and the eternal comes to mind, and the dead seasons, and the present living one, and how it sounds. So my mind sinks in this immensity: and foundering is sweet in such a sea. (translated by Jonathan Galassi) ==Sonnet translation== I’ve always loved this solitary hill, I’ve always loved this hedge that hides from me So much of what my earthly eyes can see. For as I sit and gaze, all calm and still, I conjure up my thoughts; my mind I fill With distances that stretch out boundlessly And silences that somehow cannot be Heard by my heart, which feels a sudden chill. It seems these rustling leaves, this silence vast Blend into one. Eternity draws nigh. The present sounds and seasons, those long past Become one sea of endless lives and deaths. My thought is drowned, and yet it does not die: It plunges into sweet, refreshing depths. (translated by Z.G., with the title \\"Boundless Depths\\") ==Modern usage== The poem is recited in the film One Hundred Steps by the film's hero Impastato, with which the film draws a parallel between Impastato and Leopardi. ==See also== * Monte Tabor (Recanati), the described mountain in the poem. ==References== Category:1819 poems Category:Italian poems Category:Giacomo Leopardi ","title":"L'infinito"},{"id":"35917391","text":"The AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is the United States Marine Corps next generation Air Surveillance/Air Defense and Air Traffic Control (ATC) Radar. The mobile active electronically scanned array radar system is currently being developed by Northrop Grumman and was expected to reach initial operating capability in August 2016. ==Mission and Description== The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is a single materiel solution for the mobile Multi-Role Radar System and Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) requirements. It is a three-dimensional, short/medium range multi-role radar designed to detect unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, air breathing targets, rockets, artillery, and mortars. G/ATOR satisfies the warfighter's expeditionary needs across the Marine Air-Ground Task Force spectrum replacing five legacy radar systems with a single solution. The five Marine Corps legacy radar systems being replaced by this multi-function capability include: the AN/TPS-63 (air defense), AN/TPS-73 (air-traffic control), AN/MPQ-62 (short range air defense), AN/TPQ-46 (counter-fire target acquisition) and UPS-3 (target tracking). Additionally, it will augment the AN/TPS-59 long-range radar. The Program Executive Office (PEO), Land Systems Marine Corps is executing the G/ATOR program as an evolutionary acquisition program consisting of four capabilities, referred to as blocks. * Block 1 will complete the primary material system acquisition and can support the short-range air defense and air surveillance mission, as well as provide an Air Defense/Surveillance Radar (AD/SR) capability to the MAGTF Commander. * Block 2 will include software to perform the missions of ground counter-battery/fire control (Ground Locating Weapons Radar). * Block 3 capabilities are not currently defined or resourced, and have been deferred indefinitely. * Block 4 will provide air traffic control capabilities (Expeditionary Airport Surveillance Radar). G/ATOR System Configuration G/ATOR provides real-time radar measurement data to the Tactical Air Operations Module, Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), Composite Tracking Network, and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System. The G/ATOR baseline system configuration consists of three subsystems: * Communications Equipment Group (CEG). The CEG provides the ability to communicate with and control the radar and is mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. * Radar Equipment Group (REG). The REG consists of the phased-array radar mounted on an integrated trailer. The trailer is towed by the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR). * Power Equipment Group (PEG). The PEG includes a 60-kilowatt generator and associated power cables mounted on a pallet. The generator pallet is carried by the MTVR. ==Development== Development of the G/ATOR began in September 2005 when the Marine Corps awarded a $7.9 million contract to Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems. Initial design requirements required planning for short-range air surveillance, counter-battery fire and target acquisition, and sensor networking. The requirement also required Block 1 to allow for incremental implementation of the following blocks without equipment or software redesign. In 2009, a $14 million cost overrun for the G/ATOR, attributed to requirements creep and increasing cost of scarce materials required in advanced electronic components. In 2012 the Marine Corps and Northrop Grumman began Block 2 development, beginning with upgrading the Block 1 equipment and software for performing GWLR requirements. The G/ATOR program obtained a successful Milestone C decision in March 2014. In October 2014, a 207.3 million dollar low rate initial production (LRIP) contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman for the first lot of four systems. In March 2015, another contract worth $113 million was awarded to produce two additional systems to be delivered in October 2017. In September 2015, the Marine Corps awarded Northrop Grumman a $58.7 million contract to incorporate and test the GWLR mode for the G/ATOR. In September 2016, the Marine Corps awarded Northrop Grumman a $375 million contract for nine additional LRIP systems that will incorporate gallium nitride (GaN) technology. On June 10, 2019, the Marine Corps awarded Northrop Grumman a $958 million contract for full-rate production of 30 GaN G/ATOR Systems. A total of 57 G/ATOR systems are planned for procurement. On December 6, 2019, the Marine Corps awarded Northrop Grumman a $188 million contract for the firm-fixed-price portion of a previously-awarded contract (M67854-19-C-0043). This modification is for the purchase of six Gallium Nitride full-rate-production systems and associated travel in support of Program Executive Officer Land Systems, Quantico, Virginia. ==Main characteristics== * Multipurpose Tracking & Surveillance Radar * Proven S-band (2–4 GHz), 3D Radar * Detects fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, cruise missiles, and UAVs * Performs ATC and fire finder roles * High mobility, transportability, and reliability * The entire system can be airlifted into an operational site by three CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopters or MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, or by a single C-130 transport. * The system is required to be set up on-site within 45 minutes. * Provides identification of friendly aircraft using a Telephonics UPX-44 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) integrated with the main radar. ==Nomenclature== Per the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), the nomenclature AN/TPS-80 is thus derived: * \\"AN/\\" indicating Army/Navy (Marines) -- a system nomenclature derived from the JETDS * \\"T\\" for 'transportable', indicating it is carried by, but not an integral part of, a vehicle (compare with 'V' for vehicle-mounted) * \\"P\\" indicating a RADAR * \\"S\\" is for Detecting, Range and Bearing, Search * \\"80\\" is the 80'th version of this family of TPS radars ==See also== *Counter-battery radar *AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar *AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar *ARTHUR (radar) *AN/TPQ-53 Quick Reaction Capability Radar *AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel ==References *Northrup Grumman.com (G/ATOR) Category:Ground radars Category:Military radars of the United States Category:Northrop Grumman radars Category:Weapon Locating Radar Category:Targeting (warfare) Category:Military radars of the United States Marine Corps ","title":"AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar"},{"id":"35917406","text":"Yat sang ho kau () is a Cantonese-language Hong Kong album by Danny Chan, released by Warner Music (WEA) in June 1989.

Island. It is their second studio album under Warner Music Japan and third studio album overall in the country. Recorded in South Korea in the midst of the band's promotions there, the band aimed to make 20 [Twenty] their most mature album to date. The album spawned three singles prior to its release—\\"Let It Go!\\", \\"Distance\\", and \\"Neverland\\"—which all charted within the top ten spots of the weekly Oricon singles chart. 20 [Twenty] was released on May 16, 2012, in three editions: a CD-only edition, a CD and DVD edition, and a Lawson edition.

He penned the song \\"Stay\\", which is based on his personal relationship experiences. He initially wrote the lyrics in Korean, then translated them into Japanese, using a translator where he was unable to translate the lyrics by himself. The process between three and four hours. Choi Min Hwan and Song Seung Hyun worked on the songs \\"Always\\" and \\"Compass\\" together while in high school. Discussing \\"Always\\", Choi Min Hwan compared the song to \\"Satisfaction\\" in that one may feel a similar \\"atmosphere and a strength\\", but noted that there was more emphasis of sorrow in \\"Always\\". \\"Paper Plane\\" is a medium-tempo song, which features a dense snare drum. \\"Distance\\" was written by Kenn Kato, Song Seung Hyun and Lee Jae Jin, and composed by Corin. Lead singer Lee Hongki had difficulty singing the song, stating that the key he sang in was very high. 20 [Twenty] was recorded while F.T.

He is best known for his hit charity single \\"The Lost Boy\\" and for co-writing \\"Home\\", the 2012 debut single for American Idol-winner Phillip Phillips. ==Early life== Holden was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and lived in Methlick in Aberdeenshire until he was three. The family then moved to Lancashire in England, and he was raised in Morecambe and then Leyland. He went to St. Patrick's Primary School, Heysham near Morecambe, then attended Leyland St. Mary's Catholic Technology College and the University of Central Lancashire. Holden started learning to play the guitar when he was 18. After graduating in 2005, he went to Brighton with his band. He then moved to London in 2007 to attempt a career, before moving to New York City in 2009. He relocated to Los Angeles in July 2016. ==Music career== Holden wrote his first song called \\"You Go Left, I'll Go Right\\" when he was 18. He won the Lancashire Evening Post Battle of the Bands in 2005. Greg first gained a large following by posting live videos of himself performing his songs on YouTube. One series of videos was called the \\"Not My Living Room Tour\\" where he performed for his fans in their living rooms. Greg Holden's debut album, A Word in Edgeways (2009, 9 tracks) was followed by the EP Sing for the City. All of Holden's albums were initially either self-released or released on his own label, Falling Art Recordings. In 2009, Holden moved to New York soon after the release of his first album. A few months later, he toured as a support act for Ingrid Michaelson in the US after she heard him live in his previous visit to New York. His songs have been featured on several TV shows, for example a track from A Word in Edgeways, \\"Choking on the Concrete\\", was featured on an episode of the TV show Private Practice. Other shows include ABC's Make It Or Break It, One Tree Hill and the CW's Life Unexpected. 2011–2014: I Don't Believe You Greg Holden's second album, I Don't Believe You, was funded by fan donations using Kickstarter in 2010 which raised $30,000. In late 2010 Holden started recording his second studio album with producer Tony Berg in Los Angeles. The album was released in May 2011, and an acoustic version of I Don't Believe You was also released in March 2012, including 2 bonus tracks, one of which is \\"The Lost Boy\\". \\"The Lost Boy\\" was written by Holden in 2011 but was not included in the original release of the album, but added in its subsequent releases. It was inspired by the book What is the What by American writer Dave Eggers about Sudanese refugees. Holden recorded it and released as a charity single on 20 December 2011, and it became a hit for him in the Netherlands, topping the Dutch iTunes singles chart on Christmas Day and reaching No. 2 on the Dutch Top 40. In December 2013, he released an official video for \\"The Lost Boy\\" after his album I Don't Believe You was re-released in the US when he became signed by Collective Sounds. The song \\"The Lost Boy\\" was featured in an episode of the TV show Sons of Anarchy in 2012, where it was used as the musical backdrop to the funeral procession of Opie Winston. In the following week debuted at No. 36 on the Billboard Rock Charts, selling over 20,000 copies. Holden's single \\"I Need An Energy\\", which was released on 26 October 2012, is used on the soundtrack of the film, Chasing Mavericks. Holden has toured throughout Europe and the United States as a headliner. The Dutch leg of his 2012 European tour sold out months in advance. He has also toured with A Great Big World, BOY, The Lone Bellow, and Jukebox the Ghost. =\\"Home\\"= In 2012, Holden became known in the United States for \\"Home\\", a song he co-wrote with Drew Pearson. The song was picked by American Idol mentor Jimmy Iovine for Phillip Phillips as his coronation song for the final of the show's season 11. The song quickly topped the US iTunes singles chart and became the best-selling song by an American Idol alum with over 5 million copies sold. In 2014, \\"Home\\" was named one of the most performed pop songs of 2013 by ASCAP, and Holden also performed \\"Home\\" at the 2014 ASCAP Award Ceremony.  2015: Chase the Sun  In 2014, Holden worked with Greg Wells to record a new album. He signed a record deal with Warner Brothers, and the new album, Chase the Sun, was released on 14 April 2015. It was preceded by the single \\"Hold On Tight\\", which debuted in the Triple A chart April 2015. The single was released on 27 January 2015, and its video on 18 February 2015. The album also includes \\"Boys in the Street\\", which was written after he was asked by Everyone Is Gay, an organization that supports LGBTQ youth, to contribute to their 2014 fundraiser compilation, The Gayest Compilation Ever Made II. Holden co-wrote three songs on A Great Big World's sophomore album When The Morning Comes (which was released on 13 November 2015): All I Want Is Love, The Future's Right In Front Of Me and When The Morning Comes. ==Discography== Albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:25em;\\"  Album details !colspan=\\"1\\"Peak chart positions !rowspan=\\"2\\"Notes - !NL Top 40 - ! scope=\\"row\\"A Word in Edgeways  *Released: 19 February 2009 *Label: Falling Art Recordings *Formats: digital download align=\\"center\\"-  - ! scope=\\"row\\"I Don't Believe You  *Released: 31 May 2011, 30 September 2013 *Label: Falling Art Recordings, Collective Sounds *Formats: CD (2013), digital download (2011, 2013)  align=\\"center\\" Re-released in 2013 - ! scope=\\"row\\"I Don't Believe You (Acoustic Version)  *Released: 13 March 2012 *Label: Falling Art Recordings *Formats: CD, digital download align=\\"center\\"22  - ! scope=\\"row\\"Chase the Sun  *Released: 14 Apr 2015 *Label: Warner Bros *Formats: CD, digital download   - ! scope=\\"row\\"World War Me  * Released 29 March 2019 * Label: Falling Art Music * Formats: CD, Vinyl, Digital   - } EPs *2007: Run, Don't Walk *2009: Sing for the City Singles {  !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !rowspan=\\"2\\"Title !colspan=\\"4\\"Peak chart positions !rowspan=\\"2\\"Album - !US Rock !US AAA !NL Top 40 Top40.nl: greg Holden - \\"The Lost Boy\\" song page !NL Single Top 100 DutchCharts.nl - Single Top 100 - Greg Holden page discography - 2011 \\"The Lost Boy\\" align=\\"center\\"36 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\"15 align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"Non-album song - 2015 \\"Hold On Tight\\" align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" 15 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"Chase the Sun - 2016 \\"Exactly Like You\\" align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"30 Days, 50 Songs - } ;Others *2012: \\"I Need an Energy\\" (on soundtrack of film Chasing Mavericks) *2015: \\"Boys in the Street\\" (in collective album The Gayest Compilation Ever Made II.

It existed from 1919 until 1957. The highway ran north from Monroe, where it connected with US Highway 24 (US 24, Telegraph Road), to Flat Rock where it terminated at an intersection with US 24/US 25\\\\. Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville. The trunkline was progressively scaled back to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957. ==Route description== When it was decommissioned in 1957, M-56 started at an intersection with US 24 (Telegraph Road) on the west side of Monroe. From there, the trunkline ran southeasterly along Elm Avenue to an intersection with US 25 (Dixie Highway, now M-125) in downtown. M-56 also intersected US 24A (now Interstate 75, I-75) just outside town. The highway continued northeasterly past Sterling State Park and along Brest Bay in the communities of Detroit Beach and Woodland Beach. Turning inland near Stony Point, the trunkline followed Dixie Highway across the Swan Creek. North of the creek, Dixie Highway met US Turnpike, and M-56 followed Dixie Highway northward into South Rockwood. In that village, the trunkline turned northeasterly parallel to US 24 to cross the Huron River. On the north side of the river, M-56 followed the southernmost end of Fort Street to Huron River Drive, turning northwesterly along the latter road. The highway ran through an intersection with US 24A and parallel to the river into Flat Rock, where it terminated at the intersection with US 24/US 25 (Telegraph Road, now just US 24). ==History== When the state highway system was first signposted in 1919, M-56 was assigned to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the Belleville area. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US 25. In the 1940s, the northern end was rerouted north from New Boston to follow M-112 along the Willow Run Expressway (now I-94 and part of the Detroit Industrial Freeway) into Belleville north to US 112. In late 1954 or early 1955, the northern end was changed again, this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston. The northern end was shortened again to terminate at US 24/US 25 in Flat Rock in 1956. The remainder of the highway from Monroe to Flat Rock was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year, becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References 056-1 Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Michigan Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Michigan ","title":"M-56 (1919–1957 Michigan highway)"},{"id":"35917572","text":"Ignacio Luis Arcaya Rivero (Santa Ana de Coro, 3 May 1912 – Caracas, 4 September 1990 Ignacio Luis Arcaya Rivero, accessed 24 May 2012), was a Venezuelan lawyer and politician.

Some sources state that Christianity was brought to the Isle of Man around 500 AD by Celts from Ireland, perhaps by St. Patrick himself. Trade links between the islands have existed for a long time, owing to their geographic proximity. Until the Isle of Man was integrated into the commercial system of England in 1765, the Isle of Man's trade with Ireland surpassed that of any other country. Both countries have branches of the Celtic league, and there are regular music festivals and other cultural events that celebrate their common Celtic heritage. The languages of Ireland, Irish Gaelic and of the Isle of Man, Manx Gaelic are also similar, and in 1947, Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera spearheaded efforts to save the dying Manx Gaelic language. Additional joint work on language preservation started as recently as 2008. According to a 2011 census, 1.9% of the population of the Isle of Man were born in Ireland. ==Visit of Eamon de Valera== On 23 July 1947 Taoiseach Éamon de Valera made an official one-day state visit to the island. He was escorted around the island by the director of the Manx Museum, Basil Megaw and the attorney-general, Ramsey B. Moore. When he found out that no good sound recording of the near- extinct Manx language were in existence he offered to send someone over from Ireland to make a recording. De Valera ordered that a recording device be bought and on 21 April 1948 a man was sent over to make the recordings. ==Constitutional Position of Isle of Man== The Isle of Man is a Crown dependency of the British Crown, and not part of the United Kingdom. As such, the Isle of Man does not itself have diplomatic relations with any other country. It has no diplomatic service of its own. Instead, its foreign affairs are dealt with by the British government. ==Tax agreements== The Isle of Man has developed a sophisticated financial services infrastructure. It had also, over many years, developed a reputation as a tax haven. An Irish commission reported in 2001 that Irish banks held £4 billion in the Isle of Man on behalf of Irish residents, which was more than twice the amount held there per capita by UK residents. To address the issue of offshore banking and potential tax evasion, the governments of Ireland and the Isle of Man committed in 2002 to develop a tax agreement. In 2008, Ireland signed several tax agreements with the Isle of Man – the first such agreements made by the Irish government with any international financial centre. These agreements serve two general purposes: # The information exchange provisions make it more difficult for citizens to evade taxes by placing them in offshore tax havens, by providing a standard way for authorities to request information about assets and property held by their citizens (for example, an Irish citizen placing money in a Manx bank, or a Manx citizen holding real estate investments in Ireland). # The relief of double taxation provisions help avoid double taxation on income for citizens of both countries. ==Environment and energy== Ireland and the Isle of Man have collaborated on preparing reports and jointly pressing the UK government to shut down the Sellafield nuclear plant. According to the governments, the location of the Sellafield plant, close to both the Isle of Man and Ireland, poses an environmental risk. Isle of Man and Ireland have also had discussions about the development of renewable energy sources, including sharing costs for the development of a wind farm off the coast of the Isle of Man. An intergovernmental collaboration platform called the Irish Sea Region has also been set up. The platform links the governments of Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the UK, and various local jurisdictions, to collaborate on planning for development of the Irish Sea and bordering areas. In 2004, a natural gas interconnection agreement was signed, linking Ireland with Scotland via the Isle of Man. ==See also== *British-Irish Council *Common travel area *Foreign relations of the Republic of Ireland ==References== Man Category:Foreign relations of the Isle of Man Category:Politics of the British Isles Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations ","title":"Ireland–Isle of Man relations"},{"id":"35917737","text":"The 1974–75 NBA season was the Hawks' 26th season in the NBA and 7th season in Atlanta.1974–75 Atlanta Hawks An unusually high total of eight Hawk players averaged double figures in points per game for the season, though Lou Hudson only played in eleven games. ==Offseason== Draft picks ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:95%;

It starred Emil Jannings. A complete version of the film had been considered lost for years. A digitally restored and reconstructed version premièred on 17 September 2011. The restored film includes the original music by composer Eduard Künneke that had been commissioned for the film by Lubitsch. Lubitsch is thought to have made The Loves of Pharaoh to show Hollywood that he could make an epic. The Loves of Pharaoh was his last German feature before he migrated to Hollywood in 1923. ==Restoration== The restoration was done by Thomas Bakels of Munich- based Alpha Omega GmbH, the company that did the digital 2001 and 2010 restorations on Fritz Lang's 1927 Metropolis. Bakels spent five years on the digital restoration; the Munich Film Museum did the reconstruction. The complete version of The Loves of Pharaoh had been lost, so restoration had to be done from parts of the film that had been found in various countries. The largest part came from a 35mm tinted nitrate print the German Federal Archives had acquired from a film archive in Russia in the 1970s. The Russian footage lasted only 55 minutes and was missing all the scenes dealing with love and emotion. This version revolved around the massive combat sequences. The restoration extended the Russian version with footage from an Italian nitrate print of Pharaoh that the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, had acquired in 1998. The Italian print had been fragmented but contained the missing love scenes. To this was added other footage, and the title cards, which had turned up during the Munich Film Museum's restoration work on another movie. According to the introduction of the restoration, about of the original of film is still missing. ==Plot== Pharaoh Amenes (Emil Jannings) receives glad tidings: King Samlak of Ethiopia proposes an alliance, to be cemented by the marriage of Amenes to Samlak's daughter, Makeda. Sothis, Amenes's master builder, reports there has been an accident at the construction site of the treasury and begs for more time for his workers' sake, but Amenes is unmoved. As Samlak and Makeda trek to Amenes, Ramphis, the son of Sothis, spots Makeda's despised Greek slave, Theonis. Entranced, he takes her home with him. When Ramphis tries to kiss Theonis, she playfully runs away toward the treasury, unaware that the penalty to approach the place is death. Ramphis chases after her, but they are caught and brought before Amenes. Pharaoh sentences them both to be executed at dawn. Theonis throws herself at his feet and begs him to spare Ramphis, as it was all her fault. Amenes immediately falls under her spell. He offers to let Ramphis live in return for her. Theonis rejects him, but seeing Ramphis about to be crushed underneath a gigantic stone slab, she gives in. Amenes commutes Ramphis's sentence to a life working in the quarries; the prisoner is told that Theonis has been executed. Amenes decides to make Theonis his queen, mortally offending King Samlak. Samlak raises his army and invades the country. Meanwhile, Ramphis triggers a rebellion at the quarry when he goes to the aid of a stricken fellow prisoner. He escapes in the confusion when the news of the invasion breaks. Back in Amenes's city, Pharaoh prepares to lead out his army. Before he leaves, however, he demands that Theonis swear an oath not to take another man if he is killed in battle. When she refuses, he orders that she be sealed within the treasury. He has Sothis show him the secret entrance to the treasury, then has the builder blinded. Samlak launches a surprise attack on Amenes's camp, routing the defenders. He personally shoots an arrow into the back of Amenes, causing him to fall from his fleeing chariot. Before he succumbs, Amenes asks Samlak not to harm Theonis. Ramphis makes his way home. When he learns what has happened to his father and Theonis, he enters the treasury, intent on killing Theonis, blaming her for his father's blinding. However, when he sees her, he cannot go through with it. Samlak marches on the city. He gives the terrified inhabitants a choice: give up their queen or he will sack the city. Theonis, apprised of the situation, decides to give herself up, but instead, Ramphis rallies the soldiers and prepares an ambush, having the army hide in and around the treasury, and lets Samlak break down the gates and enter the city. Then the Egyptians attack the unsuspecting and celebrating Ethiopian army. The Egyptians are victorious. Queen Theonis chooses Ramphis as her king, to the delight of the soldiers. Then Amenes shows up, haggard but still alive. The chief priest tells him he has lost his throne, but that Theonis is still his wife. No one dares challenge the law of the gods. In desperation, Ramphis offers him back the throne in return for Theonis. When the couple leave the palace, the mob turns on them, stoning them to death, despite Amenes's attempt to stop it. Distraught, Amenes returns to his throne, then falls down dead. ==Cast== *Emil Jannings as Pharaoh Amenes *Paul Biensfeldt as Menon, Amenes's governor *Friedrich Kühne as Oberpriester *Albert Bassermann as Sothis *Harry Liedtke as Ramphis *Paul Wegener as Samlak *Lyda Salmonova as Makeda *Dagny Servaes as Theonis ==See also== *List of historical drama films * List of rediscovered films ==References * Category:1922 films Category:1920s historical films Category:German films Category:German epic films Category:German historical films Category:German silent feature films Category:Romantic epic films Category:Films of the Weimar Republic Category:Films directed by Ernst Lubitsch Category:Films set in ancient Egypt Category:German black-and-white films Category:Films shot in Germany Category:1920s rediscovered films Category:Rediscovered German films ","title":"The Loves of Pharaoh"},{"id":"35917967","text":"Acalypha eremorum is a species of shrubs of the plant family Euphorbiaceae, endemic to Queensland, Australia. Commonly known as soft acalypha, turkey bush or native acalypha . The species grows as an open branched shrub to 2 m tall with small leaves with crenate margins. Plants may shed their leaves in response to prolonged drought. Branches often end in spines, especially on smaller plants. Small flowers are produced in spikes throughout the year and are followed by deeply lobed capsular fruit. Acalypha eremorum occurs naturally in forest understorey, primarily in the drier closed forest types such as vine scrub though occasionally in open forest.

An equivalent definition is A^* = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n :\\\\,\\\\omega_n\\\\cdotx^n < A \\\\\\\\}, where \\\\omega_n is the volume of the unit ball and where A is the volume of A. == Definition for functions == The rearrangement of a non-negative, measurable real-valued function f whose level sets f^{-1}(y) (y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}_{\\\\geq0}) have finite measure is : f^*(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\mathbb{I}_{\\\\\\\\{y: f(y)>t\\\\\\\\}^*}(x) \\\\, dt, where \\\\mathbb{I}_A denotes the indicator function of the set A. In words, the value of f^*(x) gives the height t for which the radius of the symmetric rearrangement of \\\\\\\\{y: f(y)>t\\\\\\\\} is equal to x. We have the following motivation for this definition. Because the identity : g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\mathbb{I}_{\\\\\\\\{y: g(y)>t\\\\\\\\}}(x) \\\\, dt, holds for any non-negative function g, the above definition is the unique definition that forces the identity \\\\mathbb{I}_{A}^* = \\\\mathbb{I}_{A^*} to hold. == Properties == Function and its symmetric decreasing rearrangement preserve the measure of level sets. The function f^* is a symmetric and decreasing function whose level sets have the same measure as the level sets of f, i.e. : \\\\\\\\{ x: f^*(x)>t\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{x: f(x)>t\\\\\\\\}. If f is a function in L^p, then : \\\\f\\\\_{L^p} = \\\\f^*\\\\_{L^p}. The Hardy–Littlewood inequality holds, i.e. : \\\\int fg \\\\leq \\\\int f^* g^* . Further, the Pólya–Szegő inequality holds. This says that if 1 \\\\leq p < \\\\infty and if f\\\\in W^{1,p} then : \\\\ abla f^*\\\\_p \\\\leq \\\\ abla f\\\\_p. The symmetric decreasing rearrangement is order preserving and decreases L^p distance, i.e. : f \\\\leq g \\\\Rightarrow f^* \\\\leq g^* and : \\\\f - g\\\\_{L^p} \\\\geq \\\\f^* - g^*\\\\_{L^p}. == Applications == The Pólya-Szegő inequality yields, in the limit case, with p = 1, the isoperimetric inequality. Also, one can use some relations with harmonic functions to prove the Rayleigh–Faber–Krahn inequality. == Nonsymmetric decreasing rearrangement == We can also define f* as a function on the nonnegative real numbers rather than on all of Rn. Let (E,μ) be any σ-finite measure space, and let f:E\\\\to[-\\\\infty,\\\\infty] be a measurable function that takes only finite (i.e., real) values μ-a.e. (where \\"μ-a.e.\\" means except possibly on a set of μ-measure zero). We define the distribution function \\\\mu_f:[0,\\\\infty]\\\\to[0,\\\\infty] by the rule :\\\\mu_f(s)=\\\\mu\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in E:f(x)>s\\\\\\\\}. We can now define the decreasing rearrangment (or, sometimes, nonincreasing rearrangement of f as the function f^*:[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to[0,\\\\infty] and the rule :f^*(t)=\\\\inf\\\\\\\\{s\\\\in[0,\\\\infty]:\\\\mu_f(s)\\\\leq t\\\\\\\\}. Note that this version of the decreasing rearrangement is not symmetric, as it is only defined on the nonnegative real numbers. However, it inherits many of the same properties listed above as the symmetric version. Namely: :f and f* are equimeasurable, i.e. they have the same distribution function. :The Hardy-Littlewood inequality holds, i.e. \\\\int_Efg\\\\;d\\\\mu\\\\leq\\\\int_0^\\\\infty f^*(t)g^*(t)\\\\;dt. :f\\\\leq g μ-a.e. implies f^*\\\\leq g^*. :(af)^*=af^* for all real numbers a. :(f+g)^*(t_1+t_2)\\\\leq f^*(t_1)+g^*(t_2) for all t_1,t_2\\\\in[0,\\\\infty). :f_n\\\\uparrowf μ-a.e. implies f_n^*\\\\uparrow f^*. :(f^p)^*=(f^*)^p for all positive real numbers p. :\\\\f\\\\_{L_p(E)}=\\\\f^*\\\\_{L_p[0,\\\\infty)} for all positive real numbers p. :\\\\f\\\\_{L_\\\\infty(E)}=f^*(0). The (nonsymmetric) decreasing rearrangement function arises often in the theory of rearrangement- invariant Banach function spaces. Especially important is the following: :Luxemburg Representation Theorem. Let \\\\rho be a rearrangement-invariant Banach function norm over a resonant measure space (E,\\\\mu). Then there exists a (possibly not unique) rearrangement-invariant function norm \\\\overline{\\\\rho} on [0,\\\\infty) such that \\\\rho(f)=\\\\overline{\\\\rho}(f^*) for all nonnegative measurable functions f:E\\\\to[0,\\\\infty] which are finite-valued μ-a.e. Note that the definitions of all the terminology in the above theorem (i.e., Banach function norms, rearrangement-invariant Banach function spaces, and resonant measure spaces) can be found in sections 1 and 2 of Bennett and Sharpley's book (cf. the references below). == See also == *Isoperimetric inequality *Layer cake representation *Rayleigh–Faber–Krahn inequality *Riesz rearrangement inequality *Sobolev space *Szegő inequality ==References== Category:Multivariable calculus Category:Real analysis ","title":"Symmetric decreasing rearrangement"},{"id":"35918031","text":"Solar power in South Carolina is rapidly becoming competitive with grid electricity, due to the decrease in cost and the eight-year extension to the 30% federal tax credit, which can be used to install any size system.Tax Credits Extended: Renewable Energy Industry Breathes Sigh of Relief South Carolina offers a 25% tax credit, meaning that 55% of the cost is covered through tax credits.Solar power picking up some heat in S.C.

They replace older patrol craft and some of the Type 053H frigates. The first Type 056 entered service in February 2013. An anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant, commonly known as Type 056A, has also entered service. Following construction of the Aba in December 2019, China ceased building of Type 056 corvettes to focus on procuring bigger warships for high sea missions.China Builds its last and final Type 056 Corvette. Navy Recognition. 17 January 2020. Two 1800 ton patrol variant, P18N has been delivered to Nigeria and four 1300 ton corvette variant has been sold to Bangladesh. ==Description== 583 Shangrao YJ-83 ASM launchers FL-3000N SAM launcher Radar The Type 056 corvette fills the capability gap between the Type 022 missile boat and the Type 054A frigate. It is 90 metres long, displaces 1500 tons, and incorporates anti-radar features. The Type 056 is suited for mid-range green-water missions and littoral duties, but not for major blue-water combat operations; it is built with a 15-day endurance for combat missions such as patrol, escort and protection of EEZ maritime interests within from the coast, freeing up larger warships for open ocean deployment.China's 36th & 37th Type 056 Corvettes (Jiangdao class) Commissioned in PLAN South Sea Fleet – Navyrecognition.com, 28 November 2017 The Type 056 corvette has crew of 78 people with a top speed of , and a range of at .Type 056 class – Military-Today.com Surface armament is reported as an AK-176 76 mm naval gun, two 30 mm autocannons, and four YJ-83 anti-ship missiles. FL-3000N surface-to-air missiles are carried in a single eight-cell launcher. Finally, there are two triple-tube 324 mm torpedo launchers, which may carry Yu-7 light ASW torpedoes. The basic Type 056 is equipped with Type 347G (LR66) radar and bow-mounted sonar. The Type 056A adds towed array and variable depth sonars (VDS); the towed body suggests the VDS is \\"not an exact copy\\" of either the Italian/US DE-1163 or the French DUBV-43. It is likely that the Chinese will have undertaken extensive trials and analysis of any imported equipment and built a nominally indigenous system using the knowledge gained. The Type 056 has a helicopter deck for a Z-9-sized helicopter, but no hangar. ==Development== The Type 056 hull may have been based on the Pattani- class offshore patrol vessels, which were built in China for Thailand from 2005 to 2006. The first ship was launched by Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding in May 2012. In late 2012, corvettes were being produced by four Chinese shipyards. The Type 056A were in production by late 2013. One of the first, 593 Sanmenxia, was launched in November 2013 with a modified hull to accommodate the added ASW gear. ==China Coast Guard variant== A Type 056 variant for the China Coast Guard was under construction at Huangpu in late-2014. The forward superstructure was moved back to make for a raised structure ahead of the bridge. Large davits were installed ahead of the flight deck on both sides of the ships. It is not expected to be armed with the 76 mm. gun, missiles, or other weapon systems. ==Variants== The P18 corvette is the export version of the Type 056. The P18 is advertised as displacing 1,800 tons, with a length and a beam; the power plant is two MTU 20V 4000M diesel engines, for a maximum speed of ; armament may include a 76 mm. gun, two 30 mm. cannon, up to eight anti-ship missiles, and two triple torpedo launchers; a medium-sized helicopter may be carried. In 2014, the P18 was reportedly considered by Kazakhstan to fill a requirement for up to nine ships. In late 2014, Argentina reportedly agreed to purchase five P18s, two to be built in China, and the remainder to be co-produced in Argentina. The ships would be called the Malvinas class, and have towed array sonar and an enlarged landing deck to handle Sea King helicopters. Each ship may cost . Bangladesh The C13B corvette is the surface warfare corvette variant of the Type 056 corvette for the Bangladesh Navy. The corvettes displace 1,330 tons and are in length. It is armed with a H/PJ-26 76 mm gun, C-802A anti-ship missiles, FL-3000N SAMs and two H/PJ-17 30mm remote controlled gun turrets. The C13B lacks sonar and ASW weapons. Like the Type 056, there is a helicopter pad but no hangar. The corvette has a reported speed of . The first batch of two corvettes was ordered from Wuchang Shipyard in Wuhan, reportedly in October 2012. The ships were laid down on 8 January 2013. Shadhinota (F111), the lead ship, was launched on 30 November 2014. The second ship, Prottoy (F112) was launched on 30 December 2014. Shadhinota and Prottoy were commissioned on 19 March 2016. The second batch of two corvettes was ordered on 21 July 2015 to China. Construction of the ships began on 9 August 2016. The third ship of the class, Shongram (F113), was launched on 12 February 2018. The fourth ship of the class, Prottasha (F114) was launched on 8 April 2018. The Bangladesh Navy has received the final two Shongram and Prottasha corvettes. The corvettes were handed over to the service on 28 March and arrived at the naval base in Chittagong on 27 April 2019, said ISPR. According to Jane's 360, the latest two appear to be equipped with a more advanced phased-array radar unlike the first two ships of the class. Nigeria The P18N offshore patrol vessel (OPV) is the variant operated by the Nigerian Navy. The P18N displaces 1,800 tons, is long, has an endurance of 20 days, a maximum speed of and a range of at . It has a crew of 75. Armament is reportedly a single NG-16-1 76 mm gun with a TR47 fire-control radar, two 30 mm guns, and two 20 mm guns. The class has an Oil Support Recovery System to combat oil spills. Unlike the Type 056, the P18N has a helicopter hangar. Nigeria ordered two P18Ns from CSOC in April 2012 for each. The first was slated to be completed in China, with the final 50–70% of the second being completed at the Nigerian Naval Shipyard in Port Harcourt; CSOC was contracted to upgrade the shipyard to facilitate this. NNS Centenary (F91), the first P18N, was built at the Wuchang Shipyard in Wuhan. It was launched January 2014 and completed trials in October 2014. Centenary left China in December 2014 and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria in February 2015; it was commissioned the same month. Delivery was originally expected in mid-2014. The second OPV, NNS Unity (F92), was reported in February 2015 to be undergoing outfitting at Wuchang, and was expected to be delivered in 2015. Nigeria had originally expected to receive it in mid-2014 for completion at Port Harcourt. The ship was delivered on 4 November 2016 to the Nigerian Navy in Lagos. NNS Unity was commissioned on 15 December 2016. In January 2017 the vessel was deployed to The Gambia in a \\"show of strength\\" as part of an ECOWAS sponsored intervention in the 2016–17 Gambian constitutional crisis. ==Ships in class== ; {  ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  # ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Pennant Number ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Name ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Builder ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Launched ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Commissioned ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Fleet ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Status - ! colspan=8 Type 056 - 1 501 信阳 / Xinyang   March 2015 North Sea Fleet Active - 2 503 宿州 / Suzhou  May 2014 February 2015   - 3 505 秦皇岛 / Qinhuangdao Hudong October 2014 16 October 2015 North Sea Fleet Active - 4 511  保定 / Baoding   December 2016 East Sea Fleet Active - 5 512 菏泽 / Heze   December 2016 East Sea Fleet Active - 6 580 大同 / Datong   May 2013  Active - 7 581 营口 / Yingkou   August 2013 North Sea Fleet Active - 8 582 蚌埠 / Bengbu   February 2013  Active - 9 583 上饶 / Shangrao      - 10 584 梅州 / Meizhou   July 2013 South Sea Fleet Active - 11 585 百色/ Baise      - 12 586 吉安 / Ji'an      - 13 587 揭阳 / Jieyang   January 2014 South Sea Fleet Active - 14 588 泉州 / Quanzhou   August 2014 East Sea Fleet Active - 15 589 清远 / Qingyuan Huangpu  June 2014 South Sea Fleet Active - 16 590 威海 / Weihai      - 17 591       - 18 592 泸州 / Luzhou Wuhan  June 2014 South Sea Fleet Active - 19 595       - 20 596 惠州 / Huizhou   July 2013 Hong Kong Garrison Active - 21 597 钦州 / Qinzhou   July 2013 Hong Kong Garrison Active - ! colspan=8 Type 056A - 22 502 黄石 / Huangshi Hudong  March 2015 North Sea Fleet Active - 23 593 三门峡 / Sanmenxia Hudong November 2013 November 2014 East Sea Fleet Active - 24 594 株洲 / Zhuzhou   November 2014 South Sea Fleet Active } ; {  ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Pennant Number ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Name ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Builder ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Launched ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Commissioned ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Status -  F111  Shadhinota  Wuchang  30 November 2014  11 December 2015  Active -  F112  Prottoy  Wuchang  30 December 2014  11 December 2015  Active -  F113  Shongram  Wuchang  12 February 2018  18 June 2020  Active - F114  Prottasha  Wuchang  8 April 2018   Sea trial } ; {  ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Pennant Number ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Name ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Builder ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Launched ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Commissioned ! 079;color:#fff;\\"  Status - F91 Centenary Wuchang January 2014 February 2015 Active -  F92 Unity Wuchang 29 November 2014 15 December 2016 Active - } ==Comparable ships== Ships of comparable role and size: *Descubierta-class corvette *D'Estienne d'Orves-class aviso *MEKO 140 *Minerva-class corvette *Pohang-class corvette *Qahir-class corvette *Sa'ar 5-class corvette *Kora-class corvette *Buyan-class corvette *Karakurt- class corvette *Project 22160-class patrol ship ==See also== *List of active People's Liberation Army Navy ships ==References Category:Corvette classes Category:Corvettes of the People's Liberation Army Navy Category:2010s ships ","title":"Type 056 corvette"},{"id":"35918205","text":"Louis Jacques Bégin Louis Jacques Bégin (2 November 1793, Liège – 13 April 1859) was a French military physician.

Crutchfield (born 1955) is an American mathematician and physicist. He received his B.A. summa cum laude in Physics and Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1979 and his Ph.D. in Physics there in 1983. He is currently a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Davis, where he is Director of the Complexity Sciences Center—a new research and graduate program in complex systems. Prior to this, he was Research Professor at the Santa Fe Institute for many years, where he ran the Dynamics of Learning Group and SFI's Network Dynamics Program. From 1985 to 1997, he was a Research Physicist in the Physics Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He has been a Visiting Research Professor at the Sloan Center for Theoretical Neurobiology, University of California, San Francisco; a Post-doctoral Fellow of the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at UCB; a UCB Physics Department IBM Post-Doctoral Fellow in Condensed Matter Physics; a Distinguished Visiting Research Professor of the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; and a Bernard Osher Fellow at the San Francisco Exploratorium. ==Research== Over the last three decades Crutchfield has worked in the areas of nonlinear dynamics, solid-state physics, astrophysics, fluid mechanics, critical phenomena and phase transitions, chaos, and pattern formation. His current research interests center on computational mechanics, the physics of complexity, statistical inference for nonlinear processes, genetic algorithms, evolutionary theory, machine learning, quantum dynamics, and distributed intelligence. He has published over 100 papers in these areas. ==Life== While a graduate student, Crutchfield and students from the University of California, Santa Cruz (including Doyne Farmer) built a series of computers that were capable of calculating the motion of a moving roulette ball, predicting which numbers could be excluded from the outcome. Equipped with hidden electronic equipment of the early days of \\"mobile\\" computing, trials in Las Vegas showed success. However, because of technical limitation and the infamous gambler's ruin, the success was only partial and it was not feasible to use to make large profits. A book written about this project (The Eudaemonic Pie / Newton's Casino: The Bizarre True Story of How a Band of Physicists and Computer Wizards Took on Las Vegas) describes Crutchfield in his early years as \\"hacker-in-residence\\": \\"Crutchfield surfs, snorkels, and backpacks.

As no presidential candidate received an absolute majority in the first round of voting, a runoff took place on 30 November. Primary elections to determine each party's presidential candidate had been held on 1 June. Incumbent President José Mujica was ineligible to run owing to a constitutional limit on serving consecutive terms. The governing Broad Front nominated Mujica's predecessor, Tabaré Vázquez, as its candidate. Vázquez came within a few thousand votes of a first-round victory and advanced to the runoff with National Party canddiate Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou, son of former president Luis Alberto Lacalle de Herrera. In the runoff, Vázquez was returned to office with the widest margin since the run-off system was first implemented in 1999. The Broad Front also maintained its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 50 of the 99 seats. ==Electoral system== The president was elected using the two-round system, with a run-off required if no candidate received 50% of the vote in the first round.

The result was an extremely powerful visual and emotive experience for all involved. A special booklet reproduced every art work and written story and the additional production of a selection of postcards highlighting specific artists also provided professional development opportunities for the participating artists.

It was the primary railway station serving Gympie from 1881 until 1989. ==Original railway station== Dead end station in 1882 View of the yard in 1882 After the discovery of gold in October 1867 by James Nash in Gympie, the requirement of a railway line linked to a port became apparent. In 1877, the Queensland Government approved the construction of three railways to connect mining towns to their principal ports: Townsville to Charters Towers; Bundaberg to Mount Perry; and Maryborough to Gympie. The station buildings at Gympie and Maryborough were positioned at the terminus of the track line, marking the railway's dead end status. The line opened on 6 August 1881. Architectural plans for Railway Drivers and Firemen's quarters, 1905 Within a year of the line opening, Gympie representatives began lobbying for a rail link to Brisbane and on 17 July 1891, the Gympie to Brisbane line was opened. This is when the original building was re-sited from the end of the track to the southern side of the line, allowing the line to pass through Gympie. ==1913 station== The passing of the North Coast Railway Act in 1910 which linked the separate regional divisions of Queensland Railways into one network, provided increased spending and construction works within Queensland railways. Construction commenced on the present station in 1913, which commenced operations on 1 December 1913. The station was based on the Queensland Railways A ‘Pagoda’ standard design. Positioned on an island platform the long narrow chamfer-board building housed: a bar; refreshment room and servery; waiting room; ladies room; station master's office; telegraph and booking office; and a sheltered sales area. The smaller upper floor housed: the kitchen; scullery; and pantry. This floor was serviced by a hand-operated lift. Major works Other major works to improve the facilities include *A subway and luggage lift to provide access from the southern end of the island platform to the station entrance. *An adjacent underpass to replace the gated crossing between Station Road and Mellor Street. *A large timber two-span overbridge with steps leading from the island platform and steps leading onto Lady Mary Terrace and Station Road. Closure After 1906, gold production declined and by 1925 the last of the big mines had ceased operations. Agriculture and dairying had begun to emerge as key industries within the Gympie district and in 1915 the Mary Valley branch railway was opened. These industries heavily relied on rail transport. Fruit trains began operating from Gympie to Melbourne from 1923, and in 1929 the Gympie Fruit Growers Co-operative Association erected their premises opposite the station on Tozer Street. By the 1930s, the Gympie Railway Station Complex had evolved into one of Queensland's most substantial and busy railway complexes. In 1963 a new ticket and parcel office was built within the former parking area adjoining the subway entrance (where the Gympie Family History Society is now located). For over a century the station complex was intrinsically linked to the economy of Gympie and surrounding areas and played an important role in Queensland's rail network however by the end of the 1980s it had become mostly redundant.

It was shut down indefinitely by Transport & Main Roads, as it was declared unsafe to convey passengers. Following flood damage in 2013, the railway disbanded.

Also known as the \\"Gympie Whirlwind\\" or the \\"Gympie Tornado\\", Archie Bradley was the Australian Welterweight Champion from 1922–1924. At the height of his popularity Bradley was afforded huge publicity with whole pages of magazines and newspapers devoted to his boxing career. It was not uncommon for over 12,000 fans to fill stadiums in Brisbane and Sydney to watch him fight. In the 1920s his stamina and athletic ability as both a boxer and a professional rugby league footballer became legendary.The Archie Bradley story:the fighting career of Archie Bradley from Gympie, Queensland. Compiled by Keith Parker. ==Personal life== Bradley was born at Wickham Street, Gympie, Queensland on 4 January 1897. He was the seventh of 10 children born to John (b. 1860, Ulverston) and Minnie Bradley (née Gierke, b. 1866, Toowoomba). ==Career== In September 1917 Bradley had his first professional fight against Joe Healy at the Theatre Royal in Gympie. After 15 rounds the fight was awarded to Healy in a controversial decision. Bradley went on to win 14 fights in Gympie before travelling to Brisbane in 1918, at the age of 21 years, to further his career. In an eight-month period in Brisbane he had seven wins in seven bouts--against boxers such as \\"Smiling Georgie\\" Malouf, Roy Hayward, Bert Secombe and Jimmy Hill. After a loss to Silvino Jamito on a foul in the fifth round, he went on to outpoint Eugene Volaire and knock out the famous Eddie Lynch after nine rounds of furious fighting. In August 1921 Bradley beat Sid Godfrey on points. In 1922 he took the welterweight crown from Tommy Uren, and was later described as \\"probably the greatest fighter to come out of [Queensland]\\" . He had a break from boxing from August 1925 – September 1926, but was out of form on his return, losing soundly to Jim Cox. ==Life after boxing== After his retirement from boxing, Bradley bred greyhounds for racing, and produced champions including \\"Archie's Wonder\\", \\"Bradley's Best\\", and \\"Archie's Gift\\". He also managed a relative of his who was taking up heavyweight boxing, Col Daley, who went undefeated for at least 29 fights. He kept up his associations with the sport until at least the 1950s, attending tournaments at mission stations. == References == * Category:Australian male boxers Category:Australian rugby league players Category:People from Gympie Category:1897 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Welterweight boxers ","title":"Archie Bradley (boxer)"},{"id":"35918542","text":"Śāṭhya (Sanskrit; Tibetan phonetic: yo) is a Buddhist term translated as \\"hypocrisy\\", \\"dishonesty\\", \\"deception\\", or \\"concealment of shortcomings\\".

Using this method, he created a plan known as \\"The Dan Plan\\". Prior to The Dan Plan, McLaughlin had never played a full 18 holes of golf and had no previous experience as a competitive athlete. Dan developed his skills by practicing golf for 30 or more hours each week and originally planned to hit the 10,000 hour goal by October 2016. Dan wished to make a successful appearance in the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament to eventually obtain his PGA Tour card and win amateur events, aiming to reach a golf handicap of 2 or less. The best handicap he reached was 2.6 in January 2014, and in the end, in January 2015, was back up to 5.5.http://thedanplan.com/statistics-2/ Dan quit the plan and started Portland Soda Works with his neighbour, Chris Onstad.https://thesandtrap.com/b/thrash_talk/post_mortem_on_the_dan_plan ==Early life== McLaughlin is the youngest in his family, with a brother who worked as an actuary like their father, and a sister who is a dermatologist. As a child he competed at tennis and, for one year, cross country. Intending to go to graduate school, Dan saved $100,000 over a 6-year span by renting out rooms in his house and limiting his expenses to $2,000 a month. McLaughlin also has lived in Australia for five months and worked as a waiter to earn money. Like his brother, McLaughlin went to Boston University to study physics and math but he quit after a year. McLaughlin then attended the University of Georgia where he completed a degree in photojournalism then worked for a year in Chattanooga, Tennessee. ==Career== After graduating from the University of Georgia, McLaughlin pursued a career in photography. After two years of being a photographer at Chattanooga Times, he began doing commercial photography in Atlanta, Georgia. He then moved to Portland, Oregon. ==Golf== At the age of 30, with hopes of becoming a professional golfer, McLaughlin quit his job on April 5, 2010 and lived off of his savings. The goal of McLaughlin’s plan was to qualify for the PGA Tour at the end of the 10,000 hours of practice. This would be accomplished by competing in the annual PGA Q-School. A handicap factor of 2.0 is required to be allowed entry in the pre-qualifying stage. Learning method McLaughlin had no experience in golf. Starting in early 2010, McLaughlin began learning golf with the putter. McLaughlin learnt the game beginning from the hole and working further and further away. The only club McLaughlin used for the first three months was the putter. He then progressed to the pitching wedge, then the sand wedge. McLaughlin only used a larger club once he showed proficiency with the smaller golf clubs. In November 2011, McLaughlin began using the driver and a full set of 14 clubs in January 2012. Statistics and handicap factor Sine playing his first full round of golf in August 2011, McLaughlin kept detailed statistics on his progress such as handicap, greens in regulation and driving accuracy. As of November 6, 2013, McLaughlin had a handicap factor of 5.2. McLaughlin last reported his handicap factor of 5.5 in April 2015. McLaughlin has not updated any statistics since then.Dan Plan Blog McLaughlin's Trackman Combine score as of December 2012 was 66.9. Equipment McLaughlin received some equipment free of charge from Nike. He used the following golf clubs: Driver: Nike VR Pro Limited Edition, 10.5 degree loft, Project X 5.5 Shafts; Woods: 3 wood – 15 degree loft, 5 wood – 19 degree loft, Project X 5.5 Shafts; Irons: 3-PW – VR Pro Blades, True Temper Dynamic Gold Shafts; Grips: Lamkin full cord grips. ==Influences== McLaughlin based his goal of 10,000 practice hours on a misinterpretation of a theory by Dr. K Anders Ericsson, Professor of Psychology at Florida State University. At the beginning McLaughlin tested this theory with the help of Christopher Smith (a PGA golf instructor), Shawn Dailey (a strength trainer) and Jeremy Dunham (a cinematographer). McLaughlin was not certain that by following this program he could become a professional golfer but he was more determined on proving how one's work ethic and dedication can allow people to accomplish things that they would have never thought possible. ==Personal lifeReferences== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:University of Georgia alumni Category:Photographers from Oregon Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon ","title":"Dan McLaughlin (golfer)"},{"id":"35918548","text":"Munro's Camp Bunya Mts – circa 1910 Hector Munro (23 September 1859 - 18 December 1930) was the eldest son of George Munro, born on 'Boondooma Station', Queensland, which was managed by his father.

It was found that the ground was too low and hard digging, resulting in shallow burials that caused distressing odours. Tozer Park Cemetery was closed in 1886. The cemetery was relocated to its current location on Corella Road at Two Mile, and an area of 60 acres was granted. Families were granted new plots in lieu of plots already purchased in the old cemetery. They were also able to exhume loved ones and move their headstones to place in the Two Mile Cemetery and family graves were established. However many headstones remained until the 1980s. The first person to discover gold in the Gympie area, James Nash is buried in the cemetery.

During the French and Indian War the Cherokee were sought after as allies by the British and Provincial Colonial Governments to help contest the frontiers against the French and their Indian allies. An alliance was formed and both sides initially fulfilled each other's expectations. The Cherokee provided warriors and in return the British and Provincials provided supplies and protection of the warriors homelands. However, the alliance unravelled and soon incidents by both sides provoked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. ==Background== The British had reports that indicated the French were planning to build forts in Cherokee territory (as they had already done with Ft. Charleville at Great Salt Lick on the Cumberland River); Ft. Toulouse, near present-day Montgomery, Alabama; Ft. Rosalie at Natchez, Mississippi; Ft. St. Pierre at modern day Yazoo, Mississippi; and Ft. Tombeckbe on the Tombigbee River). With the Cherokee now their allies, the British hastened to build forts of their own in the Cherokee lands, completing Fort Prince George near Keowee in South Carolina among the Cherokee Lower Towns; and Fort Loudoun in the Overhill towns. Once the forts were built, the Cherokee raised 400 warriors to fight in western Virginia Colony under Ostenaco. Oconostota and Attakullakulla led another large group to attack Fort Toulouse. Fort Loudoun was built as an outpost of the British and their colony of South Carolina during the French and Indian War as part of an alliance treaty with the Cherokee in return for a field force of Cherokee warriors to help in the campaign against the French at Fort Duquense. The Virginians in particular were desperate for Cherokee assistance against the French and their Shawnee Indian allies. The fort was to be both a trading post supplying manufactured goods, guns and powder to the Cherokee as well as providing additional defense of the Cherokee Middle Towns as well as a refuge for Cherokee women and children while their warriors were away on campaign. Building of the fort began by 120 troops of Sergeant William Gibbs' South Carolina Provincial Militia accompanied by 80 British regulars and was continued by Captain Postell's Company of construction into 1757. It was named after General John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, the British Commander in Chief in North America. It was sited on the south side of the Little Tennessee River on high ground about five miles below the Cherokee capitol town of Chota. The elongated diamond-shaped fort was designed by a German engineer, William Gerald de Brahm, who departed before completion on Christmas Day 1756. The earthen walls topped with wooden palisades 15 feet high and 100 feet long on each side and the 4 corners were 2 large and 2 small bastions each mounting 3 small cannon or swivel guns. The moat was some 50 feet wide and there was a ravelin covering the front gate. When completed, operational and garrisoned by 90 regulars and 120 provincial troops in the summer of 1757 the troops families moved to the fort and a small community was started.Kaufmann, pp.87-88. The view of reconstructed fort interior from Bastion King George to the barracks. The fort remained dependent on white settlements nearly 200 miles east over the Appalachian Mountains for much of their supplies. Fort Loudoun's first commander was Captain Raymond Demeré who was friendly with the Cherokee, he was replaced by his brother, Paul Demeré whose overbearing nature exacerbated bad relations with the Cherokee. In 1759 Captain John Stuart and a reinforcement of 60 or 70 artillerymenNichols, John L.. John Stuart Beloved Father of the Cherokees, Highlander Magazine, Sept./Oct. 1993. of the South Carolina Provincial Regiment, known as the 'Buffs' after their facing colors, arrived bringing supplies of meat, flour, salt, ammunition and clothing. The alliance between the Cherokee and the British began to unravel with the British expedition under General Forbes against Fort Dusquesne in 1758. The Cherokee felt their efforts were unappreciated. Conocotocko, then the leading chief of the Cherokee, ordered his warriors home. Later, a contingent of Cherokee warriors under Moytoy accompanied Virginian troops on a campaign against the Shawnee of the Ohio Country. During the expedition, the enemy proved elusive. After several weeks, the Tuscarora contingent left, while that of the Cherokee stayed, but dwindled. Then, a group of Cherokee warriors scalped and killed one or more white settlers and deceptively attempted to proclaim to the British the scalps belonged to their enemies in order to receive a reward.Letter to John Ross from Principal Chief Charles Renatus Hicks, dated July 15th, 1825 Suspicious of the truth, the British soldiers disarmed and briefly detained them, and then chose to send them home. Some Cherokees, who had not been involved in the treachery, were bitter over this treatment, and raided Virginia's frontier settlements while returning to the Tennessee Valley. Virginia settlers got angry and banded together to pursue the Cherokee, attacking them and killing, scalping and mutilating 20 of the Indians, later collecting the bounty offered for enemy scalps.Mooney, p.41. Although Dinwiddie, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, apologized other Virginians called them horse thieves. Some Cherokees retaliated and the situation spun out of control. The new governor of South Carolina, William Henry Lyttelton, declared war on the Cherokee in 1759.Mooney, p. 42. Conley, p.47. The governor embargoed all shipments of gunpowder to the Cherokee and raised an army of 1,100 provincial troops which marched to confront the Lower Towns of the Cherokee. Desperate for ammunition for their fall and winter hunts, the nation sent a peace delegation of moderate chiefs to negotiate. The thirty-two chiefs were taken prisoner, as hostages, and, escorted by the provincial army, were sentAnderson, p.460. to Fort Prince George and held in a tiny room only big enough for six people.Conley, p.47. Three of the chiefs were released conditionally, Lyttleton thought this would ensure peace. As smallpox broke out among his troops Governor Lyttleton feared the desertion of most of his force and hurried back to Charleston in great disorder.Hatley, p.124. The Cherokee were still angry, and continued to attack frontier settlements into 1760. In February 1760, they attacked Fort Prince George in an attempt to rescue their hostages. The fort's commander was killed. The garrison, in panicked retaliation, massacred all of the hostages.Hatley, p.126 And two days later the fort fired artillery into the town of Keowee. The Cherokee now attacked Fort Ninety Six, but it withstood the siege. However, settlements and lesser posts in the South Carolina backcountry quickly fell to Cherokee raids.Hatley, p.127. The Cherokee were led by Standing Turkey as Principal Chief, Oconostota (Aganstata) of Chota, Attakullakulla (Atagulgalu) of Tanasi, Ostenaco of Tomotley, Wauhatchie (Wayatsi) of the Lower Towns, and Round O of the Middle Towns. The Cherokee sought allies among the other Indian tribes and help from the French but received no practical aid and faced the British alone. While some Cherokee leaders still called for peace, others led retaliatory raids on outlying pioneer settlements. ==Siege== Portrait of Ostenaco by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1762. At the commencement of the siege the warriors fired their rifles for a few days at the soldiers in the fort but soon ceased in order to conserve precious ammunition. The Cherokee prevented the soldiers and settlers from leaving the fort to hunt or gather foodstuffs. However, some soldiers were married to Indian women and these women were allowed to come and go because the Cherokee did not wish to start feuds with the women's tribes and families. The women were able to smuggle in some much needed food. However this was not enough to indefinitely sustain the garrison and Demeré had reported to Lyttleton in January that his supplies could only last four months. The Cherokee cut off the garrison from all other outside aid or communications. When several of Demeré's messengers were either killed or captured and all other white colonists declined to volunteer, Demeré turned to an African-American slave named Abram, to whom he promised freedom as a reward, if he could carry messages through the Indian lines and across the mountains to South Carolina.Hatley, p.133. Abram made the dangerous and harrowing passage several times and was freed by the South Carolina Commons House in a tax bill in 1761.Lipscomb, Terry, W., ed..The Colonial Records of South Carolina, Journal of the Commons House of Assembly Oct. 1757-Jan.1761, Columbia, S.C., 1996, p.xvii. Governor Lyttleton appealed for help to Jeffrey Amherst, the British commander in North America. Amherst sent Archibald Montgomerie with an army of 1,300 to 1,500 troopsOliphant, p.113. Hatley gives 1,200, p.131. including 400 in four companies of the Royal ScotsWoodward, p.74; Drake, p. 376. Fortescue, p.400. and a 700-man battalion of the Montgomerie's Highlanders to South Carolina in order to mount a second expedition against the Cherokee. His second in command was Major James Grant. The regulars were joined by some 300 mounted Carolina rangers,Anderson, p. 462 in seven troops, and 100 militia as well a party of 40 to 50 Catawba warriors.Anderson, p.462. Keenan. p.40 The two objectives of this second expedition were to subdue the Cherokee by razing their towns and crops, while relieving those posts invested by the Cherokee, in particular, Fort Loudoun.Hatley, p.132. In late May the British had reached Fort Ninety-Six and Montgomerie's campaign burned some of the Cherokee Lower Towns, including Keowee, Estatoe and Sugar Town, killing or capturing around 100 Indians. The British advanced on the Cherokee Middle Towns and some five miles from Etchoe, the lowest town in the Cherokee's middle settlements, Montgomerie's advanced guard of a company of Rangers was ambushed in a deep valley. On June 27 the battle of Echoee ensued in which the British advance was halted and the force's wounded, including Montgomerie,Woodward, p.75. were so numerous and seriously hurt that there was no possibility of leaving the wounded behind and continuing to advance. The invading British were compelled to retire and the relief of Fort Loudoun was abandoned.Kaufmann, p.89. The siege ground on through June, July and into August with the garrison reduced to eating the horses and getting progressively weaker every day from hunger and sickness. Several soldiers deserted and others threatened to desert. On August 6 a council of the officers agreed to seek surrender terms. Captain Demeré was refused when he asked to surrender but Captain Stuart, who was well liked by the Indians, reached an agreement with the Cherokee chiefs at Chota.Woodward, p.76. ==Aftermath== The failure to relieve Fort Loudoun forced the garrison to surrender with Captain Demeré and the garrison allowed to retain their arms and enough ammunition to make the trip back to the colony provided they left the remaining arms and stores of ammunition to the Cherokee led by Ostenaco. The garrison marched out of the fort on August 9 with a Cherokee escort. The Indians entered the fort and found 10 bags of powder and ball buried and the cannon and small arms thrown in the river to keep them from the Cherokee. Some of the Indians, angered by the broken agreement, held a secret council and decided to go after the garrison.Conley, p.52. The next morning the garrison's Indian escort had drifted off and the garrison was attacked in the woods by perhaps 700 Indians.Anderson, p.464 Some 22 soldiers, including all the officers except Stuart, equal to the number of Cherokee chief hostages killed at Fort Prince George, and 3 civilians were killed and 120 or more were taken prisoners.Bancroft, p. 354, gives 200 and overall in the war 300 prisoners. Captain Demeré alone was tortured, scalped, made to dance and beaten until he died for betraying the surrender agreement.Anderson, p.465. Captain Stuart was saved from the initial massacre of the soldiers by the intervention of a Cherokee woman, likely his wife, Susannah, who ran in among the soldiers during the firing to shield him. As commander of the artillery, it was Ostenaco's plan to force Stuart to show the Cherokee how to use the 12 captured cannon against the other British forts. Stuart had a great friend among the Indians, Attakullakulla - the Little Carpenter, who first ransomed and then aided Stuart to escape.Bancroft, p. 355. Woodward, p.76. Stuart would later on January 5, 1762, be appointed Royal Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern Districts of North America and hold this office for 18 years. Panic and consternation reigned in Charleston at the news of the fall of the fort. A truce of six months was agreed to during which peace attempts failed. After a difficult winter for the Cherokee due to the loss of the Lower Towns' harvest and shortage of ammunition for hunting, as well as disease, Cherokee morale still remained high. In a goodwill gesture, the Cherokee allowed Fort Prince George to receive a limited amount of supplies and even though it was almost as vulnerable as Fort Loudoun had been the Cherokee did not put it under close siege.Anderson, p.465 Amherst subsequently determined to launch a third and greater invasion of the Cherokee lands \\"to chastise the Cherokees [and] reduce them to the absolute necessity of suing for pardon,\\". James Grant was now in command with more regulars: the 1st, 17th and 22nd Regiments, a war-party of Mohawks and Stockbridge Indian scouts, Catawba and Chickasaw warriors; a large number of provincials under Colonel Middleton that included several who would gain fame during the American Revolution: William Moultrie, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Francis Marion and rangers. His force was more than 2,800 strong.Anderson, p.466. Grant would be met by 1,000 Cherokee warriors on June 10, 1761 near the site of the previous battle of Echoee. The Cherokee fought until their limited ammunition was exhausted and then withdrew. Grant's force then proceeded to burn the fifteen Middle Towns and all the crops. Grant expressly ordered the troops to summarily execute any Indian man, woman or child they captured. Although, by July, Grant had marched his men to exhaustion with 300 too sick to walk, he had wrecked the Cherokee economy and made 4,000 inhabitants of the Middle Towns homeless and starving. In August 1761 the Cherokee sued for peace.Anderson, pp.466-467. Following the destruction of Fort Loudoun, Amherst dispatched yet another force from Virginia under Colonel William Byrd in 1761. While Byrd moved against the Middle Towns, he dispatched Colonel Adam Stephen to attack the Overhill Towns. Stephen arrived at Long Island of the Holston in 1761, and proceeded to construct Fort Robinson. Concerned over this invasion force, the Overhill Cherokee sent Chief Old Hop (Conocotocko) to Long Island of the Holston to seek peace. Colonel Stephen agreed, and peace was concluded in November 1761, before any action to place. At the behest of the Cherokee, Stephen dispatched Lieutenant Henry Timberlake on an expedition to the Overhill country to consolidate peace with the various villages. A journal and map created by Timberlake during this expedition would later prove invaluable to early explorers and settlers of Tennessee.Schroedl, Gerald, \\"Henry Timberlake,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

At Carnegie Tech, he studied with Robert Lepper who once taught fellow Pittsburghers Philip Pearlstein and Andy Warhol. In 1953, Qualters joined the army, serving the following two years as an artilleryman in England. He returned to Pittsburgh in 1955 and spent one more year at Carnegie Tech. Qualters moved to California in 1956 on the G.I. Bill and enrolled in the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. He earned a B.F.A. there, while becoming immersed in the fledgling Bay Area Figurative Movement of Representational Painting. At California College, his mentors included the painters Nathan Oliveira and Richard Diebenkorn—founding members of the Bay Area Figurative Movement—and the calligrapher Sabro Hasegawa. It was Diebenkorn who, in 1957, invited Qualters to be in the first Bay Area Figurative show. Qualters returned to Pittsburgh in 1959. From 1962–1968, he taught at the State University of New York at Oswego, while completing an M.F.A. at Syracuse University in 1965. He settled in Pittsburgh permanently in 1968. Since then, he has taught at the University of Pittsburgh, Carlow College, Slippery Rock State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, West Virginia University, and Carnegie Mellon University. He has also been an Artist-in-Residence at the Pittsburgh High School for the Creative and Performing Arts.

A “master of the collaborative process,”Thomas, Mary. \\"Robert Qualters and Mark Perrott: Combining Talents\\", \\"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Weekend Magazine\\", pp. 21 and 23, Pittsburgh, 21 February 2013. Qualters has also created original works with poets Jan McReery and Gail Ghai; mixed media and tattoo artist Nick Bubash; photographers Charlee Brodksy and Mark Perrott, and other Pittsburgh-based artists. With scenic designer Tony Ferrieri, Qualters designed and painted the set for the City Theatre of Pittsburgh's 1996–97 production of “Below the Belt.” Qualters has exhibited in Pennsylvania, as well as in New York, California, Maine, and West Virginia. In Pittsburgh, he has had solo-artist shows at Borelli Edwards, Concept Art Gallery, Carson Street Gallery, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, and many other galleries and museums. A 2008 retrospective at the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area in Homestead featured works from a 20-year span, 1980–2000, highlighting the end of the industrial age in the Monongahela Valley through firsthand observation and through what Rivers of Steel Director Ronald Baraff calls \\"the lens of the people\\". His work is represented in the permanent collections of the Carnegie Museum of Art; the Oakland Museum of California; and the Westmoreland County Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pennsylvania; as well as in the main offices of PPG Industries, Alcoa, Hillman Company, The Pittsburgh Foundation, The Heinz Endowments, and many other corporations, schools, and government agencies, and private collections throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania. Qualters' work has also been seen in more than two-dozen public murals and site-specific installations around the city. Besides commissions from Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh, the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Arts Festival, Oxford Development Company and others, he has created more than a dozen murals with high school students between 1986 and 1988 and as recently as 2005. His work with these students, like his numerous collaborations with prominent Pittsburgh artists, reflects a passion to create, as well as to teach, learn, and discover. Besides Diebenkorn and other Bay Area colorists, his influences include Brueghel, Rembrandt, Matisse, and fellow Pittsburgh artist John Kane. Many of his works include references or homages to these artists.

The player is tasked with managing and expanding a colony in a science fiction setting, while also exploring both their colony and other planets. The game has received mostly positive reviews from critics. ==Gameplay== Epic Astro Story has two main facets to its gameplay. The first is a city managing simulation, where the player is required to build up a colony and build its success. The second is a colony exploration component, which allows the player to look through caves, empty territory, and other planets for loot and land, and contains a battle system where the colony's explorers must fight aliens and monsters. As the teams of colonists leave to explore, their progress in different areas is tracked through a bar on the bottom of the screen, which allows the player to continue with other management issues while the explorers continue their work. All of the colonists have names that are a play on popular Star Trek characters. ==Reception== Epic Astro Story has received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the iOS version receiving a 91/100 from review aggregator website Metacritic. TouchArcade Colette Bennett called the iOS version her favorite title of Kairosoft's release thus far, and felt that the battle system broke up the company's formula for past management simulation games. Pocket Gamer Damien McFarren was impressed by the Android version's surprisingly \\"multifaceted gameplay\\", and praised its addictive formula.

The name comes from the Greek words αρσενικόν (for arsenic) and κλάσις (for cleavage), as arsenoclasite contains arsenic and has perfect cleavage. The mineral was discovered in 1931 in Långban, Sweden. ==Description== Arsenoclasite is red or dark orange brown in color. The mineral rarely occurs as crystals; rather it has either a massive or granular habit. When crystals are present, they are no larger than . Arsenoclasite has been found in association with adelite, allactite, barite, calcite, dolomite, gatehouseite, hausmannite, hematite, manganoan ferroan calcite, sarkinite, and shigaite. The mineral occurs in fissures of metamorphosed Fe-Mn ore bodies and sedimentary Fe-Mn deposits. ==Structure== A 1971 study identified the mineral's structure as an array of oxygen atoms in a double hexagonal close packed pattern. However, a 1977 study discovered that all the manganese ions in arsenoclasite are six-coordinated, a constraint this structure cannot permit without severe distortion.Ruszala, p. 2420 The 1977 study identified arsenoclasite as isostructural to Co5(PO4)2(OH)4 and Mn5(PO4)2(OH)4.Ruszala, p. 2417 ==History== Arsenoclasite was noted from specimens at Långban, Värmland, Sweden, by Gust Flink in 1924 as a mineral that appeared similar to sarkinite, but with one perfect cleavage.

These searches are contested regularly in courts, and have been ruled for and against under different circumstances. The primary debate concerns the method in which the search is conducted, and also the area being searched. Issues concerning warrantless search and subsequent seizure are always of local concern, because they are a community law enforcement issue as well as a national law issue. Debate centers on whether the home holds special legal sanctity against warrantless search, unlike an automobile. Automobiles stopped on public roads can be searched without warrants because the searched party is still on public property. Warrantless searches can also be performed in public buildings, such as museums and airports. However, because the home is the private property of the owner, homes have different protections against warrantless searches. The United States Supreme Court has addressed these issues in a number of cases. ==Katz v. United States== In Katz v. United States, , electronic eavesdropping devices attached to the outside of a phonebooth or a home were deemed to violate the unreasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because the interior private life of the homeowners was exposed along with information about illegal activity. Overruling Olmstead v. United States and Goldman v. United States, the Court ruled that this minimally intrusive bugging for the purpose of exposing illegal activity was unconstitutional, because it intruded on private civilian life.White, Welsh S., and James J. Tomkovicz. Criminal Procedure: Constitutional Constraints upon Investigation and Proof. Newark, NJ: LexisNexis Matthew Bender, 2004. (p. 6). This is precedence for protecting civilians against minimally invasive means of exposing criminal activity. ==Kyllo v. United States== In Kyllo v. United States, , the Court held that the use of a thermal imaging device from a public vantage point to monitor the radiation of heat from a person's home to identify home drug cultivation was deemed unconstitutional, because in addition to exposing illegal activity without a warrant, the privacy of the home was compromised. This case specifically highlights this duality: the right to privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the denial of right to contraband as a concept enmeshed in the concept of rule of law. ==Illinois v. Caballes== In Illinois v. Caballes, , the Supreme Court ruled that a minimally intrusive warrantless dog sniff of the car was constitutional at traffic stops. This ruling was based on the premise that the police never entered the car and were instead on public property when they did the search. In Caballes and other previous rulings the court asserted that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy on public property. Thereby this ruling upheld the constitutionality of certain minimally intrusive warrantless searches. Illinois v. Caballes called into question certain aspects of Kyllo v. United States. Justice Stevens asserted that the Kyllo search was only unconstitutional due to the fact that it revealed certain aspects of the home besides the presence or absence of contraband. This opened the door to the current minimally intrusive drug sniffs of the home which can only detect the presence or absence of drugs. ==Florida v. Jardines== Florida v. Jardines (2013) was Supreme Court case that decided the legality of deploying drug-sniffing dogs around the perimeter of homes without a search warrant. The Supreme Court held that police use of a trained detection dog to sniff for narcotics on the front porch of a private home is a \\"search\\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and therefore requires both probable cause and a search warrant. ==See also== * Surveillance * Olmstead v.

From 1999 to 2001, Shuford coordinated the Navys legislative efforts in the United States Senate, and was selected to flag rank in this assignment. His first flag tour was as the Navys \\"Head Detailer,\\" responsible for career development and assignment for the 370,000 personnel of the Navy. Shuford was selected as an Olmsted Scholar in 1979, studying for two years in France at the Paris Institute of Political Science. He also received master's degrees in public administration from Harvard University with a concentration in finance and in national security studies and strategy from the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from which he graduated in 1991 with highest distinction. From 12 August 2004 to 6 November 2008, Shuford served as the 51st President of the Naval War College, overseeing senior education and wargaming for the Navy. During his lengthy presidency, he directed an extensive restructuring of the colleges basic curriculum and initiated the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander Course for flag officers, the Maritime Staff Operators Course, and the Naval Operational Planner Course (NOPC). He led the college as it played the key role in designing the process for establishing a new national maritime strategy and in providing the geostrategic analysis to support it. He reinstituted Title 10 wargaming and initiated concept-development efforts to explore important warfare issues such as maritime ballistic missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, homeland defense organization, and the command and control of maritime forces. He also engaged in extensive diplomacy to establish an international network of naval colleges that could collaborate on the study of maritime security issues.Past Presidents page at Naval War College official Web site Admiral Shuford retired from the Navy in 2009. ==NotesReferences== * This article includes public domain text from the United States Navy official Web sites page United States Navy Biography: Rear Admiral Jacob Lawrence Shuford, President, Naval War College * Past Presidents page at Naval War College official Web site == External links == * Category:Living people Category:1950s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Presidents of the Naval War College Category:Sciences Po alumni Category:John F.

Mossmain is in the Mountain Standard time zone at an elevation of 3,274 feet. ==History== The original town site of Mossmain was situated just off East Laurel Main Street and S. 72nd Street West. The community was founded and named after Preston Boyd Moss, who played a significant role in the infrastructure development and economic establishments in the Yellowstone County area, and specifically Billings. The City of the Future The town was originally intended to become a futuristic, showpiece city with fine architecture as well as a huge regional hub that would link many surrounding major cities together. As ambitious as it was, one of the hopes was that Mossmain would eventually juxtapose Billings, the motivation of this project being in part to create a \\"fresh start\\" to do what wasn't done in Billings. The town was specifically planned out to accommodate for a massive rail junction and a showcase of architecture and modern culture. The design layout was intended to be concentric, with all parts of town interconnecting to a well-organized town center. The town was built approximately 10 miles west of Billings and several miles east of Laurel. The plans for Mossmain were drawn up by one of the most brilliant architects and city planners in the world, Walter Burley Griffin, who also designed the city plan and some of the architecture for Canberra, the capital of Australia. Decline The onset of the Great Depression followed by World War II left Moss' dream for a planned city hobbled by lack of funds and material resources. Along with this, the nature of the town's planning was highly experimental and many aspects had already become technologically outdated. The rail link intended for Mossmain was built running through Laurel and bypassing Mossmain. The end results of these events led to the town's inevitable demise. Far from becoming \\"America's First Garden City,\\" it was never more than a few dirt roads and some scattered dwellings. The Mossmain post office was operational from 1916 until its closure in 1935. There is almost no visual evidence of Mossmain today, only the town's old main street, Mossmain Lane, and some scattered tree lining remains. Many of the surrounding roads and landscape were destroyed with the construction of the Interstate Highway System and an adjacent overpass connecting I90 with the old Frontage Road and E. Main Street, rendering much of the area unrecognizable. There are a few more recent industrial sites that have been built on and around the old road. However, all of the original town structures have been removed. The site can be easily accessed from the East Laurel interchange on I-90. ==References== * Peisch, Mark L., The Chicago School of Architecture: Early Followers of Sullivan and Wright, New York: Random House, 1964.

It was first introduced in 1961 and remained in production until 1968, when Toyota released the Toyota Hilux. In 1967, the Hino Briska was renamed the Toyota Briska, then the Hilux was introduced, based on the Briska. There was also a commercial delivery van, appropriately called the . __TOC__ ==FG series; 1961-1965== The Briska was introduced in March 1961 at exhibitions in 32 cities across Japan. Called the FG10, it used a Hitachi-Stromberg carburetor on a modified version of the Contessa's engine, itself derived from that of the Renault 4CV. In March 1962, the Briska lineup added a longer version with a second bench seat for rear seat passengers. This was coded FG20P and was also available in a glazed van version (\\"Light Van\\"), called FG20V.Ozeki, p. 109 The Briska was built under contract by rather than by Hino themselves from the beginning. The body style with the single bench seat could carry a payload of , while the Pickup (crew cab with an integrated bed) could accommodate . In September 1962 the longer FG30 arrived (with a corresponding update to the Light Van and Pickup in 1963 as the FG30P and V), now on a slightly longer wheelbase and upgraded for a payload. The Light Van and Pickup received new rear bodywork, more standardized and simplified compared to that of the earlier models. The Briska was the first Japanese produced truck to accommodate three passengers on a single bench seat, according to the Japanese Governments Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The light delivery van (FG20V/FG30V) was only built for two years due to lack of sales. In 1963, the engine was uprated from the original to . This also meant that top speed increased, from .Ozeki, p. 116 In October 1963 the original Briska was facelifted, with a new front clip with a rather ornate front grille with a row of five diamond-shaped openings across the center. This model was briefly built as the FG30V Light Van and FG30P Pickup as well; for the last year of production only the Briska truck was available. A total of 33,916 Briska 900 were built. == FH series; 1965–1968== When the Contessa entered its second generation, the Briska was also modified and received a larger 1251 cc engine with . There was only a single bodystyle available of the second generation, but payload increased to . The new Briska appeared in April 1965. Hino entered into a partnership with Toyota in 1966, with Hino focusing on large commercial trucks and Toyota focusing on lighter vehicles. The four-speed manual transmission received synchronization only on the top three gears. 15,036 Hino Briska 1300 were built; this does not include Toyota-badged cars. The second generation Briska continued to be built by Mitsui Seiki rather than by Hino themselves, until after the Toyota takeover. Toyota moved Briska production (with their own badges) from the Mitsui plant into Hino's own Hamura factory to replace the Contessa after it was discontinued in March 1967. As of 12 May 1967 and until the end of production in March 1968 the truck was sold as the Toyota Briska, using the model code GY10. The Toyota Briska received twin headlights and a slightly more powerful engine with . The engine modifications had originally been developed for the Contessa but only the Toyota Briska ended up benefitting from them. Production of the Toyota Briska was limited to 10,000 units in a little under a year; The succeeding Hilux was built by Hino factories for Toyota while Hino's truck sales were still low. ==Israel== Hino Motors signed a 10-year assembly agreement with Kaiser-Illin Industries of Haifa, Israel, in 1963. Assembly of the Contessa 900 started in 1964. Later, the Briska 900 and 1300 and the Contessa 1300 sedan were assembled in Haifa as well. During the years 1964 and 1965, Israel was Hino's second most important market for its Contessas. Israel exports amounted to about ten percent of the total Contessa production. Israeli-built Contessas were even exported to Greece, beginning towards the end of 1965. After Hino was purchased by Toyota, the contract was terminated and the very last Israeli Contessas rolled off the assembly line in March 1968. In total, over 8,000 Hino Contessa and Briska were assembled in Israel. ==Commerce== Hino Commerce delivery van built on Hino Briska chassis. The Briska was actually pre-dated by a commercial delivery van version called the Hino Commerce (model code PB), introduced in 1959. The Commerce was similar mechanically to the Renault Estafette (which was also based on the Renault 4CV). At the time, Hino built three vehicles with three different layouts, while sharing engines and some other mechanicals: the Briska was front engine and rear-wheel drive, whereas the Commerce is front engined and front-wheel drive, and the Contessa is rear-engined and rear-wheel drive. ==References ;Global *Company website *Company website *HinoSamurai.org (Research Center of Historic and Existing Hino Contessa & Hino Samurai Cars, English and Japanese) *Hino Briska images and specifications Category:1960s cars Category:Cab over vehicles Briska Category:Pickup trucks Category:Rear- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1961 ","title":"Hino Briska"},{"id":"35919173","text":"Joculator obscurus is a species of minute sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Cerithiopsidae.Joculator obscurus at World Register of Marine Species.

It was first released for Android on June 8, 2011 and for iOS on September 8, 2011. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released on March 21, 2019. The player serves as the manager for a racing team and controls the research and development of the team's cars, its crew and drivers, and the races they perform in. The game was released to mostly positive reviews. ==Gameplay== Grand Prix Story is a management simulation video game, in which the player controls a new racing team. Players progress their team through races, which earn them money and unlocks longer and more difficult single race and grand prix events. As the game progresses, the terrain on which the cars race often changes, forcing the player to take into account varying road conditions and rain. One of the large differences from past Kairosoft efforts such as Game Dev Story and Hot Springs Story is that progress is made visual during races. The player does not control the cars during races, and instead watches as their driver races the cars that they have improved and worked on beforehand. As the player's team wins Grand Prix events, the racing team expands to include multiple teams that the player must manage. ==Reception== The game received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with a 74/100 from review aggregator website Metacritic. IGN's Nick Kolan felt that the visuals and the formula from past Kairosoft efforts were the same, but that the execution of the concept, and the visual feedback provided by it, improved the game handily. TouchArcade Brad Nicholson felt that the game ratcheted up after its slow beginning, feeling that the addition of multiple teams to manage makes the game more interesting in the longer term. Edge criticized Kairosoft's formula for its management games, feeling that Grand Prix Story reminded them more of deja vu than a fresh concept. They critiqued the game's non-interactive races, as they felt the races were dull to watch and made for a rather flat game.

The Contessa was developed largely from the 1947-1961 Renault 4CV powertrain under license to Hino Motors. Offered in both coupe and sedan bodystyles, it replaced the Hino Renault, which was the Renault 4CV manufactured by Hino for Japan. It was adapted into a small pickup truck called the Hino Briska, but used a front engine and rear drive powertrain, while the Contessa used a rear engine and rear drive setup. The PC series coupé was designed by Giovanni Michelotti, while the second generation was longer and wider in both coupé and sedan bodystyles. Unlike many cars found internationally of this time period, using rear drive and rear engined powertrains, the Contessa was water-cooled rather than air-cooled. The name contessa is Italian for a countess. ==PC series (1961-1964)== 47,299 of the PC-series Contessa were built, between April 1961 and the second quarter of 1964. With an 893 cc version of the Renault-based GP engine, max power is which provides a top speed of . The first Contessa originally received a three-speed column mounted shifter, later a four-speed manual became optional, utilizing an electromagnetic clutch apparatus called Shinko-Hinomatic. The gear change came in for a certain amount of criticism, a result of its long and cumbersome linkage from the steering column to the rear-mounted transmission. As Hino had a business relationship with Renault at the time, and the powertrain was largely adapted from an existing Renault product, there are clear similarities to the Renault Dauphine. The drivetrain and suspension were carried over from the Hino Renault (PA). The main improvement over the 4CV was that the Contessa 900 was a full five-seater, making it a much stronger competitor. The engine was installed longitudinally, meaning the radiator was against the outer edge of the engine bay, whereas the Renault installed the radiator against the firewall, and the Hino engine sat in a north-south orientation with the transmission attached inside the engine bay next to the Contessa's firewall. The engine was slanted to the left, and utilized a crossflow cylinder head. The rear suspension used swing axles. The first Contessa was never intended for export, although foreign language brochures were printed up for the Michelotti-designed Contessa 900 Sprint Coupé. Aside from the stylish bodywork, the 100 kg lighter Sprint () also benefitted from an Officine Nardi-tuned engine (and matching steering wheel) with Weber carburetors and . The Sprint was introduced at both the 10th Tokyo Auto Show, and the Turin Motor Show in 1962, and followed at the New York Auto Show in 1963. Top speed was claimed to be . So that there would be no doubts about its provenance, the scuff plates at the bottom of the door apertures read \\"Hino-Michelotti\\". The Sprint had a floor-mounted shifter. File:Contessa900.jpgHino Contessa 900 sedan File:Contessa900Sprint.jpgHino Contessa 900 Sprint ==PD series (1964-1967)== Hino Contessa 1300 coupé (PD300) With design by Giovanni Michelotti (who had sold a very similar design to Triumph for their 1300), the second generation Contessa debuted in September 1964. While considerably longer and heavier, the PD Contessa also had a much more powerful 1,251 cc four-cylinder engine with five main bearings (\\"GR100\\", ). With a four-speed manual transmission, top speed is . A handsome coupé version was presented in April 1965; the coupé benefitted from an upgraded engine with twin carburetors and slightly higher compression and from November of the same year. With chassis code PD300/400 (versus PD100/200 for the regular sedan), this sporting version was marketed as the \\"1300S\\". There was also an LPG-powered version in Standard or Deluxe trim; in this specification the engine produces at 5000 rpm. 100 and 300-series are right- hand drive, while 200 and 400-series are left-hand drive. The use of twin headlights does contribute to a mild similarity to the second generation Chevrolet Corvair, and the lack of a front grille because the Contessa and the Corvair are both rear engined and rear cooled (air for the Corvair, water for the Contessa). Early Standard versions did not receive bumper horns and were fitted with single front headlamps with blanks where the second set would have gone. Later on, the Standard (of which very few survive) received the same headlamps and bumpers as the De Luxe, albeit with painted rather than chromed bumpers. Later 1300 Standard sedan, with twin headlamps and painted bumpers This generation of the Contessa was also exported to Australia, Switzerland, and the Netherlands amongst others. As a part of this export drive, the Contessa also saw local assembly in New Zealand (by Campbell Motors, around 600 are thought to have been assembled there) and in Israel (by Autocars). 55,027 PD Contessas were built, of which 3,868 were Coupés. As of 2007, only 105 Contessas remained on the road in Japan, although many New Zealand-built cars are exported back to Japan. While series production ground to a halt in March 1967 following Toyota's purchase of Hino in late 1966, assembly of existing shells and parts continued at a slow pace into the summer of 1968, with ever-higher Toyota parts content. A further 175 were built in October 1969, as part of a final disposal of stock. As production of the Contessa began to wind down towards discontinuation, the Hamura factory was reprioritized to produce the Toyota Hilux pickup truck, and the Toyota Publica truck, then later was used to manufacture the Toyota Sprinter. Hino Contessa 1500 engine The earlier column-mounted three-speed manual continued to be available in the sedans, while a floor-mounted four-speed manual was standard in coupés and an option in the sedans. A bored out 1.5 litre version of the GR100 engine was developed in 1966, but after the Toyota takeover the project was shelved. Codenamed YE30, this 1471 cc engine produced in standard trim.Ezawa (1994), p. 174 The projected Coupé version of the engine (YE36) was to produce and a twin-cam version was to offer . As Toyota began to assume operations of Hino assets and manufacturing resources, Toyota was also concentrating their efforts of introducing a Contessa sized coupe and sedan of their own, and in 1966 introduced the Toyota Corolla. In an effort to prepare the US market in advance of a planned entry, Hino had Pete Brock and his BRE Racing team prepare two Contessa sedans for competition. One won a surprise victory at the 1966 LA Times Grand Prix. Later, Brock raced the lighter and faster Coupé version, called the \\"Samurai\\". The Contessas also saw a lot of local competition in Japan, and to aid this effort 20 of the lightened Hino Contessa 1300 L (for \\"Lightened\\") were built in 1966. These were built with thinner sheet metal and missing some equipment, such as hubcaps and sound deadening. ==Israel== Hino Motors signed a 10-year assembly agreement with Kaiser-Illin Industries of Haifa, Israel, in 1963. Assembly of the Contessa 900 started in 1964. Later, Briska 900 and 1300 and the Contessa 1300 sedan were assembled in Haifa as well. During the years 1964-1965, Israel was Hino's second most important market for its Contessas. Israel exports amounted to circa 10 percent of total Contessa production. After Hino was purchased by Toyota, the contract was terminated and the very last Israeli Contessas rolled off the assembly line in March 1968. In total, over 8,000 Hino Contessa and Briska were assembled in Israel. ==References *Company website *Company website *HinoSamurai.org (Research Center of Historic and Existing Hino Contessa & Hino Samurai Cars, English and Japanese) *Hino Contessa images and specifications Category:Rear-engined vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Slanted engines Category:Cars introduced in 1961 Category:1960s cars Category:Sedans Category:Coupés Contessa ","title":"Hino Contessa"},{"id":"35919223","text":"Music from Another Dimension! is the fifteenth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on November 6, 2012 by Columbia Records. This is their first studio album since 2004's Honkin' on Bobo and the first to feature all-new material since 2001's Just Push Play, marking the longest gap between Aerosmith's studio albums. The album was released in a single CD edition, along with a deluxe version. It is the last album in Aerosmith's recording contract with Sony/Columbia Records and was produced by Jack Douglas, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry and Marti Frederiksen (three tracks). It is also their longest studio album with total track time of nearly 68 minutes. The album includes the singles \\"Legendary Child\\", \\"Lover Alot\\", \\"What Could Have Been Love\\", and \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\". Music From Another Dimension debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 selling 63,000 copies its first week, a sharp contrast to previous debuts. ==Overview and recording history== The album's release on November 6, 2012, marks six years since the band's last release of original material, the two tracks \\"Devil's Got a New Disguise\\" and \\"Sedona Sunrise\\", which were released as part of the band's compilation album Devil's Got a New Disguise in October 2006. In addition, it marked eight years since the band's last studio album, the mostly blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo (which also included the lone original song \\"The Grind\\"), released in March 2004, and eleven years since the band's last all-original studio album, Just Push Play, released in March 2001. Reports suggest that the band has possibly been working on this album since at least 2006, and has had many recording sessions. However, it remains unknown how many recording sessions actually took place and how productive they were. 2006 sessions Shortly after lead singer Steven Tyler recovered from throat surgery after the band had completed two legs on their \\"Rockin' the Joint Tour\\" (in support of the namesake live album Rockin' the Joint), the band entered the studio to begin work on a new album in May 2006. In October, the band's compilation Devil's Got a New Disguise was released; the album included the new songs \\"Devil's Got a New Disguise\\" and \\"Sedona Sunrise\\", songs that were written during the Pump and Get a Grip sessions that were re-worked and recorded for the compilation. The album was intended to help fulfill Aerosmith's contract with Sony and tide fans over until the band's final studio album on that contract was released. It is unknown how much work (if any) was done on material for the new album, or if the recording sessions consisted merely of work on the two new tracks on Devil's. In the fall of 2006, Aerosmith supported Devil's with the Route of All Evil Tour, with Mötley Crüe opening. 2007–2009 sessions After a 2007 world tour, which ended in September of that year, it was reported that Aerosmith entered the studio in November 2007 to work on their new album again. At the time, it was believed that the album would include both re- recorded tracks left off previous albums, as well as brand new material. In an interview, guitarist Joe Perry revealed that in addition to creating a new album, the band was working closely with the makers of the Guitar Hero series to develop Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, a video game dedicated to the band's music. The game was released on June 29, 2008. Tyler announced on VH1 Classic Radio on September 4, 2008 that the band would enter the studio at the end of September 2008 to complete their album. A concert in Venezuela was planned for February 2009, but on January 15, 2009, Tyler said the band would be unable to play the gig because of a second knee injury of guitarist Joe Perry. In mid- February 2009, it was announced that the album would be produced by Brendan O'Brien and that the album would likely be recorded live, like their earlier records. Although the band had hoped to finish the album before the Guitar Hero: Aerosmith Tour started in June 2009, Perry said that the group \\"realized there wasn't any chance of getting [the album] finished before we hit the road for the summer.\\" The tour featured ZZ Top as the opening act for most of the tour.Graff, Gary. \\"Aerosmith to Tour with ZZ Top, New Album Delayed\\". billboard.com. April 4, 2009. The tour was slated to take the band across North America from June to September 2009, but was plagued with many injuries and cancellations, and was ultimately cancelled on August 5, 2009, when Tyler spun around on a rain-soaked stage in Sturgis, South Dakota and ultimately fell from it, sustaining injuries that required him to be airlifted to a local hospital. Also in 2009, Perry completed work on his fifth solo album, Have Guitar, Will Travel and drummer Joey Kramer released his autobiography, Hit Hard. Near-breakup of Aerosmith and Tyler (2009–2010) After Tyler fell off the stage, he said that his fellow band members did not visit him in the hospital and he had little to no contact with them until a series of concerts in late October and early November 2009. He pulled out of a planned South American tour at the end of 2009 and seemed intent on pursuing solo projects. Tyler told Classic Rock magazine, \\"I don’t know what I'm doing yet, but it's definitely going to be something Steven Tyler: working on the brand of myself – Brand Tyler.\\" Meanwhile, guitarist Joe Perry toured the United States at the end of 2009, and Japan and the UK early in 2010. In November 2009, Joe Perry stated that Tyler had not been in contact with the band and could be on the verge of quitting Aerosmith. Perry stated that the rest of the group was \\"looking for a new singer to work with.\\" It had also been reported that singer Lenny Kravitz had been approached for Steven Tyler's position, which he then declined. However, despite the rumors of him leaving the band, Tyler joined The Joe Perry Project onstage, on November 10, 2009 at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, and Tyler and Perry performed the Aerosmith single \\"Walk This Way\\" together. According to sources at the event, Tyler assured the crowd that he was \\"not quitting Aerosmith\\". On December 22, People magazine reported that Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers, brought on by injuries to his knees, legs, and feet, that resulted from years of performing. In his statement, Tyler said he is grateful for the support he is receiving, is committed to getting things taken care of, and is eager to get back on stage and in the recording studio with his bandmates. On January 20, 2010, Perry confirmed the band were about to audition for a new singer to replace Tyler. Perry said that Tyler's surgery to his legs would \\"take him out of the picture\\" for up to a year and a half, and in the meantime, the rest of the band wanted to continue performing. Perry also said that the band would be willing to continue working with Tyler in the future if the singer wanted to. In response, Tyler's attorney sent the band and its manager a \\"cease and desist\\" letter and threatened further legal action against both if the band did not discontinue this effort to replace Tyler. Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour and 2011–2012 sessions However, in February 2010, Tyler and the rest of Aerosmith resolved their differences and announced a world tour, entitled the \\"Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour\\", which took the band to 42 locations through September 2010. On the tour, tension between the band members flared again due to a series of on- stage incidents between Tyler and Perry, and the announcement of Tyler as a new talent judge on the television program American Idol, which Tyler did not inform his band members about before signing on to the program. When announcing the 2010 tour, the band said that the next item on the agenda was the band's next studio album. It was also revealed that the group did in fact do some recording with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2008 but halted because of the health problems of band members. Bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the time and energy to continue fronting the band while also being a judge on American Idol. Hamilton explained, \\"Steven's been very emphatic in saying that the way his time is arranged on the show leaves room to work on a record. He's been taking great pains to remind everybody of that, so hopefully that's the way it will come out.\\" On November 5, 2010, guitarist Brad Whitford said the recording sessions would probably be in Los Angeles, where American Idol is headquartered, and a world tour would follow. In a November 2010 interview reported at NME.com, drummer Joey Kramer confirmed that the band had every intention to finish and release their long-delayed album in 2011, stating, \\"Really, at this point in time, the only thing that's going to stop us is if someone out-and-out dies. Other than that, we've already been through what we've been through and stood the test of time. What else is there?\\" On January 18, 2011, shortly before the start of Tyler's debut as an American Idol judge for the 2011 season, Tyler declared that \\"Joe (Perry) has got some licks and I've got a bunch of songs that I've written for solo and/or Aerosmith\\" and the band would start prepping the album that week. In June 2011, Joe Perry announced that the band was going to meet at the recording studio to produce the next album of the band in July. Throughout the summer of 2011, the band worked on the album and regularly provided video updates of the recording sessions to their fans. On August 30, it was announced that the new album would be released around May 2012 and that the album would be produced by Jack Douglas, who produced four albums for the band in the 1970s, and also helped provide production on 2004's Honkin' on Bobo. Aerosmith toured Japan and Latin America in the fall of 2011 In January 2012, Tyler said that all of the album had been written, but that he just had to finish writing and recording the lyrics for the album, which he did while in the midst of his second season as a judge on American Idol. Perry remarked \\"I never felt for a minute he was lagging in the studio because of his other job. He did his whole thing [on Idol] and then showed up at eight at night and was in the studio until two in the morning. Release of new material (2012) On May 22, 2012, the album's first single, \\"Legendary Child\\" was released and on May 23, the band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. Immediately after the band debuted their new single \\"Legendary Child\\" on May 23, the band released the new album's track list, title, and release date. At the time, the track list consisted of only twelve songs and was scheduled for release on August 28, 2012. In June 2012, it was announced that the album's release date would be pushed back to November 6, 2012. On May 30, Aerosmith and Cheap Trick performed for Walmart shareholders and then began the \\"Global Warming Tour\\" on June 16 in Minneapolis, which took the band to 25 locations across North America through August 12. During the tour, Aerosmith performed new material from the album, including the single \\"Legendary Child\\", as well as the album track \\"Oh Yeah\\". In addition, \\"Beautiful\\" was played on the PA system before Aerosmith's show at the Hollywood Bowl on August 6. On August 15, 2012 Aerosmith released a video with bassist Tom Hamilton on their official YouTube channel, asking fans which artwork he should choose for their second single, \\"What Could Have Been Love\\". However, both images shown were blurred out. \\"Lover Alot\\" and \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" were released on radio simultaneously on August 22 and on the iTunes Store on August 28. On August 28, a revised track list consisting of 15 songs was released. On August 31, Kramer premiered \\"Street Jesus\\" on an Austin, Texas radio station, where it was largely well received by hardcore fans. On October 17, 2012, Rolling Stone premiered the opening track \\"Luv XXX\\". The entire album was premiered, track-by-track, leading up to the album's release on November 6, 2012. There was a major leak of the album on October 17 when Rolling Stone uploaded all of the songs to their media player without placing any type of protection on them. The fifteen songs on the regular edition of the album proceeded to circulate on the internet. On October 20, 2012, as part of Pepsi's NFL Anthems project, Aerosmith released a rewritten version of \\"Legendary Child\\" titled, \\"Legendary Child - Patriots Anthem\\". The lyrics have been reworked as a tribute to the New England Patriots. The song is available for free download at www.pepsianthems.com. ==Content== Production and writing credits The album was mostly produced by Jack Douglas, who produced five albums for the band in the 1970s and early 1980s (Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, Rocks, Draw the Line, Rock in a Hard Place) as well as helped produce the band's blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo (2004). Lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry also co-produced the record, like they have on every record since 1997. Marti Frederiksen, who has produced and/or co-written much of the band's material since 1997, co- produced and/or co-wrote four of the album's tracks, including the singles \\"Lover Alot\\", \\"What Could Have Been Love\\", and \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\". Tyler and Perry remain the band's principal songwriters, with Tyler having credits on eleven songs and Perry on seven songs; four of Perry's credits are solo credits. Every song, other than Diane Warren's \\"We All Fall Down\\" features at least one Aerosmith band member's songwriting credit. In addition, Tyler and Perry have renewed their exclusive songwriting partnership, writing the songs \\"Luv XXX\\" and \\"Out Go the Lights\\" together, without outside help. This marks the first time since \\"Fever\\" (1993) that this has happened. Guitarist Brad Whitford and bassist Tom Hamilton also have their first songwriting credits since Pump (1989), each of them co-writing three songs apiece. Drummer Joey Kramer has his first songwriting credits since Permanent Vacation (1987). In addition to Diane Warren, who previously wrote \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" for the band (which remains their only #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit), the album also includes the return of familiar outside songwriting collaborators Desmond Child (\\"Another Last Goodbye\\") and Jim Vallance (\\"Legendary Child\\"), who each co-wrote one track apiece. This marked Child's first contribution since Nine Lives while Vallance had been absent since Get A Grip. New as an Aerosmith songwriting collaborator is Marco Moir (Brad Whitford's current guitar tech), who co-wrote \\"Lover Alot\\". Also garnering their first songwriting credits on Aerosmith songs are the band's touring keyboardist Russ Irwin (who co-wrote \\"What Could Have Been Love\\") and Kramer's son Jesse Sky (who co-wrote \\"Lover Alot\\"). Music Perry says that 2004's Honkin' on Bobo was actually supposed to be this album, but the energy wasn't right at the time. However, like Honkin' on Bobo, Perry says that this album was recorded with \\"live, in- the-room excitement\\". He also says that, like with their albums from the 1970s (and unlike their albums from the 1980s and 1990s), he found himself going back and listening to the completed tracks constantly. He also revealed that the album does indeed include older material, including a riff that is at least 20 years old, stating that it may end up in several songs, \\"in a mini- opera kind of way\\". During the recording process, Perry described the sound of the music as \\"[It] sounds like dinosaurs eating cars - musical dinosaurs with [a] sick beat. Is that a good thing?\\" \\"Legendary Child\\", \\"Lover Alot\\", and \\"Oh Yeah\\" are described as rockers. The former two have been released as singles and have garnered airplay on rock radio. American Idol runner-up Lauren Alaina provides backing vocals to \\"Oh Yeah\\", a song that was a nightly staple throughout the band's \\"Global Warming Tour\\". \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" is described as a ballad, and has already been released as a single and has garnered airplay on adult contemporary radio stations. \\"Luv XXX\\" is described by Steven Tyler as \\"Beatlesque\\" and includes backing vocals from John Lennon's son Julian Lennon. \\"Freedom Fighter\\" is described as a \\"politically conscious rocker\\" and also includes backing vocals by Johnny Depp. Country star Carrie Underwood duets with Tyler on \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\", which is described as \\"a country-western crossover ballad\\". In addition, former Aerosmith guitarist Rick Dufay (who was in the band from 1981–84) plays on the song \\"Shakey Ground\\", which is a cover of an R&B; song originally done by The Temptations in 1975. \\"Shakey Ground\\" is now slated to appear on the Walmart exclusive version of the record. Tom Hamilton is also set to have his first-ever lead vocal on the song \\"Up on a Mountain\\", which is planned for release as a bonus track. Album cover Tom Hamilton said the album name was suggested by Jack Douglas, and he said \\"It’s kind of that we feel such a connection to our early days working with Jack, it just created a vibe that was very familiar from those early 70′s records. It’s almost like these young punks from another dimension who came out to have their influence on the album.\\" This led to a B movie inspired cover, designed by the band's road documentarian Casey Tebo.tom hamilton of aerosmith (november 2012) The album features two different covers: one for the regular release, and one for the deluxe release. The vinyl version features a similar cover to the deluxe edition, though the vinyl includes the same track listing as the standard edition of the CD release, spread out over two red vinyl albums (a standard release CD is also included inside one of the sleeves of the vinyl release). Differences on the deluxe version: * The Aerosmith logo shading is reversed. It goes from orange/yellow/white compared to the white/yellow/orange of the regular version. * The font size used for \\"Music\\" in the album title makes the word stretch the entire length of the \\"From Another\\" on the second line. * A finger sticks up from the top of the 'I' in the word \\"Music\\". * A white face appears over the 'M' in \\"Music\\". This face is to be of Joey Kramer as he appeared (as a dog) in the music video for \\"Pink\\". * A skull appears in the middle of the 'O' in the word \\"Dimension!\\" * The bus held by the giant robot is labeled \\"Boneyard Bus Lines\\". * The robot holding the bus has the number \\"1325\\" on his chest, which is a reference to 1325 Commonwealth Ave, where the band lived when they first formed in the early 1970s. * The woman in front is blonde with a red shirt rather than red- headed with a pink shirt. * The members of Aerosmith appear on the right side in the opening between the woman’s head and hand. * Producer Jack Douglas' face and white hair are visible in the center of the image near the base of the falling telephone pole. In the regular version, the figure is simply a black outline. * In the crowd near the base of the collapsing building are two faces: one appears to be John Kalodner and the other resembles album engineer Warren Huart. * Two plumes of smoke rise from the tallest building on the left side of the image. * A billboard with a red gem is on the tallest building. This would appear to be a reference to the cover of the album Rocks. * Directly to the left of the gem billboard is a person holding a staff or walking stick. * Also to the left of the billboard is a horse, which could be a reference to the horse on the cover of the album Toys in the Attic. * The building on the far left with the sniper on the roof has three square yellow windows in addition to the three rectangle windows. * A red demon sits on the smoke cloud next to the lizard creature. Its wings resemble the style of wings on the logo of the Get Your Wings album. * The smaller building being attacked by the lizard monster has a skeleton on the roof. * The larger building being attacked by the lizard monster is labeled Max's Kansas City towards the base. This is the legendary theater where Aerosmith scored their first recording contract. * A billboard on the roof says \\"Aerosmith\\" in the same font and style that appeared on the band's debut Aerosmith. * A flock of eight birds are flying below the Aerosmith logo near the lizard monster. ==Commercial and critical reception== Music From Another Dimension debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200 selling just 63,000 copies its first week, a sharp contrast to previous debuts. The album received mostly mixed reviews from music critics, with online review site Metacritic calculating an aggregate score of 54/100 based on 22 reviews. ==Previews== Small clips Before the first trailer was released, two small clips of the band in the studio were released, the first an interview with a guitar solo, and the second a jam in the Boneyard (Joe Perry's home recording studio). Trailer one On August 24, 2012, Aerosmith released the first trailer for the album on YouTube. It included pro-shot live footage (possibly from the upcoming bonus DVD for the album), interviews with the band, scenes of the band inside the studio, and snippets from the single \\"Legendary Child\\". Trailer two (\\"Episode One: The Beginning\\") On September 7, 2012, Aerosmith released the second trailer for the album on Vimeo. The beginning of the video was made to look like a comic- book with pictures of Aerosmith recording and discussing the album, a new song, \\"Luv XXX\\" played in the background. After a thirty-five second clip of the new song, the video transferred into a room where the members and producer, Jack Douglas, were tossing around ideas. Then, it cut to several studio clips of the band rehearsing and recording the album with a commentary by Tom Hamilton. Following that, the video cut to another clip of the new song and then finished. Trailer three (\\"Episode Two: The Writing\\") On September 17, 2012, Aerosmith released the third trailer for the album on Vimeo. The preview started off with Joe Perry and producer, Jack Douglas, in the studio discussing a song from the upcoming album, then it cut to the same opening in the episode one. After the intro, the video cut to a clip filmed in the summer of 2011 of Tom Hamilton, Joe Perry and Joey Kramer discussing one of Perry's contributions to the album and working out the guitar riffs. The third clip in the video was of the band at Vindaloo Studios with a voice-over commentary by Kramer; the commentary lasted for two more clips. The second to last clip was of the band discussing a few songs in an office with Douglas; it included Steven Tyler playing guitar. The last clip was a montage of small studio sessions. ==Track listingPersonnel== Aerosmith *Steven Tyler – lead vocals, drums on \\"Something\\", arrangement, backing vocals on \\"Up on The Mountain\\", production *Joe Perry – lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on \\"Freedom Fighter\\" and \\"Something\\" and \\"Oasis in the Night\\" production *Brad Whitford – rhythm guitar & backing vocals *Tom Hamilton – bass guitar, lead vocals on \\"Up on The Mountain\\" *Joey Kramer – drums, percussion Additional musicians *Julian Lennon – background vocals on \\"Luv XXX\\" *Melanie Taylor – background vocals on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Sharlotte Gibson – background vocals on \\"Oh Yeah\\" *Laura Jones – background vocals on \\"Oh Yeah\\" *Tom Scott – saxophone tenor on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Jessy J – saxophone tenor on \\"Oh Yeah\\" *John Mitchell – saxophone baritone on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Bill Reichenbach Jr. – trombone on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Gary Grant – trumpet on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Larry Hall – trumpet on \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Out Go The Lights\\" *Mia Tyler – backing vocals on \\"Beautiful\\" *Russ Irwin – piano and backing vocals on \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" *Carrie Underwood – featured vocals on \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\"Gunderson, Edna. \\"Aerosmith finds new harmony along with new 'Dimension'\\", USA Today, June 14, 2012.

Dr Henderson the owner sought orders from the NSW Residential Tenancies Tribunal requiring the DHA to allow him to enter the premises for the purpose of inspection and give the owner a key to the premises. In response the DHA maintained that it was not bound by the Residential Tenancies Act 1987, since replaced by the as it was immune from state laws about tenant disputes due to the Commonwealth government enjoying Crown immunity from State laws. The matter was heard before the High Court of Australia. ==Decision reached== It was established that the DHA was created under s. 61 of the Constitution (concerning the royal prerogative), so there was no actual law in which the state law could be in conflict. By a 6:1 majority (Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ; Kirby J dissenting) the Court held that the DHA is subject to the NSW Act. Four judges saw a distinction between the capacity of the crown which state law can’t affect and the exercise of the crown authority which state law could affect. One judge (McHugh) thought the distinction was unrealistic to make that distinction, but held a state law could affect the manner in which the performance of commonwealth duty. By a 6:1 majority (McHugh J dissenting) the Court rejected the broad proposition that the Commonwealth cannot be bound by State legislation. However, by a 6:1 majority (Kirby J dissenting) also rejected the argument that the Commonwealth's constitutional immunity from State law is no greater than the immunity which the States enjoy from Commonwealth law. ==Impact== Henderson is relevant in assessing how a State's legislative and executive actions may affect the Commonwealth's executive power, although a State's executive actions in that regard appear to be restricted to the area of royal prerogative. While there were majorities in favour of general concepts in the matter, there were differing views on specific aspects concerning the distribution of legislative power: :* Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that, where the Commonwealth has a pre-existing relationship with a citizen and a State passes a law which potentially affects that relationship, the State law will be valid so long as it is of general application and does impose a disability on, or remove a privilege or immunity of, the Commonwealth. In Brennan CJ's view, which was similar to McHugh J's, such laws would not be valid as the Commonwealth had not chosen whether to be subject to it. As all five agreed that the Commonwealth will only be bound by State law where it has consented to be bound, this has the effect of making the Commonwealth executive superior to those of the States. :* Whether a State law affects the executive capacities of the Commonwealth, as opposed to the exercise of them, will be a matter subject to the facts of a particular case. :* The High Court's view of the relevance of s. 109 in such matters was inconclusive. McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ believed that, where executive power arises from statute, the Commonwealth's protection from State law must come from s. 109 and not from the Cigamatic doctrine. Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ did not consider s. 109 in formulating their judgment. Certain commentators consider the first viewpoint to be more consistent with the nature of Australian federation. :* While Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that the States do not have specific legislative powers to restrict or modify the executive capacities of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth does have such authority with respect to those of the States, it has been noted that there is no reason why a State law could not affect the Commonwealth so long as it is for the peace, order and good government of that State. :* Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ agreed that the States do not have the power to alter the legal relationships between the Commonwealth and its subjects. The majority of Justices accepted that s. 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 did not apply, as the DHA was not a body that was subject to the Cigamatic doctrine. However, Commonwealth v Evans Deakin Industries had previously held that that provision will mean that a wide range of State laws may apply to the Commonwealth in circumstances where the doctrine applies. == See also == * Pirrie v McFarlane.. == Further reading == * (1999) 27(1) Federal Law Review 151. * ==References== Category:Intergovernmental immunity in the Australian Constitution cases Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1997 in case law Category:1997 in Australian law ","title":"Henderson v Defence Housing Authority"},{"id":"35919276","text":"Loensia variegata is a species of Psocoptera from the family Psocidae that can be found in Great Britain and Ireland.

Areas of study range from animal and plant sciences to biochemistry, agribusiness management, science and agricultural journalism, animal science, fisheries and wildlife, and atmospheric science. In 2018, there were more than 2,428 undergraduate and 384 graduate students studying in CAFNR. CAFNR has the highest sponsored research expenditures on the MU campus ($31,873,581 in 2010). The college is ranked among the Top 15 programs in the world for animal and plant science research (Thomson Reuters). Divisions in CAFNR are: • Animal Sciences • Biochemistry • Division of Applied Social Sciences (Agricultural and Applied Economics, Agricultural Education, Rural Sociology, Science and Agricultural Journalism) • Food Systems and Bioengineering (Agricultural Systems Management, Biological Engineering, Food Science, Hospitality Management, Continental Climate Viticulture and Enology) • Plant Sciences • School of Natural Resources (Fisheries and Wildlife; Forestry; Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences; Parks, Recreation and Tourism). CAFNR operates the Agricultural Experiment Station, a network of several research centers around Missouri designed to meet the regional research and demonstration needs of agricultural producers and natural resource managers. CAFNR’s research efforts have regional and international economic impact. Projects include a drought simulator that allows scientists to develop drought tolerant crops, an inexpensive genetic tool to judge the economic value of cattle, and a study to determine the connection between eating breakfast and obesity. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI), part of the Division of Applied Social Sciences, conducts research in national and global agricultural policy. Its researchers regularly testify before Congress. CAFNR’s marketing tag line is Collaborating for the Greater Good, a recognition of its long culture of interdisciplinary partnerships that result in discoveries that could not be easily obtained by researchers in a single area. ==History== The College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts was established on February 24, 1870. The College has undergone several name changes since then. Most recently it was renamed the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR). The College is the only one of its type in Missouri. George C. Swallow was the first professor and dean of the College. The program enjoyed immense growth during its early years, but class sizes dwindled past the turn of the century due to inadequate staffing and underdeveloped academic curricula. With increased funding by the state and the appointment of Frederick B. Mumford as dean in 1909, conditions dramatically improved. In addition to producing positive results for the College, Mumford convinced University administrators that space was needed for the College to flourish. As a result, several new buildings were constructed to house the program. They were the veterinary building (1911), Schweitzer Hall (1912), the hog cholera serum plant (1915), Gwynn Hall (1920), Mumford Hall (1925) and Eckles Hall (1938). Many of these buildings are still used by the College. In 1989, the School of Natural Resources (SNR) was formed and housed within CAFNR. Some of SNR’s programs originated up to 80 years ago. It is the Midwest's only school with a comprehensive natural resources program, encompassing atmospheric science, fisheries, forestry, parks, recreation, soils, tourism and wildlife. ==References *College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources Category:Agriculture in Missouri Missouri Category:Educational institutions established in 1870 +Category:University subdivisions in Missouri ","title":"University of Missouri College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources"},{"id":"35919302","text":"Leptostylopsis poeyi is a species of longhorn beetles of the subfamily Lamiinae.

However, on the first lap of the race, he was passed by Red Byron. Three laps later, Fonty Flock took over the lead, and would eventually lead over 104 laps before being sidelined with a blown engine. Byron took the lead back, and would lead 30 more laps, but he was sidelined with a broken spindle. Jack Smith would inherit the lead, but with eight laps to go, Leon Sales, in his first start, took over the lead, and would defeat Jack Smith by an unknown margin of victory. Sales would qualify in eleventh place for this racing event.1950 Wilkes 200 information at Fantasy Racing Cheat Sheet Seven thousand people would watch this race that took place on a dirt track spanning . All 26 drivers on the starting grid were born in the United States of America; no foreign drivers made the grid. Most of the DNFs in the race were caused by wheel and engine problems; although two drivers were taken out the race due to a crash and a troublesome spindle. Other notable drivers in this race were Billy Carden, future 1955 Southern 500 winner Herb Thomas and Curtis Turner. The lowest paid driver got $50 in winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) while the winner received $1,000 in total prize money ($ when adjusted for inflation). NASCAR would offer a total purse of $3,900 for this racing event ($ when adjusted for inflation). The oldest car in the race was a 1947 Buick which was one of the models manufactured shortly after the end of World War II. Most of drivers on the field were driving 1950 model year vehicles with no entries from the Chevrolet manufacturer until later in the decade. Even a Cadillac vehicle made an entry in the race. This was the first race of the Grand National series to not have at least one Ford in the field. Oldsmobile drivers would use the Oldsmobile 88 as their vehicle for this event. Debuts and retirements Herbert Burns, Leon Sales, Ewell Weddle, and Jerry Wimbish would introduce themselves to the NASCAR scene during this race while Jack Carr and Tex Keene would retire from NASCAR after this race.1950 Wilkes 200 information at Race-Database Results { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - !

It is essentially a blended sour mash whiskey flavored with fruit syrup(s). The liqueur has a vivid semi-translucent pink color and a sweet, assertive strawberry-dominant flavor. Sweet Revenge is marketed in a 750 mL size bottle with a silhouette similar to that of vintage American whiskey brands. It is promoted as a shot beverage with relatively high alcohol content – the liqueur is typically served undiluted in a shot glass or on the rocks (in a glass over ice). Sweet Revenge is manufactured by Independence Spirits Company, LLC at the Charles Jacquin et Cie, Inc. facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was developed and is marketed by John Cooper, of Independence Spirits Company, LLC, of Miami, Florida, who was also the producer of Domaine de Canton, another flavored liqueur that was previously produced by Jacquin,Felton, Eric, \\"How's Your Drink: What Sibling Rivalry Has Wrought\\", in The Wall Street Journal, February 28, 2009. and was distributed by Miami-based Maurice Cooper et Cie, LLC.

The sour mash addition regulates bacteria growth and helps to maintain a proper pH level, which contribute to yeast development and flavor consistency from batch-to-batch.

All three conclude with the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. The miniseries originally aired in three two-hour installments on three consecutive Wednesdays on NBC on February 14, 21 and 28, 1979. The story details the men and families of G Company, 24th Infantry Division, United States Army. There are two main sub-plots: First Sergeant Milt Warden’s (William Devane) ongoing affair with Karen Holmes (Natalie Wood), the wife of his commanding officer, and Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt's (Steve Railsback) affair with Lorene Rogers (Kim Basinger, a local prostitute). == Plot == It is April 1941 at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii and Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt is new to G Company. He is a skilled boxer who unintentionally severely injured a fellow soldier in an exhibition boxing match. As a result he refuses to be a boxer anymore. This places him at odds with his company’s commanding officer, Captain Holmes, who uses the reputation of many of the sergeants in his company as skilled boxers to further his military career. Facing pressure from the fascist-minded Gen. Barney Slater, who argues that the Army needs to control soldiers by fear of authority, Captain Holmes has many of his sergeants harass and abuse Prewitt in an attempt to pressure him to join the company's boxing team. Prewitt is tough and refuses to bend to the pressure. The company's First Sergeant, Milt Warden, attempts to help Prewitt, but there is only so much he can do. Prewitt becomes involved with Lorene Rogers, a local prostitute. Prewitt’s friend Private Angelo Maggio is sent to the stockade after being court martialed for getting drunk and fighting with MPs. Things take a turn for the worse when Pvt. Prewitt is sent to the stockade for a few months of what turns out to brutal mistreatment at the hands of the Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade, Sgt. Fatso Judson, a bully and a sadist. While in the stockade, Prewitt reunites with Maggio and finds that he has been nearly beaten to death by Judson. Maggio dies after panicking and falling out of the ambulance on his way to the hospital. After Prewitt is released from the stockade he tracks downs Judson and kills him in a knife fight. Prewitt is wounded in the fight and he takes refuge at Lorene’s house while he heals. Captain Holmes is promoted to major and leaves the company. The new company commander does not care about the boxing team. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor and Schofield Barracks. First Sergeant Warden organizes the men of his company. He and the other sergeants of the company go to the armory and get Browning Automatic Rifles (B.A.R.s) and .30 caliber Model 1919 machine guns and return fire to the attacking Japanese warplanes. Warden and his men shoot down one of the Japanese \\"Zeros\\". Wanting to join in on the upcoming war, and with Warden promising to help smooth things over regarding Fatso’s murder if he reports back, Prewitt attempts to rejoin the company but is mortally wounded by a nervous sentry that same evening. As he lies dying, he says he knows that Sgt. Warden will take care of his body (make sure his death is marked “line of duty”) and makes sure that it gets a military burial. After he dies, Warden assures the guilt-ridden sentry that Prewitt’s death was going to happen one way or another. When asked by the other soldiers if Prewitt was a good soldier in his company, Warden replies, “Hell, he was the only soldier.” == Main cast == {  - !

It has remained popular in all parts of the Indian sub-continent particularly in the Hindi and Urdu speaking areas. In its classical form a Geet conforms to Prabandha, a composition bound by Dhatu that comprises Sthayi, Antara, Dhrupad etc.; and Anga that comprises swar, taal, pat, birud etc. Therefore, it has a beginning part known as Prabandha which is followed by an Udgraah or Dhruv which is its part that is repeatedly sung and cannot be left out, the ending part is known as Aabhog and that part of the geet which is between Dhruv and Aabhog is called Pada or Antara. Dhrupad, Khyal, Thumri and Ghazals are the accepted forms of Hindustani classical music. The legendary singers Mian Tansen and Raja Man Singh Tomar were Dhrupad singers. Geets are a significant part of Indian folk-literature meant for all memorable occasions, then they are known as lok-geets sung by different communities and sections of society. These lok-geets include Chaiti, Kajari, Hori and Sawani. However, the boundary-line separating folk songs from classical songs cannot be easily traced and re-drawn.'Folksong and Classical Song: The Discursive Formation of Dividing Practice' Geets are also central to many cultures and communities across the globe and are used in a variety of contexts and purposes. Frequently, religious communities employ geets to not only express devotion but also to transmit knowledge of their faiths. For instance, in the Satpanthi Ismaili communities of South Asia (also known as Khojas), geets of devotion are composed and sung by community artistes. The Geets Portall at the University of Saskatchewan Library is a digital curation of the Ismaili community's devotional tradition of geets. == Context == In Urdu poetry its roots are found in Dakhani Shairi whose most important feature is its Indian ethos with the strain being feminine, and the tone, delicate and elegant; Urdu Geets mainly speak about feminine anguish. Dakhini or Hindavi forms part of what is known as proto-Hindi Literature whose origin can be traced to a far earlier period that produced the great historical lyric Prithviraj Raso written by Chand Bardai. In Hindi poetry that has its roots in the Avadhi and the Brij Bhasha the Bhakti movement amalgamating the more ancient forms of Sanskrit and Persian poetry brought to the fore the wide range of rasas from love to heroism that later on in the Ritikal introduced erotism in a big way. Urdu geets are basically found written in the Hindustani language that took shape after the colonization of India by the British and had subsequently become the court language in Delhi and Avadh whereas Hindi geets have retained the flavour drawn from earlier compositions in Rajasthani dialect, Brij Bhasha and Maithali. == References == Category:Indian poetry Category:Indian music ","title":"Geet (song)"},{"id":"35919378","text":"Jimmy the Lock is the debut solo studio album by American rapper Nocando.

He is the Olympic and world long course and short course champion and three-times European long course champion in the 1500 m freestyle event at the 2012, 2014 and 2016 European Aquatics Championships, and two-times European long course champion in the 800 m freestyle event. Paltrinieri is the current 1500 m freestyle (short course) world record holder. He also holds the long course European records in the 800 m and 1500 m freestyle events with times of 7:39.27 and 14:33.10. ==Swimming career== Paltrinieri started swimming at a very young age, and until the age of 12, he specialized in breaststroke. However, as he grew, he converted to freestyle, specializing in the longer pool distances. 2011: Junior His first international success came as a 16-year-old at the 2011 European Junior Swimming Championships in Belgrade, where he won the 1500 metres gold and an 800 metres bronze. Having qualified for the World championships in Shanghai, he did not progress further than the heats, but a few weeks later at the World Junior Championships in Lima, Peru, he was back on the podium with a 1500 metres freestyle silver and an 800 metres bronze. 2012: Summer Olympics and European Champion In March 2012 Paltrinieri won the Italian 800 metres freestyle title, and two months later, he left everyone in his wake at the European Championships in Debrecen, defeating renowned Hungarians Gergő Kis and Gergely Gyurta in the 1500 m. His time of 14:48.92 qualified him for the Olympics and, at the time, was the year's second-fastest 1500 m swim, breaking the championship record. He is trained by Stefano Morini. At 2012 Summer Olympics, the 17-year-old Italian advanced to his first Olympic final with the 4th fastest time of 14:50.11. In the final he finished 5th in 14:51.92. At the end of 2012 Paltrinieri finished 2nd in the 1500 meter freestyle event at the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m), and was later awarded a gold medal after a positive doping test for Danish swimmer Mads Glæsner. However, upon appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Glæsner's 1500-meter freestyle gold medal was reinstated based on the fact that a test after that race, two days after his initial positive test following the 400-meter free, was clean. This means that Paltrinieri was returned to his silver medal position in the 1500 m freestyle. 2013 World Aquatics Championships Paltrinieri competed for Italy at 2013 World Aquatics Championships. He reached his first 800 metres freestyle final at a long course world championship event finishing sixth in 7:50.29. In the 1500 metres freestyle event Paltrinieri won a bronze medal with a time of 14:45.38, establishing a new national record. 2014 In 2014 Paltrinieri at the Italian Swimming Championships in Riccione finished second in 800 metres freestyle event with a time of 7:43.01, behind Gabriele Detti who established a new European record in the distance. Three days later Paltrinieri established a new national record of 14:44.50 in the 1500 m freestyle event. The day before the meet, Paltrinieri had swum an unofficial world best time of 50:56.50 in the 5 km (long course pool) at the Italian indoor distance championships in Riccione. In August, at the 2014 European Aquatics Championships, Paltrinieri won the 800 m and 1500 m freestyle events establishing the new European record of 14:39.93; with this result he became only the fifth swimmer ever to swim under 14:40.00 in the 1500 m freestyle long course. At the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Doha, Paltrinieri became World champion for the first time with the new European record of 14:16.10, which was also the second fastest time ever swum behind Grant Hackett's world record. 2015: World Champion and World Record Holder At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, in Kazan, Paltrinieri won the silver medal in the 800 m, losing to Sun Yang. Later he won the 1500 m, setting a new European record, a race in which Sun did not take part despite having qualified for the final with the second best time after Paltrinieri.

The previous record set in 2001 by Grant Hackett was beaten by 2.04 seconds. With the gold medal, Paltrinieri also became the simultaneous holder of the world and European titles, in long course and short course, in the 1500 metres freestyle event. 2016: Olympic champion At the 2016 Rio Olympics Paltrinieri won the gold medal in the 1500 m freestyle in a time of 14:34.57, having qualified fastest for the final. 2017 In 2017, Paltrinieri confirmed his World Championship gold medal in the 1500m freestyle at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships held in Budapest.

Under the Judiciary Act of 1801, the United States federal judicial districts were divided into six (and later seven) United States circuit courts--one for each justice. Rather than appointing separate circuit judges (with the exception of the brief interlude under the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act), the circuit courts were staffed by a combination of the resident United States district court judges from that district and the Supreme Court justice assigned to that circuit (either could preside alone or they could preside together). While the circuits were the unit of circuit riding assignments, the individual circuit courts were referred to by the name of the judicial district (e.g. \\"United States Circuit Court for the District of New Hampshire,\\" or, in case citations, C.C.D.N.H.). Some districts were not within any circuit (for example, under the Judiciary Act of 1801: Maine, Kentucky, and Tennessee).

Examining the concept and objectives of legal literacy (Accessed on 31 Mar 2013) Legal awareness helps to promote consciousness of legal culture, participation in the formation of laws and the rule of law.Ashok Swain, Ramses Amer Globalization and Challenges to Building Peace (Accessed on 1 April 2013)Bharadwaj Study Package For CLAT Page vii \\"Legal Awareness is the most important component for the students preparing for LL.B. entrance tests. It is altogether a new subject for the students preparing for the said examinations. In the absence of any comprehensive book on this topic in..\\" Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to law and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and study concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional movement that advocates greater societal commitment to educating people about the law. Anna- Marie Marshall explains that \\"in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them. This initiative, in turn, depends on the availability and the relevance of legal schema to people confronting problems.\\" This is because laws exist as part of a larger organizational ecosystem in which the interests of the organization as well as those of the actors become inextricably linked to the ways in which they are enacted. Distinct from the education of students in law school seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called \\"legal education\\") and the continuing professional education of lawyers and judges (which is sometimes called \\"continuing legal education\\"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students. The term \\"public legal education\\" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms. The terms \\"public legal information\\" and \\"public legal education and information\\" (PLEI) emphasize a difference between educating and providing information. The term \\"community legal education\\" is common in Australia and the United States, where it often refers to community-based public legal education activities led by legal aid organizations. The term \\"law-related education\\" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in primary and secondary schools (and sometimes in higher education), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.Cassidy, Wanda (2000). \\"Law-Related Education: Promoting Awareness, Participation, and Action\\", 297–98, in Weaving Connections: Educating for Peace, Social and Environmental Justice (Tara Goldstein & David Selby, eds.). . ==Definition== According to the American Bar Association, Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is \\"the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy\\". The Canadian Bar Association (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as \\"the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action.\\" With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's (MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as \\"critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements\\". ==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy== The \\"continuum approach\\" considers legal literacy as \\"a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other\\". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean \\"that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly legalistic and litigious culture\\". Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a \\"spectrum of functional skills\\", related to the conduct of litigation.(Bilder1999, 51) The continuum approach explains, \\"a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'\\" One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is \\"intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved\\".(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47) These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance. ==Need and importance== Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, \\"the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution.\\"Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis Beljaars, Ben. \\"Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum\\", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015. Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels. Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V. Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, reported in AIR 1986 S.C. at page 991, Justice P.N. Bhagwat Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.(Canadian Bar Association 1992) Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.(The John Howard Society of Canada1996) Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.(Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005) At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits.(South Carolina v.

An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events. Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people. Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings, illustrations in comics, and other ways to ensure publicity for various legal mobilisation activities. Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law. ==Obstacles== According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to legal information. Illiteracy, economic barriers, \\" Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights\\" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012 www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST language barriers, social taboosArise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound. In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, \\"the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress\\". The absence of a legal culture and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it. website retrieved 30 March 2013 In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange legal information worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable.

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool. She says, \\"corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence\\". According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization. Institutional legal literacy George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations.

However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations. Designated legal officers Apart from external legal advisors, internal legal officersThe 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10, Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO) and in certain countries like Australia and India, The company secretary is responsible for advising on good governance practices and compliance of corporate governance norms as prescribed under various corporate, securities and other business laws, regulations and guidelines made thereunder. ==Related concepts== There are certain related concepts including legal consciousness, legal mobilization and legal socialization, legal empowerment, that helps to put legal literacy in perspective. Civics and socio-legal literacy Despite semantic proximity education of civics, civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the \\"legal literacy\\" semantic components are the dominant notion of the \\"right\\", \\"law\\", \\"responsibility to the law\\", and \\"civic literacy\\" added to them the concept of \\"civil society\\", \\"individual rights and freedoms\\" and \\"man's responsibility to civil society\\". In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms. At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through civics, but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life. Applied legal education is imparted through business and commerce school and some other branches. News media also plays a part, but is unable to meet all socio-legal literacy needs. NGOs and legal aid centres may provide for limited legal literacy related to specific thrust areas. ==Legal literacy mission== China conducts Nationwide Legal Awareness Raising Campaigns (NLARC) this five-year program has been conducted since 1986. National Legal Services Authority (India) conducted a five-year nationwide \\"National Legal Literacy Mission\\" from 2005 to 2010. ==Legal literacy events and celebrations== Between March 20 to April 5 annual legal awareness celebrations take place in Australia. Australian Employee Legal Awareness Day is held annually on February 13. In India, National Legal Literacy Day is on November 9.Supreme Court of India website as read on 26th Feb 2013 ==Internet and legal literacy== The Internet as a legal research tool is advantageous for most primary legal research materials, which can be located for free to supplement fee-based services and library collections. The Internet offers increased access to resources, low- or no-cost access, and real-time information via social media. Author Roger Smith, an expert in domestic and international aspects of legal aid, human rights and access to justice; says in his article \\"IT changes bring hope – and hype\\", that Technology offers the opportunity significantly to cut costs and to leverage existing provision. Author Roger Smith further believes there is enough to suggest potential usage of internet and its interactive capacities of internet in information sharing. According to Roger Smith (Internet and) Technology also opens up the possibility of providing ‘just in time’ public legal education which might just be the answer to the yawning gap in family law advice. Roger Smith further says 'technology can be used to construct a network of (online legal) provision which provides the level of legal advice and assistance to which people are entitled - even in times of austerity.' Founded in 1992 by Peter Martin and Tom Bruce, Legal Information Institute (LII) a non-profit, public service of Cornell Law School that provides no-cost access to current American and international legal research sources online at law.cornell.edu is a pioneer in the delivery of legal information online. LII was the first law site developed on the internet. Public service of Cornell Law School promotes Legal Information Institute which in turn promotes Free Access to Law Movement and work on principles adopted at Montral declaration (2002 and amended subsequently); which advocates publishing of public legal information via internet. In India, MARG(Multiple Action Research Group), an organization working for empowerment is using internet and social networking sites to empower netizens. The organization posts every Friday \\"friday facts\\" in their Facebook, Twitter & Instagram pages.These posts/pictures focuses on rights of the citizens and all other important information about laws in India. ==Important institutions promoting legal awareness and legal literacy== Bar councils, lawyer federations and various NGOs take the lead in promoting legal awareness and legal literacy. In India, as per the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the National Legal Services Authority (NLSA) has been designated to take appropriate measures for spreading legal literacy and legal awareness amongst the people. In Indiana, in the United States, Outreach for Legal Literacy (OLL) is a community service program in which law students teach law to fifth- graders in local elementary schools.

On these trips he met Anthony van Dyck and Claude Vignon, who both painted his portrait. He also became acquainted with the engravers Stefano della Bella and François Collignon. It was probably around this time that he acquired the nickname of Chartres (Ciartres in Italian). In 1624–1625 he was associated with Vignon as an art dealer (paintings) and acted as a print collector for Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, and Charles I of England.

She studied portrait painting under the noted Australian painter Antonio Dattilo Rubbo (1870–1955) during which time she also began writing and drawing comic books for her own amusement. \\"When I was at school…I made up my mind to draw and write them [comics]. I was always very successful.\\" Still in her teens, Bertram's first published work was the fantasy-styled adventure strip, Jo, which debuted in Sydney's Daily Mirror newspaper on 8 January 1945. “[I have been drawing/writing comics] since I was fourteen – I told the publishers I was sixteen for fear they wouldn't publish them.\\" Jo was a beautiful raven-haried dancer who, with the aid of her magic cape, to assist her American fighter pilot boyfriend, Serge Shawn, to outwit gangsters and the Japanese. The strip quickly established Bertram's reputation as a vivid and imaginative cartoonist, her work characterised by her granite- jawed heroes and voluptuous, glamorous women. According to Kevin Patrick, Bertram was \\"Unlike many of her male counterparts of the time,\\" and \\"from the outset grasped the dynamic storytelling possibilities of the comic book page. Huge panels, inventive compositions and dizzying perspectives dominate her page layouts (many of which were prepared by her sister, Kathleen), while her use of over-the-top sound effects anticipates the comic book paintings of 1960s 'Pop' artists like Roy Lichtenstein.\\" According to Ingrid Unger, \\"Bertram developed a striking visual style that included a skillful use of changing angles for dramatic and humorous effect.\\" \\"Bertram's stories are action-packed, without being excessively violent, and often contain humour. They feature strong women and a variety of other female characters.\\" After finishing work on the Daily Mirror, she signed a three-month contract with publisher Frank Johnson in June 1945, with Jo & Her Magic Cape subsequently appearing in a range of Frank Johnson Publications during 1945–46. \\"Moira was a proud attractive person and the strength in her work showed in her personality. She had never married and when the comics' scene finally died, she did portraits and magazine illustrations for a number of publishers.\\" In 1949, Moira and her sister Kathleen (who did the lettering) turned to self- publishing their comic book Red Finnegan, which ran for four issues. In the 1950s she worked for companies, including Horwitz Press, Invincible Press (The Thrilling Adventures of Dan Eagle (c.1954), Army and romance comics, Bring Back My Love (c.1956), Army (c.1956), Campus Snobs (c.1959) and Rivals in Love(c.1959)) and Calvert Publishing (pulp books). Bertram additionally illustrated covers for 'Carter Brown' novels, and contributed stories to the 'Silhouette Romance Library' (Reigate Pty Ltd). She ended her comic book career in the late 1950s. Another of her comic book creations was Flameman, published by K.G. Murray Publishing Company in 1946, which documented the adventures of a super-powered 'genie of the sun'. John Ryan in the comic book anthology, Panel by Panel describes Bertram's work as \\"highly stylised and confident; her experiments with perspective include placing large shapes in the foreground to enhance the visual drama of a story, and placing the reader above the action.\\" ==ReferencesPatrick, Kevin (2011) Jo and Her Magic Cape: The Female Superhero and 'Austerican' Culture Monash University (Department of English) * Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:Australian comic strip cartoonists Category:Australian illustrators Category:Australian comics artists Category:Australian cartoonists Category:Australian women cartoonists Category:Australian comics writers Category:Artists from Sydney Category:Australian female comics artists Category:Female comics writers ","title":"Moira Bertram"},{"id":"35919795","text":"Aminocyclopyrachlor is a selective, low-toxicity herbicide that provides pre- and post-emergent control of broadleaf weeds, woody species, vines and grasses on several non-food use sites, such as rights of way, wildlife management areas, recreational areas, turf/lawns, golf courses and sod farms.

The Colombian television model from 1955 to the late 1990s, known as the sistema mixto (\\"mixed system\\"), relied on programadoras as the sole producers of programs that aired on the two major channels. Following the introduction of two national private television channels to the country in the late 1990s, the recession of that same time period and a resulting combination of falling ratings and declining advertising revenues, the programadoras went into a tailspin that led to many closing in bankruptcy or becoming production companies for the private networks. By 2003, only seven programadoras were left on Canal Uno, later reduced to four. In May 2017, Plural Comunicaciones, a consortium including several former programadoras, took total control of Canal Uno's operations, marking the first time since the 1950s that one entity was responsible for programming the network's entire broadcast day. ==History== 1950s-70s In 1955, the Colombian government created what would be the model of national television for the next four decades. For the preceding year, the lone national channel had focused exclusively on educational and cultural programs. However, a fall in the world price of coffee, the country's principal export, forced the government to cut the portion of its budget allotted to television.Sandra Liliana Vecino Valero and Isabel Cristina Muñoz Betancur. \\"Yo soy Betty, la fea: Análisis de un producto televisivo.\\" Thesis, Universidad de La Sabana, 2003. link Private companies bid to lease timeslots to air their shows on the Cadena Nacional (National Channel), which was the only TV network in the country. The government, in turn (from 1964, through Inravisión, the state broadcaster), chose the timeslots and the programs they should air, and operated the national television infrastructure. The first of the major production companies began to spring up, such as Producciones PUNCH (the first programadora, founded in 1956) and RTI Colombia. Radio networks RCN (in 1967) and Caracol (in 1963) also entered the new medium of television; their initial joint effort, a programadora known as TVC, briefly held a contract to program as much as 50% of the broadcast day, but did not meet with success.\\"El nacimiento de las industrias culturales\\", Revista Credencial April 2012: When Colombia gained a second national channel in 1972, Segunda Cadena, companies were assigned slots on both channels indiscriminately, and the mixed system began its 26-year reign as the undisputed model of commercial television in Colombia. The licitación Every several years—often in every government—bidding cycles known as licitaciones were opened. At these times, new potential programadoras would bid, old ones would compete for new positions, and some would leave the air. At the start of the next calendar year, television schedules completely changed. These bidding cycles occurred in 1972, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1991 (see below), and 1997. (Note the varied length of the concessions: three years in the 1970s, two years in the early 1980s, four years in the mid-late 1980s, and six years after the passage of the Colombian Constitution of 1991.) There was also a small licitación in 1991 to award the former slots of Promec Televisión (which went bankrupt) and Jorge Enrique Pulido TV (whose owner was murdered); a larger off-cycle licitación in 1996 that awarded the former slots of Producciones Cinevisión\\"CNTV asignó espacios en Canal Uno.\\", El Tiempo, 5 March 1996 and one in 2000 that awarded spaces returned by programadoras including TeVecine and DFL Televisión.\\"Abren nueva licitación en camales (sic) privados.\\", El Tiempo, 6 June 2000 Newscasts were particularly affected by these bidding periods, being particular points of pressure from political parties. New ones would appear after licitaciones and old ones might disappear (such as QAP after 1997) or move to new time slots (for instance, Datos y Mensajes and its flagship Noticiero TV Hoy wound up moving from weekdays to weekends in 1992; the Noticiero 24 Horas in 1998 found itself moving from its traditional 7pm time to 12:30pm; both newscasts were linked with factions of the Colombian Conservative Party). Newscasts either ran on weekdays or on weekends and holidays. At some licitaciones (such as 1991), those wishing to bid for a newscast could not bid for any other programming. The pressure for equal political representation made the production of newscasts among the most coveted and scrutinized elements of the mixed system. For instance, the 1983 round of concessions awarded six spaces for newscasts, three of them to conservative interests and three to liberals.Vizcaíno, Milciades. \\"La legislación de televisión en Colombia: entre el Estado y el mercado.\\" Historia Crítica\\" 28 (July 2004): 87-103. Most programadoras that disappeared prior to the programadoras crisis did so at the end of one of those calendar years (for instance, Noticiero Criptón, a programadora that produced the newscast by the same name, left the air at the end of 1997). There were several exceptions: Jorge Enrique Pulido TV ceased operations in 1990 after its proprietor was murdered, and Multimedia Televisión; Promec Televisión;\\"Promec saldría de la televisión.\\" El Tiempo 26 January 1991 and Cromavisión\\"Cromavisión saldría de la televisión. El Tiempo 5 September 1991:link were forced out for nonpayment of debt (after caducidad administrativa, or administrative expiration of the contracts these companies had with Inravisión, was declared). Separate bidding cycles were held to program holidays (festivos), usually with movies and special programs. Promec and Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre, later to be known as CPT, were pioneers in this venue of programming. CPT was sold in 1988, did not bid in 1991, and returned at the start of 1998. In the 1980s, OTI Colombia, a consortium of programadoras that had the license to broadcast the Olympic Games and World Cup, was formed. It included such major names as R.T.I., Caracol, RCN, PUNCH, Producciones JES and Datos y Mensajes. 1991 changes The Colombian Constitution of 1991 precipitated major changes in the way the licensing was handled. 31 programadoras applied, and 24 won. These 24 were split into two groups of 12, originally dubbed Telenorte and Telesur, that would air their programs on competing channels. There were several other major changes: Duque Salazar, Ana Lucia. \\"TV 92: Se oyen las propuestas.\\" El Tiempo 19 August 1991: *The quota for nationally-produced content increased, from 50% to 60%. *In the 1987 bidding cycle, programadoras were allocated between 4 and 13.5 hours a week. In the 1991 bidding cycle, the minimum was 8 hours a week, with a maximum of 16. For most companies, this was a major increase in output, which came with increased costs to Inravisión for the programming time. (The minimum was further raised to 9.5 hours a week in the licitación of 1997.)\\"La mala hora de la programadora Audiovisuales.\\" El Tiempo 23 October 1997: link *A new governing body was established (in accordance with Article 77 of the Constitution of 1991) to relieve Inravisión of its regulatory functions: the Comisión Nacional de Televisión (National Television Commission or CNTV). This entity began operations in 1995.\\"Arranca la Comisión Nacional de Televisión.\\" El Tiempo 13 June 1995: link Initially, the contract would run for six years with the government retaining the option to extend the contracts for another six. This element was dropped in a new television law late in 1996, which thus meant that a new licitación would take place in 1997 with new programming in 1998. QAP, known for its impartiality and independence, believed that this act served solely to get them (as well as several other newscasts critical of the government) off the air and withdrew from the 1997 bidding. There were a variety of issues that accompanied the new bidding cycle: *In the 1983 and 1987 bidding cycles combined, only three programadoras had disappeared as a result of losing bids, but six vanished in the 1991 cycle, including Do Re Creativa TV, which protested along with four other disqualified programadoras alleging the illegality of the licitación.\\"Siguen demandas contra la licitación de television.\\" El Tiempo 7 August 1991: link *It was worried that the Cadena Dos programadoras would be at a disadvantage. Even though the channels had similar coverage area and technical capacity, as both were managed by Inravisión from the same transmitter sites, it was perceived that their positioning after Cadena Uno might hurt them. They proposed the names Telecolombia and Telenacional for the two channels, but ultimately, the two channels became Cadena Uno and Canal A. In March 1993, more ratings information came to Colombian screens. A court decision forced Inravisión to ban sexual and violent scenes from the franja familiar (family block). Programadoras were now required to state if the program was appropriate for minors to view.\\"Programas de TV siguen en el aire.\\" El Tiempo 31 March 1993: link In addition, programadoras had to submit their material to Inravisión 72 hours in advance to determine its suitability.

Source: IBOPE In 1997, Colómbia awarded two private television licenses to Caracol and RCN, two of the largest programadoras; their channels took to the air on July 10, 1998. Some 25 programadoras still applied for spaces on the two channels in the licitación of 1997, however, including Caracol and RCN which had limited spaces on the two major channels from January–July 1998.Luz Monroy, Martha. \\"Las sobrevivientes.\\" El Tiempo 15 July 2003: link However, Caracol and RCN enjoyed limited output; notably, Caracol was left without any timeslots on Saturdays. Other programadoras presented Caracol's marquee programs on that day, the Premier Caracol movie (Andes Televisión and the revived CPT) and the long-running Sábados Felices variety show (Coestrellas/CPS/Proyectamos Televisión). Understanding that more unity was needed within each channel against the new competition, programadoras began to find ways to cooperate. The twelve Canal A companies formed the Canal A Society, within which each of the programadoras acquired a program specialty. For instance, RTI produced novelas and large-scale game shows, while En Vivo was placed in charge of developing a channel-wide news service.León Giraldo, Diego. \\"El Canal A se lanza a la guerra.\\" El Tiempo 26 July 1998: link They also contracted one agency, Mejía y Asociados, to market advertising for the entire channel, while they began selling and buying programs as a single group on the international market.

As part of a salvation plan (Plan de Salvamento) approved by the government on June 19, 2003, RTI was moved to Canal Uno. After several months of showing nothing but programs from Audiovisuales, the state programadora (an arm of the Ministerio de Comunicaciones), on October 24, 2003, Canal A became the government-controlled Señal Institucional.Luz Monroy, Martha. \\"Adiós león, hola condor.\\" El Tiempo 22 Oct. 2003: link Inravisión and Audiovisuales were liquidated in 2004, partly due to the programadoras crisis but also due to out-of-date equipment and, in the case of the former, costly pension liabilities. Inravisión was replaced by RTVC (Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia), now known as RTVC Sistema de Medios Públicos. After the crisis The salvation plan of 2003 and the licitación of the same year resulted in a dramatic realignment of the survivors on Canal Uno. Of the seven remnants, six were grouped into time- sharing cooperatives: Jorge Barón Televisión with newcomer Sportsat, NTC with Colombiana de Televisión and RTI with Programar Televisión, along with CM&. Each of the four groups received 25% of Canal Uno's airtime, including the production of a newscast for each group. The original length of these contracts was 10 years beginning January 1, 2004, but all except the RTI/Programar contract, which the companies opted to not renew, were extended in September 2013 by the Autoridad Nacional de Televisión (ANTV), successor of the CNTV, to an expiration date of April 30, 2017.

The bidding was not without controversy. Jorge Barón Televisión had asked for a review of its 2013 request for a ten-year extension, which the ANTV denied. For its part, Programar Televisión filed a criminal complaint against Minister of Information Technologies and Communications David Luna and requested precautionary measures before the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce in order to stop the bidding, arguing that it was not true that the company had surrendered the timeslots it had until 2013. The ANTV defended itself by arguing that the adjudication in 2003 was made to a temporary union between Programar and RTI and which also applied for the 40-month extension that was given to the licensees in 2013, though RTI and Programar did not agree. ==Critical reception== Several television figures in Colombia have posthumously mourned the loss of the mixed system, noting that it was one of the reasons that television in Colombia developed to be stronger than that of its Latin American peers and that privatization, as happened with the launch of Caracol and RCN, killed off many positive qualities of Colombia's television industry. In a 2004 retrospective on 50 years of television in Colombia, Iván McAllister, then the president of Citytv Bogotá, noted: \\"The broadcast concessionaires knew what to abide by. There was a healthy market and a growing demand that allowed them to develop and consolidate themselves as television companies. That went away quickly with the new TV.\\" Daisy Cañón noted in 2003 that the privatization of Colombian television caused it to step back from a pluralism perspective, as the ability of Caracol and RCN to attract viewers and ratings causes high-quality cultural and other programs to be missed. Paula Arenas, former head of Producciones Cinevisión, noted as part of Señal Colombia's series covering the 60th anniversary of television in Colombia that privatization caused television \\"as a creative exercise\\" to become a loss-making proposalSeñal Colombia Sistema de Medios Públicos, \\"Del sistema mixto a la privatización\\", Todo Lo Que Vimos (2014): link and also that more recent Colombian television programs are more focused and formulaic.

Born John Haines or John W. Haynes, the 6' tall Klondike fought out of Chicago as a heavyweight at a weight of 190 to 200 lbs. from 1898 to 1911. He took the nickname because he was supposed to be a great find (evoking the Klondike Gold Rush). He made his pro boxing debut against future two-time colored heavyweight champ Frank Childs on 8 January 1898 at Chicago's 2nd Regiment Armory (a fight erroneously credited to lightweight Frank Young Haines). He was K.O.-ed by Childs. Later that month, on the 29th, Childs won the world colored heavyweight title from Bob Armstrong and his first defense of the title was against Klondike on February 26. Childs won by a T.K.O. in the fourth round of the scheduled six-round bout when the referee stopped the fight. They fought again four times, as African American boxers were forced to fight one another often due to the color bar. Childs won every fight. Klondike fought many of the top black heavyweights of his generation, including Johnson, the first black man to win the world heavyweight championship. Klondike first declared himself the black heavyweight champion after beating Johnson in the future world heavyweight champ's third pro fight at Chicago's Howard Theater on 8 May 1899. It was Klondike's eighth pro bout. According to the Chicago Tribune, \\"...Johnson knocked Haines down in Round one with an uppercut, and only the bell saved Klondyke...\\" Klondike and Johnson fought again twice, with one bout ending as a draw and the third with Johnson winning by a T.K.O. ==Black Heavyweight Championship== On 4 September 1898, Frank Childs lost his world colored heavyweight title to George Byers. Regardless of losing the title, Childs fought Bob Armstrong again on 4 March 1899 in Cincinnati, Ohio in a fight announced as a title bought, despite Byers being the legitimate champion. He defeated Armstrong via a TKO in the sixth round of a 10-round bout. On 11 August 1899, Childs challenged Klondike for his \\"Black Heavyweight Championship\\". In a six-round contest in Chicago, Childs prevailed by outpointing the \\"Black Hercules\\". On October 28 of that year, they met in a rematch in Chicago in which Childs retained the black heavyweight title by K.O.-ing Klondike in the third round of a six-round contest. On 16 March 1900, Childs put his black heavyweight title on the line and Bryers put up his colored heavyweight crown in a six-round bout that ended in a draw. He fought Joe Butler on 15 December 1900 for the black heavyweight title, dispatching Butler via K.O. in the sixth. Finally, he took back the Colored World Heavyweight Championship legitimately from Bryers on 16 March 1901 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, K.O.-ing him in the 17th round of a 20-round fight. (He did not put up his black heavyweight title, which he never claimed again.) Many years, later, when Sam Langford was denied a shot at the world heavyweight title by Jack Johnson, Langford claimed himself the colored heavyweight championship, much as Klondike had done a decade earlier when he declared himself the black heavyweight champ by beating the young Johnson. The problem with Langford's pretension was that the colored heavyweight title (which had been Johnson's from 1903 to 1908, when he vacated it upon winning the world heavyweight title) was held by Joe Jeanette. On 13 July 1909, in Pittsburgh's Bijou Theater, Langford \\"claimed\\" the title by facing and defeating Klondike, the erstwhile black heavyweight champ, with a newspaper decision in a six- rounder. After defeating the Dixie Kid in a defense of his proclaimed title on September 29, Langford faced Klondike at the Armory in Boston in his second \\"title defense\\". He K.O.'ed Klondike in the second round of a 12-round fight. Langford eventually became undisputed champ when he beat Jeanette on 6 September 1910. Klondike racked up an official record of 24 wins (14 by K.O.) against eleven losses (K.O.-ed six times) and three draws. He won five newspaper decisions, lost three and drew two. ==References== - Category:1878 births Category:1949 deaths Category:African-American boxers Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:American male boxers Category:Place of birth missing ","title":"Klondike (boxer)"},{"id":"35919966","text":"Kim Se-hyun (; born Kim Young-min, August 7, 1987) is a South Korean pitcher who plays for the Kia Tigers in the KBO League.

It is the largest crab found on the California coast. The species was first described to science by William Stimpson in 1857. The type specimen was collected on the coast of California, near San Francisco. Fossils from the late Miocene epoch indicate that this species is at least 11.63 to 5.333 million years old. == Description == The sheep crab has a carapace, four sets of walking legs, and a set of claws, or chelipeds. Males are larger than females. The carapace of a male can be up to across, while females can grow to . The carapace is tear-shaped with a wide, rounded posterior which tapers to a point at its snout, or rostrum. There is an obvious preorbital spine on the tip of the rostrum, which is sharply down- curved and deeply notched at its tip. The carapace is covered in short spines, or tubercles. The longest legs, the second pair of walking legs, is longer than the carapace is wide, so sheep crabs can reach an overall width of . While the exoskeleton, or shell, is reddish, brown, or blue-green, this is often masked. Young crabs deliberately attach algae, bryozoans, hydroids, sponges, and other creatures to their exoskeletons as a form of camouflage to hide from predators. Animals larger than cease to decorate themselves. This species stops molting when it reaches sexual maturity, however, and a layer of algae often develops on the long-lived adult exoskeleton, giving these crabs a green appearance. == Distribution and habitat == This crab lives in coastal waters from Cordell Bank, California to Punta San Bartolome, Baja California. It is found in waters between and deep. Sheep crabs are quite mobile, achieving speeds of , foraging on soft and rocky bottoms, as well as pilings. This species is migratory, spending the warm months of the year in shallow waters and the cooler months in deeper waters. == Reproduction and life history == Sheep crabs are gonchoric, which is to say that individuals are either male or female. They form aggregations, piles of dozens or hundreds of crabs. The aggregations which have been studied in detail are composed only of adults and included females and at least one male. Sheep crabs are typically solitary, and it has been hypothesized that the purpose of the aggregations is to increase the concentration of a chemical signal, a pheromone, from the females to attract males for mating. A male crab grasps a female for mating and delivers a sperm packet. A female can store sperm for later use, if no males are available. Fertilization takes place internally, and the fertilized eggs are then glued to the exterior of the female's abdomen. Females brood their eggs to protect them from predation. Broods may contain 125,000 to 500,000 eggs. The development of the eggs can be discerned by their color. Orange eggs are the freshest, red are of intermediate development, and brown can be seen to have eyes and are ready to be released. Brooding females have been found year-round suggesting that there is no strong seasonal peak in reproduction. The length of the brooding period is unknown. After release from the female, larval crabs are free swimming plankton. They settle to the bottom and become recognizable sheep crabs when they reach about across. The sheep crab has a rigid and thick exoskeleton which presents an obstacle to growth. The shell cannot grow even if the animal inside it does. Like most other crabs, this species solves this issue by periodically molting its shell. It first forms a soft shell inside the existing exoskeleton. It then opens a slit at the rear of the carapace and backs out of the old shell. The new, soft shell is then vigorously inflated with water and it hardens at this inflated size. The animal then has plenty of room to grow inside the new shell simply by displacing the water. This strategy also has the benefit of allowing the animal to regenerate limbs that have been lost since its last molt. Unlike many crabs, the sheep crab ceases to molt when it attains sexual maturity. This terminal molt ends its ability to grow and regenerate limbs. The maximum life of this crab is unknown, but is at least three years. == Diet == The sheep crab is a scavenger-generalist in diet, eating algae, mussels, sea stars, small crabs, including juvenile sheep crabs and northern kelp crabs, and dead fish. == Predators == Sheep crabs are preyed upon by sea otters, cabezon, California sheephead, octopus, sharks, bay rays, California sea lions, and larger sheep crabs. == Fishery == In the late 1970s a commercial fishery for sheep crabs developed in California. Two markets emerged, one for the large claws of the male crabs, and another for whole crabs. The fishery peaked in 1988 when 96,000 pounds of claws and 108,000 pounds of whole crabs were landed. In 1990, a California ballot initiative banned the use of gill nets and trammel nets that were used to catch sheep crabs, and the fishery shrank significantly. In 2018, California reported commercial landings of 503 pounds of claws and 74,863 pounds of whole crabs. Sheep crab are taken as bycatch in the California spiny lobster fishery. One study found 1.29% of the animals caught in lobster traps were sheep crabs. ==References== Category:Majoidea Category:Crustaceans described in 1857 ","title":"Loxorhynchus grandis"},{"id":"35920024","text":"Triphyllozoon inornatum is a species of bryozoa in the family Phidoloporidae. ==References== Category:Cheilostomata Category:Animals described in 1934 ","title":"Triphyllozoon inornatum"},{"id":"35920025","text":"Gold-mouth sea squirt.

It is commonly known as the tall urn ascidian, the green barrel sea squirt or the green reef sea-squirt. It is native to the Red Sea and the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. ==Description== A colony of Didemnum molle is composed of a number of linked zooids adhering to the substrate. Each individual zooid has a plump, urn-shaped body with a diameter of up to . The tunic (body wall) is made of a cellulose-like substance that is strong but flexible, and is perforated by numerous small holes, the buccal siphons, through which water is drawn into the body. At the top of the body is the large atrial siphon through which water flows out. The tunic is strengthened by the presence of many spherical calcareous spicules which are particularly concentrated round the neck of the urn. The colony is white, brown or green, or some combination of these colours. This hue is due to the symbiotic blue- green algae of the genus Prochloron present in the tissues. The tunic contains mycosporins which filter out ultra-violet radiation and protect the symbiotic cyanobacteria from damage in strong sunlight. In shallow water the colonies are small, the colour is more intense and there are more spicules present making the external surface bright white. At greater depths the colonies are larger, there are fewer spicules and the colour is more greyish or brownish. The tunic exudes large quantities of mucus which makes this species sticky to the touch. It is very similar to Atriolum robustum in appearance, especially young colonies, but can be distinguished by the mucus secretion and the network of canals connecting the thorax internally to the atrial siphon. ==Distribution== Didemnum molle is native to the western Indo-Pacific region where it is common and widely distributed. It grows on rock or dead coral on shallow reefs. In New Caledonia there is a green variant that grows direct onto sand. ==Biology== Didemnum molle is a suspension feeder. Water is drawn into the body of each zooid through the numerous buccal siphons, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fine organic particles are filtered out and the water is exhaled through the atrial siphon. Asexual reproduction takes place by budding. A new bud will form and begin to actively feed while the zooid from which it emerged gradually regresses and is eventually re-adsorbed. Sexual reproduction also takes place. Each zooid is hermaphrodite and fertilisation takes place in the body cavity when a clutch of eggs is fertilised by sperm drawn in with the water stream. The embryos are brooded for a few days before the tadpole-like larvae are expelled into the water column. These quickly settle and cement themselves to suitable surfaces and start new colonies. ==References * Category:Enterogona Category:Animals described in 1886 ","title":"Didemnum molle"},{"id":"35920028","text":"Pyromaia tuberculata is a species of crab in the family Inachoididae. == Taxonomy == Pyromaia tuberculata, also known as the fire crab, was first described by Lockington in 1877 off the coast of San Diego, California. The familial classification of pyromaia is currently still controversial. It was originally known as the Inachus tuberculata, and has also been referred to as Neorhynchus mexicanus. It is a member of the superfamily majoidea, also called “spider crabs”. == Description == P. tuberculata is a benthic dwelling crab species, with adults often inhabiting continental shelves. Individuals of P. tuberculata have a granulate and tuberculate carapace, with a short, backwards facing spine on the first abdominal segment. The species undergoes nine post- larval stages each separated by brief periods of molting. Beginning at the third crab stage, mature females can be differentiated from males by the large rounded sodomites which make up their abdominal plates and form a cavity to hold eggs. The carapace length of adult specimens in the ninth crab stage can reach up to 20 mm while the carapace width can reach approximately 18 mm. == Life cycle == The life cycle of P. tuberculata is made up of three main stages: the egg, larval, and crab. The incubation time of P. tuberculata eggs has an inverse relationship to the temperature in which the ovigerous females live, with eggs hatching after 7 days at 26℃, and 80 days at 8℃. Larvae are free floating and feed on brine shrimp and small plankton, undergoing regular intervals of molting. There are two zoeal and one megalopa stage for larval tuberculata, which can be distinguished through analysis of carapace spines and relative width. In the first zoeal stage the carapace has a singular dorsal spine and the eyes are sessile, whereas in the second zoeal stage there are multiple small dorsal spines and eyes are slightly stalked. In the megalopa stage, the carapace lacks spines but is larger and more prominently lobed. After reaching the initial crab stage, it takes approximately 3 months for P. tuberculata to reach adulthood. There is no clear difference in body size or weight between adult males and females. Males can begin to reproduce after 47–81 days, while female can reproduce after 62–79 days. == Life history == P. tuberculata is characterized by a low number of post-larval stages which results in a shorter life span than other benthic crab species. This species also has a shorter larval phase, which is common in the Majidae family, and represents a greater degree of ecological specialization. It has a relatively short developmental stage and can reproduce year round. The ability of female crabs to carry fertilized eggs days after the puberty molt aids in shorter generation times. In combination with strategies leading to maximum offspring survival, such as a high larval dispersal area to areas of high oxygen, the year round reproduction of P. Tuberculata makes it so three generation cycles may take place each year. Females of the first generation lay eggs in early spring which reach maturity in late summer. This second generation releases eggs more quickly due to the warmer average water temperature, allowing for the third generation to settle and release eggs until early winter. == Habitat == P. tuberculata is native to the pacific coast of North America from San Francisco Bay to Panama, but has spread to coastal waters of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Japan, and New Zealand. Larvae float freely in coastal and estuarial waters up to 18 meters of depth. Adults live hidden among stones or on mud to sandy-mud bottoms up to depths of 412 meters. Adults and larvae were reported on the Atlantic Argentine continental shelf after previously only being observed in the Atlantic in the coastal waters of Brazil. P. tuberculata has now also spread to the western Pacific, as specimens of P. tuberculata have been found along the southeast coast of Australia in Port Phillip Bay and Newcastle, and along the western coast in Cockburn Sound. In the northwest pacific, populations of P. tuberculata have been established in the waters of China and Japan mostly due to naval shipping after World War II. == Invasive species == P. tuberculata is considered an invasive species due to its spreading to the southeast Atlantic and western Pacific. After arriving in Japanese waters, P. tuberculata has thrived due to its ability to quickly recolonize waters following instances of summer hypoxia. Smaller, native crabs have limited breeding seasons which restrict their ability to compete with the invasive P. tuberculata. In eutrophic waters such as Tokyo Bay, P. tuberculata is abundant from the intertidal zone up to 80 meters of depth, with inner-bay populations being replenished each fall with larvae from crabs in the outer- bay, which do not experience the hypoxic die offs. Populations of P. tuberculata are limited in the shallow waters of Port Phillip Bay Australia due to predation by globefish. ==References== Category:Majoidea Category:Crustaceans described in 1877 Category:Taxa named by William Neale Lockington ","title":"Pyromaia tuberculata"},{"id":"35920030","text":"Carpilius maculatus common names seven-eleven crab, spotted reef crab, dark- finger coral crab, and large spotted crab,https://books.google.com/books?id=0c2p5FK1wdAC Tropical Island Recovery, Michael J.

The spots are placed in a 2-3-4 design, with two at the front of its carapace, three across the middle, and four located at its posterior end. This species grows to approximately 18 cm. At an average carapace width of 152 mm, it is larger in size in regards to other xanthids.Wetzer R, Martin JW, Trautwein SE. 2003. Phylogenetic relationships within the coral crab genus Carpilius (Brachyura, Xanthoidea, Carpiliidae) and of the Carpiliidae to other xanthoid crab families based on molecular sequence data. Mol Phylogenet Evol. 27:410–421. The C. maculatus has a smooth carapace and general appearance, with the exception of four protruding spines located between its eyes. == Habitat == These crabs are typically found on coral and rocky reef substrates generally in the Indo-West Pacific.Zacharia P, Krishnakumar P, Dineshbabu A, Vijayakumaran K, Rohit P, Thomas S, Sasikumar G, Kaladharan P, Durgekar NR, Mohamed K. 2008.

DOI: 10.1080/23802359.2019.1679682 == Feeding == The nocturnal nature of the Carpilius maculatus leads it to hunt primarily at night, with its diet consisting mainly of marine snails.Zipser E, Vermeij G J. 1978. Crushing behavior of tropical and temperate crabs. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 31(2):155-172. Observations of feeding behavior revealed that Carpilius maculatus initially attack the legs or small claws of its prey, before utilizing its master claw in order to crush the shells of its prey. There was no distinct difference between the manus heights and thicknesses between females and males of the species.Vermeij G J. 1976. Interoceanic differences in vulnerability of shelled prey to crab predation. Nature. 260(5547): 135. The larger size of these master claws allows the C. maculatus to feed efficiently on bigger members of its prey species. In general, C. maculatus tends to avoid consuming smaller-sized prey (< 10 mm). Proximal molars are located on these master claws that aid it in its shell- and spire-crushing behavior. == Phylogenetic Relationships == While scientists previously grouped the genus Carpilius with other crabs of the Xanthiae family, recent research on mitochondrial gene fragments of the Carpilius crabs has granted it its status as a separate monotypic genus within its distinct family, Carpiliidae. Fossil records of crabs classified within the family Carpiliidae have linked it to the genera Palaeocarpilius, which was present during the middle to upper Eocene Epoch approximately 56 million years ago and found in what is now modern-day Europe, India, and Egypt.Schweitzer, C.E., Feldmann, R.M., Tucker, A.B., Berglund, R.E., 2000. Eocene decapod crustaceans from Pulali Point, Washington. Ann. Carnegie Mus. 69, 23–67. The family Carpiliidae has also been associated with the Harpactoxanthopsis of Europe – a now extinct family located within the superfamily Carpilioidea. This fossil record, however, is insufficient to establish a biological origination point for the group. Mitogenome analysis of C. maculatus has also allowed scientists to place Carpilius maculatus within the Heterotremata species, a clade of freshwater crabs. ==References * Category:Crabs Category:Crustaceans described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Carpilius maculatus"},{"id":"35920031","text":"Anasimus latus is a species of crab in the family Inachoididae. ==Description== The carapace of this species has a broadly ovate shape, is rough in texture, and contains spines.

In , he batted .448 with 15 home runs and 34 stolen bases in 70 games for his club, Post 6. The Mets scouted Nimmo's Legion games and other events. One such event was the 2010 Under Armour All-America Baseball Game at Wrigley Field, where Nimmo went 2-for-4 with a triple, two runs scored and two runs batted in to earn co-MVP honors with pitcher Nick Burdi. Baseball America ranked Nimmo among the Top 50 prospects for the 2011 draft at number 35. When the Mets selected Nimmo with the 13th overall pick in , he became the highest-drafted Wyomingite in the history of the Major League Baseball Draft. Of the 12 players selected from Wyoming, the previous highest pick was pitcher Michael Beaver, selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the sixth round (109th overall) of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft.

If left unsigned, he had a verbal commitment to attend the University of Arkansas. ==Professional career== Minor league career Nimmo in the 2013 All-Star Futures Game at Citi Field Nimmo played ten games with the Gulf Coast Mets and the Kingsport Mets towards the end of the season. He combined to hit .211 with four runs batted in. He spent the following season with the Class A-Short Season Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York–Penn League. On July 30, Nimmo posted the first four- hit game of his career, falling just a triple short of the cycle, with three runs scored and two RBIs to lead the Cyclones in a 10–5 win over the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. On August 18, Nimmo capped a career-high six-RBI night with his second grand slam of the season.

By April 17, Nimmo was the leading hitter in the South Atlantic League with a .447 batting average, earning him a SAL mid-season All-Star nod. He was also voted into the All-Star Futures Game held at the Mets' Citi Field. By season's end, his batting average fell to .273 with two home runs and forty RBIs. His performance at the plate was considered underwhelming as he averaged more than a strikeout per game. His numbers may have been hampered by a spacious home ballpark in Savannah that's tough on lefty power hitters, as well as a wrist injury that caused him to miss some games. Nimmo started the season with Class-A Advanced St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League. After batting .322 with four home runs, 25 RBIs, a .448 on-base percentage and .458 slugging percentage to earn FSL All-Star honors, he received a mid-season promotion to Double-A Binghamton Mets on June 19. Between his two clubs, Nimmo posted a .278 Avg, 10 HR and 51 RBI. After a brief four game stint with St. Lucie at the start of the season, Nimmo was promoted to the Binghamton Mets. He suffered a knee injury on April 29 that caused him to miss some playing time. Prior to the knee injury, Nimmo was batting .297 with a .368 on-base percentage and a .420 slugging percentage in 34 games. On July 28, it was announced that Nimmo was promoted to the Mets Triple-A affiliate, Las Vegas 51s as the starting center fielder.

Nimmo started strong, hitting .350/.458/.400 over 24 plate appearances. However, he was placed on the disabled list with a partially collapsed lung on July 8 and would not return until July 28. Nimmo would finish the 2017 season appearing in 69 games for the Mets, batting .260/.379/.418 with 5 home runs. Late in the year, hitting coaches Kevin Long and Pat Roessler suggested that Nimmo try hitting without his front foot striding forward. Nimmo took the suggestion, which allowed his front foot to turn open and generate better hip rotation. Up until that August, Nimmo had slugged .346 in his career. He slugged .479 in September and continued to show increased power in 2018, slugging over .500 through the season's first two months. In 2018, Nimmo batted .263/.404/.483, with 17 home runs and 47 RBI.

It also involves the formulation of public policy, regulations, aviation laws pertaining to airspace, airlines, airports, aerodromes and the conduct of air services agreements through treaty. This branch of engineering is distinct from aerospace engineering which deals with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. ==Airspace development== The global airspace is divided into territorial airspace which then belongs to a country. Generally, airspace has to be engineered to benefit both military and civil users. Planning and designing airspace is important so as not to affect military operations and in order to designate air routes for commercial airlines to navigate freely without intervention by military authorities. For instance, not all of China can be used for commercial aeronautical navigation. Certain airspaces are designated as military-use only. Navigating outside commercial airspaces in the country may lead to the risk of the astrayed aircraft. In prior years, airspace has been limited to military and airmail services. The advancement in aerospace engineering brought to fore aircraft designs that lead to the development of commercial airliners. Governments around the world concluded air rights for their respective airlines and their corresponding aircraft. The government saw the economic potential of airspace as a state enterprise. This rise in the development of commercial aviation led to the study of the complexities of aircraft (plane) management, airport design and construction, international air services agreements (treaties). In recent years, the global airline industry has demanded that China should reform its aviation policies. ==Airport design== Recent designs of airports have been engineered to align with global environmental standards. Advancement in civil engineering and architecture make an interplay of the two disciplines. ==Career== Governments around the world hire aviation engineers for all sorts of reasons. In the United States, federal, state and local agencies all commonly employ aviation engineers for agencies such as the Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of controlling aircraft navigation throughout the whole nation, maintaining navigation, licensing and certification for aviation engineers. FAA employs many aviation engineers to work on research and development problems, noise pollution and hypersonic aircraft among other things. Engineers are heavily involved in improving aviation technologies to support the advancement of military and commercial aviation. Aviation engineers are often employed in aerospace machine shops specializing in the technological advancement of aircraft parts and equipment. These shops produce aircraft components such as electrical connectors, oxygen generation systems, landing gear assemblies, and other pieces that require special attention. Aviation engineers do more than work on planes. Aviation engineers also play a large role in airport design. They provide guidance for the construction and daily running of the airports, as well as help in the operation and maintenance. ==References== Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Occupations in aviation Join AAEBLR for Aircraft Maintenance Engineering in Bangalore ","title":"Aviation engineering"},{"id":"35920229","text":"Michele Santucci (born 30 May 1989) is an Italian swimmer.

Corwin is a board-certified psychiatrist, child and adolescent psychiatrist, and forensic psychiatrist. Corwin has done extensive work into the long-term impact of child violence and abuse on health, and has promoted family support and treatment programs. Corwin has worked as a consultant, a lecturer, a trainer, and an evaluator of suspected or known child sexual abuse cases throughout many countries, as well as serving as an expert witness of child sexual abuse cases. Corwin has founded, directed or chaired groups that serve to advance prevention and protection against child violence and abuse, as well as furthering the education and research of the impact of child abuse. ==Biography== Education Corwin received a B.S degree at the University of Michigan, followed by receiving an M.D. at the Michigan State College of Human Medicine. Corwin completed an internship in psychiatry and internal medicine and then a psychiatry residency at UCLA-VA Medical Center. Corwin completed a fellowship in child psychiatry at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, and then certificates in executive leadership, advanced training in continuous quality improvement and conflict resolution at the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare. Career Corwin inspired and chaired the National Summit Conference meeting in Los Angeles in 1985 about how to diagnose child sexual abuse. A consequence of the conference was the formation of the group that founded the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) in 1986 which Corwin chaired and later served as a member of APSAC's BOD. In the same year that he chaired the organizing committee for APSAC, Corwin founded the California Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (CAPSAC). The aim of APSAC is to promote the best possible professional response for children and families at risk of maltreatment APSAC regularly publishes the newsletter APSAC Advisor and the journal Child Maltreatment which inform professionals in a range of disciplines about the latest policies, research findings, and up to date information on child maltreatment. Corwin was awarded Outstanding Service in 1993 and Outstanding Professional of the Year in 2007 by APSAC. Corwin co-directed the UCLA Family Support Program for treatment of intra-familial child sexual abuse from 1980 to 1982. During his time at UCLA, he initiated and chaired the Los Angeles Task Force on interviewing sexually abused children which was the first to recommend nationally and internationally (Washington D.C. and Paris, 1982) the video recording of investigative and evaluative interviews with children in possible sexual abuse cases. Starting in 1999 he served as Medical Director of Primary Children's Medical Center's Safe and Healthy Families Department and later Chief of the Pediatrics Child Protection Division until August 1, 2012. Corwin has served as an expert witness and evaluated, trained, consulted and lectured on suspected or known cases of child sexual abuse throughout many countries and regions over the last 30 years, including Thailand, Canada, the United States, Europe, Israel, South Korea, and Great Britain. Corwin served as liaison for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, from 2001 to 2009 to the AMA's National Advisory Council on Violence and Abuse of which he was its last Steering Committee Chair and oversaw its transformation, into the National Health Collaborative on Violence and Abuse for which he served as the first chair. Corwin also helped found and serves as president for the Academy on Violence and Abuse from 2013 to 2015, which is an interprofessional international membership society that promotes research and education about the health effects of violence and abuse. Corwin is also a founder of the Helfer Society, which is named after one of his first faculty preceptors at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Ray E. Helfer, MD. The Helfer Society is an honorary society for physicians who focus their work on child abuse. Corwin was chosen as a national leading child abuse physician in 2006 and invited to join the Whitworth Seniors Forum, a small group of physician leaders focusing on child abuse policy. The Child Abuse Research Education and Services (CARES) Network is a proposal to establish a nationwide network of consortia of excellence dedicated to training, research and improving the ability of the healthcare system to identify, treat and prevent child abuse. The CARES Network, conceived and promoted by Drs. Randall Alexander, John Stirling and Corwin was endorsed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions but to this dated never funded by Congress. Corwin currently works as a professor and director of forensic services for the Pediatrics Department at the University of Utah. He has a continuing interest in improving services and awareness about the adverse health impacts of violence and abuse across the lifespan. Corwin also continues to serve as an expert witness, consultant and forensic evaluator. He has produced three DVDs including the 2012 Academy on Violence and Abuse DVD featuring Drs. Felitti, Anda and Putnam and reviewed by Dick Krugman, MD in the August 15, 2012 issue of JAMA, http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1346147 . ==Publications== Journal articles Listed are a selection of journal publications Corwin has written, or co-written. Because the articles demonstrate his area of work and interest, a short summary of each article is given below each journal reference. * Child sexual abuse has cycled in and out of public and professional awareness over more than a century, through periods of discovery and suppression. Modern awareness of sexual abuse has been enlightened by the amount of research done into its negative impact on health and development, and its prevalence. Nevertheless, current knowledge of child sexual victimization has been influenced by reaction that is reminiscent of earlier suppression cycles in child sexual abuse history. Such cycles can diminish the scale of child sexual abuse as a problem. It is important to understand where such recoil can come from, as doing so can help to avoid reoccurrence of suppression in the future. * This article is a response to Milchman's article about ethical guidelines for professionals on child sexual abuse assessment. The areas of ethical issues that Milchman focuses on are confidentiality, parent and child interviews, child evaluation for the attorney representing the accused and evaluation agreement to one side of a dispute or battle for custody. One area is of particular interest; whether or not it is ethical and wise for a professional who is well trained on child sexual abuse and who has completed the relevant evaluations to attest that a child has been abused. * The article presents a case extract of a young adolescent boy who was sexually abused by a professional within his school, after which a court case followed. The article highlights how to make use of relevant research regarding the prognosis of damage to mental health and how to arrive at a conclusion for a forensic report based on the evidence. An evidence-based practice approach is emphasised. * Over the last century and a half child sexual abuse has been marked by periods of suppression and discovery. Child sexual abuse has emerged back into public and professional awareness in the last 30 years, and since then billions of dollars have been spent on efforts toward its prevention and the protection of children from maltreatment. Such efforts are the results of evidence from research and investigation into all aspects of child maltreatment. There has been a need for mental health professionals and child psychiatrists to provide expert knowledge for forensic and legal issues surrounding child maltreatment; this article provides an approach to take for professionals who are called upon to assess the personal damage, long-term harm, and treatment of victims of child maltreatment. * Child sexual abuse in the context of custody battles is at risk of being oversimplified instead of recognised as a complex problem. Children who are victims of sexual abuse and are caught in the middle of a custody battle are most at risk at missing out on protection and of misdiagnosis. Limitations of formulas which seek to distinguish between true and false claims of child sexual abuse are discussed. * There has been an increase of attention toward professional evaluation of identifying child sexual abuse and away from children themselves validating sexual abuse. Consensus of measures in identifying child sexual abuse is required of professionals. Some studies have looked interviews of sexually abused children as a way of identifying factors that indicate sexual abuse, but more research is needed. * It is more difficult to confirm sexual abuse of pre-schoolers than for older children; this article discusses some reasons why this is so, and suggests that sexual knowledge is the most useful yardstick of sexual abuse in quite young children. Methods of assessment are also discussed. * This article reviews the case of a young girl \\"Jane Doe\\" who disclosed to Corwin that she had been sexually abused. The article includes verbatim transcript and the history behind one of the first interviews with Jane, which was videotaped. Jane was contacted again 11 years later and re- interviewed by Corwin, again which was videotaped. Comparison of both the interviews provides a unique look at Jane's memory for the event, which is discussed. ==The Jane Doe case== In 1997 Corwin published an article in the journal Child Maltreatment about \\"Jane Doe\\"; a young girl who in 1984 along with her parents were referred to Corwin for a court-appointed forensic evaluation, as mutually agreed by all parties involved in family court litigation regarding custody and visitation, after she disclosed that she had been sexually abused by her mother after the parents separated. Corwin videotaped his interviews with Jane, then five and six years old, the third and last interview of which a verbatim transcript, history, and discussion of the case are documented in the 1997 publication. Corwin had previously concluded that Jane had been sexually abused by her mother, and her father was granted custody rights while the mother eventually lost even the right to visitation. Ten years after the court-appointed and video recorded evaluation, Jane was contacted again by Corwin to reaffirm her assent for his use of the earlier video recorded interview for professional education and she requested to view her forensic evaluation interviews to help her remember what she had told Corwin, since she could not remember the experiences she earlier described. A year later, after her father's death, Corwin met with Jane and videotaped the informed consent with Jane prior to showing her the earlier video recorded interviews. Jane was 17 years old at that time. During the videotaped informed consent, Jane appears to recall the memory of sexual abuse, but also described events for which there was no previous documentation. Five commentaries follow Corwin's 1997 article, which discuss various aspects of the Jane Doe case such as Jane's expressive behaviour during her interviews and implications of the recollection of the abuse that Jane previously hadn't remembered. Although some researchers hailed Jane's recollection as an example of \\"repressed memory\\", Elizabeth Loftus was sceptical about the truth surrounding the alleged abuse and investigated Jane Doe's case, concluding that Jane had never been abused by the mother. Jane Doe, who then revealed herself as Nicole Taus, sued Loftus and lengthy litigation took place. The Jane Doe case raises questions about the ethics, methods, and rights of professionals to review and investigate published case reports. ==References== Category:American psychiatrists Category:Living people Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:University of Utah School of Medicine alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Michigan State University alumni ","title":"David Corwin"},{"id":"35920388","text":"Gaotaizi (高台子镇) may refer to the following locations in China: * Gaotaizi, Heilongjiang, in Datong District, Daqing * Gaotaizi, Benxi, in Mingshan District, Benxi, Liaoning * Gaotaizi, Jinzhou, in Yi County, Liaoning * Gaotaizi, Xinmin, Liaoning * Gaotaizizhen Subdistrict, Datong District, Daqing, Heilongjiang ","title":"Gaotaizi"},{"id":"35920401","text":"Producciones Cinevisión was a Colombian programadora. It was founded in 1968 and liquidated in 1996, returned in 1999 and was liquidated again in 2008. ==History== Early Jorge Arenas Lemus founded what was then known as CV- TV in 1968. Its early programming consisted of foreign films and (from 1975) Noticiero Cinevisión. The company's trade name followed suit with the newscast, becoming Cinevisión in 1979. It produced six hours a week of programs after the 1979 bidding cycle, including programs on both Cadena Uno and Cadena Dos. Consolidation and development In the 1981 bidding cycle Cinevisión received five hours of programs, returning to six in 1983. The programadora soon found itself in hot water with viewers. It had been airing in 1985 the Brazilian telenovela Loco amor, but it was pulled for low ratings in 1986. Viewers began to boycott the various replacements: after a Mexican- Argentinian telenovela was sacked for another Brazilian telenovela (Baila conmigo), which also did poorly, that too was replaced with Loco amor. The newscast, which had aired on weeknights in the 1979 and 1981 bidding cycles, went up against Promec's newscast Noticiero Promec at the weekends in 1983. In the 1987 cycle, Cinevisión again received six hours of programming. But the new placement of Noticiero Cinevisión was a flop, running at 12:30 on weekdays against the more successful Telenoticiero al Medio Día from Telestudio. However, it began to recover its viewership. Other successes for Cinevisión were the comedies La de los tintos and Rosalina Rosas Rosales TV, plus Chispazos, the most-viewed Cinevisión program of the 1987 cycle. It also broadcast foreign telenovelas on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays such as El Camino Secreto and Quinceañera. 1990s: A new owner and a new approach In 1990, Nelly Ordoñez retired from the chief position at Cinevisión, replaced by Paula Arenas Canal. On Wednesday, October 31 of that year, Cinevisión underwent an overhaul, with a new logo and a new comedy program. Zoociedad, a program known for its political parodies, debuted that night. Cinevisión also brought another international hit to Colombian screens for the first time: The Simpsons debuted on Saturday, February 1, 1992. Matt Groening didn't like the Mexican voice actors, forcing a long delay in the process. The newscast also bid farewell on Tuesday, December 31, 1991, as Cinevisión didn't apply for a newscast license in the 1992-1998 cycle; as an entertainment-focused programadora, it earned money in 1992. A Tuesday night drama, OKTV La alternativa del escorpión, was later replaced by María María. The new bidding cycle gave Cinevisión ten hours a week on Cadena Uno. Among its major successes was a collaboration in October 1992 with RTI Colombia to present a special celebrating the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. Cinevisión also received critical acclaim, winning several national awards. In 1993, the owners of Cinevisión founded PTV Colómbia, an independent producer that helped arrange equipment sharing programs. Previously Cinevisión had loaned equipment and facilities to programmers including Inravisión, Producciones PUNCH and Promec. ==Crisis and demise== Frozen salaries heated tempers at Cinevisión as 1993 continued. María María attracted lower ratings than OKTV and had to battle against Coestrellas's powerful Señora Isabel. Zoociedad was sinking in the ratings, and some were demanding the resignation of Jaime Garzón and the rest of the production team. On Monday, October 11, it left the air. As a solution, in January 1994, Cinevisión signed a contract with Caracol Televisión. Many Cinevisión programs went to Caracol. By 1995, the programadora was airing what would be its final program, Ordóñese de la risa. On Monday, October 30, 1995, Cinevisión returned its program slots to Inravisión. Jorge Arenas Lumas died of health problems that December. Through February 1996, Audiovisuales, Inravisión's programadora, managed the slots, then sold them off to a variety of producers. ==References== Cinevision ","title":"Producciones Cinevisión"},{"id":"35920444","text":"Nandian (南甸镇) may refer to the following locations in China: * Nandian, Hebei * Nandian, Liaoning, in Benxi Manchu Autonomous County ","title":"Nandian"},{"id":"35920450","text":"Hennessey Performance Engineering is an American tuning house specializing in modifying sports cars from several brands including Ferrari, Porsche, McLaren, Chevrolet, Dodge, Cadillac, Lotus, Jeep, Ford, GMC, Lincoln and Lexus.

The event is held on the closest weekend to 2 August, in commemoration of the death of Michael Causer, the young gay man who was murdered in the city in 2008, and has grown to become one of the largest free Gay Pride festivals in Europe with 2013's audience numbers reaching up to 75,000 people. Liverpool Pride usually features a parade and march through the city centre on the Saturday plus a large open air festival, a number of stages, street stalls and street entertainment at the Pier Head. There is also the Liverpool Pride Fringe at the city's gay quarter itself. A ‘Chill Out Sunday’ usually follows which includes sports, arts and culture events across the city. Liverpool Pride is a registered charity run by a Board of Trustees with the stated aim of promoting equality and diversity, advancing education, and eliminating discrimination in relation to LGBT people across the six districts of Liverpool City Region: Halton, Knowsley, City of Liverpool, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral. ==Constitution and Core Values== Liverpool Pride is a not-for- profit registered charity governed by Memorandum and Articles of association and a board of 8 volunteer trustees elected by its membership at the Annual General Meetings. Membership is free and is open to anyone regardless of their sexuality, gender or sexual/gender identity so long as they have volunteered for Liverpool Pride during the previous 18 months, are an elected or appointed member of the local LGBT Steering Group, or represent a registered charity, community group or Not-for-Profit that supports Liverpool Pride's objects. The organisation is funded through contributions made from its delivery partners, through advertising and sponsorship. It also receives a significant amount of ‘in-kind’ support from organisations, fundraisers and volunteers. All funds raised go to the delivery of the festival and any surplus made goes towards the development of the next festival. Liverpool Pride also helps to support charities that share its 4 core values which are: To be inclusive, to be visible, to be free and to have a strong Liverpool/Merseyside identity. The current Trustee Board are: Lucy Day (Chair), Joan Burnett, Andi Herring, John Bird, Patrick Jones, James Licence, Kim McCann and Zoran Blackie. ==History== Looking down Dale Street towards main stage at Liverpool Pride 2010 Up until 2010, Liverpool was the largest British city to not hold a Pride and it took many years of campaigning to establish a stable and lasting celebration in the city. The campaign took a significant turning point in 2008 when the newly formed Liverpool LGBT Network voted that establishing a permanent Pride in the city would be one of its key priorities. At the height of Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture it was felt that staging a successful festival to rival those of other large UK cities was a realistic and attainable goal. Later in the year, the movement began to gather pace and was bolstered by a renewed sense of urgency and determination following the high-profile homophobic murder of Michael Causer on the outskirts of the city. A motion in support of Liverpool Pride was put before a full meeting of Liverpool City Council by Labour Councillor Nick Small on 28 January 2009, and was approved by 74 votes to 2.Lesbian and Gay Foundation, 5 February 2009 The City Council stated that the festival would ‘celebrate the city’s diversity, be an opportunity to raise money for charitable causes and boost the city’s visitor and night time economies’. Liverpool Gay Quarter Pride, Stanley Street, 6 August 2011 The first official Pride was successfully held in the gay quarter in 2010, centered on Dale Street and Stanley Street, however, in 2011 due to a funding shortfall the controversial decision was taken to relocate the main focus of the festival to the city's Pier Head. Following this announcement, a public backlash ensued and sections of the local LGBT community planned to boycott the event. In quick response to the anger and disappointment expressed by the community and in an attempt to salvage the situation, more than 30 businesses around Stanley Street (including the Liverpool Gay Village Business Association) rallied together in an unprecedented move and organised a complementary festival to take place in the gay district alongside the main event. Despite the overall festival proving successful in the end with visitor numbers doubling, organisers came under heavy criticism from openly gay councillor Steve Radford and chair of the Village Business Association, who accused the Pride committee of \\"running itself aloof from the Gay Quarter and not listening to the needs of the gay community and local businesses.\\" In an interview with Seen Magazine (a local LGBT publication), Liverpool Pride responded with claims that only a small number of local gay businesses had actually supported the event. By 2012, lessons had been learned and a much more coherent and unified approach was adopted. The Pride committee pledged that a presence would be maintained around the gay quarter thanks to a close working partnership with the Village Business Association, the collective that had organised Stanley Street Pride in 2011. Furthermore, a number of new people elected to Liverpool Pride's Board of Trustees had proven experience as organisers of the Stanley Street Pride the previous year, which meant dialogue between the local gay scene and the main Pride organisers would be much more constructive and free-flowing. Whilst Liverpool held its first \\"Official\\" Pride in 2010, it was not first ever in the city. Previous Prides have been held in 1979, 1990–1992, and in 1995. ==Past Festivals== 2013: \\"Superheroes\\" The theme for Liverpool Pride 2013 was ‘Superheroes’ voted for by 1,300 members of the public. The day began with a march through the streets of Liverpool City Centre attended by more than 6000 people, and continued with stages and entertainment at the Pier Head and Gay Quarter. Overall audience figures for the festival reached a record 75,000.

However, between 1990-1992 various 'unofficial' community Pride festivals were held in the city thanks to an organised effort between the Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Action group, various arts bodies and local gay clubs. 'Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride' as it was known then, was not in any way connected nor indeed related to the contemporary Pride festival, the main differences being that Liverpool Pride is now officially sponsored by public authorities, has a legal structure and framework, is a weekend event as opposed to week-long, and does not include references to 'Lesbian' and 'Gay' in its title through fear of alienating transgender people. Moreover, Pride in the early 90s tended to concentrate more on arts, exhibitions, culture, talks, workshops and function evenings, in contrast to the party on the scene/popstar on stage format as seen today. The events also had a strong political element and aimed to explore and challenge society's attitudes towards sexuality at that time. To put it into perspective, gay men still faced an unequal age of consent, the infamous Section 28 was still in existence, there would be no partnership or adoption rights for same sex couples for at least another decade whilst OutRage!, a UK based LGBT activist group, was just being formed. Highlights of the festivals included discussions on women in the church, LGBT parenting and literature, support for gay and lesbian victims of sexual abuse and health awareness workshops. T-shirts and badges bearing the Pride logos were sold in local gay venues and at events themselves to help cover running costs (see brochure of events below). The celebration took a brief break but returned in 1995 under the new name 'Mersey Pride', an attempt to create a more outdoor cabaret and stage type atmosphere around Pownall Square, chosen for its close proximity to The Brunswick and Time Out, two popular gay frequented pubs of the day. The occasion was modestly successful as a political statement and was attended by some 1200 revellers from across North West England, albeit attracting noticeable protests from the Christian right.http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/europe/uk/scotland/pulse/37-09.95 In many ways, Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride of the early 90s paved the way for Homotopia, the city's modern day gay arts festival launched some 12 years later, in the sense that Homotopia took on a similar formula. The Mersey Pride of 1995, however, bore a stronger resemblance to the present day festivities at the Pier Head and Gay Quarter in spite of being significantly smaller and much less mainstream.

The Liverpool event can legitimately claim to be one of the earliest known Prides to ever take place in the United Kingdom, the oldest being a march of 700 people through central London in 1972. ==References *Liverpool Pride (Official Site) Category:Pride parades in England Category:LGBT culture in Liverpool Category:Festivals in Liverpool Category:LGBT organisations in England Category:Summer events in England ","title":"Liverpool Pride"},{"id":"35920475","text":"Gaoguan may refer to the following locations in China: * Gaoguan, Guangdong (高莞镇), town in Lianping County * Gaoguan, Liaoning (高官镇), town in Benxi Manchu Autonomous County * Gaoguan, Chongqing (高观镇), town in Chengkou County ","title":"Gaoguan"},{"id":"35920512","text":"View southwest - view of fault from Toroweap Overlook, below Toroweap Point, west Grand Canyon, overlooking Colorado River. (with small volcano on South Rim) The Toroweap Fault of northwest Arizona and southwest Utah is part of a fault system of the west Grand Canyon region, Arizona, USA; also the west perimeter regions of the Coconino and Colorado Plateaus. The Hurricane Fault originates at the Toroweap Fault, in the region of the Colorado River, and strikes as the westerly depression of the Toroweap Fault. The Toroweap strikes northerly from the Colorado at the east of Toroweap Valley, and enters south Utah; from the Colorado River, the Hurricane Fault strikes north-northwest along the west flank of the small, regional Uinkaret Mountains, the west border of Toroweap Valley. The Hurricane Fault, and the Hurricane Cliffs strike into southwest Utah as part of the west, and southwest perimeter of the Colorado Plateau. The Hurricane Cliffs are made of Kaibab Limestone, an erosion resistant, cliff-forming rock unit. The Uinkaret volcanic field is a resultant of the two-fault system, at the intersection region. Two example landforms, Vulcan's Throne, and Lava Falls both occur west of Toroweap Point, North Rim Grand Canyon, along the faults. A small volcano even occurs above the fault on the South Rim. The 2-fault system is part of the west perimeter regions of the west, and southwest Colorado Plateau, called the High Plateaus Section. ==Grand Canyon, start of The Esplanade, & Aubrey Cliffs== In the Grand Canyon, the Toroweap-Hurricane Fault causes a change of surface rock expression in the canyon's west, on the South Rim. The Esplanade Sandstone an erosion resistant member of the Supai Group creates a platform called The Esplanade. The landform is upstream on the Colorado River, South Rim, across from Toroweap Point, and the Toroweap Fault and Aubrey Cliffs are The Esplanade's west perimeter. The Aubrey Cliffs are the west edge of the Coconino Plateau. They extend from the Colorado River south to Prospect Valley, its east perimeter, jump through a mountainous stretch to the north of Aubrey Valley, the cliffs forming its east and southeast border, with the south terminus, Chino Point, just west of Seligman, Arizona, at Interstate 40. The south terminus of Aubrey Cliffs is also near the beginnings of Chino Valley (Arizona), part of the beginnings of the Verde River watershed. The Big Chino Wash of Chino Valley starts a south trend, but immediately turns southeast towards central Arizona. The Aubrey Cliffs are composed of the Permian rocks on top,Chronic, Roadside Geology of Arizona, Chapter: Interstate 40 -- Siligman, pp. 194-197, p. 197. Kaibab Limestone, Toroweap Formation and Coconino Sandstone; also the Hermit Formation and Supai Group; at lower elevations (the Esplanade Sandstone member of The Esplanade, Grand Canyon). In the south at Aubrey Valley, the Coconino Sandstone is reduced to a thin member, compared to the up to 300 ft cliff maxima at Grand Canyon locales.Chronic, Roadside Geology of Arizona, p. 197. In Aubrey Valley at the southern region of the Aubrey Cliffs, the Cliffs are also eroded back along the Coconino Plateau; the Toroweap Fault is buried under gravels, towards the valley center, west of the north-trending cliffs.Chronic, Roadside Geology of Arizona, p. 197. ==Toroweap Fault - Aubrey Valley, a corner of Colorado Plateau== Aubrey Valley is endorheic.Benchmark Maps. Arizona Road & Recreation Atlas, Benchmark Maps, pp. 32-33. The valley is attached to the Seventyfour Plains, southwest, a water divide between the Verde River watershed (Big Chino Wash), east, southeast, and west, tributaries to the Bill Williams River into the Colorado River. Four small surrounding mountain ranges border Seventyfour Plains-Aubrey Valley. The northwest mountains to Aubrey Valley (Blue Mountain) connect to the mountains surrounding Prospect Valley, with Prospect Valley's east border, the Aubrey Cliffs. Prospect Valley is very narrow; the south half is endorheic; the north drains directly into the Colorado River, just west of the Toroweap Overlook. The next regions southeast that form the southwest border of the Colorado Plateau, are Sycamore Canyon-(Sycamore Canyon Wilderness), and adjacent east, Oak Creek Canyon. The diagonally expressed, northwest-by-southeast regional Arizona transition zone mountain ranges (about 30 across Arizona's 350 miles) are adjacent southwest to Sycamore and Oak Creek Canyons. The three mountain ranges that are at the northwest terminus of the transition zone, and the south perimeter region of the Sevetyfour Plains- Aubrey Valley, are the Aquarius Mountains-(with Aquarius Cliffs), Mohon Mountains, and (due-south of Seligman), the Juniper Mountains.

It affects both sexes, manifesting itself in males as marked or complete phenotypical feminization (with the exception of the genitalia; i.e., no pseudohermaphroditism) and in females as hyperfeminization. To date, 30 males and 8 females with AEXS among 15 and 7 families, respectively, have been described in the medical literature. ==Signs and symptoms== Observed physiological abnormalities of the condition include a dramatic overexpression of aromatase and, accordingly, excessive levels of estrogens including estrone and estradiol and a very high rate of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. In one study, cellular aromatase mRNA expression was found to be at least 10 times higher in a female patient compared to the control, and the estradiol/testosterone ratio after an injection of testosterone in a male patient was found to be 100 times greater than the control. Additionally, in another study, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were found to be either low or normal in males, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were very low (likely due to suppression by estrogen, which has antigonadotropic effects as a form of negative feedback inhibition on sex steroid production in sufficiently high amounts), whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were normal. According to a recent review, estrone levels have been elevated in 17 of 18 patients (94%), while estradiol levels have been elevated only in 13 of 27 patients (48%). As such, estrone is the main estrogen elevated in the condition. In more than half of patients, circulating androstenedione and testosterone levels are low to subnormal. The ratio of circulating estradiol to testosterone is >10 in 75% of cases. FSH levels are said to be consistently low in the condition, while LH levels are in the low to normal range. It is notable that gynecomastia has been observed in patients in whom estradiol levels are within the normal range. This has been suggested to be due to in situ conversion of adrenal androgens into estrone and then estradiol (via local 17β-HSD) in breast tissue (where aromatase activity may be particularly high). The symptoms of AEXS, in males, include heterosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-inappropriate secondary sexual characteristics; i.e., a fully or mostly feminized appearance), severe prepubertal or peripubertal gynecomastia (development of breasts in males before or around puberty), high-pitched voice, sparse facial hair, hypogonadism (dysfunctional gonads), oligozoospermia (low sperm count), small testes, micropenis (an unusually small penis), advanced bone maturation, an earlier peak height velocity (an accelerated rate of growth in regards to height), and short final stature due to early epiphyseal closure. The incidence of gynecomastia appears to be 100%, with 20 of 30 male cases opting for mastectomy according to a review. In females, symptoms of AEXS include isosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-appropriate secondary sexual characteristics), macromastia (excessively large breasts), an enlarged uterus, menstrual irregularities, and, similarly to males, accelerated bone maturation and short final height. Of seven females described in one report, three (43%) had macromastia. Pubertal breast hypertrophy in association with AEXS has been described in two young girls. Fertility, though usually affected to one degree or another—especially in males—is not always impaired significantly enough to prevent sexual reproduction, as evidenced by vertical transmission of the condition by both sexes. ==Cause== The root cause of AEXS is not entirely clear, but it has been elucidated that inheritable, autosomal dominant genetic mutations affecting CYP19A1, the gene which encodes aromatase, are involved in its etiology. Different mutations are associated with differential severity of symptoms, such as mild to severe gynecomastia. For example, duplications result in relatively mild gynecomastia, while deletions, resulting in chimeric genes, cause moderate or severe gynecomastia. ==DiagnosisTreatment== Several treatments have been found to be effective in managing AEXS, including aromatase inhibitors and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in both sexes, androgen replacement therapy with non- aromatizable androgens such as DHT in males, and progestogens (which, by virtue of their antigonadotropic properties at high doses, suppress estrogen levels) in females. In addition, male patients often seek bilateral mastectomy, whereas females may opt for breast reduction if warranted. Medical treatment of AEXS is not absolutely necessary, but it is recommended as the condition, if left untreated, may lead to excessively large breasts (which may necessitate surgical reduction), problems with fertility, and an increased risk of endometriosis and estrogen-dependent cancers such as breast and endometrial cancers later in life. At least one case of male breast cancer has been reported. ==Society and culture== Names AEXS has also been referred to as familial hyperestrogenism, familial gynecomastia, and familial adrenal feminization. Notable cases It has been hypothesized that the Pharaoh Akhenaten (husband of Queen Nefertiti) and other members of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt may have suffered from AEXS. Akhenaten and his relatives, including men and young girls, many of whom were the product of inbreeding, are described as having breasts and wide hips, and Akhenaten was described as having a \\"beautiful and feminine voice,\\" unusual physical features that could be explained by AEXS or another form of hereditary hyperestrogenism. However, numerous other physical abnormalities were also present in the Akhenaten family, and a variety of other conditions have been proposed to explain the observations instead. Most recently, Loeys–Dietz syndrome was proposed as a probable cause, with gynecomastia and feminization possibly being caused by liver cirrhosis-induced hyperestrogenism. ==See also== * Androgen insensitivity syndrome * Aromatase deficiency * Congenital estrogen deficiency * Disorders of sex development * Estrogen insensitivity syndrome * Hyperestrogenism * Inborn errors of steroid metabolism ==References External links == Category:Autosomal dominant disorders Category:Cholesterol and steroid metabolism disorders Category:Endocrine gonad disorders Category:Estrogens Category:Rare syndromes Category:Genetic syndromes Category:Syndromes affecting the endocrine system Category:Intersex variations ","title":"Aromatase excess syndrome"},{"id":"35920543","text":"Olena Olehivna Fedorova (; born 14 November 1986) is a Ukrainian diver from Mykolaiv. ==Career== She has competed at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.

The 5'7\\" middleweight fought out of New York City from 1922 to 1929, racking up a career record of 53 wins against 23 losses and two draws from 1922 to 1929. Estridge fought colored middleweight champion Panama Joe Gans for his title on July 26, 1924 at Yankee Stadium, defeating the champ via a unanimous decision in their 10-round bout. After scoring two victories over heavyweight Frank Yarchan, Estridge had a rematch with Gans for the colored title. On 11 August 1924 in Queensboro Stadium in Queens, New York, Estridge defeated Gans on points. It was his last defense of the title, which went into abeyance as African American Tiger Flowers won the world middleweight crown the following year. Estridge never earned a shot at the world title. His status as a contender began to decline after he lost to future light- heavyweight champion Paul Berlenbach on 26 December 1924. Larry Estridge, who weight 155¾ lbs. to Berlenbach's 163¾ lbs., lost via a T.K.O. in the second round. His record was 38–2–1 at the time. Estridge won his next three fights but lost to Frankie Schoell on 13 March 1925, when they appeared as part of the undercard at Madison Square Garden that was topped by a fight between Berlenbach and former world light-heavyweight champion Battling Siki. Estridge again won three fights before to losing to Sergeant Sammy Baker on 1 June 1925. He then racked up a record of six victories, three losses and a draw in his next 10 fights before he met Baker again on 7 May 1926.

In his last loss of the streak, and the penultimate fight of his career, his former nemesis Paul Berlenbach K.O.-ed him in the eighth round of their fight on 22 May 1928. His last fight was against lightly regarded Mickey Taylor on 21 February 1929, whom he scored a T.K.O. against in the fifth round. ==References== Category:1902 births Category:Middleweight boxers Category:World colored middleweight boxing champions Category:Year of death missing Category:British male boxers ","title":"Larry Estridge"},{"id":"35920684","text":"Kelvin Teo () is a management consultant whose first success was a million dollar business venture at the age of 20 while still in university.http://www.nus.edu.sg/nec/_files/news/afterSaSFinal020603.pdf At age 27, he won Malaysia's first wedding related reality show, Love Me Do.http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2009/5/8/central/3830278&sec;=central He also co-founded EasyEco International and was a frequent columnist of several local newspapers.http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/news/11448 ==Early years== Education Born in Labuan and raised in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah, Kelvin Teo did his high school at Kian Kok Middle School and undergraduate at National University of Singapore with a degree in Electrical Engineering.

Born Cyril Quinton Jr. on November 14, 1896 in Barbados, British West Indies and raised in the Panama Canal Zone, the 5'7\\" Quinton originally fought out of Panama and then New York City. He took his ringname from boxing great Joe Gans, the first black American fighter to win a world boxing title. He found his greatest fame fighting as a middleweight at between 147 and 160 lbs, but in his early career he took the Panamanian Lightweight Title and contended for the Panamanian Welterweight Title at weights roughly between 130 and 147 pounds. ==Early life== Panama Joe Gans was born Cyril Quinton Jr. on November 4, 1896 on the small tropical Island of Barbados. His family moved to Colon, Panama while he was still a child. After his father died when he was very young, he was detained by local authorities for stealing fish and spent the next five years in a detention center. At the center, he learned the basic aspects of boxing by partaking in bouts organized by his classmates. Under the guidance of H.R. Cambridge, a local Panamanian business manager, and real estate developer, Quinton adopted his ring name, and became a successful boxer in the Canal Zone where he fought his first thirty fights with considerable success. ==Taking the Panamanian Light and Middleweight Championships== On October 10, 1915, Panama Joe first won the Lightweight Championship of Panama at only eighteen against Young Sam Langford at the Pacific Theatre in Panama City in a twenty- round points decision. He later took the Middleweight Championship of Panama by knocking out Benny McGovern in the third of fifteen rounds on November 30, 1916 at the Santa Ana Plaza in Panama City. At the time, these titles were often described as extending to both Central and South America. In his first bout after taking the Middleweight Championship of Panama on December 12, 1916, though barely twenty-one years old, he soundly defeated Abraham Jacob Hollandersky, a former holder of the Panamanian Heavyweight Championship in 20 rounds in Panama City. Moving to New York in 1917 In 1917, Panama Joe was brought to New York by the talented boxing manager Leo P. Flynn, and settled in Harlem. Some of his important early victories were against the Jamaica Kid, Cleve Hawkins and Battling Thomas. =Wins that brought attention to Gans, 1919–20= Gans had an important early career win against Jeff Smith on July 8, 1919, in an eight-round newspaper decision of the Philadelphia Inquirer at Atlantic City. On October 23, 1919, he made a very strong showing against well known boxer Bert Kenney in an eight-round newspaper decision in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Kenney had been an opponent of Jack Dempsey in 1916. On May 24, 1920, Gans made a splash in the boxing world by knocking out Young Fisher in the fifth round at Rochester, New York. On June 15 of that year, Gans would defeat Fisher again in a ten-round newspaper decision. Rather than acting as a lever to gain access to more lucrative opponents, several boxing historians wrote than these wins, and Gans' exceptional record may have made it more difficult for him to sign for a bout with a white Middleweight championship contender. =Serving as a sparring partner for Jack Dempsey, 1920= Gans worked as a sparring partner for Jack Dempsey prior to his a bout with future Hall of Fame boxer Billy Miske in early September 1920. The speed and skill he demonstrated in his fast sparring matches with Dempsey won him attention with the press, and the boxing public. The publicity he gained helped him secure a shot at the Colored World Middleweight Championship. ==World Colored Middleweight Title, October 1920== George Robinson Panama Joe won the World Colored Middleweight Championship from Bostonian George Robinson in Madison Square Garden on October 8, 1920 in a twelve-round points decision. Panama Joe weighed 151 and Robinson weighed 150, in the light middleweight range. It was the first time two black boxers were featured on a fight card at the Garden, though typical of the era, the coverage of the fight was brief in those few newspapers that covered it. The fighting was described as fierce and drawing blood by one source.\\"Danny Frush Victorious in Bout With O'Leary\\", The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 8, 9 October 1920The fighting was bloody in \\"Boxing\\", San Antonio Evening News\\", San Antonio, Texas, pg. 5, 9 October 1920 World Colored Middleweight defense, December 1920 On December 19, 1920, Panama Joe defeated Sailor Darden in a ten-round points decision for the Colored World Middleweight Championship title at New York's Madison Square Garden. Darden was a sailor who had been released by the Navy from his service on the USS Charleston. One key to Gans' victory may have been the ten pound weight advantage he had at 149 1/2 pounds, as Darden put up an exceptionally strong fight.\\"Ray Moore Knocks Out Sharkey in the Eleventh\\", The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 8, 30 December 1929 After the fight, manager Tex Rickard presented Panama Joe with a diamond studded belt signifying his possession of the Colored Middleweight Title. Gans had some trouble in the first, but had a stronger showing in the subsequent nine rounds. Though the bout was technically a world championship, the crowd was described as small. Darden made many of his points with blows to the body of Gans.The crowd was small in \\"Panama Gans Whips Darden\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 20, 30 December 1920 In a twelve-round newspaper decision by the Pittsburgh Post on December 6, 1921, Gans defeated Allentown Joe Gans at McGuigan Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. Contracting pneumonia, 1921 In January 1921, Panama Joe contracted pneumonia, affecting his long term career ambitions. In 1920 he had won all of his fights, showing his mastery of the boxing world, and his potential as a true World Middleweight Champion. In September and October 1921, Panama Joe would lose to Sailor Darden in New York in fifteen round points decisions. In a non-title fight on November 28, 1921, Gans impressively defeated Joe Borell at the arena in Trenton, New Jersey in a ninth-round technical knockout. Borrell had been a powerful puncher in his earlier days, with twenty-four career knockouts. In his career he faced future Heavyweight champion Gene Tunney, Middleweight champions Harry Greb, and Al McCoy, and former World Welterweight Champion Harry Lewis. Knockout win over Jack Blackburn, July 1922 Panama Joe defeated black Kentuckian boxer Jack Blackburn at Tomlinson Hall On July 24, 1922 in Indianapolis, Indiana in a fourth-round knockout. Gans had come from the West Coast where he won two four round bouts in Oakland against Frank Barrieau and Frankie Denny.\\"Gans Goes East, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 8, 16 July 1922 Blackburn was fighting one of the last matches of his career and was 40 at the time of the bout, ancient for a highly rated boxer, even in 1922. He had a three-inch advantage in reach and height, but it did not compensate for his age and declining stamina. Blackburn had fought many of the greatest boxers of his era, including Sam Langford, Kid Norfolk, and champions Joe Gans, Harry Greb, Harry Lewis, and Mike Twin Sullivan. On February 17, 1923, Panama Joe defeated Jimmy O'Gatty in a fifth-round knockout at the Commonwealth Sporting Club in New York City. Defenses of the Colored World Middleweight Championship Gans defended the Colored Middleweight Title three times in 1923. He won a ten-round newspaper decision against Whitey Black on May 14 in Detroit. Meeting Black again on October 22, 1923, he knocked him out in Rochester, New York in the eighth of a scheduled non-title ten round bout, but the fight was investigated as neither man appeared to have landed a telling blow in the bout, and Black had been warned against not putting up a serious fight.\\"Panama Joe Gans Stops Whitey Black\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 24, 23 October 1923 =Bouts with future World Champion Tiger Flowers, 1921–23= Panama Joe fought Tiger Flowers in Toledo, Ohio, on May 25, 1923, in a twelve-round, no-decision bout, in which the Toledo News Bee reported that Flowers seemed to have had an edge in every round, but Gans' World Middleweight Title was not at stake as Ohio did not allow decisions. Flowers had a three-inch reach advantage over Gans, and may have fought with a weight advantage in the bout as well. Even though Gans had beaten Flowers twice previously, Gans' manager, Leo Flynn refused to have Panama Joe meet Flowers for a fourth time, though the purse offered was very large. The Atlanta Constitution noted that Flowers had \\"badly beaten\\" Panama Joe in their May bout.Flowers beat Panama Joe badly, but Panama Joe would not meet Flowers again in \\"J. Gans Won't Meet Tiger\\", Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, pg. 8, 14 June 1923 ==Win over future World Champion Tiger Flowers, 1921== Impressively, on August 8, 1921, Panama Joe knocked out Flowers in the sixth round at the Auditorium in Atlanta, Georgia. Famed sportswriter Damon Runyon noted prior to the fight that Panama Joe had a better claim to the Middleweight Title than two of the primary white contenders, Bostonian Italian Johnny Wilson, who first took the title in 1920, and Bryan Downey, who contended for the title once in July 1921 against Wilson.\\"Real Opportunity Knocks for Flowers\\", The Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, pg. 9, 4 August 1921 On December 15, 1921, Gans had decisively beaten Flowers in a fifth-round knockout at the Auditorium in Atlanta, Georgia. These were impressive wins as Flowers would become the first African American to hold the World Middleweight Championship in 1926.Edgren, \\"Flowers May Last for Sometime\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 34, 14 March 1926 At 149 1/2 pounds, on November 18, 1922, Gans defeated Jewish New York boxer Marty Cross before a large crowd in twelve rounds at the Commonwealth Sports Club in the Bronx in a twelve-round points decision. Cross had a three-inch reach advantage over Gans. He was a brother of the great lightweight boxer Leach Cross.The crowd was large in Pollock, John, \\"Fistic News and Gossip\\", The Evening World, New York, New York, pg. 25, 21 November 1922 Gans was the winner on points in every round, but in the ninth he was nearly knocked out by a single punch to the midsection. Gans recovered from the blow and came back strongly in the following round, continuing to press his advantage and bringing Cross close to a knockout. Gans had promised to forfeit his Middleweight Championship bout if he lost the fight.\\"Panama Joe Gans Retained Middleweight Champ's Belt\\", New York Age, New York, New York, pg. 6, 25 November 1922 On May 30, 1923, Panama Joe defeated well known competitor Willie Walker in New York in a ninth-round knockout. =Win over Italian Joe Gans, 1923= On September 15, 1923, Panama Joe Gans defeated quality competitor Italian Joe Gans before a crowd that packed the Commonwealth Sporting Club in New York in an important twelve round points decision. Panama Joe was the aggressor and appeared to outpoint Italian Joe in each of the fast rounds. In the late rounds, Italian Joe swung wide of his mark and could not penetrate the defense of Panama Joe.\\"Panama Joe Gans Beats Italian Joe in Fifteen Rounds\\", The New York Age, New York, New York, pg. 6, 22 September 1923 Panama Joe had previously lost to Gans on February 6, 1923 in a twelve-round points decision at New York's Pioneer Sporting Club. Contracting pneumonia again, December 1923 Around late December 1923, after a loss to Morrie Sclaiffer in Omaha, Nebraska, Panama Joe disastrously contracted pneumonia for a second time. Doctors strongly discouraged him from continuing his boxing, and he was bed-ridden for two months. Gans took only a four-month period of recuperation before resuming a career as a competitor, though he would never again compete on the world stage. His loss of the Colored title to Larry Estridge only six months later was likely a result of the endurance he had lost to his illness. Win over Andy \\"Kid\\" Palmer Gans defeated Andy \\"Kid\\" Palmer in their first meeting on January 6, 1923 in a twelve-round points decision at New York's Commonwealth Sporting Club. They had met earlier on October 27, 1922, in the feature bout at Brooklyn's Rink Sporting Club. Gans had been uncharacteristically disqualified for a low blow in the sixth round, after having been warned twice previously for hitting low. Gans had started well in the first few rounds, but subsequently took a beating from the short jabs of Palmer.\\"Panama Joe Gans Loses to Palmer in Sixth on Foul\\", New York Age, New York, New York, pg. 8, 28 October 1922 Losing the Colored World Middleweight Championship, June 1924 Only six months after his second battle with pneumonia, Panama Joe lost his title to Larry Estridge in a decisive ten round unanimous decision at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx on June 26, 1924. Panama Joe was floored three times in the bout, and was cut by the swinging jabs of his southpaw challenger. Gans was down by the second round, and may have been woozy in the remaining eight, where he gamely took a serious battering, but fought on. Estridge was twenty-two to Panama Joe's twenty-eight years and had a six-pound weight advantage which may have played a factor in the bout.\\"Harry Greb Defends Title Successfully\\", Courier-Journal, Louisville, Kentucky, pg. 9, 27 June 1924 Estridge successfully defended the title in a rematch with Gans at Queensboro Stadium in Long Island City, Queens, New York on August 11, 1924 before a crowd of 16,000. Panama Joe once again took a battering in the match.\\"Madden Near Knockout Survives\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 21, 12 August 1924 It was Estridge's sole title defense. The title went into abeyance after Tiger Flowers became the first black boxer to win the world middleweight championship when he defeated Harry Greb in 1926. According to BoxRec, Panama Joe's last recorded fight was at Balboa Stadium in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico against Francisco Soler on June 10, 1928. Panama Joe lost the ten round bout. Panama Joe's professional boxing career extended for a period of roughly fifteen years. Little has been published about his later life or his death. ==AchievementsReferencesProfessional Boxing Record for Panama Joe Gans, Cyber Boxing Zone Category:1896 births Category:Middleweight boxers Category:World colored middleweight boxing champions Category:Barbadian male boxers Category:Year of death missing Category:British male boxers ","title":"Panama Joe Gans"},{"id":"35920721","text":"Ellen Kangru Pao (born 1970) is an American investor and former CEO of social media company Reddit. Pao first became known in 2012 for filing an unsuccessful gender discrimination suit against her employer, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, and has continued to express vocal criticism of the hiring and promotion practices in Silicon Valley. In 2014, she became interim CEO of Reddit. During this period, the site banned revenge porn, with other social media sites following suit. In 2015, decisions made by the company during her tenure, such as the banning of controversial Reddit communities for harassment, generated a wave of controversy that culminated in her stepping down. The backlash she received sparked debates both on the treatment of women in technology and the need for transparency in a company that relies on volunteers. Since 2016, she has been the co-founder and CEO of the non-profit diversity consulting organization Project Include. ==Early life and education== Ellen Pao was born in 1970 in New Jersey. She is the middle child of three daughters born to Tsyh-Wen Pao and Young-Ping Pao, immigrants from Taiwan. Her father, Young-Ping Pao, was a professor at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Her mother, Tsyh-Wen Pao (née Lee) worked as an engineer in computer sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. Ellen Pao is fluent in English and Mandarin and first learned to code from her mother at age ten. The Pao family raised their children in Maplewood, New Jersey. Young-Ping Pao died in 1987 when Ellen was in the 12th grade of high school. Pao's maternal grandparents are Yu-Wen Lee and Ching-Hsin (née Liu) Lee, who were from Baoding in the Hebei province near Beijing. Pao's maternal grandfather was a graduate of the Republic of China Military Academy, He later went on to serve as a commander in the Chinese Civil War under Chiang Kai-shek and, in 1948, moved the family to Taiwan, where he retired with the rank of Colonel in 1960. In October 1972, his wife and daughter Elizabeth moved to the New York City area to join Pao's mother and aunt and uncle who were already studying in the US. Yu-Wen Lee was the fourth child of his father, merchant Lien-Ren Lee, Pao's great grandfather. Pao graduated with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1991 after completing an 143-page-long senior thesis titled \\"Computer Databases and Business: An Analysis of Informational Privacy.\\" Immediately after, she attended Harvard Law School, where she earned a Juris Doctor in 1994. After two years of working, Pao returned to attend Harvard Business School, where she received an MBA in 1998. ==Career== From 1994 to 1996, Pao worked as a corporate attorney at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. In 1998, Pao worked at WebTV. Pao worked at several companies in Silicon Valley including BEA Systems as Senior Director of Corporate Business Development from 2001 until 2005. In 2005, Pao joined Kleiner Perkins, an established venture capital firm in San Francisco, as technical chief of staff for John Doerr, a senior partner, a job that required degrees in engineering, law, and business and experience in enterprise software. In 2007 she was appointed a Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute on the recommendation of Doerr, a trustee. Also in 2007, she became a junior investing partner with Ted Schlein as her boss.2nd and 3rd entries (at bottom)\\"Liveblog: Day Two of Ellen Pao on the Stand\\" Re/code. March 10, 2015. While at Kleiner Perkins, Pao led the company's expansion into China. After several years with Schlein's team, Pao was passed over for a senior partner position. According to Pao, she had the job title of junior partner from her date of hiring7th allegation, page 4 Complaint of Pao and was promised an opportunity to move into an investing role.\\"Ellen Pao: ‘I Wanted to Make Sure My Story Was Told’\\" March 10, 2015 Re/code accessed March 12, 2015 Doerr, who has expressed awareness of what he considers a gender gap at venture capital firms, mentored Pao, liberally providing feedback, but, in the end, agreed with the other senior partners who had made negative evaluations of her work at the firm. It was Pao's contention, in her suit for gender discrimination, that men with similar profiles were, nevertheless, promoted. On May 10, 2012, Pao filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against her employer. The lawsuit alleged workplace retaliation by a male junior partner, resulting from his and Pao's romantic affair. She continued to work at the firm until October 1. Pao claimed that she was terminated abruptlyComplaint of Ellen Pao while Kleiner Perkins claimed that she was given a month to accept a paid five-month transition to an operating role.\\"Liveblog: Day Four of Ellen Pao on the Stand\\" March 12, 2015 Re/code accessed March 12, 2015Section D page 6 Trial brief Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Pao's lawyer said she was fired in retaliation for her lawsuit and amended the complaint to add that cause of action. The firm said Pao was terminated for performance reasons unrelated to the lawsuit. On March 27, 2015, the jury decided the case in favor of the defendant on all counts. Pao joined Reddit in 2013 as the head of business development and strategic partnerships. One of her first investments made in this capacity strengthened the ties between Reddit and its de facto image host Imgur. She stated that a goal for the following year was making it easier for people to become Redditors. Pao became interim CEO in November 2014 after Yishan Wong resigned. Following efforts by Wong to scale back salary negotiation, Pao decided to give two final offers (one with more cash, one with more equity) to all prospective employees. As motivation for the change, she cited findings that women were more likely to be penalized for attempting to negotiate pay. After seeing that Reddit's previous offers were not correlated with gender, Pao stated that the new policy was still the fairest, as well as a stepping stone to having publicly posted salaries. One of the largest changes to the website made under Pao was the banning of revenge porn in March 2015. Other social networks, that removed such images in the following months, have been widely referred to as following Reddit's model. In June and July 2015, Pao was the subject of criticism and harassment by Reddit users after five Reddit communities (subreddits) were banned for harassment and Reddit's director of talent was fired. A Change.org petition requesting her removal reached 200,000 signatures and on July 10, it was announced that Pao had resigned from Reddit \\"by mutual agreement\\". Pao subsequently founded the non-profit organization Project Include with Erica Baker, Tracy Chou, Freada Kapor Klein and four other women in the technology industry. Aimed at startups with 25 to 1,000 employees, the group develops human resources advice in a series of meetings with clients and publishes anonymized progress reports under a Creative Commons license. Reports on the aftermath of Pao v. Kleiner Perkins included speculation that Pao had agreed not to write a book detailing her experiences at the company. In November 2015, Pao revealed that this was not the case and later confirmed that she was writing a memoir. In a May 2016 interview, Pao stated that she planned to finish the book before seeking a full-time job. One month later, the book was acquired by Spiegel and Grau and given the title Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change. The book has been shortlisted for the 2017 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award. In 2017, she became a partner at Kapor Capital and the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact before leaving in 2018 to focus on her role as Project Include's CEO. ==Gender discrimination lawsuit== On May 10, 2012, Pao filed a gender discrimination suit against Kleiner Perkins which went to trial in late February 2015. It was covered by the national media and elicited broad comment regarding the issues raised. The case was live blogged and tweeted constantly, to the point of providing both humorous and serious feedback to lawyers and witnesses. The trial, lasting 24 days, resulted in a favorable verdict for Kleiner Perkins. While the trial was taking place, a gender discrimination suit was filed against Twitter by Tina Huang and a suit alleging sexual and racial discrimination was filed against Facebook by Chia Hong. Law professor Joan Williams commented that it would have been \\"quite a coincidence\\" if these actions were not influenced by Ellen Pao. More broadly, employment lawyers described an increase in the number of women coming forward with claims of gender inequality and the term Pao effect was coined to describe the resulting increase in lawsuits. Though many reporters commented positively on the changing culture, some expressed a foreboding that companies would be less likely to hire women during a period of abundant legal action. Discussion of the trial's influence continued after the conclusion of Pao v. Kleiner Perkins when a discrimination claim was made by Microsoft researcher Katie Moussouris. Following the trial, Kleiner Perkins sought $972,814 in legal costs and offered to withdraw the fee if Pao declined to appeal the verdict. On June 1, 2015, Pao filed to appeal, one week before the deadline. On June 5, Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao wanted $2.7 million to not appeal, an amount which they called \\"improper and excessive\\". The judge ruled on June 18 that Pao would only be responsible for $275,966 citing the economic resources of both parties under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Pao filed an objection to this with the argument that an award against the plaintiff could result in a chilling effect on future discrimination cases. On September 10, 2015, Pao wrote a guest post for Re/code in which she urged companies to be more open about bias accusations made by their employees. The post stated that she was deciding not to appeal but still paying $276,000 due to an additional stipulation by Kleiner Perkins that the fee could only be waived after signing a non-disparagement agreement. However, one week later when Pao formally dropped her appeal, Kleiner Perkins filed to close the case without payment per its original announcement. ==Exit from Reddit== On June 10, 2015, a post on Reddit, signed by Pao and two other executives, announced that five subreddits were being banned for fostering off-site harassment. One such community, r/FatPeopleHate, had over 150,000 subscribers. Multiple change.org petitions calling for Pao's resignation were created by displeased Reddit users and the most popular one reached 10,000 signatures in the days following the change. Some users began posting hateful comments and images about Pao on Reddit and other websites. Other complaints about the site focused on inadequate moderation tools and the fact that some posts critical of Ellen Pao's lawsuit had been deleted by moderators. Opposition increased on July 2 when large sections of Reddit were set to private to protest the dismissal of Victoria Taylor, Reddit's director of talent, known for co-ordinating the Ask Me Anything interviews. Expressing frustration over the decline in communication from Reddit management, AMA moderators stated that they had only learned about the firing indirectly after it happened. Despite one post to the contrary, Taylor's dismissal was widely attributed to Pao, with some commentators suggesting that the move diminished her credibility as an advocate for female employees. She received increased harassment as a result and the petition for her removal surpassed 200,000 signatures. On July 3, Pao issued apologies through Reddit and Time magazine. However, the Reddit post was thought to have been deleted after it received enough downvotes to lose visibility. In a longer post on July 6, she apologized for poor communication between staff members and for not delivering on promises. Pao resigned on July 10 and was replaced by Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman. Pao speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019 at Moscone Convention Center on October 04, 2019. On July 12, former CEO Yishan Wong who had previously defended the five bans on Quora began a series of posts which he referred to as \\"declassifying a lot of things\\". The first drew attention to the fact that Victoria Taylor was fired by Alexis Ohanian. When shown that the media was covering this post, Pao tweeted \\"thanks for not blaming me for it\\". In a later post, which recalled two instances of Pao arguing against purging hateful subreddits, Wong sharply criticized the movement against her and warned about stricter policies under the site's cofounders. Huffman followed this by enacting a policy to reduce the prominence of some xenophobic communities and ban some others. On July 13, Reddit's chief engineer Bethanye Blount left the company for unrelated reasons and opined that Pao did not receive enough support from the board. Specifically, she referenced the glass cliff phenomenon in which women are allegedly given disproportionately unstable leadership positions. On July 16, Ellen Pao wrote about the difficulty of combating harassment while preserving \\"edgy content\\". The editorial described what she called \\"one of the largest trolling attacks in history\\" and the subsequent outpouring of support. ==Personal life== Pao married Roger Kuo. They later divorced. She then married Buddy Fletcher. They met through Aspen Institute functions during the summer of 2007, after they were both appointed Crown Fellows. Pao and Fletcher have one daughter. Pao is a vegetarian. ==See also== * Women in computing * Women in venture capital ==ReferencesProject Include Category:American law firm executives Category:American women of Chinese descent Category:Businesspeople from New Jersey Category:Corporate lawyers Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Living people Category:New Jersey lawyers Category:People from Maplewood, New Jersey Category:Princeton University alumni Category:American technology chief executives Category:American women chief executives Category:American women lawyers Category:Women investors Category:Reddit people Category:American corporate directors Category:Women corporate directors Category:Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers people Category:BEA Systems people Category:Silicon Valley people Category:United States employment discrimination case law Category:American women engineers Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:American venture capitalists Category:Victims of cyberbullying Category:1970 births Category:Technology corporate directors Category:American people of Northern Han Chinese descent Category:Cravath, Swaine & Moore people Category:Henry Crown Fellows ","title":"Ellen Pao"},{"id":"35920759","text":"Prof. Geetam Tiwari is currently the TRIPP Chair Professor at the Department of Civil Engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India.

A foppone is thus a large hole, i.e., originally, a common burial, such as those established after the plague pandemics; the meaning was later generalized to that of \\"cemetery\\". See (in Italian). della Ca' Granda) is a late baroque building complex and former cemetery in Milan, Italy, built between 1695 and 1732 Giardino Rotonda della Besana and located close to the city center. The complex comprises a lobate hectagonal colonnade portico enclosing a garden and the deconsacrated church of San Michele ai Sepolcri (\\"Saint Michael by the Sepulchers\\"). La Rotonda della Besana, tempio della morte The portico was designed by architects Francesco Croce and Carlo Raffaello Raffagno, while the church was designed by Attilio Arrigoni. Although originally a cemetery, over time the Rotonda has been adapted for a number of other uses; today, it is a leisure area and a venue for cultural events. The complex covers an overall area of 7,100 m² and owes its current name to its location, at number 15 of Via Enrico Besana. ==History== The building was originally established to serve as a foppone (i.e., a cemetery for the poor) for the Ospedale Maggiore (also known as the Ca' Granda, \\"Big House\\"), and hosted about 150,000 burials, placed in a complex system of catacombs (the catacombs are no longer accessible). Rotonda della Besana In 1787, under Austrian rule, cemeteries were moved outside the city walls, and the Rotonda cemetery was thus dismissed. Under Napoleonic rule, plans were made to redesign the Rotonda into a famedio (i.e., a honorific burial place) along the lines of the Panthéon in Paris, but these plans were later dismissed. Rotonda di Via Besana The Rotonda was thus adapted for a number of other uses, including as a stable and a barn. In the 19th century it was returned to the Ospedale Maggiore, which used it as a cronicario (a shelter for the chronically sick) and a laundry building. The Ospedale eventually donated the structure to the Comune di Milano, in 1939. The Comune restored the complex and adapted it to serve as a green area and as a venue for cultural and social events. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Milan Category:Baroque architecture in Milan Category:Cemeteries in Milan Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1732 Category:Centralized-plan churches in Italy Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Tourist attractions in Milan ","title":"Rotonda della Besana"},{"id":"35920797","text":"Namak New Town refers to a planned city surrounding Buju-dong, Samhyang-dong of Mokpo, and Samhyang-eup, Illo-eup of Muan County.

For cultivation, preferably soft water as well as nutrient-rich and loose substrate is recommended. The best water temperature is . In the aquarium, the white-flowering form of A. abyssinicus forms a 15 cm wide and 10 cm tall rosette consisting of light green leaves, so that it may be considered for the foreground. The floating leaves, which only rarely form in aquariums, should be removed so that the later leaves will again remain short petiolate. An emersed or semi-aquatic keeping is possible under conditions of high humidity. Best cultivation results are achieved in shallow water. Propagation can occur only sexually through the very tiny seeds. Though they mostly germinate well, the rearing of the young plant is, in fact, extremely difficult and requires a lot of effort. == References == Abyssinicus Category:Plants described in 1850 Category:Flora of Eritrea Category:Flora of Ethiopia Category:Flora of Kenya Category:Flora of Malawi Category:Flora of Rwanda Category:Flora of Somalia Category:Flora of Tanzania Category:Flora of Uganda Category:Flora of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Freshwater plants ","title":"Aponogeton abyssinicus"},{"id":"35921239","text":"Huang Yunlong (born 10 July 1960) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1988 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Basketball players at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 1986 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Asian Games silver medalists for China Category:Medalists at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1986 Asian Games ","title":"Huang Yunlong"},{"id":"35921251","text":"Sha Guoli (born 30 August 1960) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Basketball players at the 1986 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Medalists at the 1986 Asian Games ","title":"Sha Guoli"},{"id":"35921262","text":"Sir Thomas Gargrave (died 1428), Knight, Master of the Ordnance and Marshall of the English army of Henry VI in France was killed during the Siege of Orléans along with the Earl of Salisbury.

During World War II, he was Chief Medical Officer of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp between January 1944 and February 1945. ==Biography== Kahr was born in the town of Fürstenfeld in southeastern Austria, which was then part of the Habsburg Empire. He studied medicine at the University of Graz and later worked as an assistant physician in a local hospital. During this time, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss of March 1938. Upon receiving his doctorate in 1940, Kahr enlisted in the Waffen-SS (SS # 382463) as a medical officer. After being seriously wounded on the Eastern Front, he was assigned to Prague, Czechoslovakia where he taught at a training school for combat paramedics. He later served as a staff physician at military hospitals in Brno, Graz, and Breslau. In November 1942, Kahr was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp where he served as director of its tuberculosis research station, before being named SS-Lagerarzt (Camp Doctor) at Mittelbau-Dora in January 1944. During his time at Dora, Kahr developed a good reputation among the camp’s inmates both for his competence and his efforts to improve conditions for the prisoners under his care. In February 1945, he was replaced at Dora by Eduard Wirths and was briefly reassigned to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia. Following the German surrender in May 1945 Kahr, spent several months in American military detention. Due to his reputable standing with many former prisoners of Mittelbau-Dora, he was not among those indicted for war crimes by US occupation authorities during the 1947 Dora Trial, and appeared as a key witness for the prosecution in that proceeding as well as at the Pohl Trial the following year. After his release from US custody, Kahr returned to Graz where he resumed the practice of medicine.Sellier, Andre. A History of the Dora Camp. Chicago: Ivan R.

It was written in Los Angeles and in a remote cabin in the mountains around the city. Recording took place in Liars’ private studio below U.S. Highway 101 in Los Angeles under the guidance of the band's label boss, Daniel Miller. Writing for The Quietus, Luke Turner described WIXIW as the band's \\"most accessible album to date\\" as well as their most electronic record ever. Reflecting on WIXIWs themes of longing and doubt, Angus Andrew said \\"You find that throughout the record, even within single songs, there's this duality of wanting to be close to someone but at the same time being afraid of that and thinking it's best that they leave.\\" The video for \\"Brats\\" by Ian Cheng was the second featured video on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim series Off the Air in the episode \\"Nature\\". ==Critical reception== WIXIW was well received by music critics, and garnered a score of 81 on the review site Metacritic, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" In a review for BBC Music, John Doran called the album an \\"unqualified success\\" and suggested Liars' newfound kinship with Aphex Twin and Radiohead circa 1999 established them in a field all their own, while Turner referred to the song Brats as a \\"juddering drunk punk masterpiece.\\" Journalist Emily Mackay of the NME likened the palindromatic album title to the band pursuing a new creative approach to reconnect with their multi-faceted essential nature. ==Accolades== { - !

Despite the title, it is not a sequel to the 2012 film Kalakalappu, but a spiritual successor. The film features Jiiva, Jai, Shiva, Nikki Galrani and Catherine Tresa in the lead roles. The film grossed 50.35 crores in worldwide box-office. Though talks were going on since 2012, the film began production in October 2017 and progressed in locations including Varanasi, Karaikudi, Pune and Hyderabad. The film was released on 9 February 2018. ==Plot== The movie starts with Raghu (Jai) trying to kill his own father for not taking good care of his family. That is when he comes to know that he owns an ancestral property in Kasi which was given as lease almost 100 years ago. At the same time, an IT raid takes place in a minister's house. The minister hands over the laptop having his property detail to his auditor, who demands five crores to hand over the laptop. In Kasi, Raghu's ancestral property is taken care by Srinivas alias Seenu (Jiiva), but he was unsuccessful in the business that he is doing. It is then shown that both Seenu and Raghu had been cheated by Ganesh (Shiva). They move to Karaikudi to get hold of Ganesh and get back their money. Meanwhile, the minister starts his journey to get back the laptop. In Karaikudi, Ganesh and his two associates reveal that they want to cheat a billionaire in order to get valuable diamonds from him. Moreover, he assures to give back their money if they help him. After multiple attempts, they manage to get it overnight and plan to escape together. However, Ganesh sees Raghu with his girlfriend Aishwarya (Nikki Galrani), whom he liked very much. He intends to cheat both Raghu and Seenu for his revenge. Seenu and Raghu find out about this later and chase after him. After multiple chases, the diamonds in a tusk cover get placed in a random train in the railway station. How Raghu and Seenu get back their money and how the minister gets back the laptop forms the rest of the story. ==Cast== * Jiiva as Srinivas (Seenu) * Jai as Raghu * Shiva as Ganesh * Nikki Galrani as Aishwarya * Catherine Tresa as Hema * Radharavi as Police Inspector * Ramaprabha as Seenu's grandmother * Sathish as Gopal * Yogi Babu as Bhagavan * Robo Shankar as Ganesh's foster father's brother-in-law * VTV Ganesh as Sait, Aishwarya's father * Munishkanth as Muthu Kumar * Madhusudhan Rao as Dharmaraj * Vaiyapuri as Satyamurthy * Manobala as Ganesh's assistant * Aranthangi Nisha as Ganesh's assistant * Singampuli as Seenu's assistant * Singamuthu as Bhagavan's assistant * Santhana Bharathi as Ganesh's foster father * Vichu Vishwanath as Dharmaraj's henchman * Thalapathy Dinesh as Dharmaraj's henchman * Kaajal Pasupathi as Dharmaraj's wife * Meena Vemuri as Ganesh's foster mother * George Maryan as Police Constable * Nandita Swetha as Nandita, fake CBI Officer (special appearance) == Production == Following the success of Kalakalappu (2012), G. Dhananjayan of the production company UTV Motion Pictures revealed that a sequel would be made with same cast and crew, with production beginning in October 2012. Despite the announcement, the project did not materialise and Sundar C moved on to complete Madha Gaja Raja. When UTV Motion Pictures and Sundar decided to collaborate again, Sundar was hesitant to make Kalakalappu 2 as it was \\"difficult to meet such high expectations\\" and subsequently worked on Theeya Velai Seiyanum Kumaru (2013) with the studio. In November 2013, it was reported that Sundar was keen to make another film for the franchise but would only retain Shiva and Santhanam for key roles from the original cast. However, as a result of his busy schedule in late 2014, Sundar stated that he would not work on a sequel and would prioritise other work. In April 2016, it was reported in the media that the makers had cast Arya and Nayanthara in the lead roles and that Siddharth Vipin would be the film's music composer. Kushboo later denied the reports and indicated that there were no immediate plans for a sequel by Sundar. During mid-2017, Sundar C's big budget project, Sangamithra, became delayed and subsequently he looked to quickly complete another film before production started. The producers of Sangamithra, Sri Thenandal Films agreed to finance Kalakalappu 2 and the media widely speculated that actress Oviya would work on the film following her rise to fame through her appearance on the reality television show, Bigg Boss (2017). In late September 2017, it was confirmed that the producers had cast actors Jiiva, Jai, Nikki Galrani and Catherine Tresa in the lead roles, with Shiva being in discussions for a further role. Production was revealed to begin in early October 2017, with Hiphop Tamizha selected as the music composer. The film began production on 4 October 2017 in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu. Vaiyapuri amongst other supporting actors, joined the cast of the film during the first schedule, after Sundar C was impressed with Vaiyapuri's stint on the Tamil reality show, Bigg Boss (2017). The film was then shot non-stop for two months across Kasi, Pune, Bhor, Hyderabad and Chennai, as the team aimed to release the film in early 2018.https://www.newstodaynet.com/index.php/2018/01/24/nikki-galrani-is- rajini-fan-now/ In Varanasi, during a 20-day schedule, the film was shot at Ramnagar, Scindia Ghat, Assi Ghat and the lanes adjoining these ghats.

His mother was Annabella, youngest daughter of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenurchy. His paternal grandfather was Sir Alexander, fifth of Merchiston, who was killed at the battle of Flodden in 1513. Archibald was infeft in the barony of Edenbellie as heir to his father on 8 November 1548, a royal dispensation enabling him, though a minor, to feudalise his right to his paternal barony in contemplation of his marriage with Janet Bothwell, which took place about 1549. Napier began to clear his property of encumbrances. On 1 June 1555 he redeemed his lands of Gartnes, Stirlingshire, and others from Duncan Forester, and on 14 June 1558 he obtained a precept of sasine for infefting him in the lands of Blairwaddis, Isle of Inchcolm. In 1565 he received the order of knighthood. He seems to have sided with Mary Queen of Scots after her escape from Lochleven Castle. During the siege of Edinburgh Castle, held by Kirkcaldy of Grange for the queen, he was required on 1 May 1572 to deliver up his house of Merchiston to the king's party, who placed in it a company of soldiers to prevent victuals being carried past it to the castle. On this account the defenders of the castle made an attempt to burn it, which was unsuccessful. ==At the cunzie- house== Napier's name appears with others in a contract with Regent Morton for working for the space of twelve years certain gold, silver, copper, and lead mines. He was appointed general of the cunzie-house (master of the Mint) in 1576, and on 25 April 1581 he was directed, with others, to take proceedings against John Achesoun, the king's master-coiner. In May 1580 he received payment for the expenses of a mission to England. On 24 April 1582 he was named one of the assessors to prepare the matters to be submitted to the general assembly of the kirk of Scotland, and his name occurs in following years as an ordinary member of assembly, and also as acting on special commissions and deputations. On 6 March 1590 Napier was appointed one of a commission for putting Acts in force against the Jesuits. In January 1593 he was appointed by a convention of ministers in Edinburgh one of a deputation to wait on the king to urge him to more strenuous action against the Catholic nobles, and he was appointed one of a similar commission at a meeting of the general assembly of the kirk in April, and also by a convention held in October. ==Last years== On account of non-appearance before the council of his son Alexander, charged with a serious assault, Napier was on 2 July 1601 ordained to keep ward in Edinburgh until King James declared his will. In September 1604 he went to London to treat with English commissioners about the Mint, when, according to Sir James Balfour, he negotiated skillfully. Napier continued till the end of his life to take an active part in matters connected with mining and the currency. He discussed samples of gold ore with the English prospector George Bowes in 1604.Joseph Bain, Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), pp. 4-5 (misdated as 1566). On 14 January 1608 he was appointed along with two others to repair to the mines in succession to try the quality of the ore. He died on 15 May 1608, aged 74. ==Family== By his first wife Janet (died 20 December 1563), only daughter of Francis Bothwell, lord of session, by his first wife Janet Richardson, Napier had two sons and one daughter: * John Napier the scientist and mathematician who developed logarithms (1550 –1617) * Francis Napier, appointed assayer to the cunzie-house 1 December 1581 * Janet Napier. By his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Mowbray of Barnbougle, Linlithgowshire, he had three sons and two daughters: *Archibald Napier of Woolmet (1575-1600), ambushed and slain on 8 November 1600 in revenge for the murder of Scott of Bowhill in an argument over a horse, widowing his young wife Alison Edmonstone of Edmonstone House *William Napier (1577-1622) *Alexander Napier, Lord Laurieston (1578-1629), appointed a Senator of the College of Justice 14 February 1626 *Helene, married to Sir William Balfour *Elizabeth, married, first, to James, lord Ogilvie of Airlie, and, secondly, to Alexander Auchmoutie, gentleman of his majesty's privy chamber. Lauriston Castle in 1775. On 8 February 1588 the king granted to Napier, Elizabeth Mowbray, his second wife, and Alexander, their son and heir, the lands called the King's Meadow. On 16 November 1593 he obtained a grant of half the lands of Lauriston, where he built Lauriston Castle. ==References== * ==Notes== ;Attribution Category:1534 births Category:1608 deaths Category:Scottish landowners Category:Scottish civil servants Category:Scottish knights Category:Lairds ","title":"Archibald Napier (landowner)"},{"id":"35921355","text":"Charaxes alpinus, the montane charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

South Africa. 1911. Fingoland was a historical territory situated in what is now the Eastern Cape, South Africa. It was inhabited primarily by the Fengu people, and was located in the south-west portion of the \\"Transkei\\" region. The region that was later known as the Transkei was originally divided into territories known as the Idutywa Reserve, Fingoland (Mfenguland) and Galekaland (also spelled Gcalekaland). Fingoland lay by the borderlands in the far south of the Transkei, just north of the Kei River. Following their annexation by the British however, these territories were restructured into the divisions of Butterworth, Tsomo and Ngqamakwe for Fingoland; Centani and Willowvale for Galekaland; and Idutywa for the Idutywa Reserve. ==Location== The territory is located between the Kei and the Bashee rivers, close to the city of East London. Within the Transkei region, Fingoland is located in the far south-west corner on the coast, just south of Tembuland and west of Pondoland. ==History== The amaFengu, known across southern Africa as skilled gunmen, were invaluable allies of the Cape in its frontier wars. The original inhabitants of southern Africa were undoubtedly the Khoikhoi and San Bushmen. Iron- working, farming, speakers of Nguni languages arrived in the first millennium AD, the fore-front of the great \\"Bantu Migration\\" from further north. The Fengu people, whose name means \\"Wanderers\\", arrived in the area in the early 1800s fleeing from Shaka's Zulu armies in the east. After settling among the Gcaleka Xhosa for a time, they suffered repression from the Gcaleka and fled further west towards the then Cape Colony. They settled in their current area in 1835, on invitation from the Cape Government, and became adept and fearsome military allies of the Cape Colony in its frontier wars. Fingoland was annexed to the Cape Colony by treaty and act of Parliament in 1877 (Act 38 of 1877(C)). The act ordered that the inhabitants of Fingoland were to elect two seats in the Cape Parliament. At the time, the Cape Colony operated under its multi-racial \\"Cape Qualified Franchise\\" system, so qualifications for suffrage applied equally to all male residents, regardless of race. The full promulgation of the annexation act only took place several years later. ==See also== *Fengu people *Xhosa Wars ==References== Category:Cape Colony Category:Former countries in Africa Category:History of South Africa Category:Transkei ","title":"Fingoland"},{"id":"35921454","text":"A crash course or crash program is an educational or research course conducted over a very short period of time.

It was designed and built in France just after World War II; only ten were produced, one of which was still active in 2012. ==Design and development== Like the earlier Starck A.S. 70 Jac single seat light aircraft, the AS-57 was an all wooden machine. The two types were similar in layout, apart from the accommodation, though the AS-57 was larger all round. The wings were straight tapered in plan, with rounded tips. The earliest AS-57 had full span trailing edge control surfaces which could be lowered as flaps and operated differentially at the same time as ailerons, though one later specimen at least had ailerons outboard and separate flaps inboard. Leading edge slots are fitted. The side-by-side configuration seating is enclosed under a bubble canopy which has transparent access panels. At the rear the canopy line drops to the upper fuselage to improve the pilot's view aft. The fuselage tapers back to the tail unit, where the tailplane is mounted just above the upper fuselage surface, braced from below with a pair of struts and placed well forward of the straight leading edge of the fin. The fin has a curved top which merges into a full, rounded rudder. The AS-57 has a fixed conventional undercarriage; some have had wheel fairings, others not. There is a small tailwheel. Various engines have been fitted; the one remaining active aircraft has a 78 kW (105 hp) Walter Minor 4-III but another had a Regnier 67 kW (90 hp) 4E.0, both four cylinder, inverted, air-cooled inlines. The AS-57 flew for the first time on 4 April 1946. ==Operational history== An AS-57 was on view at the 1949 Paris Salon. The general later verdict on the AS-57 was that its appearance was pleasing and its characteristics \\"honest\\", but its performance unexceptional. In 2010 only one AS-57, powered by a Walter Minor engine, remained on the French civil aircraft register.

As of 2019 there are 10 elephants that either permanently or temporarily reside at the sanctuary. These elephants are taken care of by 13 local mahouts and a number of foreign volunteers. The foundation is funded predominantly by tourists and volunteer fees. This money is used to develop and improve conditions for the elephants at MEF, as well as run an education program for farmers and their families in Habarana. ==History== Millennium Elephant Foundation, which has been home to the Samarasinghe family and their elephants for many generations, was first opened to the public as the Club Concept Elephant Bath in 1979 by Mr. Sam Samarasinghe (1931-1991), a dedicated animal lover. After Sam’s death in August 1999, MEF was founded in his memory with the assistance of the World Society for the Protection of Animals (Now known as World Animal Protection), and unveiled as a sanctuary possessing proper caretaking facilities and medical services for captive elephants. MEF strives to improve the care and treatment of Sri Lankan elephants whilst increasing awareness about the crippling conditions many of them face throughout the country. The foundation remains the only certified non-profit organization working with captive elephants in Sri Lanka today. Tourists can observe and ride the elephants at MEF as well as assist with their daily washing in the Kuda Oya River that runs through the grounds. The funds generated from both visitors and volunteers is used to maintain the elephants well-being, and to enable the care and rescue of more captive elephants. MEF ensures that it strictly abides by the guidelines set by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Since its inception, MEF has cared for more than 80 elephants. As of 2014, there are 9 elephants, spanning in age from 8 to 52 years, under the care of the sanctuary. Pooja, one of the resident elephants, was the first elephant in the country to be born in captivity. MEF also runs the Footsteps Elephant Consultancy, the only mahout training program to be recognized and accredited by the Sri Lankan Department of Wildlife. ==Elephant rescue== MEF identifies mistreated elephants and subsequently works to relocate them onto the sanctuary grounds, a process that involves paying the elephant owners a monthly wage. The organization then covers all medical, food bills, and a salary for the mahout. The elephant owners are not obligated to cover any of the costs, as many of them turn to MEF when they are no longer capable of coping with the immense expenses required by keeping an elephant. The average daily expenditure on an elephant amounts to around 7000 rupees, over $50. Many of the elephants are recovered from the logging industry, within which poor living and working conditions can cause tusk injuries, potentially resulting in breakages, nerve damage, and gum disease. The other elephants MEF rescues come from the different ways in which elephants are kept in captivity in Sri Lanka: elephants that individual people keep in their home gardens, temple- owned elephants which are often neglected when not used for religious purposes, and elephants hotels keep captive for tourism. ==Elephant care== As of 2014, MEF has 9 elephants and 13 mahouts. A positive and productive working relationship is sought between each elephant and it’s mahout from the moment the elephant arrives at the sanctuary. Every elephant has a night bed at which it is fed in the evening and tied throughout the night. In the morning, each elephant is bathed in the river and fed its breakfast in a day bed. The food, which is delivered daily from off the premises, consists of coconut, kitul, and jackfruit bundles. Each elephant’s daily consumption is counted and recorded to ensure that proper care and protocols are met. Continuous efforts are made to ensure that each elephant’s day and night beds are kept clean and proper health standards upheld. A daily veterinary check is carried out on each elephant which involves a foot sweep to check for foot rot, and the feeding of a vitamin dough ball containing all the vitamins and supplements each elephant requires. This process helps detect any medical concerns early, and if further medical attention is required, the foundation maintains a close working relationship with Dr. Ashoka Dangolla, a senior veterinarian from the University of Peradeniya. This relationship has led to the establishment of a Mobile Veterinary Unit (MVU) that provides medical services for sick and injured elephants throughout the country. In the afternoons, the elephants take part in enrichment activities. At this time, the elephants are taken to an open area where they have the chance to search for hidden baskets of fruit and roam around on their own. This provides a period of relaxation and play for the elephants, and allows them to socialize and develop relationships with each other. The mahouts at MEF are comfortable with and knowledgeable in traditional methods of elephant training which involve the use of pressure points known as nila points and the ankus. The ankus is used to apply strong, clear pressure in very particular points that the elephant is trained to react to. When used correctly, the ankus does not cause the elephant any pain. However, MEF is developing a mahout training program meant to shift elephant training in Sri Lanka towards methodology based on positive reinforcement. The reinforcing stimulus used with elephants is a treat awarded after the elephant has successfully completed a verbal command given by the mahout. ==Volunteer program== The volunteer program at MEF plays a big role in running the sanctuary. International volunteers contribute to the daily tasks involved in caring for the elephants and help to continue developing MEF as charity organization. Each volunteer works with one elephant and its mahout(s) for the duration of his or her stay. Volunteers help care for their elephants by keeping track of their feeding patterns, preparing the elephant vitamin balls, completing a daily veterinary check, washing their elephant, cleaning the elephant beds, and various other tasks. The gardens at MEF, which grow food and medicinal herbs for the elephants and people living on the estate, are also maintained by the volunteers. Volunteers are also involved with various projects that help manage the sanctuary grounds, raise funds, and create awareness about the state of both captive and wild elephants in Sri Lanka. Outside the sanctuary, volunteers get involved in the local community by teaching English to both children and adults year round. ==Conflict to Coexistence== In an attempt to ease the conflict between wild elephants and farmers in Sri Lanka, MEF has established a program known as Conflict to Coexistence (C2C). The project, based in the rural community near Habarana, aims to promote new farming techniques that increase crop security and educate local people on the importance of protecting wild elephants. Volunteers, along with local farmers, spend their nights in tree houses that overlook the farmlands, searching for and monitoring the wild elephant populations. As data is collected and analyzed, farmers will be able to better guard their lands from elephant damage. If elephant-related damages do occur, MEF offers compensation by helping to rebuild the damaged property and cover the cost of the lost crops. The conservation effort hopes that by educating farmers and their families, it will be able to provide them with the resources they need to defend their crops, and thus no longer view the wild elephant as a pest. ==Long term goals== MEF has many longer term objectives it is progressing towards, the most noticeable being a project known as the Freedom Fence Enclosure. MEF is currently working on an enclosure around the estate that will give the elephants 325,100 feet of free roaming area. This will provide them with a natural habitat in which they will be able to socialize amongst themselves. The fence is to be constructed of steel and concrete and one hot wire. MEF is also attempting to train elephants using positive reinforcement methods that differ from the traditional Sri Lankan training system. If successful, MEF hopes to spread this type of training throughout the country and encourage its use. ==See also== *Sri Lankan Elephant *Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage *Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home ==References== Category:Elephant conservation Category:Tourism in Sri Lanka Category:Volunteering in Sri Lanka Category:Wildlife conservation in Sri Lanka ","title":"Millennium Elephant Foundation"},{"id":"35921607","text":"Vicente Ehate Tomi (born 1968) is an Equatoguinean politician who was Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea from May 21, 2012 until June 22, 2016.http://rulers.org/rule.html#equatorial_guinea == References == Category:1968 births Category:Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea politicians Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Equatorial Guinea ","title":"Vicente Ehate Tomi"},{"id":"35921614","text":"Ramón \\"Ramoncito\\" F.

The victim, an American student found stabbed to death at Baker Street station was killed with a potsherd, raising the suspicion the death may be Falcon (police code for 'Folly') related. It quickly emerges that there is not merely a supernatural component to the case but that a secret world lies beneath the streets of the 'mundane' (non-magical) metropolis, and that the supernatural semi-human subterranean inhabitants may be no more harmless than the entirely human population who are blissfully unaware of their existence. ==Plot== Constables Peter Grant and Lesley May, and Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale form the magical branch of the Metropolitan Police. Grant is called in for a murder investigation at the Baker Street Underground station: the victim, American art student James Gallagher, was fatally stabbed with a potsherd. Grant visits James's art professor, and attends an exhibition of work by Irish sculptor Ryan Carroll. Peter realises some of the pieces incorporate pottery identical to the potsherd murder weapon and a bowl found at James's flat. Following this lead, Grant and Lesley discover a warehouse where similar pottery is taken and stored. It owned by The Beale Corporation, which was historically the maker of 'unbreakable' pottery. Its founders were instrumental in excavating the tunnels that later became the heart of the London Underground railway. Grant and a team investigate in the railway tunnels, but they are attacked by pallid large-eyed individuals. They pursue them, eventually reaching an Underground platform, where ones of the individuals uses magic to tear the platform apart, burying Grant in the process. While Grant is recovering in hospital, Lesley tells him she has confirmed Beale, Gallagher and Carroll are all descendants of the founders of the Unbreakable Empire Pottery corporation. James' roommate Zach also visits and accidentally mentions that he knows a pallid large-eyed man. When questioned he reveals that a group known as the Quiet People has been living underground and making pottery for the Beale corporation since the mid-Victorian Era.

He was also a member of Madras Legislative Council for four terms—in 1893, 1895, 1899, and 1902. He was chiefly notable for transforming Madras Christian College into an ecumenical enterprise and imbuing the minds of Madras Province South Indians with Fulfilment theology, with an idea of \\"Christ the fulfiller\\"—in a sense, he is considered not only the pioneer of Fulfilment theology, but also of Hindu Renaissance by making Indian converts to think Christianity in Indian context. He was the recipient of Kaiser-i-Hind Medal and the first LL.D, honoured by the Madras University. ==Biography== Miller was born in Thurso on 13 January 1838, and was educated at Aberdeen University and Edinburgh University. He arrived Madras in 1862 at the age of twenty-four, as the only missionary of the Free Church of Scotland in Madras city at the time of his arrival. Initially, as a missionary, he was engaged in outdoor preaching, congregational work, medical aid, and the education of boys and girls. Madras Christian College received vitality with the arrival of Miller in 1862, and soon became the greatest architect of the college. In 1863, he envisioned that only Christian education could train the greatest leaders of India, he began to specialise on the institution that later renamed the Central Institution, as the Madras Christian College on 1st January, 1877. —A Christian school[General Assembly School] founded on 3 April 1837 by John Anderson, Scottish missionary and the founder of the mission of the Free Church of Scotland at Madras, later became known as Madras Christian College that grew from the school into a college and then Campus under the leadership of William Miller. After he took over the college succeeding Anderson, within two years of his arrival, he upgraded the school into a college and reoriented the educational policy of the institution. The first college class was formed in 1864, studying for the First examination in Arts(FA) of the university. By 1865, the first class of six students appeared for matriculation examination. And, by 1867, a new class was opened to prepare for the BA courses. Miller procured the support of leading missions, including Anglican, Wesleyan, and Presbyterian bodies that ultimately turned a small sectarian institution into a mammoth and a central Christian college for all South India, and soon to be in the front rank of all institutions in India. Miller transformed the institution into an ecumenical and co-operative enterprise and named it as Madras Christian College on 1 January 1877. He not only erected great buildings for the college, chiefly by his own gifts and those of his brother Alexander Miller,. but also garnered support and sponsorship from a group of loyal and able men, both Indian and British. His college hostels were first of their kind in South India—he used these to train future government officials and members of municipal and local boards in the art of conducting public business and running democracy. The alumni of the college, occupied prominent positions in all fields, including national movements, politics and government offices. Miller is credited for opening hostels, several academic and cultural associations, that ultimately shaped Madras Christian College into a premier educational institution in South Asia. He later opened up the institution for Hindu students to a Christward direction through education, rather than just conversion of their faith – Vengal Chakkarai Chetty, P. Chenchiah, and many more were in fact attracted to Christianity under the influence of Miller. He served as the active principal of Madras Christian College for 45 years, another 16 years as Honorary principal, and helped the government shape its educational policy as an educator in all over India. He worked as an educator in India until 1896, and also served as a leading member of Madras University syndicate. For his educational work, he won the appreciation and financial aid from the government. He was nominated to Madras Legislative Council (1891–1909) consecutively four times in 1893, 1895, 1899, and 1902. In 1896, he was unanimously chosen the moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, the highest honour accorded in the church. He received Kaiser-i-Hind Medal and several honorary degrees were conferred by the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He was appointed as Vice-chancellor of the University of Madras in 1901. In 1907, due to ill-health, he left India to reside in Edinburgh, Scotland, and died in 1923 at the age of eighty-five. A biography on William Miller entitled Dr. William Miller was written and published by O.Kandaswami Chetty in 1924, which was earlier published in the Madras Christian College Magazine in 1923 (see Joshua Kalapati and Ambrose Jeyasekaran, Life and Legacy of Madras Christian College, Chennai, 2010 ) ==Works== * Scottish Missions in India, 1868. * Indian Mission and How to View Them, 1878. * Lectures for Educated Hindus, 1880. * The Christian College for Madras, a printed memorandum to the Free Church Foreign Mission Committee (FCFMC), 1874. *Our Scandinavian Forefathers *The Least of All Lands: The Topography of Palestine *Gideon *The Plan of History *Christianity and Education in South India *Shakespeare's Coriolanus and Present Day Indian Politics ==Theology== Miller argued that the Hinduism could not be excluded from the plans of God, and believed that Christianity and Hinduism could work in concentric circles to fulfill the master plans of God. Miller, who is considered as the pioneer of Fulfillment theology, in his Scottish Missions in India published in 1868 noted that: Miller asserted that the institutional and historic Christianity is not superior to Hinduism; instead, it is Christ who is the fulfiller of Hinduism. According to him, though, Christ and His teachings were ultimately central, he felt that enriching truths can be found in Hinduism which would contribute to the common good of humanity and to the Church of Christ. He affirmed that Christianity has no monopoly on truth as Hinduism's emphasis on the immanence of God and on social solidarity has much to teach humanity;other religions could make contributions to the completeness of Christianity, while Christ can fulfill the aspirations of the followers of other religions. Miller felt that educational institutes in India could not be used as places for conversion; instead, as avenues for preparing the Hindus in a Christian direction – Preparatio evangelica. According to him, Christian missions are like leaven, though, not seen from outside, yet is innately transforming. According to O. Kandaswami Chetty, biographer of Dr. William Miller, for Miller \\"Christ was the friend of all that was good and true not only in Christianity, but in Hinduism.\\" The idea of Christ the fulfiller imbued the minds of South India, part of then-Madras Presidency, due to the teachings of Miller at Madras Christian College and due to his missionary work in Madras. According to Eric J. Sharpe, professor of Religious Studies at the University of Sydney, J. N. Farquhar's work on Fulfillment theology in Bengal was built on foundations originally laid in Madras. Though, the object of missionary work and missionary colleges like Madras Christian College was to preach Christ and train Christians, Miller encouraged the Indian converts to rethink Christianity in Indian context, possibly to integrate Christianity and Hinduism; hence, was considered the pioneer of Hindu Renaissance. He discouraged proselytism, encouraged the retention of national manners, and advocated the habit of independent thinking. ==Honours== * The library building in Madras Christian College is named after him as The Miller Memorial Library. * Kaisar-i-Hind Medal * Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (1884) * A bronze statue during his lifetime was erected in Madras. * The Miller Endowment Lectures were established at the University of Madras in 1926 by Diwan Bahadur Sir R. Venkataratnam Naidu, Vice Chancellor of the University, in Miller's honor. Many major figures in philosophy from India and abroad have been invited to deliver them. Among the Indian scholars invited to give the lectures are: S. Radhakrishnan, T.M.P. Mahadevan (1953), S.S. Suryanarayana Sastri (1936-37), V.A. Devasenapathi (1962), P.N. Srinivasachari (of Pachaiyappa’s College) (1940) and C.T.K. Chari (of Madras Christian College), from Madras; S.S. Raghavachar (1965) and M. [Mysore] Hiriyanna (1940-1) from Mysore; and R.K. Tripathi (1977) from Banares Hindu University. Foreign scholars, such as Fernand Brunner of the University of Neuchâtel and Klaus Klostermaier of the University of Manitoba, have also given the lectures. ==See also== * Miller Memorial Library at Madras Christian College Joshua Kalapati and Ambrose Jeyasekaran, Life and Legacy of Madras Christian College (1837-1978), Chennai: Zha Communications, 2010 ==References * Church of Scotland India and Nepal Collection. * HISTORICAL MILESTONES – William Miller * Christian Mission to Muslims – Author: Lyle L.

A number of letters to Spain were discovered, which included blank sheets signed by prominent nobles. ==Background== The Spanish Armada had failed in its attempt to conquer England in 1588. The undeclared Anglo-Spanish War continued, however. The Kingdom of Scotland under James VI was divided over religion, despite the formal ascendancy of the Church of Scotland at this time in a presbyterian form. The Scottish nobility were turbulent, while the king was working to assert administrative and political control of the country against factional and religious strife. A Jesuit mission concerned with Scotland included William Crichton and Robert Abercromby; it looked to help from Spain to further the aims of the Counter-reformation in the British Isles. ==Discovery== Andrew Knox, Minister of Paisley was sent to arrest George Kerr, son of Mark Kerr of Newbattle. George Kerr was about to sail to Spain from the west coast of Scotland, and carried incriminating correspondence. He was arrested at night on the Isle of Cumbrae. The \\"Spanish blanks\\" which were found with other letters in a chest on Kerr's boat, were documents signed by four members of the Catholic nobility of Scotland, and otherwise left to be filled in. At first, the English diplomat Robert Bowes supposed the blanks had writing in invisible ink written with \\"white vitriol\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 823, 828–9, describes the blanks. James VI and Anne of Denmark were at Alloa Tower celebrating the wedding of the Earl of Mar and Marie Stewart, festivities were cut short when Sir John Carmichael and Sir George Home arrived from Edinburgh with news of the crisis. James VI rode to Edinburgh, where the kirk minister Robert Bruce and Robert Bowes explained their understanding of the situation and threat to him.Thomas Thomson, The historie and life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 260-1. George Kerr, his servant, and the letters were taken to Edinburgh and examined by the Privy Council on 2 January 1593.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 829–833, with a list of the letters, not including the royal \\"position paper.\\" Under torture, Kerr said that the blanks were to be filled in by Crichton, to forward a Spanish invasion. Damagingly for James VI (it has been said), Kerr was also carrying a copy of a position paper by the king on the possible advantages to him in accepting Spanish help. ==Investigation== Three prominent Earls were directly implicated: *William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus *Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll *George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly The fourth signature on the papers discovered was that of Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun. Erroll and Huntly were given a date of 5 February to appear and explain themselves: they did not do so, and went to ground in the north. The king was confronted by them on 24 October, on the road from Soutra to Fala, south-east of Edinburgh; they explained that the blanks related to their support for the Jesuits in Scotland. Others involved were: *Alexander, Lord Home * Sir James Chisholm of Cromlix *David Graham, Laird of Fintry. A Catholic, he was executed on 15 February 1593. *Hew Barclay of Ladyland *John Ogilvy ==Aftermath== An official account of the plot appeared in February 1593; it is assumed it was edited by John Davidson. It by no means included all the intercepted letters; but it printed a number concerned with William Sempill in 1589; the connection was that when Sempill's servant Pringle was found in England carrying letters to the Duke of Parma, they had included some from Huntly and Erroll.John Rawson Elder, Spanish Influences in Scottish History (1920), p. 188; archive.org. Perceptions of James VI shifted after the discoveries: some assumed the affair showed the king had at least tacitly approved dealings with Spain, and many more put it down to slackness in anti-Catholic measures. ==References * Saenz-Cambra, Concepción, 'Colonel William Sempill of Lochwinnoch (1546-1630): A Strategist for Spain', Tiempos Modernos, no.13 (2006).

Each week's chart was compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) and was first published on Monday afternoon on their official website. The chart ran for 140 weeks from 2012 to 2015, during which time a total of 23 singles by 22 artists reached number one. The most successful artist was the Italian pianist Ludovico Einaudi, who topped the chart with three singles for a total of 54 weeks, while the most successful record label was Decca Records, which spent 89 weeks at number one with six singles. Einaudi's track \\"I Giorni\\" from his album of the same name spent 51 weeks at number one, longer than any other single. In January 2013, following the release of Einaudi's album In a Time Lapse, singles by the pianist accounted for 13 of the Top 20 on the Official Classical Singles Chart. Martin Talbot, managing director of the OCC, described him as one of the chart's \\"biggest and most consistent stars\\". Singles would often top the chart as a result of exposure in popular media, including films such as Fifty Shades of Grey, The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel. In July 2012, a rendition of Spem in alium by the Tallis Scholars topped the chart following its usage in Fifty Shades of Grey. E. L. James, author of the original novel on which the film was based, said that she was delighted that her readers had been introduced to the piece of music, and that it was a \\"deserved number one\\". Three weeks later, the London Symphony Orchestra reached number one after their version of \\"Chariots of Fire\\" by Vangelis was used in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Three of the top five singles on that week's chart were related to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Reaction to the Official Classical Singles Chart was generally positive. Tenor Russell Watson described it as \\"absolutely amazing\\", while the New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra said that she was \\"really excited\\" about the chart's launch. Composer Paul Mealor described the chart as \\"absolutely fantastic\\". Conversely, Mike Spring, sales manager at Hyperion Records, was more skeptical, as he had observed that downloads of classical music had mainly comprised whole albums or works, rather than individual singles. Similarly, Anthony Anderson, managing director of classical music record label Naxos UK, stated: \\"By its nature, this chart will be more relevant to other companies.\\" ==Chart history== The Official Classical Singles Chart was launched in 2012. According to Umusic, the official website for Universal Music in the UK, it reflected a shift in the British public's consumption of classical music from albums to tracks. At the time of the launch, classical music was becoming more popular in the UK; the previous year, download sales of individual classical tracks had increased by 46% (from 834,000 to 1.2 million), while the single \\"Wherever You Are\\" by Military Wives had been the 2011 UK Singles Chart Christmas number one. During 2012's first quarter, approximately 284,000 classical music downloads were purchased in the UK, an increase of 34% compared to the same period the previous year. Alongside the new singles chart, the Classic Brit Awards announced at the same time that it would launch a Top Single Award at the 2012 ceremony to commemorate the most popular classical single that year. The first chart was published on 28 May 2012, and was based solely on downloads of classical singles in the UK. At number one was a version of the UK's national anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\", by the BBC Concert Orchestra and the British conductor Barry Wordsworth, which reached the top during the week of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. From 27 June 2014, streaming counted towards the UK's music charts, including the Official Classical Singles Chart, with 100 streams equating to one download. The first number one under this new methodology was \\"Nessun dorma\\" by Luciano Pavarotti. After nearly three years of publication, the chart was retired in February 2015, with its final number one being \\"I Giorni\\" – lack of media interest was cited as the reason for its dissolution. Reflecting on the chart later that year, Phillip Sommerich of Rhinegold Publishing felt that its retirement spoke to the difficulty in generating excitement in the UK's classical music sector. ==Number ones== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" +Key !scope=col nth song to top the Official Classical Singles Chart -

Isaac and Mary were both highly respected members of the Salem Village Church, and the community in general. Isaac played a significant role in the witch trials, which is often overlooked in history. Despite being one of the primary reasons for Mary's accusation, he desperately tried to clear his wife's name and put an end to the trials altogether. == Early life == Isaac had been a highly prosperous farmer throughout his life, which resulted in a large and upscale home with a generous owning of land and property. Isaac Eastey, along with his father-in- law Jacob Towne, were lifelong enemies of the Putnam family (who were later the main accusers in the witch trials). The tension between the two powerful families originated with bitter warfare over the ownership of woodland. Isaac and Jacob at one point snuck onto Putnam property and chopped several of their trees down. This, and several other similar incidents, led to a full on, physical confrontation between a band of Putnam men and several Eastey men. However the Putnam clan outnumbered Isaac Eastey and his group, and the Putnams proclaimed a victory. Despite this, the feuding over land ownership between the Easteys and Putnams would last nearly a century. In 1655, Isaac Eastey married Mary Towne. The couple raised eleven children together, with only three of them surviving into adulthood: Isaac Jr. (1656–1714), Joseph (1657–1739), and Sarah (1660–1749). == His wife's accusation and eventual execution == Anne Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, and several other young \\"afflicted\\" girls in Salem Village viciously accused Mary Eastey of being a witch. The girls claimed Mary's specter would bite and choke them, appear to them at night along with Satan and demand they sign his black book, and (along with her sisters Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Cloyce) would regularly attend satanic ceremonies held in Boston, that Mary was geographically able to participate in due to her ability to fly upon sticks, which the Devil granted her in return for her soul. Residents of Salem Village, Topsfield, and other neighboring towns were shocked to learn a woman of such pious character was accused of being a witch. However, townsfolk were well aware of the bitterness and hostility the Putnams held against Isaac Eastey, and Mary's father, Jacob. This, along with Mary's mother having a long-standing reputation of practicing witchcraft, are what most likely led to her accusation. Isaac, along with his and Mary's friends, family and neighbors, all vigorously tried to defend Mary during her examination and trial, but did not succeed. Isaac's wife Mary was hanged on September 22, 1692. == Later life == Isaac and his family did receive compensation of 20 pounds, from the Massachusetts Bay Colony government, after Mercy Lewis admitted she wrongfully accused Mary of being a witch in 1711. == References == * * Category:1627 births Category:1712 deaths Category:People of the Salem witch trials ","title":"Isaac Eastey"},{"id":"35922089","text":"Eivind Nævdal-Bolstad (born 23 April 1987) is a Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party.

The lowest floor, which was used as a cellar and, probably, stables, extends beneath the whole of the castle. It is entirely barrel vaulted and several murder-holes indicate that this floor was used for defence. The garden level is about 1m30 higher, so the lower floor is partly below ground. It is likely that the castle was surrounded by moats, later filled in. Access to the first floor is by a staircase in the west tower. The interior was greatly altered during the 18th century and maintains decoration from that period. The attic floor was dedicated to defence, though the external crenellation has disappeared. The top of the east tower has been removed. On the eastern side of the east tower, there is evidence of the existence of attached buildings which have been destroyed at some time. This tower has also been reduced in height. Château des Junies is privately owned and is not open to the public. It has been listed since 1925 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. ==See also== *List of castles in France ==References * Ministry of Culture: Ministry of Culture listing for Château des Junies * Ministry of Culture photos Category:Castles in Lot Category:Châteaux in Lot (department) Category:Monuments historiques of Lot (department) ","title":"Château des Junies"},{"id":"35922251","text":"Torre dei Pulci.

In 1993 it was severely damaged by a mafia bombing, which caused the death of five people (including one of the Academy's scholars) and also damaged the nearby Uffizi.

The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is a land-use planning policy in the United Kingdom. The NPPF was originally published by the UK's Department of Communities and Local Government in March 2012, consolidating over two dozen previously issued documents called Planning Policy Statements (PPS) and Planning Policy Guidance Notes (PPG) for use in England. A revised NPPF was published by the UK Government's Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on 24 July 2018. ==History== An outline of proposed reforms to the British planning system were published in a policy green paper by the Conservative Party in February 2010 prior to that year's general election. It included integrating the principal features of all national planning policies into one document to make the many existing guidance documents clearer and more priority focused. Following the formation of the Coalition government, on 20 December 2010, the Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark MP, announced a review of planning policy, designed to consolidate all policy statements, circulars and guidance documents into a single, simpler National Planning Policy Framework. A consultation draft of the NPPF was subsequently published on 25 July 2011 which raised a large number of responses and concerns from national organizations such as the National Trust. The final original version was published on 27 March 2012. Despite the pledge for a national policy of only fifty pages, the NPPF was released as a 65-page document, together with a 27-page Technical Guidance document, though this was still a large reduction from the previous guidance of over 1300 pages. Local planning authorities were given a 12-month transition period to ensure their plans were compliant with the new NPPF. A revised NPPF was published by the UK Government's Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on 24 July 2018. This is the first revision of the National Planning Policy Framework since 2012. It implements around 85 reforms announced previously through the Housing White Paper, the planning for the right homes in the right places consultation and the draft revised National Planning Policy Framework consultation. The revised NPPF has since been updated on 19 February 2019 following a technical consultation to redefine deliverable housing. On 23 May 2019 the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government issued a Written Ministerial Statement to remove paragraph 209a from the revised National Planning Policy Framework following a legal judgement. ==Criticisms== Archaeology The potential negative impact of the NPPF on UK archaeology has been heavily debated, with archaeologists noting that there is likely to be considerable tension between the immediate-term impacts of the process of government deregulation in the NPPF and the medium-term impacts of another key government priority – its localism agenda as enshrined in the Localism Act of 2011, which places much greater planning control in the hands of local communities. The NPPF is likely to encourage development through its streamlined planning system, but the Localism Act of 2011 is equally likely to stall development through its commitment to local communities having a greater say in what is (and crucially is not) built in their neighbourhood, a process likely to block many developments. Environment Friends of the Earth (FOE) has criticised the NPPF revisions for lack of environmental review, in that it makes it \\"virtually impossible\\" for councils to refuse fracking schemes, that it fails to address the problems in coal developments or on building within green belts, and that it introduces harsh rules for wind farms. FOE has argued that, as the United Kingdom is still part of the EU, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was required as part of the revision of a public plan. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) has raised concerns about the extreme streamlining of the revised NPPF, indicating that it treats land as a commodity, rather than as a finite resource. CPRE said Planning is pointless if the outcomes it delivers would be little different from what would happen without a planning system. Planning Practice Guidance Publication of the NPPF has been followed by the release of a wide range of online Planning Practice Guidance. As of 2019, the guidance extends to over 50 categories covering a wide range of subjects including Green Belt, Light Pollution and Viability. The amount of guidance in circulation has grown significantly in recent years meaning the volume of government planning advice is similar to what existed prior to the introduction of the NPPF. Unlike changes to the NPPF, much of the practice guidance has been issued without prior consultation or advance notification. 2020 planning reforms In 2020, a series of far reaching changes to Permitted Development rights and the Use Classes Order were introduced, effectively superceding a number of key NPPF provisions. The relevant statutory instruments were laid before parliament the day before the summer recess and were to come into force the day before parliament reconvened. On 27 August 2020, campaign group Rights: Community: Action applied for a judicial review of the statutory instruments on the basis that the changes introduced were unlawful citing a lack of scrutiny, consultation or impact assessments as well as a failure of the government to take account of its own independent experts. ==References Category:United Kingdom planning policy Category:Town and country planning in England ","title":"National Planning Policy Framework"},{"id":"35922359","text":"Ken McCracken or Kenneth McCracken may refer to: * Kenneth G.

In India, agricultural education has evolved into a large and distinct domain, often separately from other areas of higher education. Many of these universities are member of a registered society, the Indian Agricultural Universities Association. Indian Council of Agricultural Research is the main regulatory authority of agricultural education in India, while the disciplines of veterinary medicine and forestry are regulated by the Veterinary Council of India and Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education respectively. Based on the statutes establishing these universities, agricultural universities in India can be grouped into various types. ==State Agricultural Universities== State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) are the predominant class of agricultural universities in India. A SAU is usually a university established by an act of state legislature with a dedicated mandate of teaching, research and extension in agriculture and related disciplines. History of SAUs After Independence, one of the greatest challenge before India was agriculture and rural development. This necessitated the availability of trained human resources in these areas. The first Education Commission of India (1949), headed by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, recommended setting up rural universities in India on the American land-grant model. In the 1950s, Indian Parliament was already setting up specialized engineering universities - Indian Institutes of Technology - as Institutes of National Importance. However, the Parliament had limited mandate in establishing such specialized institutions for agricultural education, despite the urgent need, as the Constitution of India had conferred the power to make laws in subjects of agriculture (including agricultural research and education) exclusively in the domain of the states. The state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) took the first step for establishing an agricultural university in 1954, when it invited an Indo American team headed by Dr K R Damle, the Vice-President of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), to consider an area around Tarai State farm in Nainital district as a possible site for a rural university.Rudra 1978:390 Encouraged by the favourable view of the Damle team, senior UP government officials H S Sandhu and A N Jha visited the United States to look for collaborations with US universities. In consultation with University of Illinois dean Dr H W Hannah, the state of UP presented a proposal to the central government in 1956 for establishing a land-grant style university. Thereafter, a contract was signed between the Government of India, the Technical Cooperation Mission and a few US land-grant universities, to promote agricultural education in India.GOI Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs 1959 Report on the Indo-U.S. Technical Co-operation Programme. New Delhi: GOI, p.157 The US universities included the University of Tennessee, Ohio State University, Kansas State University, the University of Illinois, Pennsylvania State University and the University of Missouri. The UP Act XI-V of 1958 - the founding legislative act for establishing an agricultural university - was promulgated by state legislature of UP. The task of mentoring the proposed university in UP was assigned to the University of Illinois, which signed a contract in 1959. Thus, the first state agricultural university of India, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, was established in Pantnagar (then in Uttar Pradesh, now in Uttarakhand). It was inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru on 17 November 1960. The model of establishing Pantnagar University paved the way for establishing state government supported dedicated universities for agricultural education, i.e. SAUs, in India. There are 54 SAUs in India.www.icar.org.in/ Features of SAUs SAUs are characterized by their triple mandate of teaching, research and agricultural extension. Since the initial SAUs were established with technical cooperation from United States land-grant universities, their academic programmes are strongly influenced by the American system and present a departure from the academic system prevailing in other general universities in India. The undergraduate degree programs of SAUs are of minimum four years' duration. Since their inception, SAUs have followed a trimester or a semester system with credit-based, continuous evaluation on a 5-point or 10-point GPA scale. This is different from general universities, which usually follow a yearly term and percentage based end-session evaluation. As envisioned in ICAR's Model Act for Agricultural Universities, most SAUs are non-affiliating universities/ However, SAUs in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh etc. have affiliated private agricultural colleges. SAUs also have territorial jurisdiction. ==Deemed universities== Deemed universities are not established by an act of independent legislation, but declared to function as universities by Government of India under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act 1956. As per this section, \\"The Central Government may, on the advice of the Commission, declare by notification in the Official Gazette, that any institution for higher education, other than a University, shall be deemed to be a University for the purposes of this Act, and on such a declaration being made, all the provisions of this Act shall apply to such institution as if it were a University within the meaning of clause (f) of section 2\\". Thus, the provision of deemed universities enables the central government to incorporate an agricultural university without the need of Parliamentary legislation, thus circumventing the complexities of federal division for legislative powers, which has put agriculture in the state list. There are seven AUs under the deemed university category, and a further proposal to establish six more deemed universities for agriculture in the 12th Five-year plan. Most of these deemed universities are sponsored by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and have small academic programmes as compared to SAUs. A few of these universities, like Allahabad Agricultural Institute and Indian Agricultural Research Institute, have contributed significantly to research in agricultural science. ==Central agricultural universities== Notwithstanding the limited power of the Indian Parliament for legislating on subjects of state list such as agriculture (including agricultural research and education), there are certain provisions in the Constitution of India which allows it to legislate on these matters in certain conditions, such as when the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to this effect by two-thirds majority (Article 249) or when legislatures of two or more states pass a resolution to do so (Article 252) or to implement decisions taken in international conferences (Article 253). The Central Agricultural University at imphal, Manipur was incorporated by an act of Parliament (No.4 of 1992) and caters to many states in Northeast India. So far, it is the only Central Agricultural University (CAU). There are proposals and demands to establish more CAUs. The Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 22 May 2012; it aims to incorporate a CAU at Jhansi catering to the Bundelkhand region spanning the two states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The Parliament passed the Finance Bill 2012-2013 for budgetary allocation for establishing a CAU in Bihar.Demand for Grants, DARE Government of India, 7 June 2012 On 11 May 2016 Parliament of India passed the Central University Bill.

Although Niall 10th Duke of Argyll, thought it quite possible that their eponymic ancestor was Dunsleve, the son of Aedh Alain, the O'Neill Prince evidence now leads to the conclusion that they are descendents of the Ruaidhri Mac Duinnsleibhe, the last king of Ulidia.” Some sources contend that the surname McClay, like the surname MacKinley, arises instead from a Gaelic language nickname given the MacDonlevy in both the Scottish Highlands and elsewhere. That nickname is Mac an Leigh, translating to English as leech, but meaning a physician. Leeching (medical) was in Gaelic Ireland, Scotland and elsewhere for millennium a pervasive medical therapy. The MacDonlevy were also one of Ireland’s ancient hereditary medical families.A. Nic Donnchadha, \\"Medical Writing in Irish\\", in 2000 Years of Irish Medicine, J.B.

The main logis is flanked by two towers, one round and the other square with machicolations at the top. At the bottom of the tower is the doorway to the chapel, situated partly under the tower, which has kept its Romanesque transept. Originally, the church's apse was in the east. The columns of the triumphal arch are based in the crypt and are surmounted by sculpted Romanesque capitals. The bodies of former owners are interred in the crypt. The Renaissance south façade has several mullioned windows and dormers surmounted with pediments. Several rooms still have plafonds à la française (French-style ceilings: joists the same width as the spaces between them; see Plafond à la française in French Wikipedia). The second range of buildings, known as Château Bouscary, is to the south and has a round tower. In the courtyard, the entrance gateway is composed of segments of a circle, with sculptured framing in the form of a lopped tree. Following restoration, the Gothic arch at the entrance to the enceinte was transformed to the shape of a basket handle.

Her father ran a contract drainage company, which her mother, formerly a teacher, worked for. She lived in Townsville until she was ten, when she moved with her parents to the Gold Coast. She won a gold medal in the under 7's 50 m backstroke. She competed in squash, basketball, and synchronised swimming, and became one of the first Australian women to receive a surf-lifesaving bronze Medallion. On New Year's Eve in 1980, when she was seventeen and had recently graduated high school, she had a bout of transverse myelitis that left her paraplegic. A cyst in her spine that she had removed in 1985 caused her to lose some strength in her arms, and later that year, she had two protruding spinal discs removed; the latter operation restored some muscle function in her lower body. She tried learning to walk again after this operation, but severe nerve root pain forced her to abandon this ambition. She has been married to Grant since 1986. The couple have four biological children, three daughters and a son, and an adopted daughter. ==Competitive career== Connor began training in swimming for the National Wheelchair Games in 1981, and won five gold medals at her first national competition. Coached by Laurie Lawrence, she went to the 1982 World Wheelchair Games, where she won two gold medals in the 50 m butterfly and 100 m backstroke events (setting a world record in the former race), a silver medal in the 100 m freestyle event and a bronze medal in the 100 m breaststroke event. After she returned she received many awards in both disabled and able-bodied competitions including Sports Australia's Female Athlete of the Year and National Caltex-Berlei Disabled Athlete of the Year, and two awards from the Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association, Queensland's Sporting Wheelie of the Year and Most Improved Athlete of the Year. She was disappointed by her performance at the 1983 World Wheelchair Games, where she did not win a gold medal. Before the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Games, she took up the Pritikin Diet to lose weight. The diet caused a vitamin deficiency which put her position in the Paralympic swim team in doubt, and meant that she required constant medical attention at the games. Despite this, she won four silver medals in the Women's 100 m Backstroke 4, Women's 100 m Freestyle 4, Women's 4x50 m Individual Medley 4 and Women's 50 m Butterfly 4 events, and a bronze medal in the Women's 100 m Breaststroke 4 event. She then retired from swimming and took up wheelchair basketball. No other women were playing the sport in Queensland, so she joined the state men's team. She later played for the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, and was planning to be part of the team for the first women's Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in 1990. She then changed her mind after discovering that she was expecting her first child, who was born in May 1989. ==Recognition== Connor was named the 1982 Junior Athlete of the Year in the Australian Sport Awards.

Rather, he wrote that, '... elements of like properties or their compounds of like properties, form groups bounded by simple lines.

The gaseous elements form a small group by themselves, the condensible [sic] chlorine forming the boundary ... So also the boundary lines for other properties may be drawn.'

Set in a Welsh village where the mine has recently been nationalised, it focuses on the relationship between Olwen Williams, a miner's daughter who leaves the village to live in London, and Tom Thomas, who dedicates his life to working in the mine. With Craigie's background in documentary films with a social message, Blue Scar was designed to raise questions about the value of nationalising the coal industry. It was the only non-documentary film Craigie directed. ==Plot== Olwen Williams (Gwyneth Vaughan) is a miner's daughter from a mining town in South Wales, where the mine has recently been nationalised. She is keen to move on from her impoverished upbringing to a more fulfilling lifestyle. An opportunity is presented to her when she wins a singing scholarship to a music college in Cardiff. She decides to leave her hometown to take up this opportunity, which means being away from Tom Thomas (Emrys Jones), a local miner who is in love with her. While Olwen is away from home, an industrial psychologist from London named Alfred Collins (Anthony Pendrell) proposes to her, and she accepts. She announces this news to Tom while attending her father's funeral following a mining accident. Olwen moves to London with Alfred, but is disillusioned by her new life there. Meanwhile, Tom is injured in a mining accident and spends time at Talygarn, a convalescent home. Here he is looked after by Glynis (Dilys Jones), a physiotherapist and friend of Olwen. Tom and Glynis fall in love. Tom also encounters success at work, rising to the position of manager. After his promotion, he visits Olwen in London, in a vain attempt to persuade her to return to Wales. Tom later dies of a mining-related condition. The film ends with Olwen singing \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" in a radio broadcast. ==Production== Blue Scar was produced by Outlook Films, an independent production company established in 1948 by director Jill Craigie and managed in partnership with producer William MacQuitty. Craigie was a socialist documentary filmmaker, and Blue Scar was the first and only non-documentary film she directed; after Blue Scar, she concluded that documentary was the best film genre for social criticism. The film was conceived as a critical commentary on the nationalisation of the coal industry, especially in terms of safety, working conditions and the treatment of miners. The title, Blue Scar, is a reference to the blue colour that characterises wounded skin when affected by coal dust. Half of the funding came from the National Coal Board, although there is disagreement about the total cost of production: according to Craigie, the film cost £80,000, whereas MacQuitty placed the figure in his autobiography as £45,000. The disused Electric Theatre cinema in the Welsh town of Port Talbot served as a makeshift studio, hired at a charge of £1 per day. The interior of the cinema was adapted for the filming, including the construction of a soundproof stage. Coal was brought in for filming scenes in the mine itself. Other scenes were shot on location in Abergwynfi, a village in south west Wales. Most of the cast consisted of amateur actors drawn from the local area. The film was scored by Welsh composer Grace Williams. As well as being Williams's first film score, this was the first time a British woman had scored a feature film. ==Release== The film's treatment of its subject matter created difficulties for distribution, as cinemas were reluctant to show it. MacQuitty later recalled: \\"We had no clout. We couldn't force them to take it. At that time there was a feeling that people wanted only escapism, not reality\\". Daily Herald critic Richard Winnington led a campaign for the film to be released in ABC Cinemas and, after a series of test screenings, the film was eventually distributed within the ABC chain. ==Reception== Film studies specialists have disagreed about the film's reception when it was released. According to Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, the film was met with \\"excellent reviews and enthusiastic audience response\\", but Philip Gillett has suggested the opposite. In the Monthly Film Bulletin, the British Film Institute review praised the film's realism, in authentically capturing the life and environment of the mining village. The reviewer, however, suggested that the plot had \\"many absurdities\\" and that Craigie, although talented as a director, had \\"rather less talent for story-telling\\". A reviewer in The Times shared this view, stating that the miners' lives were well-captured, but that the social message was \\"not very clear\\" and the film's ending was \\"just plain silly\\". The reviewer was also uncertain about the mix of documentary and fiction elements, feeling that \\"the blend of romantic story and objective demonstration of the ways of the Welsh mining villages is not always harmonious\\". ==References * *Blue Scar at BFI Screenonline Category:1949 films Category:British drama films Category:British films Category:Coal mining in Wales Category:Films set in Wales Category:Compositions by Grace Williams Category:1949 drama films Category:British black-and-white films ","title":"Blue Scar"},{"id":"35923293","text":"Wu Naiqun (born 4 February 1971) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players from Liaoning Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Basketball players at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Liaoning Flying Leopards players Category:Medalists at the 1994 Asian Games ","title":"Wu Naiqun"},{"id":"35923306","text":"Charaxes figini is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

It was later released on October 3, 2013 on iOS devices, and on December 2, 2013 on the Ouya. The game was created by Ron Gilbert, building on an idea that he has had for nearly twenty years about a cave that lures people into it to explore their darker personality traits. The game is rated \\"teen\\" for blood and violence. The game borrows concepts from his earlier 1987 game, Maniac Mansion, such as the player initially selecting three different characters from a cast of seven to explore the Cave. Many of the game's puzzles require the three characters to work in coordination to complete, while some puzzles are specific to the unique abilities of a character; in this manner the Cave can only be fully explored through multiple play-throughs. ==Gameplay== The Caves story is based on a magical talking cave (voiced by Stephen Stanton) with a labyrinthine set of tunnels within it. Seven characters, drawn from across time and space and harboring dark secrets, have come to the Cave, believing they can \\"learn something about themselves and who they might become\\", as stated by Gilbert. In one example, a knight character goes to a princess for her amulet, which is the key to unlocking the pulling of the sword, who tells him to bring the treasure the dragon is guarding. The knight then succeeds, but forgets to close the gate to the dragon's den, in turn causing the dragon to eat the princess and coughing up the amulet. The knight then goes to the king with the amulet and is allowed to pull the sword, which was impossible at first due to the many rocks beneath it - however, our characters overcome it by blowing it with dynamite. He then pulls out the sword, and the king \\"ran off to congratulate his favorite daughter\\", but then gets eaten by the dragon as well. At the start of the game, the player selects three of the seven characters, which they are then locked to for the remainder of the game; players can restart a new game to select a different trio of characters. The characters are based on stereotypical figures, such as a hillbilly, a pair of twins (acting as one character), and a scientist. The knight character in The Cave, at the controls of the giant claw machine. Players are shown what objects they can interact with through the on-screen text, such as the \\"Levers and Such\\" caption here. As the player controls the trio to explore the Cave, they collect objects and interact with the environment in a manner similar to an adventure game. The exploration of the game is based on 2D platformer elements, though the game is presented with 3D graphics. Exploration is described as being \\"Metroidvania\\"-like, where more of the Cave's tunnels and chambers become accessible as players collect objects in a manner similar to Metroid or Castlevania. The player will need to work with all three characters, switching between them typically to activate multiple parts of a puzzle; one example shown in early press demonstrations was to use one character to ring a bell to distract a monster, a second character to repair a hot dog vending machine so to provide bait, and a third to operate a giant claw machine to pick up the monster to clear their path. Each character has a unique ability to aid in maneuvering the cave tunnels, leaving some areas inaccessible if the appropriate characters aren't chosen at the start; for example, the adventurer is able to swing herself across gaps with a rope, while the time traveler can phase shift a short distance, passing through closed gates. In addition, some areas of the Cave are accessible only to one of the specific characters; such as the knight finding a castle or the scientist discovering a laboratory; these areas represent the deep desires and dark aspects of a character that lured him or her to the Cave in the first place. While there are hazards that can kill a character, the character respawns shortly afterwards nearby, allowing the player to reattempt the move. Throughout the game will be iconographs for each of the three characters, which the player will need to get near to activate; these provide one of several still art images that reveal the character's back-story. The game is primarily a single-player game, but up to three players can participate cooperatively on the same computer or console, each controlling one of the three selected characters. ==Development== Ron Gilbert has been working with adventure games since his days at LucasArts, including several collaborations with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman; together, they developed games like Maniac Mansion, its sequel Day of the Tentacle, and the first games in the Monkey Island series. Gilbert left LucasArts in 1992, initially creating his own development studio but then moving on to other games, including contributing to Telltale Games' episodic series, Tales of Monkey Island based on the LucasArts series. Meanwhile, Schafer would stay with LucasArts until the adventure game market fell in the late 1990s, and created his own studio, Double Fine Productions, with several of the former LucasArts developers. Though Double Fine struggled with well-received but financially unsuccessful titles Psychonauts and Brütal Legend, it became successful in marketing four smaller games developed during an \\"Amnesia Fortnight\\" period in Brütal Legends development between 2010 and 2011. Gilbert has stated that the idea of The Cave has been one he has had for a long time; he said, of his idea, \\"People have really dark secrets, and going into a cave which is really dark and deep… that metaphor really resonated with me\\". While still at LucasArts, Gilbert had drawn out parts of a labyrinthine cave complex on paper, but the idea never expanded beyond that at that point. Prior to Gilbert's employment at Double Fine, he and Schafer continued to discuss game development and ideas; Gilbert had mentioned this cave idea, prompting Schafer to suggest him coming to work at his company to develop the idea. By September 2010, Gilbert was officially part of Double Fine to work on The Cave; at the time, Gilbert had stated that the yet-named title was \\"an entirely new concept\\" and that \\"fans of those old adventure games will like it\\". The timing of larger development of The Cave coincided with the resurgence in adventure games such as those produced by Telltale Games, and the success of the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter. Gilbert also considered that with casual games becoming more mainstream and acceptable, the market can handle niche games such as adventure games which do not require fast reflexes. Despite the market potential, Gilbert found that pitching the game to publishers was still a challenge, as they did not perceive that a market would exist for such games. Through the act of pitching the game to publishers for the first time in his career, Gilbert had to move away from the free-form design he had used on previous titles and set out plans for the game as a whole, which he found as a benefit; the need to present information to potential publishers required him to think about the game as a whole while still allowing smaller elements to be added in at a later date as they saw fit. The Caves gameplay development was based on three defining factors in Gilbert's mind: having the player select three of a number of characters to explore the cave, to offer a \\"light\\" platforming element to offer other challenges outside of puzzles, and to avoid the use of an inventory system. Gilbert's earlier Maniac Mansion influenced him to revisit the concept of having several playable characters that the player can switch between. Gilbert noted that within Maniac Mansion, several of the characters have minimal use within the game, and sought to correct that within The Cave by giving equal weight to each of the seven playable characters. Gilbert recognized that with seven characters the player would need to play the game three times to see all the character-specific content in the game, but felt this was still a good number to use. He recognized that from Maniac Mansion, players would tend to gravitate towards or away from certain characters, and may always want to play with one specific character in the game. Gilbert maintained the same count in The Cave for this reason. While other aspects of Maniac Mansion may have influenced other design decisions within The Cave, Gilbert considered these less likely to have been conscious decisions on his part. The structure of the Cave within the game was designed to give each character a large unique area to explore, as to avoid the scenario where \\"you play it again and 95 percent is the same\\". While the game is part platformer, Gilbert's intent was not to make it a challenge to traverse the Cave noting that it is nearly impossible to die by missing a jump. Instead, the platforming elements were added as to add variety to moving about the Cave, recalling that in the development of the Monkey Island games, players would become bored walking the same area over and over again. Gilbert's aim for the game's puzzles was to keep them less demanding to allow the game's story and visuals to be the main focus of the player's attention, comparing this to similar methods used in the game Limbo. Gilbert did not want to penalize players for cheap or permanent character deaths, feeling that the death-and- respawn approach would be taken as \\"a minor set-back\\". Similarly to reduce the game's complexity, he did not include a typical inventory system as with most adventure games; each character can carry a single object, which is shown being carried on screen, aiding as visual aids for puzzle solving instead of having to sort through multiple inventory screens. Gilbert wanted the game to be playable by several people, recounting his youth experience of playing the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure with several of his friends, working together to solve puzzles. Similarly, Gilbert took into account that his older games were designed for a different audience, where developers \\"needed to provide 40 hours of gameplay, because that was the standard\\" while players \\"wanted to be bashing their heads against the screen for days on end\\" to solve comparatively hard puzzles; instead, The Cave was designed to be \\"more forgiving\\" and \\"more accommodating\\" to the modern audiences. Gilbert compared the development of the world, characters, and puzzles similar to his past LucasArts adventure games. For example, Gilbert identified the mansion as the \\"genesis\\" for the rest of Maniac Mansion; in a similar manner, the team for The Cave first created the environs of the Cave, leading to the development of characters that would likely inhabit or visit the Cave, fleshing their individual roles out into a larger story and eventually into designing key puzzle elements for the game. Gilbert had started with more ideas for playable characters, up to 20 or 30 based on common stereotypes including an opera singer and a CIA agent, but discarded these when he could not flesh out their reasons for wanting to go to the Cave, and keeping others that he considered his favorites. Gilbert also sought to provide an equal number of characters of each gender, using the twins – a boy and girl – to satisfy this requirement. The Cave is a sentient character in the game, following on Gilbert's idea that the Cave has witnessed all of human evolution over time and mankind's fascination with caves, and thus would be an interesting character within the story. This made it a challenge in writing the story, as the Cave acts as a narrator alongside other voiced non-player characters, but the main playable ones will remain silent. This also allowed Gilbert to keep a sense of mystery about the playable characters; if they were voiced, the dialog would have likely explicitly spelled out their reasons for being in the Cave, while their ultimate goals remain shrouded if they were silent. A cartoon-ish art style, with the characters having larger-than-normal heads and more exaggerated movements, was chosen to allow the characters to still express themselves in a manner that can easily be seen by the player. Two months after the release of The Cave, Gilbert announced he was leaving Double Fine after setting out to complete the game he wanted, and was time to \\"move on\\" and \\"plot my next move\\". The departure was on completely amiable terms with the company, according to Gilbert. Gilbert further clarified that his employment at Double Fine had always been specifically to develop The Cave with no firm plans beyond that; further collaborative efforts with Double Fine remain a possibility in the future. He stated that he considers himself a \\"nomad\\" in game development, preferring smaller teams, and was already working with a former collaborator from Deathspank towards a new mobile game. Announcement Work on the game had been progressing for about a year at Double Fine prior to the game's announcement; Gilbert stated that the six months prior to that period from when he was hired into the studio was used to start developing the ideas for them, with more earnest work by a larger team starting when they identified Sega as their publisher. As the game's full announcement neared, Gilbert used his blog to tease parts of the game's artwork done in collaboration with Double Fine's art team. Double Fine would later trademark the name \\"The Cave\\", affirming this was unrelated to the Double Fine Adventure game that was funded through Kickstarter. Just prior to its announcement, Gilbert provided more artwork which some noted fit perfect within an image published by Sega on their blog, suggesting that the project would be published by the latter. The game was formally announced as The Cave on May 24, 2012, with Sega as Double Fine's publisher for the downloadable title. Schafer participated as creative director for the title. Sega opted to publish the title as part of its growth into downloadable titles; Hakuri Satomi, Sega's Vice President for digital business, called out to the game's originality and valued the experienced and creativity of Gilbert and the Double Fine team. The game was initially set for release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 consoles, but Gilbert has stated they are looking into an iOS version and other touch-based platforms, though have not committed yet; specifically they have encountered a technical limitation in iOS that may prevent them from bringing the game there. Double Fine has announced that they will also develop a version for the Android-based Ouya console. Technically, the game is being developed with the Microsoft Windows platform as the core, as Gilbert did not want this version to feel like a console port; Gilbert also attests that he is \\"primarily a [personal computer] gamer\\" and wanted to stay true to the platform. Windows users pre-ordering the title on Steam also obtained themed items for Team Fortress 2 based on the Hillbilly character's outfit. The Mac OS X version was announced alongside the release date, with Windows and Mac OS X users able to take advantage of Steam Play to use the title within either operating system. The versions for other platforms will be virtually identical to each other, with Gilbert stating that they \\"did work really hard to ensure that visually everything you're seeing is identical\\" between the console versions. The Wii U version will use the Wii U GamePad as a character selection device as well as to shift focus to the character on the screen, but otherwise will add no new features. From IOS 11 The Cave will no longer be supported and will not be available to buy from the app store. ==Reception== The Cave was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 70/100, the PlayStation 3 version 72/100, the PC version 68/100, and the Wii U version 72/100.

He is best known for his writings on the South Asian hand drums known as the tabla. He made an unsuccessful bid for Texas State Senate under the Green Party of Texas in both the 2012 and 2014 race. ==Artistic career== He began his study of the Indian tabla in 1972. In January 1975 he enrolled in the Ali Akbar College of Music in California where he initially studied tabla but then studied pakhawaj under Zakir Hussain. In 1976 he moved to Hyderabad India and began studying tabla and pakhawaj under the late Shaik Dawood Khan. He remained a student until Shaik Dawood Khan's death in 1992. It was also during this period that he studied santur under the late Hassan Mohamad, and dilruba under Sayed-ur-Rehman Jigar. Later he also studied sarangi under Aslam Khan of Hyderabad. Mr. Courtney has worked on numerous CD, vinyl disks, stage performances, as well as performance tours and workshops. From 2003 to 2010 he was a co-producer and presenter for KPFT's world music program \\"Music Beyond Borders\\" in Houston. After 2000, he began to turn his attention to the genre of music videos. In this regard he won awards at the Worldfest: Houston International Film Festival. ==Writer== David Courtney has over 60 publications spreading over the last 35 years. The majority of these works are on Indian music, computers, and musical technology. ==Politics== His political activism began in 2001 when he became involved in the anti-war movement that was a reaction to the war in Iraq. During this period he was on the steering committee of the \\"Houston Coalition for Justice Not War\\". He was also involved in the \\"Tejas Block\\" that protested at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. During this period he also began to be involved in voter registration activities in minority communities. It was in 2004 that he started to make the transition from street level political activism to partisan politics. This transition began when he became active in Dennis Kucinich's failed bid for the US Presidency. David remained active in the local Democratic Party until he switched to the Green Party in 2011. In both 2012 and 2014 he filed his candidacy for the Texas State Senate for District 17. He was unsuccessful in both of these bids. He also did a two year as the Treasurer of the Texas State Green Party. ==Personal life== In 1976 he married the Indian vocalist Chandra Courtney.

With the coming of the British it had manifested itself in the establishment of the Indian National Congress. The motive of this Congress was to establish an All India Federation. The congress had designated all British possessions in South Asia as India denied to the non Indian nations the right to their own nationhood, and, by making pretentious claims, stamped Indian nationality on the peoples of this area.What does the Pakistan National Movement Stand For?

At the time, she was 29 years old and the divorced mother of six children. Hoping to have a large tattoo removed from her chest, she visited a plastic surgeon at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. The surgeon, Frank Gerow, was one of a group working on the concept of breast implants, and was looking for patients to volunteer for the surgery. She told them she was more interested in having them work on her ears, and the surgeons agreed to do that procedure as well. The procedure went forward under the direction of Gerow and his colleague Thomas Cronin, and was deemed a success at the time.Florence Williams, Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History (W. W. Norton & Company, 2012), , pp.63ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. Lindsey kept fairly quiet about her breast enlargement for many years - one boyfriend never knew for example. It was only decades later that she told many of her friends and family about it.https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17511491 accessed Aug. 31 2014 Fifty years later, Lindsey still had her original implants and reported general satisfaction with the procedure, despite pains and other concerns over the years. She never joined the groups of women (including several of her own relatives) who filed lawsuits about health problems associated with the implants, although she reported having experienced many of those problems.J.

With the death of the founder Piccoli in April 2000, the party split into two parts. On one side, Carlo Senaldi took over the leadership of Rebirth of Christian Democracy, that on the occasion of the 2001 general elections sided with Sergio D'Antoni and his party European Democracy. The national (organizational) secretary Angelo Sandri was a candidate in a constituency of the Chamber in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, where the movement was also presented in the provincial elections of that same year. On other side, Alfredo Vito, continued to use the name and symbol of the Christian Democratic Party and chose a close collaboration with the center-right coalition (with which it is allied to the 2001 general elections) until it merged with Forza Italia. In 2002 the party, then led by secretary Angelo Sandri and president Senaldi, joined the reconstituted Christian Democracy, but sometime later it regained its autonomy, under the leadership of Senaldi. In 2005 RDC joined the Christian Democracy for the Autonomies. In 2012 the party joined the Christian Democracy led by Angelo Sandri, and Senaldi was appointed president of the party. ==References== Category:1997 establishments in Italy Category:Defunct Christian political parties Category:Defunct political parties in Italy Category:Christian democratic parties in Italy Category:Catholic political parties ","title":"Rebirth of Christian Democracy"},{"id":"35924011","text":"Thecladoris tylonotoides is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Thecladoris.Bezark, Larry G.

The game is the fifth main entry in the Yakuza series. The game was released in December 2012 in Japan, and localized for North America, Europe and Australia as a PlayStation Network download in December 2015. A remaster with improved resolution and frame rate was released for the PlayStation 4 on June 20, 2019 in Japan, and worldwide on February 11, 2020 as part of The Yakuza Remastered Collection. The game features a new graphics engine, unlike previous games in the series that have been re-utilizing the same engine since Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!. For the first time in the series, it features five settings across Japan along with five playable main characters. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is relatively similar to previous games in the series, with a few changes. Similar to past games, gameplay is divided into two components: Adventure Mode and Combat Mode. Adventure Mode allows players to explore different areas and participate in side activities including mini- games and retro games such as Virtua Fighter 2 and Taiko No Tatsujin. The cities are also significantly bigger than previous games, providing more areas to explore in the game and is said to feature the greatest volume of play spots across cities in the series' history. The change between the game's Adventure Mode and Combat Mode is also said to be more seamless than previous games, which involved a transitional change when encountering enemies whilst in adventure mode. Controls for the game have also been said to have been improved \\"dramatically\\" as with the tempo of the game's combat mode. ==Plot== Setting and characters The game features five main protagonists, the highest number of main protagonists of any game in the series, with the previous highest being Yakuza 4's four main protagonists. The game features series protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, the main character since the original Yakuza game. There are also two returning protagonists from Yakuza 4, namely Shun Akiyama and Taiga Saejima. One of the new main protagonists is Haruka Sawamura, a recurring character of the series since the original game. Though she has always been an integral part of the story, she has never been a playable main character before the game. Lastly is Tatsuo Shinada (Toshiyuki Morikawa), a new character to the Yakuza series. For the first time in the series, the game features five distinct locales across Japan. First of which will be returning from previous games is Kamurocho (a.k.a. Kamuro City), a fictionalized yet realistic recreation of Shinjuku's red-light district, Kabukichō. Second is Sōtenbori, a fictional Osaka district based on Dōtonbori, which is returning from Yakuza 2. The three new cities in the game are Nagasugai, part of the fictional Fukuoka based on Nakasu, Tsukimino, part of the fictional Sapporo based on Susukino and Kin'eicho, part of the fictional Nagoya based on Sakae. According to general director Toshihiro Nagoshi and producer/writer Masayoshi Yokoyama, it will be like the \\"San Andreas\\" of the Yakuza series, in that it is a \\"massive expansion on the core concept that takes the franchise to new heights.\\" Story In December 2012, the 7th chairman of the Omi Alliance, Tsubasa Kurosawa, is on his deathbed. With his apparent death, the truce between Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance breaks down, leading to potential war. The Tojo Clan is forced to strengthen their organization by aligning themselves with older clans based in other major cities across Japan, in order to create a new organization rivaling that of the Omi Alliance, breaking the old traditional barriers of Clan territories in the process. In order to expedite this, Daigo Dojima personally leads the delegations sent to negotiate with the other yakuza in Fukuoka. While in Fukuoka, Daigo meets with Tadashi Madarame, the patriarch of the local Yamagasa clan. Daigo then leaves to meet discreetly with Kazuma Kiryu, who has been living under a different identity as a taxi cab driver. Shortly after work, Kiryu is met by Daigo's bodyguards, Yu Morinaga and Masato Aizawa. They inform Kiryu that Daigo has gone missing and that the last person he had contact with was Kiryu. Aizawa and Morinaga show up at Kiryu’s house the following day, having gotten into a brawl with Yamagasa men. They learn Minoru Aoyama has taken the position of interim chairman. Kiryu later meets Kazuhiko Serizawa, an Osakan detective with the Organized Crimes Unit. He warns Kiryu that he needs to meet with Omi Alliance Lieutenant Masaru Watase to prevent a war. Kiryu meets with Watase who reveals he has no interest in Daigo and doesn’t know his whereabouts, but he does reveal a lot of information was leaked by Aoyama. Kiryu rushes to the hotel where Madarame and Aoyama are only to find Madarame stabbed after trying to shoot Aoyama. Aoyama was planning to take over the Tojo Clan and frames Kiryu for attacking Madarame and shooting Morinaga. Kiryu fights his way out, but Aoyama detonates bombs in the hotel to destroy the evidence. The following morning Kiryu finds out that a hostess he befriended, Mayumi, is Madarame’s daughter and was tasked with watching Kiryu at Daigo's request. Madarame reveals Daigo had gone into hiding as he believed that Aoyama was making an attempt on his life. With Daigo sorting out affairs incognito, Madarame gives Kiryu a letter for Yahata. Kiryu meets with Yahata and shows him the letter ordering the dissolution of the Yamagasa Family. Yahata agrees but he’s still intent on fighting the Tojo. Kiryu tears up the letter, saying that the Yamagasa need to remain intact to keep the peace in Fukuoka. Kiryu proposes he take on Aoyama’s forces by himself to minimize bloodshed and is victorious. Aoyama confesses his real intent to lure Kiryu out of hiding. Before Aoyama can reveal his master’s identity, he’s shot in the head by Morinaga, who is part of the conspiracy. Morinaga admits to murdering Aizawa and declares that Kiryu go to Kamurocho for answers. While Kiryu makes preparations to return to Tokyo, he hears on a radio broadcast that Goro Majima is found dead in Sapporo. In Sapporo, Hokkaido, Taiga Saejima is serving out his sentence with complications. Shigeki Baba, one of Saejima’s cell mates, is accused of stabbing one of Hiroshi Kugihara’s gang members on the same day as Baba's parole hearing. Saejima and Baba learn that Kugihara framed Baba in order to provoke Saejima. Concurrently, Saejima learns that he’s been excommunicated from the Tojo Clan, learns of Majima's death, and learns his parole has been revoked by the Ministry of Justice. Sympathetic to their plight, Deputy Warden Seiji Kosaka helps Saejima and Baba escape from prison. Saejima and Baba head to Sapporo to meet with Taizo Kitakata who is supposedly Majima’s killer. They kidnap him during the Snow Festival via the sewer system and he talks with Saejima. Kitakata reveals that Majima suspected a conspiracy within the Tojo Clan, but is shot by Baba to cover it up. Saejima is spared by Baba, and is directed by Serizawa to Kamurocho in order to act as his informant. In Osaka, Haruka Sawamura is training for the Princess League J-pop competition in order to make her big debut, having been scouted by Mirei Park of Dyna Chair under the condition that Kiryu leave the orphanage in order to keep Haruka's past clean. While training, Haruka and Park bond over a shopping trip, learning of the latter's previous aspiration as an idol and rough upbringing. Park confesses she recently received a letter from her ex- husband who she is going to meet in Tokyo. However, she is found dead outside the office the following day, apparently having thrown herself from the top floor of the building. Park's death attracts the attention of Shun Akiyama, who was in Osaka in order to expand his Sky Finance money-lending business. He reunites with Haruka and details how Park borrowed money from him to invest in Haruka. The pair come to the conclusion that foul play is involved since Park is not a suicidal person. Akiyama examines the suicide note and comes to the conclusion it is forged as Park had to use her left hand due to an injury from Haruka's dance instructor, Kan Ogita, during an argument. He tracks down a forger responsible for the note in Sotenbori and learns the forger was hired by another yakuza employed by Naoyuki Katsuya, the CEO of Osaka Enterprises. Akiyama investigates Osaka Enterprises and finds a heavily injured Ogita who confesses to killing Park accidentally. Park was targeted due to the letter her ex-husband sent her, where Haruka and later Akiyama learn that Majima is Park's ex-husband. With the Princess League competitions finals completed, Haruka and Akiyama head off to Tokyo with the letter in hand with Katsuya shortly behind. In Nagoya, former pro-baseball player Tatsuo Shinada is hired by a disguised Daigo to investigate Shinada's banishment from the league. In order to pay off a massive debt, Shinada investigates the scandal with the aid of loan shark and former fan Koichi Takasugi. During the course of their investigation, they learn the identities of the Nagoya Family members, and that Shinada's former manager, Fujita, is the mastermind. With the culprits identified, Daigo reveals his true identity to Shinada, having known him since high school. After a brief fight, the pair return to Tokyo. As Kiryu arrives in Tokyo, he learns that Baba is an accomplice in the Omi Alliance’s plan and that the main objective of the plan was to draw out Saejima and Kiryu due to them being seen as the pillars of the Tojo Clan. Kiryu learns that three main families are vying for the Chairman position with the Watase, Katsuya, and another. Saejima meets with the Osakan Detective who has tasked him with finding Morinaga while the detective tails Katsuya. Knowing that Morinaga can’t go to the Tojo Clan, Saejima heads to Purgatory where he meets with Kage the Florist about Morinaga’s whereabouts and learns that Aizawa had faked his death and that Morinaga is dead. Upon their return to Kamurocho, Akiyama and Shinada cross paths with each other when they both learn that Haruka may be targeted during the Princess League. Further investigation into Katsuya reveals that Katsuya was Park's close friend, and was not capable of ordering Park's death. Baba and Kiryu see a broadcast saying Haruka’s concert has been canceled, making Kiryu certain of Katsuya’s guilt which Saejima and Aizawa also see. Kiryu tells Baba to relay a message to Haruka and heads off to Kamurocho Hills. Kiryu and Saejima fight their way through the Omi Alliance members separately until they reach Katsuya in his suite with Watase following after. On the roof of the hotel, Katsuya reveals himself to be luring out the actual culprit. Detective Serizawa's identity is revealed to be Kurosawa. Daigo shows up to intervene, but is shot by a traitorous Kamon Kanai. Haruka is met by Nakai and T-Set at Dyna Chair’s Tokyo studio who say they canceled T-Set’s concert and will instead have a supergroup show with Haruka and T-Set performing as Dream Line. As they agree, Baba arrives and relays Kiryu’s message to her. Akiyama and Shinada then meet with Kiryu and Saejima at New Serena, Akiyama coming to the conclusion that Majima, Katsuya, and Park worked behind the scenes to draw out Kurosawa. Kiryu refuses to cancel Haruka's concert and the four plan a way to protect her. Kurosawa is then met by Majima. Before their plan can start, Kurosawa’s men, disguised as members of the Majima Family, arrive at Millennium Tower and begin shooting. With Majima at the top of the tower and Haruka’s concert underway, Akiyama and Kiryu stay behind to fend off Kurosawa’s men while Shinada fights Baba under the Japan Dome. At the top of the Millennium Tower, Saejima finds Kurosawa and is forced to fight Majima. Saejima and Majima fight to a draw, but Kurosawa is unable to reach Baba as he chose not to shoot Haruka. Kurosawa attempts to kill Majima and Saejima, but is stopped by Daigo. In the streets, Akiyama fights Kanai before being relieved by Watase, Madarame, and Kitakata, who survived the attempt on his life. At the Tojo Clan Headquarters, Kiryu learns that Aizawa is Kurosawa’s son. Kurosawa, panicking after his terminal diagnosis, wanted to leave Aizawa the entirety of the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance as a legacy, but Aizawa is only interested in defeating Kiryu. A wounded Kiryu defeats Aizawa and reunites with Haruka, who makes her connection to Kiryu public and announces her retirement from the entertainment industry. ==Development== The game had double the development time of previous games in the series, which generally had a one-year development cycle. The game was developed as something akin to being a reboot of the series, and dubbed as a \\"New Yakuza\\" by developers with the goal of having one of the greatest scripts and scenarios in the series' history. In addition, the game was developed on an all new graphics engine, previous PS3 games in the series used the Magical-V Engine, the same engine as Yakuza 3. The game was seen as a fresh start for developers, who treated Yakuza: Dead Souls as the end for everything developed for the series up to that point. On December 5, 2014, Sega announced Yakuza 5 would be releasing worldwide in December 8, 2015 as a digital download via the PlayStation Network. A remaster with improved resolution and frame rate was released for the PlayStation 4 on June 20, 2019 in Japan. The remaster was released in English on February 11, 2020 as part of The Yakuza Remastered Collection, alongside remasters of Yakuza 3 and Yakuza 4, with a re-translated English script, restored content from the Japanese version, except for the vocal songs due to licensing issues, and a togglable option between Japanese Romaji lyrics and English translated lyrics for the karaoke tracks.https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/20/20814029/yakuza-3-4-5-remaster- collection-release-date-ps4 ==Reception== Yakuza 5 received generally positive reviews release in western territories, while receiving critical acclaim in Japan.

It is usually found in connection with a more-vague, overall standard. By contrast, \\"unsafe harbors\\" describe conduct that will be deemed to violate the rule. For example, in the context of a statute that requires drivers to \\"not drive recklessly,\\" a clause specifying that \\"driving under 25 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed not to constitute reckless driving\\" is a \\"safe harbor.\\" Likewise, a clause saying that \\"driving over 90 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed to constitute reckless driving\\" would be an \\"unsafe harbor.\\" In this example, driving between 25 miles per hour and 90 miles per hour would fall outside of either a safe harbor or an unsafe harbor, and would thus be left to be judged according to the vague \\"reckless\\" standard. ==Theoretical justifications== Safe harbors have been promoted by legal writers as reducing the uncertainty created by simply employing a vague standard (such as \\"recklessness\\"). On the other hand, this type of rule formulation also avoids the problem of creating a precise rule that leaves a judge with no available discretion to allow for \\"hard cases.\\" In theory, the safe harbor formulation can combine the virtues of vague standards and precise rules, allowing legislatures to prescribe with certainty the advance outcome for specific foreseeable cases, and to leave to judges to decide the cases that remain. ==Criticisms== Safe harbors can create precise rules that will be applied in unintended ways. For example, driving under 25 miles per hour in a 60 MPH zone when traffic or other conditions do not require this could be reckless driving. ==United States== An example of safe harbor is performance of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment by a property purchaser: thus effecting due diligence and a \\"safe harbor\\" outcome if future contamination is found caused by a prior owner. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has notable safe-harbor provisions which protect Internet service providers from the consequences of their users' actions. (Similarly, the EU directive on electronic commerce provides a similar provision of \\"mere conduit\\" which, while not exactly the same, serves much the same function as the DMCA safe harbor in this instance.) In the context of environmental protection, a voluntary safe harbor agreement can be undertaken between property owners and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under which a property owner undertakes actions that protect and aid the recovery an endangered species protected under the Endangered Species Act with habitat on their property. In exchange, the FWS or NOAA promises not to require any additional or different conservation activities on the property without the property holder's consent. When the agreement expires, the property owner is permitted to return the landscape to its original baseline condition if they so desire. Safe Harbor laws are being used across the United States to address how children are treated when they become victims of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC). These laws are being used in New York, Florida and 20 other states (as of 2014) to \\"address the inconsistent treatment\\" that children receive after they are exploited sexually. The laws are used to ensure exploited children are treated as \\"victims\\", not as \\"criminals\\". ==European Union== There is an example of a safe harbor decision in reference to the EU Data Protection Directive. The Directive sets comparatively strict privacy protections for EU citizens. It prohibits European firms from transferring personal data to overseas jurisdictions with weaker privacy laws. Five years later, a decision created exceptions where foreign recipients of the data voluntarily agreed to meet EU standards under the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. In October 2015, following a court decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the safe harbor agreement between the EU and US was declared invalid on the grounds that the US was not supplying an equally adequate level of protection against surveillance for data being transferred there. == India == Safe harbour rules are part of the taxation laws in India under which multinational companies declaring certain minimum operational profits will not be subject to rigorous transfer pricing audits. The rules were issued in June 2017 amending the earlier notification from 2013. The current safe harbour rules lower the minimum operation profits declared by software development and ITeS companies, to avoid an audit, to 17-18% depending on the previous year's turnover. For KPO companies, safe harbour rates are set at 18-24%. These rates are effective for the Assessment Years 2017-18 to 2019-20. ==Notes== Category:Legal doctrines and principles Category:Legal defenses ","title":"Safe harbor (law)"},{"id":"35924049","text":"Trichoferus pallidus Trichoferus is a genus of long-horned beetles in the family Cerambycidae.

An outfielder, he played in minor league baseball in the Boston Red Sox organization. Westmoreland was considered one of the best prospects in baseball. However, his career was limited by a medical condition that has required two brain surgeries. A star baseball player in high school, Westmoreland was twice named to the Rhode Island All- State team and was named the Rhode Island player of the year as a senior. The Red Sox selected Westmoreland in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft and signed him with a $2 million signing bonus. Baseball America ranked Westmoreland among the best prospects in baseball in 2010. However, he began to experience symptoms of a cavernous malformation that year, which required two surgeries and years of rehabilitation. Westmoreland announced his retirement in 2013. ==Career== Westmoreland attended Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. He was named to the All-State team in 2007 and 2008, and was named Gatorade Rhode Island Player of the Year in both years. Westmoreland committed to attend Vanderbilt University on a baseball scholarship, allowing him to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores. Eligible in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft at the end of his high school career, Baseball America rated Westmoreland the 113th-best prospect available in the draft. However, it was rumored that he would only consider signing a professional contract with the Boston Red Sox, his hometown team. The Red Sox drafted Westmoreland in the fifth round of the draft, with the 172nd overall selection. Westmoreland signed with the Red Sox, receiving a $2 million signing bonus. Assigned to the Lowell Spinners of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League, Westmoreland batted .296 with seven home runs, 35 runs batted in (RBIs), and a .401 on-base percentage in 60 games during the 2009 season. Baseball America rated Westmoreland the 21st-best prospect in baseball prior to the 2010 season. Before the season began, Westmoreland began to experience weakness, and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed a cavernous malformation at his brainstem. In March 2010, Westmoreland had brain surgery to repair the malformation. He continued to rehabilitate in an attempt to return to professional baseball in the 2011–12 offseason. Following a setback in his rehabilitation, Westmoreland underwent a second surgery in July 2012. Westmoreland announced his retirement from baseball on March 6, 2013. In June 2014, the Lowell Spinners retired Westmoreland's uniform number, 25, the first such honor by the Spinners for a player. A NESN biography, Red Sox Prospects: The Ryan Westmoreland Story, debuted on August 16, 2018. ==Personal== Westmoreland's father, Ron, played baseball and coached for Eckerd College, and two of his uncles played professional baseball.

The ruling also made it clear that Christian Democracy was never dissolved by Congress, the only statutory body entitled to take such a decision. Therefore, on the initiative of Clelio Darida, with a notice in the Official Gazette of March 12, 2012, the National Council in charge in 1993 was reconvened to deliberate the election of the Political Secretary and the President. The Council, meeting in Rome on March 30, 2012, elected Gianni Fontana as Political Secretary, Silvio Lega as President of the National Council and Clelio Darida as Honorary President. Therefore, the political subjects who claimed the name \\"Christian Democracy\\" became three, led respectively by Giuseppe Pizza, Angelo Sandri and Gianni Fontana. Even the party led by Fontana resumed the celebration of the congresses continuing the numbering from the last of those celebrated by the historical DC, the XVIII held in 1989. Thus, in November 2012 the XIX congress was celebrated, which ratified the election of Fontana as Secretary. Subsequently, however, the members of the reborn DC changed its nature and name to \\"Christian Democracy Association\\" and Gianni Fontana took on the role of president of the association.

Of Greek origin, it is counted as one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 24 in the Perry Index. ==Versions== Percy Billinghurst's illustration of the La Fontaine version Wenceslas Hollar's illustration In Greek versions of the story, a lean and hungry fox finds food left by shepherds in the hollow of a tree but is unable to get out again because it has eaten so much. Another fox hears its cries of distress and advises it that it will have to remain there until it becomes as thin as when it entered. Because there were no Latin sources, the fable remained unknown to other European countries until the revival of Greek learning in the Renaissance. A different version was known in Rome, although no fable collection in which it figured has survived. However, it was perpetuated in one of Horace's poetical epistles to Maecenas (I.7, lines 29-35):Horace, Satires, Epistles and Ars Poetica, Loeb Classics, London 1942, p. 297, Internet archive It was this version which was to influence most of those that came later, although there are a variety of them, depending on the country where they are told. But, as in the context of Horace's poem, all teach the lesson of moderating one's ambitions since superfluity only brings trouble. One of the earliest appearances in English sources was in John Ogilby's editions of Aesop's fables in which a fox becomes trapped in a larder and is advised by a weasel that is also present there.Illustrated in editions of the 1660s by Francis Cleyn, then by Wenceslas Hollar; see the British Museum site In Sir Roger L'Estrange's retelling only a few decades later, the fox is trapped in a hen-roost and receives the advice from a weasel that is passing outside. Samuel Croxall tells his moralised story of ‘a little starveling, thin-gutted rogue of a mouse‘ who, rather more plausibly than Horace's fox, creeps into a corn basket and attracts a weasel with its cries for help when it cannot get out.The Fables of Aesop, Google Books, Fable 36 More or less the same story was told at the start of the following century by Brooke Boothby in verseFables and Satires, Edinburgh 1809, p.152 and Thomas Bewick in prose.The 1818 edition of the fables, Google Books, pp.271-2 In French versions it is a weasel that becomes trapped in a granary. In La Fontaine's Fables, the advice to slim is given by a rat within the buildingFables III.17, see Elizur Wright's translation on Gutenburg while in Edmé Boursault's drama Esope à la ville the advice comes from a passing fox.Google Books I.2, pp.7-8 The English playwright John Vanbrugh based his comedy of Aesop on the latter (1697) but unaccountably makes yet another animal the protagonist. His Aesop relates that a famished goat squeezes into a well-stocked barn and realises without any intermediary that fasting is its only chance of getting back out.Plays I, London 1776, p.227 Nevertheless, Boursault's version was sufficiently known in England as to figure five years later in Thomas Yalden's pamphlet of political verses, Aesop at Court.Aesop at Court or State Fables, London 1702, pp.18-19 ==Adaptations== In 1518 the Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto began a series of satires in imitation of Horace. The first of these adapted the Epistle to Maecenas but related a rather different tale in which an ass finds its way through a cracked wall to a stack of corn and is counselled by a mouse when it cannot get out.Susanna Braund, “The Metempsychosis of Horace” in A Companion to Horace, Oxford UK 2010, Google Books pp.369-72 In England the story was adapted by A. A. Milne as the second chapter in his Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) 'in which Pooh goes visiting and gets into a tight place'. In this case, the bear overindulges in honey and condensed milk while visiting Rabbit and becomes stuck when trying to exit the burrow. It takes a week of starvation before he can be extricated.Transcription by Umeå University Academic Computer Club ==References *Illustrations of the mouse and weasel version *Illustrations of the La Fontaine version Fox and the Weasel Fox and the Weasel Category:Foxes in literature Fox and the Weasel Fox and the Weasel Fox and the Weasel ","title":"The Fox and the Weasel"},{"id":"35924414","text":"McAusland is a surname.

This is an element of the later propaganda surrounding the event, and did not happen historically. Nailing the colours (also nailing the colours to the mast or nailing the flag) is a practice dating back to the Age of Sail that expresses a defiant refusal to surrender, and willingness to fight to the last man. During the Age of Sail, ships would legally fight only while flying their national flag. Flying another flag was considered to be a legitimate ruse de guerre only until the beginning of the fight. Striking the colours was a sign of surrender. Indeed, when cannon shots fell a ship's flag, her opponent would cease firing and inquire whether she was capitulating. In contrast, fixing the battle ensign with nails would prevent it from being removed easily, and effectively prevented the surrender. It became an expression of defiance and willingness to force oneself to fight up to the bitter end. The practice became a powerful and recurrent propaganda tool during the French Revolutionary Wars. It actually happened on the Tonnant at the Battle of the NileAristide Aubert Dupetit-Thouars, archivesdefrance.culture.gouv.fr and on the San Juan Nepomuceno at the Battle of Trafalgar; it was also wrongly claimed that the Vengeur du Peuple had done so during the Glorious First of June, when she had in fact struck.

The hypothesis states that the kidney is first and foremost a secreting gland. According to the theory, glomeruli are merely filters, while the tubules are the true secretory structures. To prove his hypothesis, Rudolph Heidenhain injected methylene blue into an animal's bloodstream, which soon appeared in the urine. More evident proof of this theory is that when the tubules are destroyed, urine becomes watery and urea and other toxic products remain in the blood.

Announced and released by Samsung in February 2012, the Galaxy Ace 2 is the successor to the Galaxy Ace Plus. Being a mid-range smartphone, Galaxy Ace 2 contains hardware between that of the Galaxy Ace Plus and Galaxy S Advance; it features a dual-core 800 MHz processor on the NovaThor U8500 chipset with the Mali-400 GPU. In May 2012, the device went on sale in the UK. ==Hardware== Galaxy Ace 2 is a 3.5G mobile device that offers quad-band GSM, and was announced with dual-band 900/2100 MHz HSDPA at 14.4 Mbit/s downlink and 5.76 Mbit/s uplink speeds. The display is a 3.8-inch capacitive PLS TFT LCD touchscreen with 16M colours in a WVGA (480x800) resolution. There is also a 5-megapixel camera with LED flash and auto-focus, capable of recording videos at QVGA (320x240), VGA (640x480) and HD (1280x720) resolutions. Galaxy Ace 2 also has a front-facing VGA camera. The device comes with a 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery. ==Software== Galaxy Ace 2 comes with Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread and Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz 4.0 user interface. In September 2012, Samsung announced that Galaxy Ace 2 would be updated to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The phone can be upgraded to Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. Galaxy Ace 2 has social network integration abilities and multimedia features. It is also preloaded with basic Google Apps, such as Google+ and Google Talk. The phone is available in Onyx Black and in White colours. The device also unofficially supports CyanogenMod as well as other AOSP-derived roms like AOKP. It also unofficially supports LineageOS (14.1 and 15.1 version). ==Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 x / Trend== Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 x Galaxy Ace 2x (GT-S7560M) and in some markets Galaxy Trend (GT-S7560) are at first glance variants of Galaxy Ace 2, in that both have a similar shell and specifications; such as the slightly larger 4\\" screen, and similar specs for RAM and storage space. The major differentiator is in processing power: While Galaxy Ace 2 has a dual-core 800 MHz CPU, then Galaxy Ace II x and Galaxy Trend contain a single-core 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A5 processor in conjunction with an enhanced Adreno 200 GPU. The single-core Snapdragon S1 MSM7227A ARMv7 SoC design is much closer to the one in Samsung Galaxy Mini 2. Galaxy Ace 2 x and Galaxy Trend have 645 MB of accessible RAM (out of the total 768 MB), and approximately 2 GB of user-accessible internal storage. Galaxy S Duos (GT-S7562) is available with very similar specifications; the primary differentiating feature is its dual-SIM support. Galaxy Trend Plus (GT-S7580) has very minor differences comparing with Galaxy Trend (GT-S7560). Trend Plus has Android 4.2 Jelly Bean out of the box, single-core 1.2 GHz processor in conjunction with VideoCore 4 GPU and Broadcom BCM21664 SoC. Galaxy S Duos 2 (GT-S7582) is a dual-SIM equivalent of Galaxy Trend Plus. Software The devices are powered by Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, running Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz Nature UX as the default user interface. Where possible, the operating systems can be upgraded to somewhat newer official versions of Android 4.x than the factory install. To perform a firmware upgrade, the phones must have at least 1 GB of free internal storage. Since these phones run Android 4.0, they are still supported by cloud, communications and social networking services that push the latest versions of their apps, which have in some cases been designed with only the newest hardware in mind. Such applications hog system resources and cause the phones to run slowly. As a remedy, phone owners can replace those apps with less resource-hungry equivalents, or remove them entirely and use a web browser to access the services' sites. The Facebook app has been singled out as the one that uses the most resources overall; it can demonstrably consume between 206-231 MB of RAM memory, whereas Metal (a Facebook wrapper) and Facebook Lite are much easier on phone RAM and battery life. Alternately, the Facebook mobile site can be used, as it uses browser notifications in browsers that support this functionality. ==See also== *Samsung Galaxy Ace *Samsung Galaxy S Duos *Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2 == References == Category:Samsung mobile phones Category:Samsung Galaxy Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2012 Category:Mobile phones with user-replaceable battery *[internal storage]: per device ","title":"Samsung Galaxy Ace 2"},{"id":"35924723","text":"McAloon is a surname.

Binee, understanding that Amir is angry with her, follows her. Amir says that he is fed up with Binee for almost kissing Raj. Binee, in return, says that she was just role-playing kissing Raj. Amir leaves Binee in the night in Raj's house and vows never to return. Binee wakes up in the morning just to find that Amir is no longer there. She cries and tries to kill herself. Raj saves her with a kiss. Binee begins her life without Amir. Raj tries to persuade Binee that he loves her more dearly than Amir does. Raj organizes a party where the only guests are Binee and Raj, and he proposes to Binee. Raj convinces Binee that whatever happened was the part of life and she should accept this and move ahead. Binee accepts the reality that Amir left her, along with Raj's proposal of marriage. Binee finds Raj and Amir together with her in bed. Raj and Amir disclose their past to Binee: they were very, very good childhood friends, each liking whatever the other liked. When they grew up, their parents separated them, forcing Raj to move to Chapali Height, leaving Amir behind in Pokhara. They reveal that they still love each other and want to share everything they have with each other as in their childhood, including Binee. Binee tells them that they are sick and they need a doctor. Binee tries to call the police, but Raj and Amir stop her. In the later scene, we see Raj and Amir making a plan to either persuade Binee to live with them together and enjoy it or they must kill her, otherwise, their truth would be known to the world. Binee remembers how her father said to her that she is his pride and remembers her childhood vow that she would never lessen his prestige in the society. She cries at how she betrayed her father's trust, and vows in her heart to expose the truth of Raj and Amir. Raj and Amir try their best to persuade Binee to forget everything and live with them together. They untie Binee and Binee in return makes them believe that she has accepted them. In the night, Binee tries to leave the house leaving behind a drunken Raj and Amir who are passed out. However, Raj awakes, knocks Binee out, and brings her back to the house. Binee knocks Raj out/down and flees the house. Amir wakes up just to find that Binee has left and Raj has been knocked down and out. Amir catches Binee this time and asks why Binee is not understanding their love. Binee attacks Amir and flees the scene, leaving Amir unconscious. Raj wakes up just to find that Binee attacked Amir, possibly fatally, and chases Binee. Binee tries to flee the house, pursued by Raj. Realizing that Binee is not going to accept them, Raj tries to kill Binee. In the meantime, Amir awakens. Binee finds herself trapped between Raj and Amir. Amir hits her badly, knocking her down. Binee falls to the ground. Raj and Amir come down from the roof to find that Binee is not on the ground any longer. She has already escaped. They vow to find Binee and kill her, just to hide their secret from the society. Binee kills Amir from her hiding place. However, Raj is still alive, and she fights for her life with Raj. In the battle symbolizing homophobic good and innocence vs. evil, the innocence of Binee wins and she is able to kill Raj as well. She digs a graveyard where she buries both Raj and Amir together in Chapali Height to symbolize their eternal friendship. The movie ends with Binee leaving the grave of Raj and Amirat at dawn, free to live her life again having killed her would-be husbands. ==Reception== Critics had mixed to negative responses in spite of its good collection in box office. The Kathmandu Post said it to be \\"plagued with stilted, artificial-sounding dialogues and wooden performances, this is one watch you probably wouldn’t mind missing.\\" Republica commented the film as \\"a compilation of tasteless scenes.\\" The Himalayan Times noted it to be the \\"height of nothingness.\\" There were some positive reviews as well, Manoj Pandit wrote twice about the movie and called it a good watch, which has all its elements at right place. ==Box office== Chapali Height had a decent opening at the box office. It collected around lakhs on the first day. Unofficial figures confirm the collection of lakhs on second day. But the movie ended up being the second-biggest hit of the year behind Nischal Basnet's LOOT. Its net collection at the box office is approx. crores(million rupees). ==Sequel== As sequel to the movie, Chapali height 2 is made. ==References== Category:2012 films Category:Nepali-language films Category:Nepalese films Category:Films directed by Dipendra K Khanal ","title":"Chapali Height"},{"id":"35924797","text":"McAreavey is a surname.

HOPE Atlanta is also notable for the role it has played in Atlanta's - and the United States' - history. What began as a one-man operation outside the Atlanta Railroad Depot aiding travelers seeking support and shelter, soon expanded into a widespread effort to help those in need.

It bears a fragmentary inscription dating to the fifth or sixth centuries and was part of a funerary complex consisting of the stone itself, a cairn and a series of cist burials.The RCAHMS Site record for the Cat Stane. The stone's Latin inscription is interpreted as a dedication to a deceased woman whose remains were interred near the stone. Dates have been ascribed to the stone and its inscription by considering the script used and the results of several excavations conducted in modern times. The stone appears to have been erected in the Bronze Age while the inscription was added in the fifth or sixth centuries AD. During the latter period the area around modern Edinburgh was controlled by the nation known as either the Votadini or the Gododdin. The Cat Stane now lies within the perimeter of Edinburgh Airport, making it impossible for the general public to access it. Nearby is the confluence of the Gogar Burn and the River Almond. The stone is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. ==Description== The Cat Stane is an irregular standing stone of 1.3m height. It is heavily weathered but preserves an inscription in Latin, with several lacunas. The inscription, carved in a rough Latin script appears to read: :IN OC T :MVLO IAC T :VETTA F :VICTR This is interpreted by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) as representing: :IN THIS :TOMB LIES :VETTA DAUGHTER OF :VICTRICUS File:Cat Stane, Kirkliston, 1860.jpg The Cat Stane illustrated in 1860 for the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. File:Latin Inscription on the Cat Stane at Edinburgh Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1735742.jpgInscription on the stone ==History== The earliest description of the Cat Stane was made by the Welsh scholar Edward Lhuyd in 1699 who described it as standing on a pavement of flat stones surrounding the remains of a low oval cairn. The first excavation of the stone's vicinity was conducted in 1860. Further excavation took place in 1864 and, most recently, 1977 when it was unsuccessfully proposed that the stone be removed from the grounds of Edinburgh airport. These excavations showed that the Cat Stane was surrounded by a series of burials in stone-lined graves known as cists. RCAHMS interprets the Cat Stane as a Bronze Age site re-used for burials in the fifth or sixth centuries. ==See also== *Cat Stones of Scotland == References == Category:Scheduled monuments in Scotland Category:Archaeological sites in Edinburgh Category:6th century in Scotland Category:Megalithic monuments in Scotland Category:Bronze Age Scotland Category:Culture of medieval Scotland ","title":"Cat Stane"},{"id":"35924930","text":"Uglovsky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia. ==Districts of the federal subjects== Location of Altai Krai in Russia *Uglovsky District, Altai Krai, an administrative and municipal district of Altai Krai ==Historical districts== *Uglovsky District, Leningrad Oblast (1927–1932), a district of Leningrad Oblast ==See also== *Uglovsky (disambiguation) ==References== ","title":"Uglovsky District"},{"id":"35924937","text":"Worldcrunch is a Paris-based English language news website that curates and translates news from international media sources or partner organizations.

Johnson, Paul. Art: A New History, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003, p. 290. The technique allows for faster painting and makes the undercoat an integral part of the painting itself. ==History== The Italian Renaissance painter Tintoretto first developed the method to increase the output of his workshop. The prestezza method consists of three steps: > At first the artist applied a brown undercoat, using a color that was used > for etching technology, on the canvas. Thereafter he made a rough drawing > using white colour, very often like a sketch. Then the actual painting > process started.Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson, Jörg Reckhenrich, The Fine Art > of Success: How Learning Great Art Can Create Great Business, Wiley, 2011. Tintoretto believed that increased artistic output at lower cost would be more profitable than his meticulous, multi-layered brushwork of his former employer, Titian. Tintoretto relied on quick execution, flexible pricing, and high turnover to fill the market gap left by Titian's exclusively high-end patrons However, the prestezza technique's unfinished look was unsatisfactory to many patrons. For example, the use of the technique in Raising of Lazarus resulted in \\"...movements [which] are indicated by broad movements of the brush. ...[t]he background area is hidden in shadow, which allows the painter to indicate with minimum definition the presence of twenty figures required by the contract signed by his patron.\\" Nichols, Tom. Tintoretto: Tradition and Identity. Reaktion Books, 2004, p. 107. Giorgio Vasari described the end result as, \\"[he] has left as finished works sketches still so rough that the brush-strokes may be seen.\\" Vasari, Giorgio. The Lives of the Artists. Translated with an introduction and notes by J.C. and P Bondanella. Oxford University Press, 1991. Tintoretto's refusal to redo his delivered work and led to customer alienation. Still, he enjoyed a level of success comparable to other leading Venetian painters. ==Gallery== The effect can be observed in several of Tintoretto's paintings: File:Jacopo_Tintoretto_- _Christ_washing_the_Feet_of_the_Disciples_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg  Tintoretto's painting shows background figures painted with the prestezza technique.

It was officially announced on May 4, 2012. A playable version of the game was presented at the 2012 Role Play Convention in Cologne, Germany and the E3 2012. A reveal trailer was released on May 24, 2012. ==Gameplay== The gameplay of Dark is based on stealth combat. Eric has many supernatural vampiric 'skills' at his disposal; he can use Shadow Leap to quickly teleport to different areas and to perform stealth finishers, make himself temporarily invisible, see in the dark and slow down time. His abilities are linked to a certain amount of 'blood points' which are used up each time Eric uses a skill. He can drink blood from his enemies to restore his health and blood points. ==Plot== The game follows the story of Eric Bane (Doug Cockle), a newly turned vampire suffering from amnesia. He learns that his transformation is not complete and that, if he does not drink the blood of his sire, he will mutate into a mindless ghoul. In order to avoid being such a foul creature, he receives missions to drink ancient vampires' blood. However, an angel in Eric's view appears to guide him to the righteous path, and ease intolerable pain that comes from not drinking appropriate blood as it disappears. With a question of this vision, he tries to recover his deleted memories and his true self. ==Reception== Dark received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Much of the game's criticism has been aimed at the poor melee combat, camera, script, and lack of interest in the game's protagonist. In a mixed review, Jon Blythe of Official Xbox Magazine UK stated: \\"DARK is frustrating, because that initial feeling of being a zippy blur of a vampire in a world of neon-lit night never leaves you. It's just swamped in frustrating design decisions, a script that lurches from passable to laughable, weak enemy AI, and a vortex of a lead character who's impossible to like or hate.\\" Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that \\"low-budget games can be delightful and surprising, but only if the core elements work. Here, they don't. In its best moments, this is only ever a reminder of better games. In its worst moments - of which there are far too many - Dark frustrates and irritates as only a clumsy stealth game can.\\" Michael Engle of The Game Scouts said, \\"I would rather [insert cliché about how to kill a vampire here] than play this game.\\" In the most negative review on the website, Andrew Reiner of Game Informer complained that \\"I’ve played a lot of bad Xbox 360 games for achievements, but hardly any are as unpolished and poorly executed as Dark. It’s easily one of this generation’s worst titles. Even when the stealth is working moderately well, the slow pacing is a killer, and no amount of blood sucking brings satisfaction. Most levels were completed through trial and error, failure after failure, and then success coming from exploiting an AI bug or an odd design decision.\\" ==References * *Official website *Realmforge Studios *Kalypso Media Category:Role-playing video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Urban fantasy video games Category:Vampire video games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:2013 video games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Dark (video game)"},{"id":"35925048","text":"M.

J. M. McCarthy, 1990, Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kinematics equations are used to analyze and design articulated systems ranging from four-bar linkages to serial and parallel robots. Kinematics equations are constraint equations that characterize the geometric configuration of an articulated mechanical system. Therefore, these equations assume the links are rigid and the joints provide pure rotation or translation. Constraint equations of this type are known as holonomic constraints in the study of the dynamics of multi-body systems. ==Loop equations== The kinematics equations for a mechanical system are formed as a sequence of rigid transformations along links and around joints in a mechanical system. The principle that the sequence of transformations around a loop must return to the identity provides what are known as the loop equations. An independent set of kinematics equations is assembled from the various sets of loop equations that are available in a mechanical system. Transformations In 1955, Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg introduced a convention for the definition of the joint matrices [Z] and link matrices [X] to standardize the coordinate frames for spatial linkages.J. Denavit and R.S. Hartenberg, 1955, \\"A kinematic notation for lower-pair mechanisms based on matrices.\\" Trans ASME J. Appl. Mech, 23:215–221.Hartenberg, R. S., and J. Denavit. Kinematic Synthesis of Linkages. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964 on-line through KMODDL This convention positions the joint frame so that it consists of a screw displacement along the Z-axis : [Z_i] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta_i & -\\\\sin\\\\theta_i & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta_i & \\\\cos\\\\theta_i & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & d_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, and it positions the link frame so it consists of a screw displacement along the X-axis, : [X_i]=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & a_{i,i+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,i+1} & -\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,i+1}& 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,i+1} & \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,i+1} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The kinematics equations are obtained using a rigid transformation [Z] to characterize the relative movement allowed at each joint and separate rigid transformation [X] to define the dimensions of each link. The result is a sequence of rigid transformations alternating joint and link transformations from the base of the chain around a loop back to the base to obtain the loop equation, :[Z_1][X_1][Z_2][X_2]\\\\ldots[X_{n-1}][Z_n]=[I].\\\\\\\\! The series of transformations equate to the identify matrix because they return to the beginning of the loop. ==Serial chains== The kinematics equations for a serial chain robot are obtained by formulating the loop equations in terms of a transformation [T] from the base to the end-effector, which is equated to the series of transformations along the robot. The result is, :[T] = [Z_1][X_1][Z_2][X_2]\\\\ldots[X_{n-1}][Z_n],\\\\\\\\! These equations are called the kinematics equations of the serial chain. ==Parallel chains== The kinematics equations for a parallel chain, or parallel robot, formed by an end-effector supported by multiple serial chains are obtained from the kinematics equations of each of the supporting serial chains. Suppose that m serial chains support the end-effector, then the transformation from the base to the end-effector is defined by m equations, :[T] = [Z_{1,j}][X_{1,j}][Z_{2,j}][X_{2,j}]\\\\ldots[X_{n-1,j}][Z_{n,j}],\\\\quad j=1,\\\\ldots, m.\\\\\\\\! These equations are the kinematics equations of the parallel chain. ==Forward kinematics== The kinematics equations of serial and parallel robots can be viewed as relating parameters, such as joint angles, that are under the control of actuators to the position and orientation [T] of the end- effector. From this point of view the kinematics equations can be used in two different ways. The first called forward kinematics uses specified values for the joint parameters to compute the end-effector position and orientation. The second called inverse kinematics uses the position and orientation of the end- effector to compute the joint parameters values. Remarkably, while the forward kinematics of a serial chain is a direct calculation of a single matrix equation, the forward kinematics of a parallel chain requires the simultaneous solution of multiple matrix equations which presents a significant challenge. ==References== Category:Robot kinematics ","title":"Kinematics equations"},{"id":"35925108","text":"Duke Zhuang II of Qi (; died 548 BC) was from 553 to 548 BC ruler of the State of Qi, a major power during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. His personal name was Lü Guāng (呂光), ancestral name Jiang (姜), and Duke Zhuang was his posthumous title. He was the second of the two Qi rulers called Duke Zhuang. Before ascending the throne he was known as Prince Guang. ==Accession to the throne== Prince Guang was the son of Duke Ling of Qi and his concubine Sheng Ji. In 572 BC Duke Dao of the state of Jin attacked Qi. Duke Ling made peace with Jin by sending Prince Guang to Jin as a hostage. In 563 BC, Guang was made the crown prince of Qi. However, Duke Ling later deposed him and made his half-brother Ya the new crown prince, at the request of his favorite concubine Rong Zi. In the fifth month of 554 BC, Duke Ling died after 28 years of reign, and the powerful minister Cui Zhu installed Guang on the throne instead of the new crown prince Ya. Prince Guang is posthumously known as Duke Zhuang II of Qi. Cui Zhu and Duke Zhuang subsequently killed Rong Zi, Prince Ya, and minister Gao Hou, who supported Ya. ==Battles with Jin== In 551 BC, Luan Ying, leader of the powerful Luan Clan of the State of Jin, rebelled against Jin, but was defeated and fled to Qi. Minister Yan Ying advised Duke Zhuang against supporting rebels of Jin, to no avail. The next year, with Duke Zhuang's support, Luan secretly returned to Quwo, the old Jin capital, and rebelled again. Meanwhile, Duke Zhuang dispatched the Qi army to invade Jin, reaching the Taihang Mountains. Luan achieved some initial success, and even briefly captured the Jin capital, Jiang. However, he was soon defeated by the Jin army and killed at Quwo. After hearing of Luan's defeat, the Qi forces retreated, taking the city of Zhaoge on the way back. Two years later, Jin attacked Qi for revenge. ==Death== Duke Zhuang had an adulterous relationship with Cui Zhu's second wife Tang Jiang, which Cui learned about. In the fifth month of 548 BC, the viscount of the minor state of Ju came to pay tribute to Qi. Cui pretended to be ill and did not attend the banquet for the Viscount of Ju. The next day, Duke Zhuang visited Cui at his home and tried to have a tryst with his wife. Cui had his men block the Duke's guards outside and surround Duke Zhuang in the courtyard. Duke Zhuang tried to escape by climbing a wall, but was shot by an arrow and killed. Cui Zhu subsequently installed Duke Zhuang's younger half-brother Chujiu on the throne, to be known as Duke Jing of Qi. ==Family== * Parents: ** Prince Huan (; d. 554 BC), ruled as Duke Ling of Qi from 581–554 BC ** Zong Sheng Ji, of the Ji clan of Lu () * Daughters: ** Shao Jiang () *** Married Duke Ping of Jin (d. 532 BC) ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Monarchs of Qi (state) Category:6th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:548 BC deaths Category:6th- century BC murdered monarchs Category:Assassinated Chinese politicians ","title":"Duke Zhuang II of Qi"},{"id":"35925110","text":"William Granger, from Dover, Kent (by 1491 – 1544/1545), was an English politician.

Consumers were invited to create their own Doritos ads and each year, at least one fan-made commercial was guaranteed to air during the Super Bowl. In later editions of the contest, Doritos offered bonus prizes ranging from $400,000 to $1,000,000. Eight editions of the Crash the Super Bowl commercial contest were held between 2006 and 2016 and, during that time, fans submitted more than 36,000 entries.As Doritos’ ‘Crash the Super Bowl’ ends, North Texas companies look back at iconic ads Dallas Morning News February 5, 2016 ==2006–2007 contest== In the fall of 2006, Frito-Lay (with the help of their ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and led by their promotional agency, The Marketing Arm) launched the first installment of the Crash the Super Bowl contest. Consumers were tasked with creating 30 second commercials for Doritos products. In all, 1,065 consumer-made ads were submitted and displayed on the contest site, Crashthesuperbowl.com.A Brief History of the Crash the Super Bowl Contest Video Contest News. January 7, 2012 From those entries, five ads were selected as finalists. The director of each selected ad received a cash prize of $10,000 and a trip for two to Detroit during Super Bowl XLI in February 2007. The five finalist ads were posted to the contest web site for a month-long public vote. The commercial that received the most votes, \\"Live the Flavor\\" aired during the 2007 Super Bowl. Though the five 2006–2007 finalists were flown to Detroit, they did not actually attend the Super Bowl. Instead, they watched the game from a private party near the stadium. In a move that has since become a Crash the Super Bowl tradition, no one, not even the finalists, knew which commercials would air before the game. \\"Live the Flavor\\" was the first consumer-generated ad to ever air during the Super Bowl and it was ranked the #4 best commercial of the game on the USA Today Ad Meter poll.Anheuser-Busch Wins USA TODAY Ad Meter Title USA Today February 5, 2007 Later in the game, Frito-Lay surprised the finalists by also airing a second Crash the Super Bowl ad, \\"Check Out Girl.\\" In December 2007, Time.com named \\"Live the Flavor\\" the 9th best commercial of the year.Top TV ads of 2007 Time.com December 9, 2007 Frito-Lay's PR company, Ketchum Inc., won a Golden World Award from the International Public Relations Association for their work on the 2006–2007 Crash the Super Bowl contest.

But instead of being a commercial contest, the 2007–2008 installment would give an aspiring musician the chance to \\"Crash\\" the Super Bowl and have their music heard by millions of viewers. The winner would also receive a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&M; Records. The winner of the public vote was 22-year-old Kina Grannis and, during Super Bowl XLII, Frito-Lay purchased 60 seconds of commercial time to run a music video featuring Grannis performing part of her original song, \\"Message From Your Heart.\\" Frito-Lay also chose to air one of the 2006–2007 Crash the Super Bowl finalist ads, \\"Mouse Trap\\", during the game. Grannis' performance was seen by 100 million viewers and her song, \\"Message From Your Heart\\" briefly made the Top 30 on iTunes. However, Grannis' music video/commercial landed at the very bottom of USA Today's Super Bowl ad meter poll.

Within the United States and the United Kingdom, a distinction is made between the cause of death (sometimes referred to as the \\"mechanism of death\\"), which is a specific disease or injury, versus manner of death, which is primarily a legal determination. Different categories are used in different jurisdictions, but manner of death determinations include everything from very broad categories like \\"natural\\" and \\"homicide\\" to specific manners like \\"traffic accident\\" or \\"gunshot wound\\". In some cases an autopsy is performed, either due to general legal requirements, because the medical cause of death is uncertain, upon the request of family members or guardians, or because the circumstances of death were suspicious. International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions.National Center for Health Statistics – Classification of Death and Injury Resulting from Terrorism – How are external cause of injury codes assigned?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. retrieved July 7 2019 ==Terminology== A death by natural causes results from an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, other than infectious disease. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza and/or pneumonia (infections), a stroke, a heart attack (internal body malfunctions), or sudden heart failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes. \\"Death by natural causes\\" is sometimes used as a euphemism for \\"dying of old age\\", which is considered problematic as a cause of death (as opposed to a specific age-related disease); there are also many non-age-related causes of \\"natural\\" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes. (See ) An unnatural death results from an external cause, typically including homicides, suicides, accidents, medical errors, drug overdoses.External causes of death, University of Melbourne, retrieved April 25, 2019 Jurisdictions differ in how they categorize and report unnatural deaths, including level of detail and whether they are considered a single category with subcategories, or separate top-level categories. There is no international standard on whether or how to classify a death as natural vs. unnatural. \\"Mechanism of death\\" is sometimes used to refer to the proximate cause of death, which might differ from the cause that is used to classify the manner of death. For example, the proximate cause or mechanism of death might be brain ischemia (lack of blood flow to the brain), caused by a malignant neoplasm (cancer), in turn caused by a dose of ionizing radiation administered by a person with intent to kill or injure, leading to certification of the manner of death as \\"homicide\\". The manner of death can be recorded as \\"undetermined\\" if there is not enough evidence to reach a firm conclusion. For example, the discovery of a partial human skeleton indicates a death, but might not provide enough evidence to determine a cause. ==Categories by jurisdiction==  United States  In the United States, a manner of death is expressed as belonging to one classification of a group of six possible:The Crime Museum – Cause, Mechanism, and Manner of Death retrieved April 27, 2019Snohomish County Government, Washington Cause & Manner of Death retrieved April 27, 2019 * Natural * Accident * Suicide * Homicide * Undetermined * Pending In some jurisdictions, some more detailed manners may be reported in numbers broken out from the main four or five. For example: * Legal intervention (e.g. capital punishment) * Act of war * Automobile accidents * Deaths of prison inmates by acute intoxication  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, when people die, either a doctor writes an acceptable natural cause of death medical certificate, or a coroner (procurator fiscal in Scotland) investigates the case. Coroners are independent judicial officers who investigate deaths reported to them, and subsequently whatever inquiries are necessary to discover the cause of death, this includes ordering a post- mortem examination, obtaining witness statements and medical records, or holding an inquest.Coroners, post-mortems and inquests, nidirect retrieved April 27, 2019 In the unified legal jurisdiction of England and Wales, most deaths are certified by doctors without autopsy or coroner involvement. Almost all deaths certified by the coroner involve an autopsy but most do not involve a formal inquest. – Figure 1, page 16 In England and Wales, a specific list of choices for verdicts is not mandated, and \\"narrative verdicts\\" are allowed, which are not specifically classified. The verdicts aggregated by the Ministry of Justice are: – Table 6: Inquest verdicts returned, 1994-2008 * Homicide ** Killed unlawfully ** Killed lawfully * Suicide * Attempted or self-induced abortion * Cause of death aggravated by lack of care, or self-neglect * Dependence on drugs * Non-dependent abuse of drugs * Want of attention at birth * Death from industrial diseases * Death by accident or misadventure * Stillborn * Death from natural causes * Open verdict * Disaster Other jurisdictions Some jurisdictions place deaths in absentia, such as deaths at sea and missing persons declared dead in a court of law, in the \\"Undetermined\\" category on the grounds that due to the fact-finder's lack of ability to examine the body, the examiner has no personal knowledge of the manner of (assumed) death; others classify such deaths in an additional category \\"Other,\\" reserving \\"Undetermined\\" for deaths in which the fact-finder has access to the body, but the information provided by the body and examination of it is insufficient to provide sufficient grounds for a determination. The Norwegian Medical Association classifies what other jurisdictions might call \\"undetermined\\" as \\"unnatural\\": * Sudden and unexpected death of an unknown cause * Deaths in prison or while in civilian or military detention ==Legal implications== A death ruled as homicide or unlawful killing is typically referred to police or prosecutor or equivalent official for investigation and criminal charges if warranted. Deaths caused by capital punishment, though homicides, are generally assumed to be lawful and are not prosecuted. Most deaths due to war are not prosecuted, unless there is evidence of a war crime, in which case troops on foreign territory might be prosecuted by the military justice system, domestic law enforcement, or the International Criminal Court. Some insurance contracts, such as life insurance policies, have special rules for certain manners of death. Suicide, for example, may invalidate claims under terms of such a contract. ==See also== * Inquests in England and Wales (conducted by coroners) * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES – CERTIFICATE OF TREATING OR EXAMINING DOCTOR – Form 3 – Burial and Cremation Act 2013 (section 10) (Australia) Natural causes Category:Medical terminology Category:Public health ","title":"Manner of death"},{"id":"35925228","text":"Burak Bekdil (born 1966 in Ankara, Turkey) is a Turkish columnist who wrote for the daily Hürriyet for 29 years.

He is the younger of two sons. In 1938, state- sanctioned attacks against Jews in Nazi Germany prompted the family to emigrate to Australia, settling in Sydney. Shortly after arriving in Sydney, Westheimer completed high-school by self-study and enrolled in the professional Optometry program at the Sydney Technical College, from which he graduated with honours and the College Medal in 1943. While practising optometry he pursued further study, leading to a BSc in mathematics and physiology from Sydney University and submission of a thesis for the Fellowship of the Sydney Technical College. In 1951, Westheimer went to the US, first as a graduate student at Ohio State University (PhD, Physics- Physiological Optics) with Glenn A. Fry and then in various professorial ranks in optometry schools of the University of Houston, Ohio State and University of California, Berkeley, interrupted by post-doctoral studies at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole and at the Physiological Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. In 1960, he was appointed as an associate professor at the School of Optometry at Berkeley, becoming professor in 1963. In 1967, he joined Berkeley's Department of Physiology-Anatomy, later merged into the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, in which he established and headed the Division of Neurobiology until becoming professor in the Graduate School in 1994. Since 1994 he has also been a member of the adjunct faculty of the Laboratory of Neurobiology of Rockefeller University in New York. Westheimer never relinquished the Australian citizenship gained by naturalisation. Appointment to membership in the Order of Australia in 2009 recognised his continued identification with the country that provided refuge from the holocaust.

In 1869, negotiations were taking place to transfer political control to Canada. Several American traders took advantage of lack of policing in the area and set up trading posts.

The central wing surface always provides lift and is usually the largest, while the functions of the fore and aft planes may vary between types and may include lift, control and/or stability. In civil aircraft the three surface configuration may be used to give safe stalling characteristics and short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance. It is also claimed to allow minimizing the total wing surface area, reducing the accompanying skin drag. In combat aircraft this configuration may also be used to enhance maneuverability both before and beyond the stall, often in conjunction with vectored thrust. ==History== An early designation used in 1911 was \\"Three plane system\\".G.H. Bryan, Stability in Aviation, 1911 The Fernic designs of the 1920s were referred to as \\"tandem\\". While there are indeed two lifting wing surfaces in tandem, the tailplane forms a third horizontal surface. Pioneer experiments 1908 Voisin-Farman I During the pioneer years of aviation a number of aircraft were flown with both fore and aft auxiliary surfaces. The issue of horizontal stability was poorly understood and typically pitch control was on the front surface with the rear surface also lifting, leading to instability problems. The Kress Drachenflieger of 1901 and Dufaux triplane of 1908 had insufficient power to take off. More successful types included the Voisin-Farman I (1907) and Curtiss No. 1 (1909). The Wright Brothers too experimented on the basic Flyer design in an effort to obtain both controllability and stability, flying it at various times in first canard, then three surface and finally conventional configurations. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the rear surface had become the conventional configuration and few three surface types would be flown for many years. The Fokker V.8 of 1917 and Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano of 1921 were both failures. Soft stall and STOL Molniya-1 In 1920s George Fernic developed the idea of two lifting surfaces in tandem, together with a conventional tailplane. The small foreplane was highly loaded and as the angle of attack increased it was designed to stall first, causing the nose to drop and allowing the aircraft to recover safely without stalling the main wing. This \\"soft\\" stall provides a level of safety in the stall which is not usually present in conventional designs. The Fernic T-9, a three- surface monoplane, flew in 1929. Fernic was killed in an accident while flying its successor the FT-10 Cruisaire. It is possible to achieve such a soft stall with a pure canard design, but it is then difficult to control the pitching and oscillations can develop as the foreplane repeatedly lifts the nose, stalls and recovers. Also, care must be taken in the design that the turbulent wake from the stalled foreplane does not in itself disturb the airflow over the main wing sufficiently to cause significant loss of lift and cancel out the nose-down pitching moment. In the three-surface design the third, tail surface does not stall and provides better controllability. In the 1950s James Robertson developed his experimental Skyshark. This was a broadly conventional design but with a variety of features, including a small canard foreplane, intended to give not only a safe stall but good Short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance. The foreplane allowed STOL performance to be achieved without the high angles of attack and accompanying dangers of stalling required by conventional STOL designs. The aircraft was evaluated by the US Army. Robertson's system was commercialised as the Wren 460, a modified Cessna light aircraft. This in turn was later licensed and produced during the 1980s as the Peterson 260SE and with the foreplane modification only as the 230SE. In 2006 a ruggedised variant, the Peterson Katmai, entered production. A broadly similar approach is taken by the 1988 Eagle-XTS and its derivatives, the Eagle 150 series. Manoeuvrability beyond the stall Grumman X-29, rear strake flaps deflected Around 1979, military jet designers began studying three-surface configurations as a way to provide enhanced manoeuvrability and control, especially at low speeds and high angles of attack such as during takeoff and combat.Miller, J.; The X-planes, Speciality Press (1983), page 178. In the United States the experimental Grumman X-29 flew in 1984 and a modified McDonnell Douglas F-15, the F-15 STOL/MTD, in 1988 but these designs were not followed up. In the Soviet Union a Sukhoi Su-27 modified with canard foreplanes flew in 1985Green, W. & Swanborough, S.; The complete book of fighters, Salamander (1994). and derivatives of this design became the only military types to enter production. Minimum wing surface Scaled Composites Triumph Also in 1979, Piaggio began design studies on a three- surface civil twin turboprop which, in collaboration with Learjet, would emerge as the Piaggio P.180 Avanti. This type first flew in 1986 and entered service in 1990, with production continuing today. In the Avanti, the three- surface configuration is claimed to significantly reduce wing size, weight and drag compared to the conventional equivalent. Two experimental aircraft adopting this configuration were subsequently built by Scaled Composites under the lead of Burt Rutan and flown in 1988. The Triumph was a twin-turbofan very light jet aircraft designed for Beechcraft. Flight testing validated the targeted performance range. The Catbird was a single-engined propeller-driven aircraft, envisioned by Rutan as a replacement for the Beechcraft Bonanza. It holds the world record for speed over a closed circuit of without payload of set in 2014. ==Fighter aircraft design== Sukhoi Su-33 Some advanced jet aircraft have a three-surface configuration, often in conjunction with thrust vectoring. This is typically intended to enhance control and manoeuvrability, especially at very high angles of attack beyond the stall point of the main wing. Some advanced combat manoeuvres such as Pugachev's Cobra and the Kulbit were first performed on Sukhoi three-surface aircraft. The experimental Grumman X-29 was of basic \\"tail-first\\" canard configuration, with unusual forward-swept wings and strakes extending rearwards from the main wing roots. Movable flaps at the ends of the strakes effectively made it a three-surface design.In Jan Roskam's Airplane Design, the X-29 is described as a three- surface aircraft The X-29 demonstrated exceptional high-angle of attack manoeuvrability. A more straightforward three-surface design is seen in several variants of the otherwise conventional Sukhoi Su-27. Following the successful addition of canard foreplanes to a development aircraft, these were incorporated into a number of subsequent production variants including the naval Su-33 (Su-27K), some Su-30s, the Su-35 and the Su-37. The Chinese Shenyang J-15 also inherits the configuration of the Su-33. The McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD was an F-15 airframe modified with canard foreplanes and thrust vectoring, designed to demonstrate these technologies for both STOL performance and high manoeuvrability. ==Reduced surface area design== Equilibrium of a conventional (top) and a three surface aircraft (bottom) The three-surface configuration is claimed to reduce total aerodynamic surface area compared to the conventional and canard configurations, thus enabling drag and weight reductions. Pitch equilibrium On most aircraft, the wing centre of pressure moves forward and backward according to flight conditions. If it does not align with the centre of gravity, a corrective or trim force must be applied to prevent the aircraft pitching and thus to maintain equilibrium. On a conventional aircraft this pitch trim force is applied by a tailplane. On many modern designs, the wing centre of pressure is normally aft of the centre of gravity, so the tailplane must exert a downward force. Any such negative lift generated by the tail must be compensated by additional lift from the main wing, thus increasing wing area, drag, and weight requirements. On a three-surface aircraft, the pitch trim forces can be shared, as needed in flight, between the foreplane and tailplane. Equilibrium can be achieved with lift from the foreplane rather than downforce from the tailplane. Both effects, the reduced downforce and the extra lifting force, reduce the load on the main wing. The Piaggio P.180 Avanti has flaps on both its forward wing and main wing. Both flaps deploy in concert to maintain pitch neutrality for take-off and landing. Static stability and the stall On a canard aircraft, to allow natural static pitch stability in normal flight, the foreplane must provide lift. Also, in order for the aircraft to have safe stall characteristics the foreplane must stall before the main wing, pitching the aircraft down and allowing the aircraft to recover. This means that a safety margin must be used on the main wing area so that its maximum lift coefficient and wing loading are never attained in practice. This in turn means that the main wing must be increased in size. On a three-surface aircraft, the tailplane acts as a conventional horizontal stabiliser. In the stall condition, even if the main wing is stalled the tailplane can provide a pitch-down moment and allow recovery. The wing may thus be used up to its maximum lift coefficient, an advantage that may translate into a reduction of its area and weight. A lifting foreplane is positioned ahead of the centre of gravity, so its lift moment acts in the same direction as any movement in pitch. If the aircraft is to be naturally stable, the foreplane’s size, lift slope and moment arm must be chosen so that it does not overpower the stabilizing moment provided by the wing and tailplane. Stability constraints thus limit the foreplane’s volume ratio (a measure of its effectiveness in trim and stability terms), which may in turn limit its ability to share pitch trim forces as described above. Wing area reduction The minimum size of the lifting wings of an aircraft is determined by: the weight of the aircraft, the force required to oppose the negative lift produced by the horizontal stabilizer, the targeted take off and landing speeds, and the coefficient of lift of the wings. Most modern aircraft use trailing edge flaps on the main wing to increase the wings lift coefficient during take off and landing; thus allowing the wing to be smaller than it would otherwise need to be. This may reduce the weight of the wing, and it always reduces the surface area of the wing. The reduction of surface area proportionately reduces skin drag at all speeds. A drawback of the use of trailing edge flaps is that they produce significant negative pitching moment when in use. In order to balance this pitching moment the horizontal stabilizer must be somewhat larger than it would otherwise be, so that it can produce enough force to balance the negative pitching moment created by the trailing edge flaps. This, in turn, means that the main wing must be somewhat larger than it would otherwise have to be to balance the larger negative lift produced by the larger horizontal stabilizer. On a canard aircraft the foreplane can provide positive lift at takeoff, reducing some of the down force the rear stabilizer would otherwise have to create. However, the main wing must be large enough to not only lift the aircraft's remaining weight at takeoff but also to provide adequate safety margin to prevent stalling. On a three-surface aircraft, neither of these handicaps is present and the main wing can be reduced in size, so also reducing weight and drag. It is claimed that the total area of all wing surfaces of a three-surface aircraft can be less than that of the equivalent two-surface aircraft, so reducing both weight and drag. Minimum area in cruise can be further reduced through the use of conventional high-lift devices such as flaps, allowing a three-surface design to have minimum surface area at all points in the flight envelope. Examples of reduced-area three-surface aircraft include the Piaggio P.180 Avanti, and the Scaled Composites Triumph and Catbird. These aircraft were designed to expose a minimum of total surface area to the slipstream; thus reducing surface drag for speed and fuel efficiency. Several reviews compare the Avanti's top speed and service ceiling to that of lower-end jet aircraft, and report significantly better fuel efficiency at cruise speed. Piaggio attributes this performance in part to the layout of the aircraft, claiming a 34% reduction in total wing area compared to a conventional layout. ==List of three-surface aircraft== -  Aceair AERIKS 200  Switzerland  Propeller  Private  2002  Prototype   Designed as a homebuild kit. -  Curtiss/AEA June Bug  US  Propeller  Experimental  1908  Prototype   -  Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano  Italy  Propeller  Transport  1921  Prototype   Three triplane stacks, making nine wings in all.

He wears a grey suit jacket, white shirt, and grey tie. Behind him are people with single-lens reflex cameras. Brad Pitt is an American actor and film producer whose acting career began in 1987 with roles in the hit Fox television series “21 Jump Street”. He subsequently appeared in episodes for television shows during the late 1980s and played his first major role in the slasher film Cutting Class (1989). He gained recognition in Thelma & Louise (1991) and A River Runs Through It (1992). He later took on the role of vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror drama Interview with the Vampire (1994) and for his performance in the epic drama Legends of the Fall (1994), he earned his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination. Pitt featured in the David Fincher-directed, commercially successful thriller Seven (1995), in which he played a detective on the trail of a psychopathic serial killer. The role of a mental patient in the science fiction film 12 Monkeys earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. He followed it with the role of Heinrich Harrer in the biopic Seven Years in Tibet (1997). Pitt reteamed with Fincher to star in the apocalyptic film Fight Club (1999) in a role that required him to learn boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. A critical and commercial disappointment, the film has since developed a cult status. Pitt portrayed Rusty Ryan in the commercially successful heist film series Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07). In 2002, he earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his guest appearance in the sitcom Friends. Also that year, Pitt started a production company, Plan B Entertainment, whose first release was the epic war film Troy (2004), starring Pitt. He played an assassin opposite Angelina Jolie in the commercially successful action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Pitt produced the 2006 crime drama The Departed, and acted alongside Cate Blanchett in the multi-narrative drama Babel (2006); the former won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt's portrayal of the eponymous man who ages in reverse in the drama The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. He starred in the successful war film Inglourious Basterds (2009), and produced the superhero film Kick-Ass (2010) and its sequel in 2013. In 2011, he earned critical acclaim for producing and starring in two films—the experimental drama The Tree of Life and the biopic sports drama Moneyball—both of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He also garnered a Best Actor nomination for the latter. His biggest commercial success came with the apocalyptic film World War Z (2013), which has grossed a total of $540 million worldwide. Pitt produced the period drama 12 Years a Slave (2013), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury which received positive reviews from critics and proved to be successful at the box office. In 2019 he starred with Leonardo DiCaprio in the Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and in James Gray's science fiction epic Ad Astra. For playing a stunt double in the former, he won an Academy Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. ==Film== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" width=\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Title ! colspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" Credited as ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Role ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Notes ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" -

Relation between catalytic activity and size of particle. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 31 (1939), pp. 916–920 Thiele reasoned that with a large enough particle, the reaction rate is so rapid that diffusion forces are only able to carry product away from the surface of the catalyst particle. Therefore, only the surface of the catalyst would be experiencing any reaction. The Thiele Modulus was then developed to describe the relationship between diffusion and reaction rate in porous catalyst pellets with no mass transfer limitations. This value is generally used in determining the effectiveness factor for catalyst pellets. The Thiele modulus is represented by different symbols in different texts, but is defined in HillHill, C. An Introduction to Chemical Engineering and Reactor Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1977, 440-446. as hT. : h^2_{T} = \\\\dfrac{ \\\\mbox{reaction rate} }{ \\\\mbox{diffusion rate} } == Overview == The derivation of the Thiele Modulus (from Hill) begins with a material balance on the catalyst pore. For a first-order irreversible reaction in a straight cylindrical pore at steady state: {\\\\pi} r^2\\\\left ( -D_c \\\\frac{dC}{dx} \\\\right )_x = {\\\\pi}r^2\\\\left ( -D_c \\\\frac{dC}{dx} \\\\right )_{x+{\\\\Delta}x}+\\\\left ( 2{\\\\pi}r{\\\\Delta}x \\\\right )\\\\left ( k_1C \\\\right ) where D_c is a diffusivity constant, and k_1 is the rate constant. Then, turning the equation into a differential by dividing by {\\\\Delta}x and taking the limit as {\\\\Delta}x approaches 0, D_c\\\\left (\\\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{2k_1C}{r} This differential equation with the following boundary conditions: C=C_o \\\\text{ at } x=0 and \\\\frac{dC}{dx} = 0 \\\\text{ at } x= L where the first boundary condition indicates a constant external concentration on one end of the pore and the second boundary condition indicates that there is no flow out of the other end of the pore. Plugging in these boundary conditions, we have \\\\frac{d^2C}{d(x/L)^2} = \\\\left (\\\\frac{2k_1L^2}{rD_c} \\\\right) C The term on the right side multiplied by C represents the square of the Thiele Modulus, which we now see rises naturally out of the material balance. Then the Thiele modulus for a first order reaction is: h^2_T=\\\\frac{2k_1L^2}{rD_c} From this relation it is evident that with large values of h_T, the rate term dominates, and the reaction is fast while slow diffusion limits the overall rate. Smaller values of the Thiele modulus represent slow reactions with fast diffusion. == Other Forms == Other order reactions may be solved in a similar manner as above. The results are listed below for irreversible reactions in straight cylindrical pores.  Second Order Reaction  h^2_2=\\\\frac{2L^2k_2C_o}{rD_c}  Zeroth Order Reaction  h^2_o=\\\\frac{2L^2k_o}{rD_cC_o}  Effectiveness Factor  The effectiveness factor η relates the diffusive reaction rate with the rate of reaction in the bulk stream.

It was designed to be a modern representation of American Victorian gardens as they appeared in the mid to late 19th century. It replaced an existing Victorian Garden which had been built to celebrate the nation's Bicentennial in 1976. ==History== Lady Bird Johnson strolls in the Haupt Garden with its donor Enid A. Haupt (left) The garden opened on May 21, 1987 as part of the redesigned Castle quadrangle. It is named for Enid A. Haupt, who provided the $3 million endowment which financed its construction and maintenance. Initially approached with a request that she finance a small Zen garden within the quadrangle, after a review of the plans Haupt said that she was \\"not interested in putting money into a Zen garden...I'm only interested in financing the whole thing.\\" The quadrangle redesign project and the Smithsonian Gardens more broadly were part of the vision of the eighth Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, who felt that the museum experience should extend beyond the museums' buildings into the outdoor spaces. The landscape design of the Garden featured the collaborative efforts of architect Jean Paul Carlhian, principal in the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott; Lester Collins, a landscape architect from Millbrook, New York; Sasaki Associates Inc. of Watertown, Massachusetts; and James R. Buckler, founding director of the Smithsonian's Office of Horticulture. The central feature of the garden is a symmetrically patterned parterre, flanked by the Moongate Garden to the west and the Fountain Garden to the east. The parterre measures 144 feet long by 66 feet wide; the low-growing plants that fill out the series of diamonds, fleurs-de- lis, and scallops or swags that make up the design are changed every six months, typically in September and May. Other notable design features include saucer and tulip magnolias, brick walkways, and historical cast-iron garden furnishings from the Smithsonian Gardens' Garden Furniture Collection. The Andrew Jackson Downing Urn is within a circle in the northeast portion of the parterre.(1) (2) (3) ==Gallery== File:Moving Magnolia Trees for Haupt Garden.jpgMoving Magnolia Trees for Haupt Garden File:Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for AMSG & NMAfA.jpgRibbon Cutting 1987 File:Visitor Playing in Pool of Water.jpgVisitor Playing in Pool of Water File:NMAfA and Haupt Garden in the Spring.jpgNMAfA and Haupt Garden in the Spring File:S.

Goldstein in 1973. It has been widely used in the United States, as well as other countries, in schools, agencies, and institutions serving children and youth. The Skillstreaming programs for early childhood, elementary age, and adolescence are published by the Research Press Publishing Company of Champaign, Illinois. Behavior theorists, including Albert Bandura described the processes of modeling, behavioral rehearsal, and reinforcement which are the basis of the Skillstreaming approach. However, rather than emphasizing operant procedures such as prompting and shaping of behaviors, Skillstreaming takes a more psychoeducational approach, viewing the individual as a person in need of help in the form of skills training. The method provides active and deliberate learning of desirable behaviors to replace less productive behaviors. ==History== In 1950s and 1960s, the main therapeutic approaches for dealing with inappropriate behavior in individuals were (psychodynamic, nondirective, and behavior modification). These three types of therapy focused on helping individuals to express their pre-existing effective, satisfying, or healthy behaviors. After the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s resulted in the discharge of large numbers of people from mental health and other institutions into local communities, Arnold P. Goldstein developed Structured Learning Therapy,Goldstein, A. P. (1973). Structured Learning Therapy: Toward a psychotherapy for the poor. New York: Academic. the precursor to Skillstreaming, as a practical method of behavioral training. Structured learning methods deal with aggression, withdrawal, and other nonproductive actions as learned behaviors that can be changed by teaching new, alternative skills. During this time, progressive education and character education,Chapman, W. E. (1977). Roots of character education.

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, Center for Moral Education. and affective educationMiller, J. P. (1976). Humanizing the classroom. New York: Praeger. As well as filling its initial purpose as an intervention for low-income adults deficient in social skills, Skillstreaming has been used with other populations. In the 1980s, Dr. Goldstein’s skills training program, by that time known as Skillstreaming, was adapted to modify aggression and other problematic behaviors in adolescents, \\"Book Review: Refusal Skills: Preventing Drug Use in Adolescents\\". DeepDyve. elementary children and preschool and kindergarten children. The Skillstreaming approach has been employed with elderly adults, child-abusing parents, industrial managers, police officers, and others. Evaluative research studies support the efficacy of Skillstreaming and have suggested means for altering and improving its procedures and materials.Ganz, Jennifer B., \\"Skillstreaming the Adolescent: New Strategies and Perspectives for Teaching Prosocial Skills.(Review)\\" Intervention in School & Clinic, v.36, no.4, 2001 March, p.246 () Sage Publications, Inc. ==Publications== Between 1984 and 2012, Goldstein and Ellen McGinnis published a series of books describing the Skillstreaming program, organized into three age groups: early childhood, elementary and adolescent.

Phase error (usually measured in nanoseconds) is calculated for an observation interval. This phase shift is known as time interval error (TIE). MTIE is a function of the observation interval. An observation interval window moved across the dataset. Each time the peak-to-peak distance between the largest and smallest TIE in that window is noted. This distance varies as the window moves, being maximal for some window position. This maximal distance is known as MTIE for the given observation interval.

The Lamb of God is an allusion to Christ’s title as recorded in John’s Gospel (John 1: 29) when John the Baptist describes Jesus as \\"The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the World\\". The painting appears in Sarah Phelps' BBC Agatha Christie \\"quintet\\", And Then There Were None, The Witness for The Prosecution, Ordeal by Innocence, The ABC Murders, and The Pale Horse. Its repeated use is to symbolise the trussed nature of the guilty character who has put them self on the path to perdition.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-02-16/pale- horse-agatha-christie-painting/ == References  *, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on this painting (see index) Category:1630s paintings Category:Sheep in art Category:Paintings based on the Gospels category:Paintings by Francisco de Zurbarán in the Museo del Prado ","title":"Agnus Dei (Zurbarán)"},{"id":"35925817","text":"Gazan (, also Romanized as Gazān; also known as Qazān) is a village in Arabkhaneh Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It was believed that the movement of these clouds was directed by demons, who led them over fields to destroy crops. A gradobranitelj (literally \\"hail defender\\") and an oblačar was, in Serbian tradition, a man who protected his village from destructive weather. In Serbia, bad weather was believed to be brought by various demonic beings, including devils, creatures called ala and aždaja, eagles, black-feathered birds, and the souls of drowned and hanged persons. The gradobranitelj used magic to dissipate hail clouds, and to repel devils and the souls of the drowned and hanged persons, who were thought to bring the clouds. He learned this magic from another gradobranitelj. The oblačar ran to and from beneath a hail cloud, fighting against an aždaja, a serpentine demon which flew in the cloud spewing hail on the fields of the oblačar's village. The gradobranitelj is recorded in north-western Serbia, and the oblačar is recorded in the region of Syrmia. It was also believed in some areas that there were women who could eliminate the danger from destructive weather using sorcery. In other respects, these protectors were normal individuals who lived and worked in their communities as others did. ==Bringers of bad weather== Adverse weather such as storms, hail, or torrential rains could quickly devastate fields, orchards, and vineyards, and thus jeopardize the livelihood of farmers in the affected region. They were believed to have been brought by supernatural forces. God let bad weather afflict the people of an area as a punishment for their sins. Angels and some saints could punish in the same way, and the Devil was also thought of as a bringer of such afflictions.Radenković, Ljubinko (2001). \\"Облачари\\" (in Serbian).

Living individuals, such as priests, witches, and those who had acquired certain magical skills were able to direct severe weather to the area whose people they wanted to harm. It was held in Bukovica and Lika that evil persons after death, or even during life, led hail to whatever field they wanted.Ardalić, Vladimir (March 1999). \\"Вукодлак\\" (in Serbian). Буковица: Народни живот и обичаји [Bukovica: folk life and customs]. Project Rastko. Retrieved 2011-02-04. People supplicated God and saints for protection against those calamities, but they also resorted to magic practices. There was a widespread practice of \\"cutting\\" clouds and hail by means of an axe, scythe, sickle, hoe, or knife. Noticing the approach of a hail cloud, farmers would stand in their house yard and wave toward it with one of those implements, or place it with the blade turned toward the cloud. Some chased hail away by firing from rifles or small simple mortars called prangija. They also tried to propitiate the bringer of the elements, as in the custom of placing a dining table with bread and salt on it in the yard. The table could have been used for \\"cutting\\" as well, for which purpose it was placed with its legs directed skywards; the same was done with tripods. In other practices farmers used objects that had been part of annual festivities and family observances, counting on the protective influence of the sacred power with which these objects were consequently imbued. Some of the customs were performed only by women, others only by men, and still others by men and women together. The gender could depend on what object was used, e.g., the scythe was seen as a masculine tool and the sickle as a feminine one, but there were practices for which the gender was irrelevant. Most of these practices were accompanied by a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing in the yard and facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name someone like that from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with something even more appalling that was allegedly present in their village. For example: \\"Back! Back, ala! Here is a bigger ala, beware!\\" or \\"Hey, do not go, prodigy, on prodigy! We have a huge prodigy: here a girl bore a girl, a girl of nine years old! Do not go, prodigy, on prodigy: we have a huge prodigy!\\" These texts often contained the idea of hail clouds as cattle, usually white: \\"O Sava and Nevena, turn back those white cattle! There is no pasture for them here! We only have ashes to put their eyes out!\\" Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind. (Sava and Nevena were a couple who drowned themselves in the Morava River for not having been allowed to marry.) Saint John and Saint Sava also appeared as leaders of cattle/clouds: \\"Saint Sava, turn back your cattle from our village!\\" ==Gradobranitelj== In Pocerina, the region containing Mount Cer in northwestern Serbia, protection from hail was provided by a gradobranitelj (\\"hail defender\\"), who learned the \\"craft\\" from another gradobranitelj. This type of protection included the use of magic. The gradobranitelj in the village of Lipolist was Nikola Stojković, who pursued that vocation for about forty years, until the 1950s. On the night before every bigger feast day, he collected earth and remnants of candles from graves of hanged and drowned persons, flour beneath a millstone, water beneath a water wheel, and dew. Nikola mixed all these ingredients into a mass, from which he made pellets the size of a hazelnut. At the same time he collected dew in a bottle. All the pellets and dew collected from Christmas to Christmas were placed in one bag and one bottle, respectively. At the onset of a thunderstorm, according to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a warp beam on which a twin sister had wound warp yarns, the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew. With this he would run directly toward the cloud, looking neither left nor right, nor watching where he treads. Once on the field, Nikola would stick the scythe into the ground, and say a prayer for lightning to strike. Having gone away from the scythe, he would make the sign of the cross with the warp beam in the direction of the cloud, to break it into quarters. Further beneath it, he would shake the cloud apart using the pellets and dew. There he also addressed the souls of the drowned and hanged leading the cloud, praying them that the \\"rain like this dew\\" fall, and spoke various other prayers. For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers. He was eventually warned by the authorities to stop with these activities, branded backward superstition by them. The gradobranitelj in Bukor in the 1950s was Trivun Selenić. Perceiving that there might be hail, he would go behind the village, wave his arms toward the cloud, and speak the following (the meaning of the italicized words is unclear): \\"Raviše đaviše, nađuniši pistols, the dress on silver, the girl onto the neck! Barbarian's head smashed! I am the first voivode here. The dinner is not served for you here. Go there to those hills. It is served there for you. So dine there.\\" Trivun explained that hail clouds were led by devils accompanied by souls of the drowned and hanged. By the statement \\"I am the first voivode here\\" he would proclaim that he was the principal commander of devils, who consequently had to obey his commands and proceed around his village. Trivun recognized that all this was a sin: both his declaring himself a voivode of devils, and averting hail from his village, because it would fall and make damage at some other place. Miljko Ivković from Dobrići spoke nothing, but went onto the field, took his cap off, made the Sign of the Cross, and put the cap back on. After that, he three times made the sign of the cross with a knife in the direction of the cloud, thus cutting it into quarters, which he then drove apart. In the end he stuck the knife's handle into the ground, the blade turned toward the cloud. ==Oblačar== In the region of Syrmia, people believed that dragons lived on high mountains and flew high in the sky shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense and terrible clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak (\\"cloud\\"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time waving his arms, or holding a stick raised in the direction of the cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When the wind blew the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that he did his best, but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and felt sorry for their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle. ==Sorceress== Some women were thought to be able to eliminate the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the center of her house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: \\"O Radomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields.\\" In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it. ==See also== *Zduhać ==References== Category:Serbian folklore ","title":"Gradobranitelj"},{"id":"35925863","text":"The Shift may refer to: * The Shift (film), a short film by David Trumble * \\"The Shift\\", a song by The Beach Boys from their album Surfin' Safari * The Shift, a 1996 science fiction novel by George Foy * The Shift, a 2009 video by Michael A.

Its original director was Bernardo Romero Pereiro. It was liquidated in 2003, one of the last casualties of the programadoras crisis of the early 2000s. ==History== Founding There were five original owners of Coestrellas, each with 20 percent of the company: Benjumea, Pereiro, Fernando González Pacheco, and two businessmen, Gustavo Cárdenas Giraldo (president and legal representative) and Jorge Ospina (who would soon back out to work at his other programadoras, Prego Televisión and TeVecine — some of Ospina's stake was sold to Cárdenas's wife, Claudia Samper, a public relations expert). Early years In the 1981 bidding cycle, Coestrellas received 4 1/2 hours of programming each week. Sabariedades was the main vehicle that kept it afloat, a ninety-minute variety and game show that aired on Saturday afternoons on Cadena Uno and was presented by Pacheco and Benjumea. It enjoyed popularity among the Colombian public. Other programs included Cuentos y Leyendas, a Monday night program on Cadena Dos, and Siga la Pista, a Sunday show that aired at noon. From R.T.I. Colombia it acquired the rights to air Compre la Orquesta on Sunday nights. Consolidation and development For the 1983 bidding cycle, Coestrellas added an hour of allotted time to reach 5 1/2 hours a week of programs. Sabariedades continued, this time on Cadena Dos. In 1984, Dejémonos de Vainas, a major success for the programadora, premiered on that same channel, airing on Friday nights. In 1985, it partnered with RTI to produce Extorsión, one of the most violent series ever to be screened on Colombian television. Monday nights included Compre la Orquesta, in collaboration with RTI, which may have been one of the most popular TV shows of the decade. The 1987 bidding cycle gave Coestrellas 4 1/2 hours of weekly programming, but the allotted time blocks were not choice cuts. It worked with RCN, swapping time blocks with that programadora to keep Dejémonos de Vainas in a similar time slot until 1989, when it moved to Coestrella's adjacent block thirty minutes earlier on Cadena Uno. Pacheco continued fronting some of Coestrella's most important programs, such as Charlas con Pacheco. Other major programs that Coestrellas broadcast were foreign imports (enlatados), such as CHiPs and Laverne and Shirley. In 1987, Coestrellas founded Producciones Coestrellas, a company that loaned production and post-production equipment to other companies. The 1991 bidding cycle more than doubled Coestrellas's allotted program hours from 4 1/2 to 10, this time all on Canal A. This is when it aired one of its most popular shows, Señora Isabel, which went on to enjoy national and international success. Many of Coestrellas's programs from this period dealt with issues such as alcoholism (in Copas amargas, 1996) and bisexuality (Géminis, 1995). However, El octavo pecado (1997) didn't work out. Changes to the program schedule that took effect at the start of 1998, with a new bidding cycle underway, severely hurt it. Ironically, it went up against RTI's powerful Quiere Cacao, hosted by Pacheco. Ultimately the show was suspended and main actor Jorge Félix Alis left Colómbia. Later years: 1997-2003 Pereiro retired in 1997 to found his own programadora, Producciones Bernardo Romero Pereiro, but it still received 9.5 hours (the minimum possible) of Canal A programming time. While Dejémonos de Vainas continued to enjoy decent ratings, it also was criticized heavily. It was removed from the air, airing for the last time on Sunday, August 16, 1998. Another important presentation for Coestrellas in 1998 (in conjunction with CPS and Proyectamos Televisión) was Caracol's Sábados Felices, as Caracol (soon on its way to private television) was not awarded any time on Saturdays. Coestrellas was one of the programadoras that received RCN's airtime upon RCN becoming a private TV channel in 1998. But later all the companies that had received airtime from Caracol and RCN had to return those blocks to Inravisión. The last gasp for Coestrellas as a traditional programadora came in 2001. Facing the programadoras crisis that had started a few years earlier, it allied with Datos y Mensajes, Mejía & Asociados and Big Bang TV to program Canal A from 1:00pm to 8:00pm in a bid to make the channel more coherent. The results were disastrous, and all programmers involved were affected: the flagship program of Datos y Mensajes, Noticiero TV Hoy, aired its final program at the end of 2001, ending 22 straight years on the air. All four involved programadoras pulled out. In mid-2003, Cárdenas, the only remaining owner, had the company liquidated. It was the last of the Canal A programadoras to leave the air, at which point R.T.I. moved to Canal Uno. In 2006, Mejía & Asociados acquired Coestrellas and operates it mostly as a film library for the programs it produced, though the possibility of a return to program production has not been ruled out.

The schools were built to provide open-air therapy so that fresh air, good ventilation and exposure to the outside would improve the children's health.

The schools were built on the concept that fresh air, good ventilation and exposure to the outside contributed to improved health. The schools were mostly built in areas away from city centers, sometimes in rural locations, to provide a space free from pollution and overcrowding. The creation and design of the schools paralleled that of the tuberculosis sanatoriums, in that hygiene and exposure to fresh air were paramount. Schools were considered to be part of the anti- tuberculosis campaign. ==Daily life== The schools were residential, \\"set up in tents, prefabricated barracks, or repurposed structures, and were run during the summer\\". Children were taught in classrooms designed to be partially (in rooms with large open windows) or fully exposed to outdoors, and sleeping was done outside or in wards that were exposed to the elements. ==Architectural design== École de plein air de Suresnes, France, undated École de plein air de Suresnes, France, undated The architecture of some more advanced open air schools in Britain and Europe was built on the traditional 'pavilion plan' which was also used for sanatoria, with a similar internal layout to that used in hospital architecture, with long window-lined hallways. A distinguished example is the École de plein air de Suresnes not far from Paris, which was built by Eugène Beaudouin and Marcel Lods at Mont Valérien between 1932 and 1935. ==Open-air school movement== Waldschule für kränkliche Kinder (Forest school for sickly children) in Charlottenburg near Berlin (1904) Johannes Duiker: Openluchtschool voor het gezonde kind (Open air school for the healthy child), Amsterdam, 1930 Waldschule für kränkliche Kinder, Charlottenburg Open Air Schools were part of a larger open-air school movement which began in Europe with the creation of the Waldschule für kränkliche Kinder (translated: forest school for sickly children), in Charlottenburg, Germany, near Berlin, in 1904. Built by Walter Spickendorff (born 1864) and founded by the paediatrist Prof. Dr. Bernhard Bendix and Berlin's schools inspector Hermann Neufert it offered \\"open-air therapy\\" to urban youths with pre-tuberculosis as part of an experiment conducted by the International Congresses of Hygiene. Classes were taught and fed in the surrounding forest. The movement quickly caught on throughout Europe and North America; construction of the buildings began in the first decade of the 20th century and carried on until the 1970s. Europe After the opening of the Waldschule Charlottenburg, schools were opened in Belgium in 1904 and continue in Switzerland, Italy, and France in 1907. Schools were also started in Hungary in 1910, and Sweden in 1914. England The first open air school in England was built in London, in 1907 at Bostall Wood, Plumstead by London County Council. Another was built in 1908 by sisters Rachel and Margaret Macmillan, as the \\"first School Clinic\\". In 1914 the sisters organized an open air school in the garden of Evelyn House, Deptford where the Children lived and slept under canvas. By 1937 there were 96 open air day schools in operation throughout Britain, and 53 that were also residential.

The problems associated with these schools outweighed the advantages and by 1922 the open-air school was phased out and more traditional designs reappeared.

The concert series featured performances by Itzhak Perlman, the ARC Ensemble of Canada, the Apollo Ensemble of Amsterdam, Jascha Nemtsov, and Marc-André Hamelin, among others. The concert recordings are not sold, but are available on the website for free. PMH concerts are occasionally broadcast on WETA (FM). ==History== Founded in 2004, Pro Musica Hebraica was the idea of lawyer-turned-artist Robyn Krauthammer, who recognized that there was a tradition of Jewish music that was neglected within the Jewish community and that deserved to be recovered and appreciated by the general public as great music worthy of the concert hall. As her husband (and PMH co-founder), Charles Krauthammer, put it, \\"when people hear ‘Jewish music,’ they think Israeli folk-dancing -- ‘Hava Nagila’—they think of liturgical music, they think of Kol Nidre, they might think of klezmer and that's it. It turns out there's a great, rich tradition of classical Jewish music people just don't know about.” The idea is to bring Jewish experience, feeling, and history – 'Jewish soul,' if you like – as expressed through classical music. They presented the idea of twice yearly concerts of these neglected masterpieces to Kennedy Center Director Michael Kaiser, who offered his encouragement and support. In December 2012, Kaiser said that the Kennedy Center \\"is enjoying a wonderful collaborative relationship with Pro Musica Hebraica. Their concerts here are always well received, and it's been great to see the company grow.” Pro Musica Hebraica was formed and made its debut in the Terrace Theatre at the Kennedy Center on April 10, 2008 with a concert featuring Itzhak Perlman and the Juilliard players honoring the 100th anniversary of the St. Petersburg school of Jewish composers. ==Mission== Pro Musica Hebraica defines its mission as aspiring “to expose our audience to the magnificent range of Jewish music and to present Jewish composers not as cultural curiosities or ethnic heroes, but as passionate modern artists who embrace the challenge of expressing their Jewishness through the creative medium of music.” As the founders emphasize, this mission is flexible, not focusing on a single region or style, and less on DNA than sensibility—an attachment, feeling, or concern with Jewish experience Jewish destiny. One of Pro Musica Hebraica’s primary goals is education – training a new generation of musicians to learn the works while leading new audiences to appreciate the Jewish tradition and Jewish music. \\"If only a few of these compositions end up in the canon,\\" Charles Krauthammer says, \\"it will be a great achievement.\\" ==Inaugural concert== Pro Musica Hebraica’s first concert (on April 10, 2008) featured musicians from the Juilliard School and Itzhak Perlman as a special guest. It celebrated the centenary of the 1908 Society for Jewish Folk Music in St. Petersburg, a group of self-defined Jewish composers from Russia and the first association devoted to Jewish musical traditions. Responding to the challenge of European nationalism, the St. Petersburg Society “gave rise to what would become known as Jewish art music—music that deliberately melded Western and Russian classical music with Hasidic melodies, Yiddish folk songs and synagogue chants, capturing the sounds of the towns and villages of the Pale of Settlement.” As Charles Krauthammer explained, “It's music that's either consciously or unconsciously drawn from the folk, the klezmer, the liturgical, the shtetl,” and reinterpreted in the spirit of “modern classical sensibility.” The concert presented the forgotten works of composers Joel Engel, Solomon Rosowsky, and Alexander Krein. The embrace of Jewish music by these composers influenced the likes of Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. ==Reception== Reviews of the concert series have been quite positive. For example, in a review of the inaugural concert, the Washington Post wrote that PMH’s inaugural concert was “an auspicious start” to an organization that is “breathing new life into lost Jewish music.” PMH’s Fall 2008 concert—which featured the performance of the ARC Ensemble of Toronto and the music of “last century’s least-known Jewish geniuses,” Mieczsław Weinberg—was called a “powerful performance.” PMH’s Fall 2010 concert—which focused on the work of Karel Berman, Paul Ben-Haim, and Walter Braunfels—was lauded as “enthralling mix” that “riveted the audience's attention.” Its Fall 2011 concert, which included works by Alexander Krein, was described as reflecting “romantic longing and peasant energy, the imperatives of both dance and religion and a reverence for history, all couched in the modality and the emphatic rhythms that characterize so much of what we recognize as a Jewish musical tradition.” Its most recent, Spring 2012 concert, featuring Marc-Andre Hamelin, was praised by Anne Midgette, chief media critic for the Washington Post, as “an intimate and engaging concert” with a “refreshingly intriguing program.” She wrote: “Hamelin did an outstanding job bringing across a lot of unfamiliar music to the audience,” adding: “Hamelin proceeded to play [the second encore] so engagingly that the audience was laughing along with some of the more extreme variations…and jumped to its feet when he was done.” Music critic Stephen Brooke called the Fall 2012 concert \\"a blazing, larger-than- life performance that seemed to celebrate the triumph of the human spirit, even from the depths of chaos.\\" Reviewing PMH's first ever winter-time concert featuring Cantor Netanel Hershtik, Joan Reinthaler \\"A superstar cantor opens Pro Musica Hebraica with strength and agility.... The program ranged from music for the liturgy to music for the theater, but all of it embodied that potent combination of sinuous, Eastern modality and heart-on-the-sleeve 19th- century romantic operatic drama that can convey both sorrow and exultation with so much dramatic juice.\\" ==Composers== * Joseph Achron (1886-1943) * Charles-Valentin Alkan (1780–1855) * Anonymous (Dio Clemenza e Rigore, Hoshana Rabbah in Casale Monferrato, 1733) * Paul Ben-Haim (1897-1984) * Karel Berman (1919-1995) * Ernest Bloch (1880-1959) * Walter Braunfels (1882-1954) * Abraham Caceres (fl. 1740) * Julius Chajes (1910-1985) * Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) * Joel Engel (1868-1927) * Meir Finkelstein (born 1951) * Osvaldo Golijov (born 1960) * Mikhail Gnesin (1883-1957) * Yossi Green (born 1955) * Erich Korngold (1897-1957) * Alexander Krein (1883-1951) * Louis Lewandowski (1821-1894) * Benedetto Giacomo Marcello (1686-1739) * Michel Michelet (1894-1995) * Darius Milhaud (1892-1974) * Julius Oscar (1903-1986) * Moishe Oysher (1906-1958c) * Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) * Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) * Solomon Rosowsky (1878-1962) * Salamone Rossi (c. 1570-1630) * Franz Schubert (1797-1828) * Jacob Schoenberg (1900-1956) * Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) * Yisroel Schorr (1886-1935) * Yehuda Sharet (1901-1975) * Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) * Erwin Schulhoff (1894-1942) * Joachim Stutschewsky (1891-1982) * Alexandre Tansman (1897-1986) * Alexander Veprik (1889-1958) * Jacob Weinberg (1879-1956) * Mieczsław Weinberg (1919-1996) * Juliusz Wolfsohn (1880-1944) * Mordechai Yardeni (1908-1992) * Leo Zeitlin (1884-1930) * Aleksandr Zhitomirskii (1881-1937) ==Musicians== * Amernet Quartet * Apollo Ensemble of Amsterdam * Ariel Quartet * ARC Ensemble of Toronto * Julian Arp * Biava Quartet * Rachel Calloway * Michael Caterisano * Tibi Cziger * Alexander Fiterstein * Mark Glanville * Hampton Synagogue Choir * Netanel Hershtik * Alexander Knapp * Alexander Lipowski * Alan Mason * Margaret Mezzacappa * Jascha Nemtsov * N-E-W Trio * Itzhak Perlman * Robert Pomakov * Frank Reinecke * Andrew Roitstein * Rohan De Silva * Konstantin Soukhovetski * Alexander Tall * Orion Weiss ==ReferencesCategory:Organizations established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in the United States Category:Music of Washington, D.C.

Its aim was to show that the security functionality of Windows NT could be extended to support users handling classified information. == Security Model == Purple Penelope implemented the Domain Based Security model K J Hughes, Domain Based Security: enabling security at the level of applications and business processes which was developed for the UK Ministry of Defence by DRA to take advantage of using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software to implement secure systems. Within a security domain access controls are designed to stop users from accessing material without a need-to-know and to prevent them making mistakes when handling classified data, while controls over sharing information between security domains are more stringent and defend against attacks and hold the users to account for their actions. The model calls for discretionary security labelling and role based access controls within a domain and user-sanctioned release of information from the domain coupled with application oriented accounting and audit. == Security Functionality == Purple Penelope extended Windows NT and the Microsoft Office application suite. The main features were a system of discretionary labelling and a trusted path for authorising security critical actions. The discretionary labelling mechanism added security labels to files, application windows and the clipboard. The user's desktop display was augmented with a stripe across the top of the screen. This showed the security label of the application window that had focus and the security label of the clipboard. When data was copied to the clipboard the clipboard label was set to that of the source application window. When data was copied from the clipboard the destination application window's label \\"floated up\\" to the label of the new data. The user was free to change the label of a window or the clipboard at any time. User's also had access to a shared file store. Files in the shared file store were labelled and when they were opened by an application the application's window label was set to that of the file. The shared file store could not be written directly by an application. The user was able to copy files to the shared file store but they were required to confirm the action using a trusted path interface that was inaccessible to applications. == Legacy == The software created by the Purple Penelope project was licensed to Argus Systems where it was developed into a product called Deep Purple. The software also laid the foundation for QinetiQ's SyBard Suite product.

They are usually very motivated, with a high drive towards completing the job at a fast pace with efficience (action-oriented) who are comfortable with taking the initiative, regardless of the boundaries that the organisation or the entrepreneurial world imposes over them, they are in a constant pursuit of an innovative product or service. Their behaviour can be characterised through the ability of thinking outside the box which includes smart and clear minded risk-taking with an emphasis on leadership, these traits combined are also what make a successful entrepreneur. == \\"Intrapreneurship\\" in practice == The main difference between an internal entrepreneur (intrapreneur) and an entrepreneur is the environment, which represents the sphere in which they work. An entrepreneur's aim in general terms is to create a successful organisation, while an internal entrepreneur on the other hand has to find solutions to existing problems within the company and provide improvements for the benefit of the existing organisation. Forbes Insights studies state that internal entrepreneurs comprise approximately one in every six executives in Europe. They tend to be innovators with specific ideas and a mind set towards the creation of original plans for the prosperity of the company. The task of an internal entrepreneur is to push the idea to a corporate bureaucracy which may be inhospitable to new ideas. A significant portion of current entrepreneurs were once internal entrepreneurs who weren't satisfied with their work or the limits put on innovation. Some companies have attempted to accommodate the idea of internal entrepreneurs, under the idea that it is in their own benefit. As a result, some large organisation I\\"nnovation departments\\" led by a \\"Chief Innovation Officer\\". Since the mid 2000s, this trend has grown. As of 2014, the majority of consulting companies have innovation offices, according to The Harvard Business Review. According to statistics published by Forbes in 2011, companies have a roughly similar proportion of internal entrepreneurs regardless of size or revenue: * 12% intrapreneurs in organisations with 10-49 employees * 25% intrapreneurs in organisations with 500-999 employees * 20% intrapreneurs in organisation with the revenue of $100+ million. == Traits of Internal Entrepreneurs == Some key traits that influence entrepreneurs are: * Money Is Not the Measurement - their determination is not driven by the money, payment is a sign that they are doing their job well; however, they are mainly motivated by influence with freedom. * Strategic Scanning - constant curiosity is what makes an internal entrepreneur stand out, they keep learning new things and applying them within their area of knowledge which benefits both themselves and the organisation. * Greenhousing - people are not open to new and radical ideas, therefore internal entrepreneurs upon coming up with a new idea tend to keep it and let it flourish in their mind so when the right time comes, they can share it with the rest. * Visual Thinking - they don't act on an idea or solution immediately, they weigh the pros and cons, try to come up with more solutions. They have to go through a brain storming, mind mapping and designing process to achieve what they need. * Pivoting - stands for shifting radically from the current strategic method of a business and it is one of the key characteristics of any internal entrepreneur. This means that they are open for change if it is in the benefit of the company, be it in long or short run. * Authenticity and Integrity - internal entrepreneurs are familiar with both confidence and humility, their wide aspect and range of understanding allows them to act efficiently, makes them smart risk-takers. == Examples == Sony: Ken Kutaragi, in the position of a junior employee at Sony used to spend his free time with his daughters in order to improve the Nintendo device. Regardless of the fact that the staff at Sony were against his work, Ken was lucky enough to get a senior employee's attention. This resulted in the beginning and creation one of the Sony's most valued products at the market right now, Sony PlayStation. At the moment PlayStation is one of the leaders in gaming industry, being one of the best selling consolses - it's a clear result of success and innovation from \\"intrapreneurship\\". 3M: Dr. Spencer Silver was trying to create a strong adhesive with the aim of using it in aerospace technology. His research proved to be unsuccessful as he accidentally created a light adhesive that would stick to surfaces without leaving any trace after removal. This is an example of strategic scanning where instead of getting rid of the idea, he decided to keep working on it and improving it further for other uses. After years of trying to push the idea forwards, he joined forces with Art Fry (a fellow scientist at 3M), together they came with the idea of Post-IT notes which are actively used until now. == See also == * Intrapreneurship * Entrepreneurship * Chief Innovation Officer ==References== Category:Business terms Category:Entrepreneurship ","title":"Internal entrepreneur"},{"id":"35926178","text":"Ernest William Hawkes (July 19, 1883 – March 13, 1957)California, Death Index, 1940-1997 was an American anthropologist best known for his work studying the indigenous peoples of Alaska and northern Canada.

The disc florets bloom yellow and turn purple. ==Taxonomy== This species may be divided into two subspecies and five varieties: * S. lanceolatum subsp. hesperium ** S. lanceolatum var. hesperium - northern Canada, western United States and northwestern Mexico * S. lanceolatum subsp. lanceolatum ** S. lanceolatum var. hirsuticaule - great lakes region of Canada and the United States ** S. lanceolatum var. interior - eastern Canada and northeastern United States ** S. lanceolatum var. latifolium - eastern Canada and eastern United States ** S. lanceolatum var. lanceolatum - eastern and central Canada and United States, also introduced to Europe The hybrid of this species with Symphyotrichum novi-belgii, known as Sympyotrichum ×salignum, originates in cultivation but is now naturalised in Europe. Hybrids have also been reported with S. boreale, S. laeve, S. lateriflorum, S. puniceum and S. racemosum. Symphyotrichum lanceolatum was formerly included in the large genus Aster as Aster lanceolatus. However, this broad circumscription of Aster is polyphyletic and the North American asters are now mostly classified in Symphyotrichum and several other genera. ==Distribution and Habitat== Symphyotrichum lanceolatum is native to much of Canada excepting the far north, to most of the United States, and to northwestern Mexico in Baja California, Sonora and Chihuahua. The species has been introduced and naturalised in many parts of Europe, from Belgium to Serbia to Latvia. In its native range, Symphyotrichum lanceolatum occurs in a wide variety of mostly moist, open habitats, including riparian areas, meadows and ditches. As an introduced species in Europe, it occurs in disturbed man-made habitats, as well as in riparian areas as an invasive species. ==Ecology== Large clone of S. lanceolatum prior to flowering, Ontario, Canada In addition to dispersal by wind-blown seed, Symphyotrichum lanceolatum spreads extensively by rhizomes to create large clones. Although these clones do not dominate habitats in North America, growing in association with grasses, goldenrods and other asters, in Europe it is an invasive species that excludes native plants in riparian habitats. This invasiveness has been linked to allelopathic compounds in S. lanceolatum tissue, and their effect on native European plants. Viable seed production in Europe seems to be limited, and the species largely spreads there via rhizomes. The species is visited by a wide variety of pollinating insects, including bees, flies, moths and wasps. Cross-fertilisation is usually required to produce viable seed, and as such large clones may have low seed production. Several gall midge species are known to form galls on S. lanceolatum, including Rhopalomyia asteriflorae and Asteromyia paniculata. Leaf-mining insects known to feed on this species include Anoplitis inaequalis, Agromyza curvipalpis, Phytomyza albiceps, Microrphopala xerene, and Sumitrosis inaequalis. Younger instars of Gorgone Checkerspot caterpillars will feed on Symphyotrichum lanceolatum. ==Uses== Symphyotrichum lanceolatum may be a minor weed in agricultural fields. Within its native range, the species was used by indigenous peoples for a variety of medicinal purposes. In the American Southwest, the Zuni people used this plant for wounds and nosebleed. The Iroquois in what is now Eastern Canada used it to treat fever.Symphyotrichum lanceolatum. Native American Ethnobotany. University of Michigan, Dearborn. Symphyotrichum lanceolatum is also cultivated as an ornamental garden plant and may be used in the cut flower industry. ==References * lanceolatum Category:Flora of the United States Category:Flora of Canada Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine ","title":"Symphyotrichum lanceolatum"},{"id":"35926389","text":"Kalateh-ye Mian Rud may refer to: * Kalateh-ye Now, Arabkhaneh * Mian Rud, South Khorasan ","title":"Kalateh-ye Mian Rud"},{"id":"35926398","text":" The Colyaer Gannet S100 is a Spanish ultralight flying boat, designed and produced by Colyaer of Portonovo.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 134.

Indian Under 23 National Team Papas in 2012 Papas went to India upon the invitation of India FA Technical Director Rob Baan with a view to become the AIFF-FIFA Academy Head Coach based in Vashi, this would be the first of many Academies made under AIFF and FIFA for under-14 players in India. Papas stated that he came to India because \\"I received an invitation to join All India Football Federation from Technical Director Rob Baan who had implemented a philosophy in Australia which focused on the total restructure of the Youth Development System.\\"and that \\"India is a country which is waiting to make its mark in World Football. Hence, the AIFF have joined forces with FIFA and PSV Eindhoven and have very big plans to shape the future by placing a major focus on the development of their Youth System.

He was admiral of the Hanseatic fleet at the Battle of Helsingborg and was tried and beheaded after losing this battle. Execution of Johann Wittenborg (from the chronicle of Heinrich Rehbein, 1620) Wittenborg was the son of the Lübeck citizen and merchant Hermann Wittenborg. From his early days, trips to Flanders (probably Bruges) and England are reported. As a merchant, he traded cloth, grain and fur from the Baltic area to London and Flanders. His business is documented in a traditional book of accounts from the years 1346-1359, which was already started by his father. As Mayor of Lübeck and the free port's representative in the Hanseatic League, Wittenborg was made supreme commander over the Hanseatic fleet in the war with King Waldemar IV of Denmark in 1362. The fleet met the Danish fleet off Helsinborg in the Øresund strait and lost 12 ships in the ensuing action, at least partly because Wittenborg had put too many of his sailors ashore to fight the Danes on land. On his return to Lübeck Wittenborg was relieved of his duties and imprisoned. Brought before the Hanseatic Council in January 1363, he was condemned to death for the Øresund defeat and \\"other reasons\\". He was beheaded in Lübeck market place in August or September 1363 and buried with the Dominicans of the Lübeck Castle Monastery. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of the Lübeck councilor Arnold von Bardewik, and had six or seven children. ==References== * Emil Ferdinand Fehling: Lübeckische Ratslinie, 1925 Nr. 366 * Philippe Dollinger: Die Hanse, S. 223 ff, * A.

As a result of this, Lisbon, the second oldest town in Ohio, played an important part in the development of Ohio, which had been granted statehood in 1803. The district features a number of commercial and residential buildings which were constructed during the period from 1810–1900.

By some estimations, vaccines can have the second highest impact on a pediatric practice's finances. As a result of these and other factors, many pediatricians have joined group purchasing organizations as a way to leverage their purchasing power and take advantage of the reduction in prices for vaccines and other products. While this aggregation of buying power allows pediatricians to negotiate lower prices for products, concerns have been raised by economists and consumer groups that the bundling contracts that require pediatricians to buy all of their vaccines from one company inhibit competition, impede the introduction of new vaccines, reduce physician choice and, ultimately, drive up the costs of vaccines to physicians, the government, and taxpayers. In response to this criticism, pharmaceutical companies have stated bundling is one of the options available to pediatricians, and the contracts are lawful and provide real value. == Public health concerns == On January 3, 2012, the economic consulting firm Compass Lexecon published a white paper on the Social Science Research Network titled “The Effects of Bundled Discounts on Entry in the Market for Pediatric Vaccines.” The paper stated the strategic goal of pediatric bundling is to make it more difficult for rival vaccine makers to enter a new market. The paper said that the long-term effects of bundling are: *The development of fewer new vaccines *Fewer vaccine suppliers *A decrease in the likelihood of improving current vaccines *A risk of vaccine shortages due to dependence on a small number of manufacturers and suppliers. The authors concluded vaccine bundling is inconsistent with the goals of the National Vaccine Program Office and at odds with public health. A separate analysis, funded by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, concluded vaccine bundling and other factors could result in elevated prices, stifled investment, innovation in the vaccine sector, and degradation in the quality, reliability and availability of existing and future pediatric vaccines. == FTC scrutiny == Possible legal issues with the marketing of vaccine bundles by Sanofi Pasteur Inc and Merck & Co. were first brought to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July 2010 by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Subsequently, the American Antitrust Institute wrote to the FTC in November 2011, requesting an investigation into anticompetitive practices in the pediatric vaccine market. In both letters the restrictive nature and possible penalties for breaking the bundling contracts were highlighted as the reason for requesting an investigation. A third letter to the FTC sent on March 19, 2012, cited a former Sanofi employee to support allegations that the companies are engaged in anticompetitive bundling practices. In response, both companies stated the agreements are well intended and lawful, telling The Hill that the contracts meet customer needs and maximize immunizations rates which protect public health. The FTC has acknowledged it received the letters, but does not comment on investigations unless wrongdoing is found. == Antitrust lawsuits == Two class action lawsuits have been filed charging Sanofi Pasteur Inc. with violating U.S. antitrust laws, as a result of its bundling practices. The suits challenge Sanofi's alleged “anticompetitive scheme” to maintain its monopoly in the U.S. meningitis vaccine market. These lawsuits have since been consolidated. In both cases, plaintiffs were parties to exclusionary contracts with Sanofi Pasteur to purchase vaccines. Each plaintiff wanted to purchase a different meningitis vaccine manufactured by Novartis that they thought to be superior. According to documents, if they purchased this vaccine and therefore did not use Sanofi's pediatric vaccines exclusively, they would have to pay Sanofi 15 to 34 percent higher prices for all Sanofi vaccines. The lawsuits claim that, due to Sanofi's prominence in the vaccine market, the contracts make it virtually impossible for competitors to gain any market share. Sanofi responded that there are alternatives to all of the vaccines in the bundle, and that Novartis already has 20 percent of the market share for its competing vaccine. In defending its practices, Sanofi contended the plaintiffs did not claim they were coerced by the bundling into not purchasing other vaccines, and did not have standing to sue because the bundling contracts were negotiated by physician buying groups, not the individual doctors themselves, and therefore only those groups would have standing. The cases are currently pending in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. ==See also== *Group purchasing organizations *Pharmaceutical marketing *Pharmaceutical industry *List of pharmaceutical companies == References  *Sanofi Pasteur Counterclaim *Sanofi Pasteur Motion to Dismiss Category:Vaccination Category:Pediatrics in the United States ","title":"Vaccine bundling"},{"id":"35926507","text":"Kalateh-ye Sarvar (, also Romanized as Kalāteh-ye Sarvar) is a village in Arabkhaneh Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Typically, his works address the Great Depression, World War II, and the impact of technology and politics on individuals and their surroundings. Landau's works can be found in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, and the National Gallery. ==Biography== Landau was born December 17, 1917, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the age of three he began drawing everything around him. When he was 12, he began studying at the Graphic Sketch Club, now the Samuel Fleisher Memorial. At the age of 17, Landau's illustrations for Kipling's Jungle Book won a competition in Scholastic Magazine. He won the competition the following year as well. In 1935, Landau received a scholarship from the Museum School of Industrial Art (today the University of the Arts) to study illustration, printmaking and painting. After his graduation in 1939, Landau moved to New York City where he experimented with a variety of styles, treatments and media. His first phase as a professional artist included illustrating books and magazines. In 1943, Landau was drafted into the armed forces, serving two years overseas in the Mediterranean Theater. In the army, Landau served in a number of capacities which utilized his artistic talents. His service in Italy included work as the art editor, photographer, and reporter of At Ease, a special services magazine. After his discharge in 1946, Landau used the G.I. Bill to further study art. Landau spent a year (1948-1949) at New York's New School for Social Research before moving to Paris with his wife, Frances, and young son to study at the Academie Julian and the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere. While in Paris, Landau met printmaker Leonard Baskin, who taught him the medium of woodcuts. From 1954-1957 Landau taught at the Philadelphia College of Art before moving to Pratt Institute where he would teach for over 20 years. During his time at Pratt, Landau helped to establish the University Without Walls program, in which students worked closely with instructors to gain hands-on experience. In 1975, Landau became a faculty member of the Artist Teacher Institute, a 10-day summer residency program sponsored by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. In addition to his art and teaching, Landau was very involved in the community. He was active in many different organizations including: Alliance for Arts Education, American Humanist Association, Association for Humanistic Psychology, Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament, International Arts Association, Jewish Federation, Linkage Project, New Jersey School for the Arts, Printmaking Council, and World Futures Society. In 1974 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1979. Landau and his wife Frances lived in Roosevelt, New Jersey as part of a small community of artists. There he built a geodesic dome which was created as an art studio. His wife died in 1993 of Alzheimer's Disease. They had two sons, Jonas and Stefan. Jacob Landau died on November 24, 2001, at the age of 85, and is buried in the Roosevelt Cemetery near his friends Ben Shahn and Gregorio Prestopino. After his death, the Jacob Landau Institute was formed to preserve his legacy, share his unique philosophy of education, and nurture individual artists. ==Artwork== Landau's art communicates his consciousness of humankind's predicament, its beauty and its horror. Growing up during the Great Depression and having been profoundly affected by The Holocaust, Landau's work expresses the self-inflicted human turmoil of the 20th century. He often drew from biblical or literary sources, presenting unpleasant topics in a way that emphasized the unlimited possibilities of peace and greater understanding. Existential philosopher Walter Kauffman described Landau's work as \\"unmistakenly modern and at the same time in the tradition of Goya and Blake.\\" Landau's works can be found in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. ==Select exhibitions== Landau's work has been exhibited in over 30 one-man and 200 group shows, both nationally and internationally. *\\"Le Drame Quotidien,\\" Galerie Paul Lebar, Paris, April–May 1952 *\\"The Insiders,\\" Cober Gallery, New York City, November 8–26, 1960 *\\"Three Artists View the Human Condition,\\" New Jersey State Museum, June–September 1968 *\\"Human Concern/Personal Torment,\\" Whitney Museum, New York City, October–November 1969 *\\"Kingdom of Dreams,\\" Associated American Artists, New York City, February 2–21, 1970 *\\"Jacob Landau: The Graphic Work,\\" New Jersey State Museum, June–August 1981 *\\"Jacob Landau: A Print Retrospective,\\" Philadelphia Art Alliance, September–October 1981 *\\"International Printmaking Invitational,\\" The Art Gallery, California State College at San Bernardino, April–May 1983 *\\"From the Capital to the Cape: A Celebration of New Jersey Artists,\\" Noyes Museum, Oceanville, NJ, June–September 1983 *\\"Dreams and Nightmares: Utopian Visions in Modern Art,\\" Hirschhorn Museum, Washington, DC, 1983–1984 *\\"The Prophetic Quest,\\" Temple Judea Museum of Kenneth Israel, Elkins Park, PA, March–June 1995 *\\"Old Man Mad about Drawing,\\" Monmouth University, West Long Branch, NJ, February 7–26, 1997 *\\"Unlimited Possibilities: Jacob Landau Works on Paper 1950 – 2000,\\" Erdman Gallery, Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton, NJ, October–December 2001 ==Book illustration== In addition to his numerous paintings, lithographs, sketches and drawings, Landau illustrated books.

They suffered great hardships on the journey as they had no food, clothes or place to stay. The soldiers drove them forward by beating them with stinging nettles. Children died of cold and they were not allowed to be cremated or buried. So the parents had to throw the dead bodies into the Tama Koshi River. Page 18.

IRBs are used to provide time-shared access to control radio transceivers or receivers, notably for use by licensed Amateur Radio operators. ==History== The United States Air Force pioneered the use of IRBs with the modernization of the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) in 2000. This was followed closely by the introduction of several solutions publicly available in early 2000s by * Keith Lamonica (W7DXX) and Bob Arnold (N2JEU), using an HTML form, * Stan Schretter (W4MQ), using a locally installed client and UDP, * and Earl Claus (KB2LWS), using Flash, Remote Scripting, and XML. ==Technology== Though implementations vary, an IRB consists of several parts: # Computer-controlled radio (\\"CCR\\") transceiver or receiver # Computer connected to the CCR (the server) # Antenna control interface to allow the server to control the antenna position # An Internetwork # Computer operated by a Radio Operator or Control Operator (the client) # Radio Control Data Stream # Audio Stream Interfaces # Amplifier Control A user interface allows the remove user to control all of the CCR's and antenna's key operating parameters, and can range from a simple HTML form hosted by the server (and accessed from the client using a web browser) to a sophisticated client-side program presenting the user with a graphical reproduction of a well-known physical radio front panel. The IRB protocol utilizes a control data stream and an audio data stream. The control data stream can be any protocol that will support compact data transfer, while the audio data stream generally uses existing audio streaming protocols. Control operator An IRB Control Operator is the end-user operating the radio, remotely. System administrator An IRB System Administrator is the person who administers the IRB server, usually the system's owner or creator. The system administrator is responsible for managing system operators to assure that any control operator given access to the IRB is properly licensed to operate it. ==Legal considerations== An IRB uses the Internet as a long microphone cord. The Internet is not governed by the FCC Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 Part 97 governs remote control of Amateur Radio stations. ==Advantages and disadvantages== The IRB's primary advantage over traditional radio-link radio base stations is flexibility: the IRB can be controlled by any device with an internet connection. The IRB allows a group of users to share the cost of a radio base station and to time-share its usage. Also, while early IRBs only allowed for audio transmission, current developments allow any signal mode to be used, which opens the door to further experimentation by the amateur radio community. The primary disadvantage of the IRB is security. Due to secure flaws present in any internet software implementation, it is feasible for an unauthorized System Operator to gain access to an IRB. Further, the cost of operating the IRB, including the electricity costs for the station itself and the server computer, along with the cost of the internet connection needed to keep the IRB connected to its users, can be prohibitive. ==References== Category:Amateur radio ","title":"Internet remote base"},{"id":"35926636","text":"The 1932 Nice Circuit Race (officially the I Circuit de Vitesse de Nice) was a Grand Prix motor race held at Nice on 31 July 1932.

It is a boggy, marshy area that has not been built on. The reserve comprises lowland raised bogs, which were extensively exploited for peat, and now feature the characteristics of peat cutting, and several acres of deciduous woodland mainly made up of silver birch. The area is a sanctuary for wildlife, including rabbits, deer and foxes. The Lenzie Peat Railway was a narrow gauge railway which ran on Lenzie Moss serving the peat trade. ==Threats of development== In 2012 locals feared that the nature reserve was under threat after Lenzie Rugby Football Club revealed plans to develop land that borders Lenzie Moss. A local resident said: “Lenzie Moss is a unique asset and people go there for peace and tranquillity. Any development will destroy the place.” In 1989 the rugby club had applied for planning permission for 45 houses to be built on the moss, this led to opposition and petitions from locals. Protests against developing the site have attracted hundreds of local people. The Friends of Lenzie Moss is a group formed in 1985 by enthusiasts dedicated to the conservation of Lenzie Moss. ==Incidents== There are ongoing problems with gangs of youths gathering on the moss. These include drinking and drug taking (and the associated littering) as well as instances of inter-gang violence. In July 2012 A 16 year old male was charged with attempted murder after a boy of 14 was hospitalised after being stabbed on the area of the Moss near Alexandra Avenue. == References == Specific General *http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/local- headlines/residents_warn_over_moss_flooding_dangers_1_356694 *http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/local- headlines/moss_open_day_combines_fun_and_learning_1_364071 ==External links== *Friends of Lenzie Moss *save Lenzie moss action group *Video and commentary on Lenzie Moss Category:Lenzie Category:Local nature reserves in Scotland Category:Protected areas of East Dunbartonshire ","title":"Lenzie Moss"},{"id":"35926766","text":"The Streetsweeper, Vol. 2 is the second studio album by American DJ, DJ Kay Slay, released on March 30, 2004, through Columbia Records. ==Background== The album was the follow-up to Kay Slay's The Streetsweeper, Vol. 1 released the previous year. ==Production== This album followed the same format as the last, several of hip-hop's biggest artists, including 50 Cent and Eminem, perform songs produced by prominent hip hop producers ranging from Swizz Beatz to Kanye West.

The title \\"Rosso Malpelo\\" is Sicilian for \\"evil redhead\\", a nickname which combines Rosso (red) with Malpelo (evil hair), as Sicilians believed people with red hair were malicious and had an evil disposition. The story, written in 1878, is set in Verga's native Sicily and reflects the social and economic conditions endured by the poor working classes in Southern Italy at the time. The story is a fine example of Italian Realism or Verismo, and is written in Verga's concise, impersonal and distinctly Sicilian style, manipulating the narrative voice into something more akin to the oral tradition. His subject matter and scientific style has led to comparison to Émile Zola's more widely known book, Germinal. This short story appeared for the first time on Il fanfulla, an Italian journal, in 1878, and was later published in 1880 in a collection of other works by Verga, from his 1879–1880s \\"Vita dei Campi\\". The novella is widely known and appreciated in Italy, providing an interesting quasi- historical documentation of the condition of the South following the unification of Italy. The book was adapted into a film in 2007, with a title of Little Boy Red. Sicily: Carusi (child workers) at the mouth of a sulphur mine shaft in (1899). ==Key characters== * Rosso Malpelo * Misciu * The pit owner * Ranocchio ==Plot== A sand mine in Mascalucia, Sicily. Rosso Malpelo, a mischievous red-haired youth, is routinely beaten and picked upon for his assumed nastiness, as manifest in his red hair. He works in the salt mine with his father, Misciu, who is killed by a collapse whilst removing a support on request from the pit owner. Malpelo is deeply affected by the loss of his father as he was the only person looking out for him against a torrent of abuse from other workers in the mine. After two days however, he has to return to the mine. Vulnerable, Malpelo begins to develop contorted philosophies of life surrounding his experiences. He takes to beating one of the pit donkeys and taking revenge on those weaker than him, thus worsening his reputation to such an extent that he is blamed for every misfortune. Malpelo accepts the subsequent beatings without question. One day a new boy starts in the mine. A former bricklayer's labourer, he is no longer able to work above ground having fallen from a bridge. He subsequently walks with a limp and is known in the mine as Ranocchio, or frog. Malpelo takes Ranocchio under his wing, giving him a share of his food seemingly for protection and the right to beat him himself, in order, in Malpelo's eyes, to toughen him up. Malpelo continues to be beaten, and is no longer welcome at home, apart from when he is delivering his pay. He is depicted as becoming more savage as he laments being born into the mine. Soon Misciu's corpse is found. At this point, Malpelo takes a morbid interest in using his father's tools and wearing his clothes. He also cryptically denounces the existence of a heaven. Not long after, Ranocchio is taken ill and dies. Malpelo is left without anyone who cares for him, and finally, when asked to undertake a particularly dangerous piece of work, he resigns himself to his fate. He walks into the mine, never to be seen again. His name becomes a legend amongst the miners, who fear that some day he will emerge from the mine with his \\"red hair and grey, evil eyes\\". ==Significance== In dealing with the working poor in Italy, Verga was exposing the continued backwardness of the South in Unified Italy. Indeed, at this time eminent politicians were largely Northern and were not prepared to reform the institutions of the South; the Prime Minister at the time, Agostino Depretis, was from Lombardy. Equally, the book can be read as an early piece of social theory or research, assessing that the social problems suffered by many in these poor communities were a consequence of their environment. ==See also== *Verismo *I Malavoglia *Émile Zola *Germinal ==References== Category:Literary realism ","title":"Rosso Malpelo"},{"id":"35926788","text":"Ian Alexander Wishart (born 25 December 1948) is a former English cricketer.

Hot air and cold air interchanges their places lead to flow of air. As it has force with motion, It carries kinetic energy. This is called wind energy * Energy - an indirectly observed quantity, often understood as the ability a physical system has to do work on other physical systems. ** Renewable energy - energy which comes from natural resources which are naturally replenished. * Natural resource - materials and components (something that can be used) that can be found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level). A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water, and air, as well as a living organism such as a fish, or it may exist in an alternate form which must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores, oil, and most forms of energy. ** Renewable resource - natural resource with the ability to reproduce through biological or natural processes and are replenished with the passage of time. == Source of wind energy == * Atmosphere - a layer of gases that may surround a material body of sufficient mass, and that is held in place by the gravity of the body. ** Wind - the flow of gases on a large scale. Wind is composed of: *** Air - the gas found in the Earth's atmosphere. Air is mainly composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, which together constitute the major gases of the atmosphere. **** Gas - one of the three classical states of matter (the others being liquid and solid). *** Motion - change in position of an object (including particles) with respect to time. Motion is typically described in terms of velocity, acceleration, displacement and time. Flow is a type of motion. == History of wind energy == * History of wind power - has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind. ** Maritime history - The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of sail construction.Hatshepsut oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and with several sails. Various others exist, also. *** History of sails - The earliest known depictions of sails are from ancient Egypt around 3200 BCE, where reed boats sailed upstream against the River Nile's current. **** Age of Sail - the period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships, lasting from the 16th to the mid 19th century. == Wind power == Wind power - conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy. * Variable renewable energy - any source of renewable energy that is not continuously available due to some factor outside direct control. The variable source may be quite predictable, for example, tidal power, but cannot be dispatched to meet the demand of a power system. * Environmental impact of wind power - relatively minor compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. * Wind power forecasting - estimating the expected production of wind farms. * Wind resource assessment - the process by which wind power developers estimate the future energy production of a wind farm.  Types of wind power  * Wind turbine - a turbine that converts wind energy into mechanical energy. * Windmill - a machine which converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. ** Windpump - a windmill used for pumping water, either as a source of fresh water from wells, or for draining low-lying areas of land. * Sail - any type of surface intended to move a vessel, vehicle or rotor by being placed in a wind - in essence a propulsion wing  Wind power industry  Wind power industry - industry involved with the design, manufacture, construction, and maintenance of wind turbines. The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers. The industry is currently undergoing a period of rapid globalization and consolidation. * List of wind power consulting companies * List of wind turbine manufacturers (shows the top 10 companies and an alphabetical listing) * Wind energy software - application software programs to assist in the development and operation of wind farms. * Wind farm management - overseeing the operation, maintenance, and administration of wind farms. = Wind farms = Wind farm - group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore. * Community wind energy - projects are locally owned by farmers, investors, businesses, schools, utilities, or other public or private entities who utilize wind energy to support and reduce energy costs to the local community. * List of offshore wind farms (currently operational wind farms, rated by nameplate capacity) * List of onshore wind farms (currently operational, rated by generating capacity) * Offshore wind power - the construction of wind farms in bodies of water to generate electricity from wind. == Wind turbines == Wind turbine - a turbine that converts wind energy into mechanical energy. * Wind turbine aerodynamics - the power, F is the force vector, and U is the speed of the moving wind turbine part. * Wind turbine design - the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind. * Types of wind turbines (see list) ** Airborne wind turbine - a design concept for a wind turbine that is supported in the air without a tower. ** Floating wind turbine - an offshore wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where bottom-mounted towers are not feasible. ** Small wind turbine - are wind turbines which have lower energy output than large commercial wind turbines. ** Unconventional wind turbines - the three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). ** Vertical axis wind turbine - type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set vertically and the main components are located at the base of the turbine. *** Darrieus wind turbine - a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) used to generate electricity from the energy carried in the wind. *** Savonius wind turbine - are a type of vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT), used for converting the force of the wind into torque on a rotating shaft. *** Quietrevolution wind turbine - a brand of (VAWT) vertical axis helical turbine. = Wind power by region = * Wind power in Africa ** Wind power in Morocco - amounts to an installed production capacity of 275 MW and 800 MW under construction. * Wind power in Asia - Asia has a total generating capacity of 10,600 MW. ** Wind power in India - began in the 1990s, and has significantly increased in the last few years. ** Wind power in Iran - has been experiencing a growth in wind generation in recent years, and has a plan to substantially increase wind generation each year. ** Wind power in the People's Republic of China - by the end of 2011, it had grown to 62 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity, and China has identified wind power as a key growth component of its economy. ** Wind power in Pakistan - new to wind power, Pakistan is building wind power plants in Jhimpir, Gharo, Keti Bandar and Bin Qasim in Sindh. ** Wind power in Thailand - began in 2011, 223 MW current capacity - target of 1,200 MW by 2021 * Wind power in the European Union - totalled 93,957 megawatts (MW) - enough to supply 6. ** Wind power in Austria - has an estimated 6,600 to 10,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of exploitable wind energy potential.

Krankschaft was the briefly used title of a backing band for Robert Calvert, a vocalist, poet and playwright best known for his work as vocalist in the space rock group Hawkwind in the 1970s. Crucial members of this group were Steve Pond, Dead Fred and drummer Mick Stupp, who were all active in the punk rock group Inner City Unit, a band founded by Hawkwind co-founder / early frontman Nik Turner, as well as a group called The Maximum Effect. The duo of Pond and Reeves played a Robert Calvert tribute concert in 2008, subsequently reuniting fully. They worked on a studio album, 'The Flame Red Superstar', and have since become favourites on the psychedelic festival circuit in Britain. Dead Fred was invited to join Hawkwind in 2013 and left Krankschaft accordingly. Today's Krankschaft consists of Steve Pond on guitars/vocals/synths. ex The Enid bassist Alex Tsentides and Kevin Walker on drums. The band rebooted in 2013 with all new material written by the band a move conceived deliberately to stop trading on their past.

The war came within the scope of the historic conflict between the Hashemites of Hejaz and the Saudis of Riyadh (Nejd) over supremacy in Arabia.Mikaberidze. P.799 It resulted in the defeat of the Hashemite forces and capture of al-Khurma by the Saudis and his allied Ikhwan, but British intervention prevented immediate collapse of the Hashemite kingdom, establishing a sensitive cease-fire that would last until 1924. ==Background== When World War I began, Ibn Saud, the powerful Emir of Nejd, offered the Hashemite ruler Sharif Husayn ibn Ali and the leaders of Ha'il and Kuwait to adopt a neutral stance in the conflict, avoiding intervention in European-related matters, and seeking self- determination for the Arab people. However, with no interests coinciding, no agreement had been reached. Ibn Saud ignored involvement on any side for the first two years of war, while Sharif Husayn of Hejaz began promoting the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, proclaiming himself \\"King of the Arabs.\\" Ibn Saud was infuriated over the Sharifians' claim to the entire Arab peninsula and demanded negotiations to consider the borders of Nejd and Hejaz. Husayn rejected Saudi demands and insulted the Saudi ruler, which eventually brought Ibn Saud to become involved in the political crisis over al-Khurma oasis. ==Warfare== First clashes (1918) Ibn Saud himself however did not maintain neutrality through World War I, being generously supported by the British against the pro-Ottoman emirate of Ha'il. In December 1917, a British deputation, led by Colonel Hemilton tried to convince the Saudi leader to take action against the Ha'il emirate of Jabal Shammar. In return, Ibn Saud demanded firearms. Yet, the British advancement in the Ottoman province of Palestine made the Saudis less relevant, while the Hashemite leader in turn concluded a peace agreement with Jabal Shammar. Thus, in fall of 1918, when Ibn Saud organized some 5,000 men against Jabal Shammar, a British demand to cease military activities came in. Al-Khurma, a crucial strategic oasis on the way between Nejd and Hejaz, had been under Hashemite rule, but following the dispute between the Saudis and the Hashemites, Khurma's emir Khalid ibn Mansur ibn Luwai defected to the Saudi side. In July 1918, after the defection of al- Khurma's emir, a detachment was dispatched by Hashemite King to seize al- Khurma. In response, Ibn Saud sent his Ikhwan forces to protect the oasis, defeating the Hashemites from Mecca. Negotiations Following the end of World War I, Sharif Husayn sought to strike a deal with Ibn Saud over the al- Khurma oasis. The conflict at that point expanded from a political dispute into a religious sectarian dimension, with the Wahhabis of Nejd standing against the Orthodox Sunni Hashemites. Sharif Husayn decided on another expedition to Khurma. Though aware of the coming dispute, the British turned a blind eye to the Hashemite advances, largely underestimating the strength of the Saudis, who the British thought would be quickly overran. Battle of Turaba In May 1919, a Hashemite army, led by Abdallah ibn Husayn, was dispatched towards Turaba, an oasis some 80 miles away from Khurma. Turaba was seized and plundered on May 21. Ibn Saud dispatched a warning to the Hashemites, that their presence in Turaba or advance on Khurma would provoke a war, but neither side was willing to compromise at that time. An Ikhwan force, under the command of Sultan bin Bajad, Hamud ibn Umar and Khalid meanwhile advanced on Turaba, and attacked the Hashemites by surprise on May 25–26 in their camp. In a few hours an entire Hashemite army was annihilated, with hundreds killed and thousands escaping in disarray. Abdallah ibn Husayn himself had barely fled the battlefield. Saudi preparations to conquer Hejaz The battle of Turaba was a turning point in the conflict, placing Sharif Husayn in a very weak position against Ibn Saud. In early July 1919, Ibn Saud himself arrived to Turaba with an army of 10,000 men, ready to advance on Hejaz. On July 4, however, a British ultimatum arrived to the Saudis, demanding to stop the campaign and return the Nejd. Unwilling to face the British, Ibn Saud submitted to the British demand and capitulated. It however could not change the notion of the Saudi ruler that the victory over Hejaz is possible. ==Aftermath== In the next 4 years, the Saudi ruler was preoccupied with consolidation of his domain, undertaking several campaigns in new regions of Arabia, while keeping the Hejazi frontier quiet. Jabal Shammar was annexed in 1920–21, while Kuwait was defeated in 1922, defining the border with Iraq and Transjordan through the Uqair protocol of 1922, while simultaneously conquering Asir in south Arabia. By early 1923, Ibn Saud decided to take over Hejaz, but was unsure over British position. The worsening relations between England and Hashemite rulers and the proclamation of Sharif Husayn as Caliph, finally made Ibn Saud to undertake the campaign, entusiasthically supported by the religiously insigted Ikhwan, who had hoped to take over the holy sites of Islam. The preliminary attack on Taif came in September 1924, beginning the Saudi conquest, which would be complete on December 1925. ==Casualties== The number of fatalities in the 1918–19 war was hundreds of killed and thousands of injured. The actual total number of fatalities is estimated at least 1,392.Political Science. Middle East/North Africa/Persian Gulf Region. University of Central Arkansas.

GOES-16 serves as the operational geostationary weather satellite in the GOES East position at 75.2°W, providing a view centered on the Americas. GOES-16 provides high spatial and temporal resolution imagery of the Earth through 16 spectral bands at visible and infrared wavelengths using its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). GOES-16's Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is the first operational lightning mapper flown in geostationary orbit. The spacecraft also includes four other scientific instruments for monitoring space weather and the Sun. GOES-16's design and instrumentation began in 1999 and was intended to fill key NOAA satellite requirements published that year. Following nearly a decade of instrument planning, spacecraft fabrication was contracted to Lockheed Martin Space Systems in 2008; construction of GOES-16 began in 2012 and lasted until 2014 when the satellite entered the testing phase. After several launch delays, GOES-16 launched from Cape Canaveral on 19 November 2016 aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V. The spacecraft reached an initial geostationary orbit several days later, beginning a yearlong non-operational checkout and validation phase. In November 2017, GOES-16 began a drift to its operational GOES East position, and was declared as fully operational on 18 December 2017. The satellite is expected to have an operational lifespan of ten years, with five additional years as a backup for successive GOES spacecraft. ==Background== Instrument conceptualization The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program began as a joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1975 to develop geostationary weather satellites following the success of the Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) and Synchronous Meteorological Satellite programs beginning in 1966. In the 1999 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Evolution of Future NOAA Operational Geostationary Satellites, NOAA listed instrument requirements for the next generation of GOES imager and sounder. Top priorities included continuous observation capabilities, the ability to observe weather phenomena at all spatial scales, and improved spatial and temporal resolution for both the imager and sounder. These specifications laid the conceptual foundations for the instruments that would eventually be included with GOES-16. More concrete development of GOES-16 began with the initial designs of an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), which started in June 1999 under the direction of Tim Schmitt of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). At its inception, ten spectral bands were considered for inclusion in the new ABI, derived from six instruments on other satellites. In September 1999, the NOAA Research and Development Council endorsed the continued development of the instrument with the suggested bandwidths and frequencies. As the instrument became further realized, the number of potential spectral bands increased from the initial ten, to twelve by October 1999. Alongside the ABI, development also began on the Advanced Baseline Sounder (ABS), which would form a part of a Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) of instruments on the next generation GOES satellites. Like the ABI, the HES was to also mark significant improvements in resolution and spatial coverage. Initial forecasts were for the ABI to be included as part of GOES beginning with the projected launch of GOES-Q in 2008. In 2001, NOAA planned for the GOES-R generation of GOES satellites to commence with the expected launch of GOES-R in 2012, with the ABI and ABS as expected instrumentation. GOES-R and its sister satellites were to lead to substantial improvements in forecast accuracy and detail by providing new operational products for users. Four years later, the number of proposed spectral bands on the ABI instrument increased to 16, covering a swath of visible and infrared wavelengths. In September 2006, NOAA dropped plans to include the HES aboard GOES-R, citing a lack of sufficient testing and major cost overruns in the development of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). Although the GOES-R series was expected to cost in total, increased instrument complexity, revised inflation assumptions, and program reserves led to the Government Accountability Office estimating a much higher US$11.4 billion cost for the program in 2006. Construction In December 2008, NASA and NOAA selected Lockheed Martin Space Systems as the contractor for the fabrication of the first two satellites of the GOES-R generation, including GOES-R, for an estimated value of contract at US$1.09 billion. Preliminary design review was completed just over two years later, with critical design review being completed in May 2012. Construction of the satellite bus was contracted out to Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and work began shortly thereafter, with the core structure becoming test-ready in January 2013. The Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) became the first installation-ready instruments for GOES-R in May 2013, while the ABI became integration-ready in February 2014; spacecraft propulsion and system modules were delivered three months later, finalizing the initial construction phase and allowing for complete spacecraft integration and testing at Lockheed Martin's facilities in Colorado. The satellite was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center on 22 August 2016 to undergo additional tests and ready the spacecraft for launch. ==Spacecraft design== GOES-16 and other satellites of the GOES-R generation are based around a derivative of Lockheed Martin's A2100 spacecraft bus capable of supporting up to dry mass with power capabilities exceeding 4 kW until the spacecraft's end-of-life. With propellant, GOES-16 had a total mass of , with a dry mass of . The spacecraft has dimensions of . GOES-16 is powered by a solar array containing five solar panels that were folded at launch and unfurled after deployment. GOES-16 was designed to have a service lifetime of 15 years, including 10 years as an operational satellite and 5 additional years as a backup for successive GOES satellites. GOES-16's command and data handling subsystem is based around the SpaceWire bus; a modified version of the SpaceWire protocol was developed specifically for GOES-16 as a cost and risk reduction measure, with the associated application-specific integrated circuit being developed by British Aerospace. The GOES Reliable Data Delivery Protocol (GRDDP) complements preexisting SpaceWire capabilities and includes packet loss detection and recovery. The satellite's instruments collect and transfer payload data to the spacecraft at 10-100 Mbit/s. Spacecraft stability and accuracy is maintained by several reaction wheels, gyrometers, and a star tracker. GOES-16 is also the first geostationary civilian spacecraft to use GPS to assess its orbit. Such calibration equipment is intended to establish the satellite's position within a radius with a confidence of 3σ. ==Instruments== Earth-facing The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) make up GOES-16's Earth- facing, or nadir-pointing, instruments. These are positioned on a stable precision-pointed platform isolated from the rest of the spacecraft. = Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)= The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is the primary imaging instrument on GOES-16, providing over 65 percent of all GOES-16 data products. A multi-channel passive imaging radiometer, ABI takes images of the Earth with 16 spectral bands, including two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and ten infrared channels. The individual bands are optimized for various atmospheric phenomena, including cloud formation, atmospheric motion, convection, land surface temperature, ocean dynamics, flow of water, fire, smoke, volcanic ash plumes, aerosols and air quality, and vegetative health. ABI's \\"red\\" visible band 2 (λ = 0.64 μm) has the highest resolution among the 16 bands at per pixel. The other visible light and near- infrared bands have a resolution of , while the infrared bands have a resolution of per pixel. The sensors on the ABI are made of different materials depending on the spectral band, with silicon used for sensors operating in visible light and mercury cadmium telluride used for sensors operated in the near-infrared and infrared. An ABI electronics unit and cryocooler control electronics complement the sensor unit to power the imager and keep the instrument at cryogenic temperatures; all electronics and the sensor array are redundant to ensure operation longetivity. Development of the ABI was contracted to Harris Corporation of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Several other companies were involved in the development and fabrication of the ABI, including BAE Systems, BEI Technologies, Babcock Corporation, DRS Technologies, L3 Technologies SSG-Tinsley, and Northrop Grumman Space Technology. The ABI takes images with three different geographic extents, with each image produced as a combination of stitched west-to-east narrow image scans made by the instrument. In the default \\"flex\\" mode (scan mode 3) of operation, the ABI produces full-disk images of the Earth every 15 minutes, with a spatial resolution of . However, the ABI can also operate on continuous disk mode (scan mode 4), whereby full disk images are recorded every 5 minutes. Full-disk images are composed of 26 image strips, making it more efficient than the preceding GOES imager, which was made with 1,300 image strips. The instrument also images a area centered on the continental United States every five minutes at a resolution of . Where possible, the ABI can also image mesoscale phenomena over two selected areas every 60 seconds at a resolution of . The variable scanning modes make GOES-16 the first GOES satellite to be configurable while in orbit. In addition, a solar diffuser new to GOES-16 allows for calibration of the ABI imaging data. On 2 April 2019, the GOES-16 ABI was reconfigured to use scan mode 6 as a default, allowing full disk scans every 10 minutes. The ABI onboard GOES-16 represents a significant improvement over the imager onboard previous GOES satellites. The sixteen spectral bands on the ABI, as opposed to the five on the previous GOES generation, represents a two-fold increase in spectral information. In addition, the ABI features up to four times greater spatial resolution and five times greater temporal resolution over the previous GOES imager. The ABI is nearly identical to the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) first used on the Japan Meteorological Agency's Himawari 8, which launched on 7 October 2014. The two instruments share 15 of the same spectral bands and have one spectral band unique to either instrument, with the ABI featuring a 1.37 μm near- infrared band for cirrus cloud detection while the AHI uses a 0.51 μm band optimized for reflectance around the green portion of the visible spectrum. Lacking an explicit band for green light, true-color imagery for ABI is created using the combination of the ABI's red and blue visible bands along with a synthesized green band; the simulated green band is created by applying algorithms based on MODIS and AHI onto existing ABI spectral bands. { class=\\" sortable plainrowheaders collapsible\\" + ABI spectral bands - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Band ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  λ (μm) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Central λ (μm) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Pixel spacing (km) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Nickname ! scope=\\"col\\"  Classification ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Primary function ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Source - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1 0.45-0.49 0.47 1 Blue Visible Aerosols  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2 0.59-0.69 0.64 0.5 Red Visible Clouds  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 3 0.846-0.885 0.865 1 Veggie Near-infrared Vegetation  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 4 1.371-1.386 1.378 2 Cirrus Near- infrared Cirrus  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 5 1.58-1.64 1.61 1 Snow/Ice Near- infrared Snow/ice discrimination, cloud phase  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 6 2.225-2.275 2.25 2 Cloud Particle Size Near-infrared Cloud particle size, snow cloud phase  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 7 3.80-4.00 3.90 2 Shortwave Window Infrared Fog, stratus, fire, volcanism  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 8 5.77-6.6 6.9 2 Upper-level Tropospheric Water Vapor Infrared Various atmospheric features  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 9 6.75-7.15 6.95 2 Mid-level Tropospheric Water Vapor Infrared Water vapor features  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 10 7.24-7.44 7.34 2 Lower-level Tropospheric Water Vapor Infrared Water vapor features  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 11 8.3-8.7 8.5 2 Cloud-Top Phase Infrared Cloud-top phase  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 12 9.42-9.8 9.61 2 Ozone Infrared Total column ozone  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 13 10.1-10.6 10.35 2 Clean Infrared Longwave Window Infrared Clouds  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 14 10.8-11.6 11.2 2 Infrared Longwave Window Infrared Clouds  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 15 11.8-12.8 12.3 2 Dirty Infrared Longwave Window Infrared Clouds  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 16 13.0-13.6 13.3 2  Longwave Infrared Infrared Air temperature, clouds  } =Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)= The GOES-16 Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is a single-channel near-infrared detector that monitors for the short-lived light emitted by lightning. In mapping lightning, GLM data can be used to alert forecasters to nascent severe weather as developing storms or tornado progenitors often exhibit an increase in lightning activity due to updraft intensification; by extension, such information can also reduce false alarm rates of severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. GOES-16 was the first spacecraft to carry a lightning mapper in geostationary orbit. The GLM can detect both cloud-to- cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning during daytime and nighttime, complementing land-based lightning detection. GLM's sensitivity results in a detection rate of 70-90% of all lightning strikes in its viewing area. The camera is a 1372 × 1300 pixel staring CCD sensitive to 777.4 nm light with a spatial resolution of at the nadir and near the edge of the instrument's field-of-view, resulting in a spatial resolution averaging roughly . The 777.4 nm band was chosen as lightning strikes have three prominent spectral lines originating from atomic oxygen centered at 777.4 nm. The latitudinal coverage of the instrument is limited to between 52°N and 52°S. To limit interference of undesired light, a solar blocking filter and solar rejection filter are affixed to the front of the instrument's aperture. The GLM can take an image every 2 ms, or 500 frames per second, with a data downlink of 7.7 Mbit/s. Information from GLM is used to determine the frequency, location, and extent of lightning strikes. Data from the GLM can be mapped in real-time using open- source software that has also been adapted by the United States National Weather Service Development of the GLM was contracted by the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California. Unforeseen during the instrument design, GLM is able to detect Bolides in the atmosphere and thereby facilitates meteor sciences. Sun-facing The Sun-facing, or solar- pointing, components of GOES-16 include the EXIS and SUVI, which are located on a Sun Pointing Platform (SPP) on the spacecraft's solar array yoke; the SPP tracks the seasonal and daily movement of the sun relative to GOES-16, and also supports GOES-16's Unique Payload Services. =Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS)= The Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) are a pair of sensors that monitor solar irradiance in the Earth's upper atmosphere. In monitoring irradiance, EXIS can detect solar flares which can disrupt power grids, communications, and navigational systems on Earth and satellites. Variability in irradiance influences conditions in the ionosphere and thermosphere. The Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS) monitors changes in solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance which shape upper atmospheric variability, with an ultraviolet wavelength range of 5-127 nm. Data from EUVS can anticipate radio blackouts for high frequency (HF) communications in low latitudes and the expansion of the thermosphere, which can induce increased drag and degrade instruments on satellites in low Earth orbit. The X-Ray Sensor (XRS) component of EXIS monitors solar flares through X-ray irradiance, allowing for the prediction of a solar particle event. The XRS detects X-rays with wavelengths between 0.05-0.8 nm. Together, the EXIS instrument weighs and consumes 40 W of power. =Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI)= The Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) is an ultraviolet telescope onboard GOES-16 that produces full-disk images of the sun in the extreme ultraviolet range, succeeding the former GOES Solar X-ray Imager instrument onboard previous GOES satellite generations. The goals of SUVI are to locate coronal holes, detect and locate solar flares, monitor changes that indicate coronal mass ejections, detect active regions beyond the Sun's east limb, and analyze the complexity of active regions on the sun. The telescope is composed of six different wavelength bands centered between 94-304 Å specialized for different solar features. The GOES-16's ultraviolet imager is analogous to the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Space environment GOES-16 features two instruments, the Magnetometer (MAG) and Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS), that provide localized in-situ observations of high-energy particles and magnetic fields in geostationary orbit. =Magnetometer (MAG)= The GOES-16 Magnetometer (MAG) is a tri-axial fluxgate magnetometer that measures the Earth's magnetic field at the outer extents of the magnetosphere from geostationary orbit. MAG provides general data on geomagnetic activity, which can be used to detect solar storms and validate large-scale space environment modelling; charged particles associated with the interaction of the solar wind and the magnetosphere present dangerous radiation hazards to spacecraft and human spaceflight. The magnetometer samples the magnetic field at a resolution of 0.016 nT at a frequency of 2.5 Hz. On GOES-16, MAG consists of two sensors positioned on an deployable boom, separating the instruments from the main spacecraft body to reduce the influence of the satellite's own magnetic signature. The tri-axial design allows for the measurement of the orthogonal vector components of the Earth's magnetic field. Development of the instrument was contracted by Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center based in Palo Alto, California. The electronic and sensor components of MAG were built by Macintyre Electronic Design Associates, Inc. (MEDA) in Sterling, Virginia, while the deployable boom was built by ATK in Goleta, California. =Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS)= The Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS) consists of four sensors with a wide variance in field-of-view that monitor proton, electron, and heavy ion fluxes in the magnetosphere. The suite monitors 27 differential electron energy channels and 32 differential proton energy channels, an increase over the six electron energy channels and 12 proton energy channels monitored by the previous GOES-N generation of satellites. The Energetic Heavy Ion Sensor (EHIS) specifically measures heavy ion fluxes, including those trapped in Earth's magnetosphere and particles originated from the sun or in cosmic rays. There are two Magnetospheric Particle Sensors, Low and High (MPS-LO and MPS-HI, respectively) that measure electron and proton fluxes. MPS-LO measures low energy flux over a 30 eV-30 keV range; electrons with these energies can cause unintended charging of the spacecraft, causing electrostatic discharge or arcing across GOES-16 components, resulting in significant and permanent hardware damage. MPS-HI measures medium- to high-energy electrons with energies of up to 4 MeV and protons with energies of up to 12 MeV. Electrons at these energies easily penetrate spacecraft and may cause internal dielectric breakdown or discharge damage. The Solar and Galactic Proton Sensor (SGPS) instrument included in SEISS measures energetic protons from solar or galactic sources found in the magnetosphere. Such protons in large quantities can cause biological effects on humans at high altitudes, as well as HF blackouts in the polar regions. Development of SEISS was contracted by Assurance Technology Corporation in Carlisle, Massachusetts, and subcontracted to the University of New Hampshire. ==Launch and mission profile== alt=A view close to the launch pad of a rocket shortly after lift-off, along with four structures associated with the lightning protection system and the service structure partially obscured by the rocket's exhaust. NASA selected the Atlas V 541 operated by United Launch Services as the launch vehicle for GOES-R on 5 April 2012, with a launch date slated for October 2015 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41. Combined with the subsequent GOES-S, launch operations were expected to cost US$446 million. The launch date was chosen relatively early to maintain the operation of the GOES satellite constellation despite there being only a 48% confidence in meeting the October 2015 launch date; an audit by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Commerce in April 2013 highlighted these concerns and projected a February 2016 launch which would reduce development stress at the cost of increasing the risk for gaps in satellite coverage should the operational backup satellites fail. Difficulties with GOES-R software and communications equipment caused the expected launch to be delayed to early 2016, and on 15 October 2015, the launch was pushed further to 13 October 2016. In early October 2016, GOES-R was secured in preparation for the close passage of Hurricane Matthew and did not sustain any damage. However, the tipping of a ground system rail van housing the spacecraft and the discovery of a booster fault on the Atlas V rocket--the same issue that had prevented the launch of WorldView-4 earlier in 2016-- resulted in another delay of the launch window to 19 November 2016. On 18 November 2016, the mated GOES-R spacecraft and the Atlas V launch vehicle were moved to the launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41. GOES-R was launched on 19 November 2016 at 23:42 UTC (6:42 p.m. EST) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 aboard an Atlas V rocket. An undisclosed issue on the Eastern Range and verification of a potential concern on another rocket had delayed the launch by an hour towards the end of the 19 November launch window. The Atlas V was in the 541 configuration with tail number AV-069 and was administered by United Launch Alliance; the launch was the 100th of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program and 138th of the Atlas program. The Atlas V's ascent was directed slightly south of east over the Atlantic Ocean. Following the rocket's first stage, additional burns in subsequent stages steered the spacecraft towards the altitude needed for geosynchronous orbit. Spacecraft separation from the launch vehicle occurred over Indonesia roughly 3.5 hours after launch, placing GOES-R in an elliptical low-inclination geostationary transfer orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of . The spacecraft then initiated several burns using its own independent propulsion systems to refine its orbit to place it in the intended geostationary position, with eight days dedicated to increasing its orbital radius and four to orbital fine-tuning. During the first corrective burn, the truss holding the main engine nozzle warmed to anomalously high temperatures. Although the exceeded pre-flight temperature limits were revised, the subsequent four burns were limited to less than 41 minutes each in duration out of an abundance of caution, bringing it to its preliminary geostationary orbit ten days after launch. In reaching geostationary orbit, GOES-R was redesignated as GOES-16, beginning a yearlong extended checkout and validation phase. The spacecraft was initially positioned in a non-operational test position at 89.5°W, with GOES-13 and GOES-15 serving as the operational weather satellites in the traditional GOES East and GOES West positions, respectively. Instruments were initially kept dormant for a 30-day period to allow for outgassing and the clearing of any contaminants in the spacecraft. The first science data from GOES-16 was received from the MAG instrument on 22 December 2016, while the first images from ABI were collected on 15 January 2017 and released on 23 January 2017. On 25 May 2017, NOAA announced that GOES-16 would occupy the GOES East position once operational, succeeding GOES-13. GOES-16's move to its operational position began at around 13:30 UTC on 30 November 2017, drifting about 1.41° per day to a final longitude of 75.2°W; during this time, the spacecraft's instruments were kept in a diagnostic mode without data collection or transmission. GOES-16 reached the GOES East position by 11 December, and following a calibration period, resumed instrument data collection and transmission three days later. On 18 December 2017, GOES-16 was declared fully operational. ==Unique Payload Services and data processing== The Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station on Wallops Island, Virginia serves as the primary point for telemetry, tracking, and command of GOES-16. Unique Payload Services In addition to its primary science payload, GOES-16 also features the Unique Payload Services (UPS) suite which provide communications relay services ancillary to the mission's primary operations: *GOES Rebroadcast (GRB) - GOES-16's downlink is handled by the GRB system, which serves as the primary full resolution and near-real-time relay for the satellite's instrument data. The instrument data are processed as Level 1b data for all instruments and Level 2 data for the GLM. The GRB replaces the former GOES VARiable (GVAR) service used by previous GOES spacecraft. The dual circular polarized signal is centered within the L band at 1686.6 MHz and consists of two 15.5 Mbit/s digital streams for a total data rate of 31 Mbit/s. *Data Collection System (DCS) - GOES-16 also serves as a relay satellite that rebroadcasts in-situ ground environmental observations, typically from remote locations, to other ground receiving sites. The GOES-16 DCS supports 433 user-platform channels with a downlink frequency range of 1679.70-1680.10 MHz. *Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) - EMWIN transmits products and other information from the United States National Weather Service. EMWIN is also coupled with the High Rate Information Transmission (HRIT) service, which broadcasts low-resolution GOES imagery and selected products to remotely located user HRIT terminals. *Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) - A SARSAT transponder on GOES-16 can detect distress signals and relay them to local user terminals to aid in the coordination of rescue operations. The transponder can be accessed with a relatively low uplink power of 32 dBm, allowing it to detect weak emergency beacons. Integrated ground system and data distribution An integrated ground system for data acquisition, processing, and dissemination was specially designed for GOES-16 and other satellites in the GOES-R generation of GOES spacecraft. The NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland, serves as the point of command for GOES mission operations, while the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station at Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, handles GOES-16 telemetry, tracking, command, and instrument data. A second station in Fairmont, West Virginia, serves as the designated Consolidated Backup to the Wallops facility. The antennas at Wallops are designed to withstand sustained winds of and gusts of up to , conditions expected in a Category 2 hurricane. Together, the ground system involves 2,100 servers and 3 PB of data storage; data processing is handled by 3,632 processor cores capable of 40 trillion floating point operations per second. In 2009, NOAA contracted the Government Communications Systems Division of Harris Corporation with the development of the GOES-R ground system, with an estimated value of contract at US$736 million; Harris was also awarded a US$130 million contract to develop the ground antenna system, including six new large-aperture transceiving antennas and upgrades to four existing antennas at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility. To aid in systems engineering and data distribution tools for the ground segment, Boeing was awarded a $55 million subcontract. In addition to GRB, which can be accessed by any calibrated receiver, GOES data is also distributed through other channels. The National Weather Service receives data directly from GOES-16 through the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) interface, which integrates meteorological and hydrological data with the agency's forecast and warning issuance systems. Real-time GOES-16 data is available through the Product Distribution and Access (PDA) system, while archived data is stored on the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS). GOES-R Proving Ground GOES-R Cooperative Institutes The GOES-R Proving Ground was established in 2008 as a collaboration between the GOES-R series program office and a number of NOAA and NASA centers to prepare forecasters and other interests for new products that would be available with the GOES-R generation of weather satellites. The technological proving ground addressed recommendations from the National Research Council in 2000 for NOAA to develop teams demonstrating the scope of new sensors like those on GOES-16 in concert with instrument design. The AWIPS-centric program was designed to allow for evaluation and development of simulated GOES-R products and provide training for forecasters. Experimental products were based on both contemporaneous and synthetic data. The first six years from 2008 to 2014 were primarily dedicated to algorithm development, simulation design, decision aid development, and end-to-end testing, while the ensuing years up to spacecraft launch would deal primarily with tailoring products to user feedback. Participants in the proving ground program were classified as developers--those developing the satellite algorithms and training materials for GOES-R products--or users--the recipients of those products. The three primary developers in the program were the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) and Advanced Satellite Products Branch (ASPB) at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin; the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) and Regional and Mesoscale Meteorology Branch (RAMMB) at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO; and NASA's Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center (NASA SPoRT) in Huntsville, Alabama. GOES-R testbed and technology demonstrations were focused on a variety of applications including tropical cyclone intensity estimation, severe storm development, aviation, and air quality. ==See also== * Cospas-Sarsat * Earth observation satellite * Geostationary orbit * Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite * Remote sensing * Space Weather Prediction Center * Storm Prediction Center * Weather satellite ==NotesReferencesAttributions== * * ==External links== * * GOES-R Satellite Proving Ground Category:Synchronous Meteorological Satellites Category:Weather satellites of the United States Category:Artificial satellites in geosynchronous orbit Category:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Category:Satellites using the A2100 bus Category:Spacecraft launched in 2016 Category:Spacecraft launched by Atlas rockets ","title":"GOES-16"},{"id":"35927202","text":"Biocoal may refer to: * Hydrothermal carbonization, a moderate temperature water-based process to convert biomass to a coal-like substance * Torrefaction, a mild form of pyrolysis to convert biomass to a char-like substance ","title":"Biocoal"},{"id":"35927204","text":"Molowghan (, also Romanized as Molowghān and Molowqān; also known as Hashta Khān, Hashtoogan, and Hashtūgān) is a village in Arabkhaneh Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

In 2011, AQAP created Ansar Al-Sharia as a Yemen-based affiliate focused on waging an insurgency rather than international attacks on the West. In the view of the International Crisis Group, AQAP is \\"an internally diverse organisation with varying layers of support among the local population\\" and many AAS members and allies are not committed to AQAP's international agenda. After the Battle of Zinjibar (May–September 2011), the faction had taken control of some cities in southern Yemen in which it has instated emirates.

The identification of pGSN in Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans points to an ancient origin early in evolution. Its extraordinary structural conservation reflects its critical regulatory role in multiple essential functions. Its roles include the breakdown of filamentous actin released from dead cells, activation of macrophages, and localization of the inflammatory response. Substantial decreases in plasma levels are observed in acute and chronic infection and injury in both animal models and in humans. Supplementation therapies with recombinant human pGSN have been shown effective in more than 20 animal models. pGSN has a cytoplasmic isoform (cGSN) known to be an actin- binding protein controlling cytoskeletal dynamics. cGSN is expressed from the same gene, and is identical to pGSN except for its lack of a 24 amino acid N-terminal extension. ==History== The cellular isoform of Gelsolin was discovered in 1979 in the lab of Thomas P. Stossel. Its name comes from observed calcium-dependent reversible gel-sol transitions of macrophage cytoplasmic extract. Around the same time a similarly sized plasma protein was discovered and shown to depolymerize actin; it was named Brevin, due to its ability to shorten actin filaments. In 1986 it was demonstrated that Brevin was identical to cellular Gelsolin except for a 24 AA N-terminal extension, and was renamed Plasma Gelsolin. ==Structure== A solution phase representation of pGSN in the presence of Ca2+ adapted from and low-resolution SAXS information. The 24 AA N-terminal extension unique to the plasma isoform was manually added (left, light blue); no structural information for it is known nor represented. Colors represent the six domains of Gelsolin. Plasma Gelsolin is a 755 AA, 83 kDa plasma protein made up of six \\"gelsolin domains\\", each composed of a 5-6 strand β-sheet between one long and one short α-helix. It exhibits a weak homology between domains S1 and S4, S2 and S5, and S3 and S6, and is identical to the cytoplasmic form of the protein except for the addition of a 24 AA N-terminal extension. Additionally a 27 AA N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved prior to pGSN's secretion from the cell. Both forms of the protein are encoded by highly conserved genes on chromosome 9 in humans, but are under the control of different promoters. There is a single disulfide bond formed on the second domain of the plasma protein, there are no documented natural post-translational modifications, and the pI ≈ 6. Isoforms and mutations Aside from the cellular form, the only other known isoform is Gelsolin-3, an identical non-secreted protein containing an 11 AA, rather than 24 AA, N-terminal extension. It has been found in brain, testis, and lung oligodendrocytes, and is reportedly involved in myelin remodeling during spiralization around the axon. Plasma Gelsolin is highly conserved and its only known mutations are single point mutations. One of several such mutations leads to Finnish Familial Amyloidosis, a disorder in which pGSN becomes more conformationally flexible and susceptible to enzymatic cleavage resulting in accumulation of peptide fragments into amyloid fibrils. D187N/Y is the most common mutation with additional reports of G167R, N184K, P432R, A551P, and Ala7fs in the medical literature. In addition to this several mutations and down-regulation of the protein are associated with breast cancer. Ca2+ At moderate pH in the absence of Ca2+ pGSN is compact and globular. Low pH or the presence of >nM Ca2+ is associated with an elongated structure with greater backbone flexibility. This flexibility exposes the actin binding sites. Since physiological levels of Ca2+ are ~2 mM, pGSN is available to bind to leaked actin from cellular damage. ==Functions== Binding Plasma Gelsolin is a sticky protein known to bind to a number of peptides and proteins: Actin (see also: Relationships with actin), Apo-H, Aβ, α-Synuclein, Integrin, Tcp-1, Fibronectin, Syntaxin-4, Tropomyosin, fatty acids and phospholipids (see also: Binding and inactivation of diverse inflammatory mediators): LPA, LPS (endotoxin), LTA, PAF, S1P, polyphosphoinositides including PIP2; and nucleic acids: Ap3A, ATP, ADP. PIP2, a phospholipid component of cell membranes, competes with ATP and actin for pGSN binding, and will dissociate F-Actin-capped pGSN. Relationships with actin =Actin toxicity and removal= Actin is the most abundant cellular protein, and its release into extracellular fluid and circulation following cellular injury from disease or injury leads to increased blood viscosity, hindered microcirculation, and activation of platelets. Hemodialysis patients with low levels of pGSN and high levels of actin in blood had markedly higher mortality. Actin is a major component of biofilms that accumulate at local sites of injury and infection, impeding access of host immune components and therapeutics such as antibiotics. Biofilms are particularly pathogenic in the setting of foreign bodies like indwelling catheters and tissue implants. Actin exchanges between monomeric (G) and filamentous (F) forms according to the concentrations of it, ATP, and cations. pGSN along with Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) bind and clear monomeric actin. DBP binds with greater affinity to G-actin, leaving pGSN available to sever F-actin. Furthermore, DBP is capable of removing one actin from a 2:1 actin-pGSN complex, restoring its ability to sever F-actin. F-actin, severed and capped by pGSN, is removed by sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver. pGSN removes 60% of actin trapped in fibrin clots in vitro leading to an increased rate of clot lysis. =Severing, capping, nucleation, and polymerization= Although pGSN is capable of initiating the polymerization of actin through nucleation, its primary relationship with it in blood is depolymerization through filament severing. Actin severing occurs rapidly in the presence of pGSN and Ca2+. pGSN wraps around filaments, non-enzymatically cleaving them. It remains attached, \\"capping\\" the barbed/plus end of the severed filament and inducing a torsional twist that is cooperative through its length. Capping has a reported binding affinity <250 pM in the presence of Ca2+ that is substantially weakened in its absence. Capping also blocks further polymerization at the fast growing, barbed end. While no evidence exists for nucleating/polymerizing of G-actin by pGSN in vivo, the ability of it to do so in vitro is well documented. Actin polymerization is initiated by the production of an actin trimer nucleus. Formation of nuclei is energetically disfavored, but dimers and/or trimers can be catalyzed/stabilized by a number of cellular proteins. In excess of a 2:1 actin:gelsolin stoichiometry and in the presence of Ca2+, gelsolin will bind three actin monomers. A monomer adds to the trimer creating a tetramer that undergoes an internal conversion to an active tetramer witnessed by a concentration-independent lag phase. Subsequent fibrilization proceeds by monomer addition. Gelsolin remains attached to the fast-growing (barbed/plus) end of actin, producing short, slow-growing fibrils. These actions are similar to those of cytoplasmic form of pGSN, cGSN, which contributes to structural changes of cells through both nucleating/polymerizing and severing/capping. Amyloid prevention and clearance pGSN may play an important role in the prevention and management of amyloidosis in several diseases. It is found in complex with Aβ in plasma and reported to both inhibit amyloid formation and defibrillize preformed fibrils in vitro. Mice with an Alzheimer's disease model given pGSN showed a 5-fold decrease in progression of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy. pGSN has also been found in Lewy Bodies, amyloid containing protein aggregates associated with Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. ==Role in inflammation== Macrophage stimulation =MARCO receptor= Macrophage receptor MARCO is responsible for pathogen recognition and phagocytosis. Macrophages incubated with actin at concentrations consistent with lung injury showed decreased uptake of bacteria. Uptake was restored when actin was administered in the presence of pGSN. =NOS3= NOS3 is an enzyme that is protective against systemic inflammation and myocardial dysfunction. pGSN activates phosphorylation of Ser1177 in NOS3 and Ser473 in Akt. NOS3 is known to be activated by phosphorylation of Akt. Mouse macrophage uptake and killing of bacteria in vitro was enhanced by pGSN, and no significant enhancement was found for NOS3-/- macrophages. In vivo, mice showed 15-fold improvement in bacterial clearance when given pGSN, and no significant enhancement was found for NOS3-/- mice. Inflammatory mediators pGSN has been shown to bind to the fatty acid inflammatory mediators LPA, LPS (endotoxin), LTA, PAF, S1P, and polyphosphoinositides including PIP2. Mediators of inflammation, the body’s innate healing mechanism, accumulate at the site of the injury to begin the processes of defense and repair, and the depletion of local pGSN allows them to do their work. See Binding and inactivation of diverse inflammatory mediators ==Therapeutic Potential== The broad therapeutic potential of pGSN supplementation resides in the fact that the molecule embodies a multifunctional system contributing importantly to innate immunity rather than a pharmacologic intervention with selective and specific activities. Plasma gelsolin’s primary function is to keep inflammation local and enhance the function of the innate immune system. It functions through a pleiotropic mechanism of action; severing toxic filamentous actin (F-actin), binding inflammatory mediators, and enhancing pathogen clearance. These mechanisms are quite distinct from other anti-inflammatory agents that function as antagonists of individual mediators or inhibitors of specific enzymes, and work to ablate inflammation. Most systemic anti-inflammatory agents also suppress the immune system and often require caution in administration because they increase the risk of infection. Plasma gelsolin is unique in that it has also been demonstrated to enhance the antimicrobial action of macrophages, which engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens, boosting immunity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections. Mechanisms of action Plasma gelsolin plays a central role in the body’s innate immune system and is responsible for localizing inflammation—a mechanism so central to species survival that it has been highly conserved by evolution. Experimental and epidemiology data suggest that pGSN performs the role of a buffer or shield that modulates the inflammatory response to injury or infection. The system accomplishes this goal in three key ways described below: =Debridement= Plasma gelsolin binds and severs filamentous actin exposed from cells damaged by injury, including both infectious and sterile injury. Actin has been reported to activate platelets, interfere with fibrinolysis, damage endothelial cells, and to function as a danger signal (DAMP). Administration of large quantities of filamentous actin to rats resulted in lethal pulmonary hemorrhage and thrombosis. Another key “toxicity” of exposed actin is the fact that it is a major component of biofilms that accumulate at local sites of injury and infection and that it impedes the access of host immune components and therapeutics such as antibiotics. Biofilms are particularly pathogenic in the setting of foreign bodies like indwelling catheters and tissue implants. As a result of actin exposure at the local site of injury, the local level of plasma gelsolin around the site of the injury initially becomes depleted as it “debrides” the local involved site. Mediators of inflammation, the body’s innate healing mechanism, accumulate at the site of the injury to begin the processes of defense and repair, and the depletion of local plasma gelsolin allows them to do their work. While local pGSN levels are depressed, the presence of this abundant protein in the circulation ensures that the inflammatory process stays local, and that stores of plasma gelsolin are available to address further injury so that the overall immune response remains intact. =Augmentation of macrophage antimicrobial activity= pGSN has antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. Administration of pGSN subcutaneously or by inhalation to mice challenged with lethal inocula of S. pneumoniae or even more lethal combinations of influenza virus and bacteria markedly diminished the number of viable bacteria in the animals’ airways and significantly reduced mortality. The number of inflammation-inducing neutrophils was also considerably reduced, presumably as a result of enhanced bacterial clearance. This is true for contemporaneous or delayed administration of recombinant pGSN. A basis of pGSN’s antimicrobial action is that it enhances the ability of cultivated lung macrophages to ingest gram positive and gram negative bacteria in vitro. The mechanism of this improved phagocytosis is that actin binds macrophage scavenger receptors and prevents them from promoting the uptake of bacteria. By debriding the actin, pGSN removes this inhibition. pGSN also increases the ability of macrophages to kill ingested microorganisms by inducing macrophage nitric oxide synthase activity. =Binding and inactivation of diverse inflammatory mediators= pGSN binds to a number of inflammatory mediators and signaling agents. Binding to LPA occurs at the same site on the molecule that ligates actin and interacts with polyphosphoinositides. Subsequent studies showed that gelsolin alters the effector function of LPA’s receptor binding. Binding to inflammatory mediators, and in some cases inhibition of their effector function has been shown for platelet-activating factor, lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and lipoteichoic acid and small molecule purinergic agonists including ATP and ADP. The binding of pGSN to Aβ Alzheimer peptide has also been well documented. {  + style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Role of mediators which bind to plasma gelsolin - ! Mediator !! Role -  LPA  A phospholipid derivative that can act as a signaling molecule and activates G protein coupled receptors. It has been associated with cell proliferation. -  LPS/endotoxin  Found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, it elicits a strong immune response in animals. -  PAF  A potent phospholipid activator and mediator of many leukocyte functions, including platelet aggregation, inflammation, and anaphylaxis. It is produced in response to specific stimuli by a variety of cell types, including neutrophils, basophils, platelets, and endothelial cells. -  Aβ  A peptide of 36–43 amino acids that appears to be the main constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. -  LTA  A major constituent of the cell wall of Gram- positive bacteria able to stimulate a specific immune response in animals. -  S1P  A blood borne lipid mediator and major regulator of vascular and immune systems. In the vascular system, S1P regulates angiogenesis, vascular stability, and permeability. In the immune system it is recognized as a major regulator of trafficking of T-cells and B-cells. Inhibition of S1P receptors has been shown to be critical for immunomodulation. } Anti-microbial resistance Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat that leads to an estimated 700,000 deaths annually with projections of 10M deaths per year and lost economic potential of $100T by 2050. The Unites States has released a national action plan to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria. Recombinant pGSN (rhu-pGSN) supplementation alone shows improved survival and decreased bacteria counts in several mouse models. The bactericidal activity of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was shown to be inhibited by F-actin. It formed bundles with F-actin in vitro that were dissolved by pGSN, restoring bactericidal activity. Bacteria growth was reduced when pGSN was added cystic fibrosis sputum, which is known to contain F-actin. When mice were given a penicillin-resistant strain of pneumococcal pneumonia, penicillin had no effect on mortality or morbidity. rhu-pGSN improved both mortality and morbidity on its own, and the combination of rhu-pGSN and penicillin gave further improvement of both suggesting possible synergism. Levels of the Protein Plasma gelsolin is produced and secreted by virtually every cell type with muscle contributing the largest amount. At normal levels of >200 mg/L, it is a highly abundant protein in the circulation. Decreased levels are often associated with ill health and disease. A growing list of insults showing loss of pGSN includes pneumonia, sepsis, SIRS, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease, HIV-1 disease, tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme, malaria, hepatitis, burns, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, trauma associated with injury or surgery, bone marrow transplantation, and multiple sclerosis. Severely depleted levels (<150 mg/L) strongly correlate with the onset of systemic inflammatory dysregulation and predict increased morbidity and mortality across a broad spectrum of clinical presentations in the critical care setting. The magnitude of decline in pGSN correlates with the likelihood of mortality in seriously ill patients. Mediators of inflammation, the body’s innate healing mechanism, accumulate at the site of the injury to begin the processes of defense and repair, and the depletion of local plasma gelsolin allows them to do their work. As a result of actin exposure at the local site of injury, the local level of plasma gelsolin around the site of the injury initially becomes depleted as it “debrides” the local involved site (See Debridement). While local pGSN levels are depressed, the presence of this abundant protein in the circulation ensures that the inflammatory process stays local, and that stores of plasma gelsolin are available to address further injury so that the overall immune response remains intact (See also: Binding and inactivation of diverse inflammatory mediators). Measured levels are higher in serum than plasma due to pGSN's affinity for fibrin. Animal studies Human plasma gelsolin has been produced in recombinant form in E. coli (rhu-pGSN), and its efficacy as a therapeutic has been studied in vivo in a number of animal models of inflammatory disease. In models of injury that cause actin release and inflammatory organ damage, pGSN levels consistently drop. In models where gelsolin levels are replenished, adverse outcomes can be prevented. To date, rhu-pGSN has been studied in many independent laboratories providing evidence of efficacy in >20 animal models. Following are descriptions of selected animal studies. All stated results are relative to those of placebo treatments. {  summary =\\"Table of summarized results from twelve animal models of disease. This table contains three columns: The first column lists the investigated disease (e.g. influenza); the second, the animal model used (e.g. mouse); and the third, the major results of the trial.\\" + style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Summary of clinical results from selected animal studies - ! Disease !! Model !! Results -  influenza  mouse  Mice given a highly lethal form of influenza show increased survival at 12 day end of study point as well as decreased morbidity and decreased expression of pro- inflammatory genes when rhu-pGSN is administered 3 to 6 days after infection. -  pneumococcal pneumonia  mouse  Mice were given pneumococcal challenge 7 days after being given influenza. Supplementation of endogenous pGSN with rhu-pGSN improved bacterial clearance 15-fold, reduced neutrophilic inflammation, improved recovery of initial weight loss, and showed a dose- dependent improvement on survival. No antibiotics were given, demonstrating pGSN's ability to stimulate the innate immune response. -  burn  rat  Rats receiving 40% body surface area burn showed 90% loss of endogenous pGSN within 12 hours and slowly recovered to almost 50% after 6 days. Intravenous administration of rhu-pGSN partially or totally prevented the burn-associated increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability in a dose-dependent manner. See also -  sepsis  mouse  Mice were intraperitoneally injected with endotoxin (LPS) or subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (a small amount of intestinal contents were extracted into the cavity and the wound was sutured). Endogenous pGSN levels dropped to 50% post-challenge. Survival substantially improved with rhu-pGSN treatment in both groups: LPS study, 90% vs 0%; CLP study: 30% vs 0%. -  sepsis  rat  Relative to a previous mouse study a smaller dosage of rhu-pGSN decreased morbidity in a double CLP sepsis model relative to sham treatments. The dosage was effective in intraveneous and subcutaneous injections, but less so with intraperitoneal injection (qualitative but not statistically significant) despite the latter being the site of injury. This evidenced the need for systemic availability of pGSN for recovery. -  Acute respiratory distress syndrome  mouse  Mice were subjected to 95% O2 for 72 hr and treated with rhu-pGSN after 24 and 48 hr. Hyperoxia produced severe diffuse congestion and edema with hemorrhage visible in lung histopathology, 70% reduction in endogenous pGSN, and an influx of neutrophils. Treatment with rhu-pGSN led to a 23% decrease in the authors' histpathological score, 65% decrease in BAL fluid neutrophil count, and a 29% reduction in an overall acute lung injury score. -  stroke  rat  Researchers induced middle cerebral artery occlusion with a direct injection of Endothelin 1, a vasoconstrictor. Animals treated with pGSN at the site of injury exhibited 50% infarction area, >2x use of both forepaws during exploration, and a decrease in whisker-stimulated reaction time (9 s, pGSN treated; 19 s untreated; 1 s healthy rat). -  multiple sclerosis  mouse  Mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis show decreased levels of pGSN in blood and increased levels in the brain. All rhu-pGSN-treated mice survived whereas 60% of control died within 30 days. Rhu-pGSN mice scored significantly better on clinical scores, smaller brain lesions imaged by MRI, less extra-cellular actin, and decreased myeloperoxidase activity. -  Alzheimer's  mouse  Two models of Alzheimer's were tested. Treatment mice that were tail-injected with a plasmid encoding human pGSN showed reduction in Aβ42 in brain tissue, decreased amyloid, and increased concentration of microglia. See also -  radiation  mouse  Mice irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays show a 50-75% decrease in endogenous levels of pGSN. Bleeding is a common consequence of heavy radiation exposure. Administration of rhu-pGSN improved clotting indices in later, but not middle, phases of recovery. Rhu- pGSN improved GSH and MDA oxidative stress indices. -  pain and inflammation  mouse  Intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid causes a pain response quantified by writhing. Both rhu-pGSN and diclofenac sodium (DS), a standard analgesic drug, caused ~55% reduction in writhing. Similarly, tails placed in hot water caused mice to retract them in an average time of 2.3 s. DS increased time to withdrawal from 5.1 to 7.6 s depending on time of drug administration; rhu-pGSN increased time from 2.9 to 5.5 s. Both DS and rhu- pGSN showed significant reductions in swelling associated with paw injection of an inflammatory agent, γ-carrageenan, as well as decreases in measured cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. -  diabetes  mouse  Endogenous levels of pGSN decrease by ~50% with type 2 diabetes(T2D) in both humans and mice. In an oral glucose tolerance test, rhu-pGSN brought blood sugar levels down to levels comparable to sitagliptin, a T2D drug. Daily dose of rhu-pGSN kept blood sugar levels close to normal for the 7 days of treatment. Daily dose of sitagliptin increased levels of endogenous pGSN. } Human Studies In 2019 BioAegis Therapeutics conducted a Phase Ib/IIa safety study administering recombinant human pGSN to sick patients with community acquired pneumonia; no safety issues were found. A 2020 Phase IIb placebo-controlled efficacy study has been approved for acute severe pneumonia due to COVID-19. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients surviving on Day 14 without mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or dialysis. ==See also== Cytoplasmic gelsolin Actin Vitamin D-binding protein ==References== Category:Proteins ","title":"Plasma gelsolin"},{"id":"35927257","text":"Mansurabad (, also Romanized as Manşūrābād) is a village in Arabkhaneh Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.
