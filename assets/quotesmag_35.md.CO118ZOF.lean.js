It was opened for passenger operations in 1866. It became a junction station in 1881 with the opening of the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway. A new station building was built after the Second World War, which is now heritage-listed. In the past, it was served by long-distance traffic. Extensive modernisation of the platforms and buildings have taken place since 2014. == Location == The station is located in the north of the town and almost a kilometre from the town centre. It is located at line kilometre 59.2 of the Halle–Hann. Münden railway and is the starting point of the line to Erfurt. It faces Lengefelder Straße and Kaltenborner Weg. The next station towards Halle is the halt (Haltepunkt) of Riestedt, towards Hann. Münden, it is Wallhausen station and on the line towards Erfurt, the first stop is at Oberröblingen station about five kilometres away. == History== Old entrance building (1910) Construction of the station in Sangerhausen began in 1865. The railway between Halle and Hann. Münden was opened for passenger operations on 10 July 1866. The first entrance building was built in the same year. Sangerhausen became a junction station in 1881 when the line to Erfurt was added. An ammunition train exploded in the station in 1944 and it was destroyed. Today's entrance building was built in 1963. == Infrastructure==  Platforms and tracks Entrance building (2014) In 1979, there were three platforms in Sangerhäusen station. A total of 17 tracks were available. Their structural length was between 50 and 855 metres. In addition, five connecting tracks ran from the station to local factories. The shortest was 190 metres long and the longest was 149 metres. Extensive modernisation work was started in September 2014. The platform, the passenger subway and the platform were renewed by 2016 for €5.5 million and, in addition, lifts were installed.  Entrance building The present entrance building, which is located south of the railway tracks, was built in 1963. It was the first station to be built in the GDR and is protected as a monument. The painter and graphic designer, Wilhelm Schmied created a particularly striking wall mosaic in the station's entrance hall. It shows the Mansfeld Land with its agriculture and mining. The round kiosk on the forecourt was built in 1957. Round kiosk built in 1957 (2015) In 2009, the town of Sangerhausen acquired the station for €405,000 from Deutsche Bahn. The refurbished entrance building is scheduled to open in October 2016. €6 million has been earmarked for this. Subsequently, it will contain a service point, tourist information, WCs and the municipal library.  Other facilities  Two loading roads led to the tracks. In addition, there was a freight-handling facility with six parallel tracks, as well as a head and a side ramp each of which had a carrying capacity of 60 tonnes. There were eleven water cranes available for steam locomotives that could pump two cubic metres of water per minute.  Repair shop and washing facility The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 2 June 2014 for the construction of a repair shop and a washing facility for the Abellio trains. It was built on the site of the former freight yard south of the railway tracks in the eastern part of the station. On 5 June 2015, its overhead wires were energised. Abellio took over the operation on the line to Erfurt in December 2015. Sangerhausen was chosen for its good location in the Saale-Thuringia-South Harz network. == Locomotive depot== The former locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) of Sangerhausen was located northwest of the station. There were two locomotive sheds with turntables. Locomotive shed 1 was built in 1899 with a turntable with a diameter of 20 metres. It was built out of yellow bricks. Locomotive shed 2 was built in 1923 with a diameter of 23 metres. Until 1945, the depot was supervised by the Reichsbahn railway division (Reichsbahndirektion) of Kassel. From 3 January 1947 to 15 January 1947, it was supervised by the railway division of Halle. After that it belonged to the railway division of Erfurt. In the 1990s, the Sangershausen Locomotive depot was closed. The rolling stock maintenance was reorganised and merged into fewer locations. The maintenance of trains is now carried out for the most part in Magdeburg and Halle. The building is now unused. Its sale was considered in 2011/12. == Connections==  Long distance Durchgangszug (express trains) stopped in Sangerhausen until 1992. In 1993/94, the station was served by InterRegio trains. These ran between Frankfurt (Main) and Halle as well as between Konstanz and Dessau. From 2010 onwards, a pair of IC trains ran between Leipzig and Frankfurt (Main) on Sundays. This was part of line 50 and was run as a relief train. This train was removed from the timetable in December 2014. Thus Sangerhausen lost its long-distance traffic.  Regional services {  - ! Line !!

On Metacritic the film has a score of 71% based on reviews from 12 critics. Jay Weissberg of Variety both complimented the effort and questioned the historical omissions that might taint the portrait of their subject: \\"Getting Swinton on board doing double duty as voiceover actor and executive producer was a wise marketing decision, while the involvement of Thelma Schoonmaker and Kevin Brownlow assured appropriate attention would be given to the artistic and archival sides. The film also features staged talking heads speaking words sourced from letters and journals. Absent however is any hint of Edward Said’s accusation of Orientalism that’s intermittently colored modern assessments of Bell’s crucial role in the foundation of modern Iraq; also missing are any negative assessments by her Arab contemporaries. Viewers attuned to chronology may object to the way footage from different eras is mixed together — the visuals accompanying a 1918 letter are certainly not from 1918 — yet that kind of criticism could be considered pedantic. The bottom line is that Oelbaum and Krayenbühl have fleshed out a complex, fascinating figure, and after a successful festival career, it’s good to see 'Letters' getting its due via limited release.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Official website Category:2016 films Category:2010s documentary film stubs ","title":"Letters from Baghdad"},{"id":"54232920","text":"Selina Priest (formerly Goodman; born 21 August 1990) is an Australian rules footballer who plays for the Brisbane Lions in the AFL Women's. ==Early life== Priest was born in 1996 on the Gold Coast, Queensland.

One stone weighing 24.5g was observed to fall by the Desert Fireball Network observatory in Western Australia on 13 April 2010 at 10h36m10s UTC. It was recovered by the DFN on 3 November 2010, and was found 150m from its predicted fall location based upon the observed trajectory and calculated mass. == Petrography, composition and physical properties == Mason Gully is an ordinary chondrite\\\\- a group of meteorites which are frequently found on the Earth's surface and make up a large proportion of the observed meteorite falls. It was identified as belonging to the H chemical class, which has a high siderophile element component (H), typically contains small chondrules, and has an oxygen isotopic signature closest to the terrestrial fractionation line out of all ordinary chondrites. A petrologic type of 5 indicates it has undergone a moderate amount of thermal metamorphism, which has caused some chemical homogenization and resulted in less distinct chondrule edges and secondary mineral growth. {  !Mineral !Composition (electron microprobe) - Olivine Fa18.7 - Orthopyroxene Fs16.4Wo1.2 - Clinopyroxene Fs5.9Wo45.5 - Plagioclase Ab82.9An12.5Or4.6 - Chromite (Fe/Fe+Mg = 0.84; Cr/Cr+Al = 0.86) } This meteorite shows low levels of terrestrial weathering, consistent with residing in a region of low precipitation for 7 months. The stone was 3 cm in length along the longest axis, approximately 50% fusion crusted, and has a porosity of 10.7%. It exhibits very low levels of shock and is therefore classified as an S1. == Petrogenesis and origin == Mason Gully has an unusually high porosity and different mineralogy when compared to other H5 chondrites. Its porosity comes from intergranular void spaces rather than microscopic cracks, which is likely due to the low shock the rock has experienced. Whilst lithophile elemental abundances are consistent with other H chondrites, the uranium and titanium abundances are noticeably lower. Conversely, heavy refractory elements are enriched relative to the H chondrite group. The modal ratio of olivine:pyroxene is oddly low for an H5 ordinary chondrite; typical values are ~1.31, and yet modal analyses indicate the ratio for Mason Gully is as low as 0.84. Plagioclase abundance is also lower than typical values, but Fe(Ni)-metal abundances are higher than average for the H5 group. Metamorphic temperatures were determined based upon the measured oxygen fugacity, using the two-pyroxene and olivine-spinel geothermometry methods. The two-pyroxene approach yielded temperatures between 865 °C - 900 °C, whilst the olivine- spinel approach yielded a temperature of 705 °C. These results are very similar to the H6 Kernouvé implying both samples experienced similar metamorphic temperatures. The source of the unusual features of the sample relative to other H5 chondrites has yet to be agreed upon. The olivine and pyroxene ratios may result from the metamorphic history of the parent body; reactions between olivines, low-Ca pyroxenes and Fe metal could result in a larger abundance of low-Ca pyroxene in reducing conditions. Alternatively, plagioclase and olivine can produce orthopyroxene at high temperatures, or high sulphidation may have caused the olivines to break down into Fe metal and orthopyroxenes. All explanations are plausible, however no consensus has been reached to identify the most probable process, as each holds implications that are not fully supported by the observations in Mason Gully. == Fall description == The fireball associated with this sample was observed by two Desert Fireball Network cameras in the east of the Nullarbor Plain. The luminous trajectory began at an altitude of 83.46 km and ended at 23.84 km altitude. The incoming rock, of ~40 kg initial mass, was travelling with a velocity of 14.53 km/s when it entered the atmosphere, and then proceeded to decelerate to a terminal velocity of 4.1 km/s, over a period of 6 seconds. The angle of atmospheric entry with respect the Earth's surface was 53.9° The calculated orbit was typically Apollo-type, and largely existed outside of the Earth's orbit. The aphelion was found to be in the outer asteroid belt.

Since the cell cycle regulator p53 is known to transactivate both pathways, several studies focused on p53 mutation and expression analyses. Meinhold-Heerlein and coworkers showed that poorly differentiated ovarian cancer harbors p53 mutations to a higher extent than hitherto assumed.I. Meinhold-Heerlein, E. Ninci, H. Ikenberg, T.

Together with Garret Hampton, Meinhold-Heerlein performed oligonucleotide array analyses and identified novel molecular markers suitable as therapeutic targets. The main focus lay on the evaluation of serous tumors, which represent the majority of ovarian cancer cases. An important finding was that non-invasive tumors of low-malignant potential (so-called borderline tumors) showed a nearly identical expression pattern when compared to highly differentiated invasive carcinomas. Moderate and poorly differentiated carcinomas, by contrast, shared a nearly identical expression pattern with respect to one another but which was significantly different from the former pattern.

Twelfth Census of the United States, 1900. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1900. T623, 1854 rolls. Year: 1900; Census Place: Cuba, Lake, Illinois; Roll: 314; Page: 4A; Enumeration District: 0130; FHL microfilm: 1240314 was a \\"black widow\\" whose activities spanned the turn of the 20th century. Light was shed on her murders only after she resorted to murdering outside of her immediate family, beginning with the death of policeman Arthur Bissonette. Authorities were alerted and suspicion arose over the peculiar and similar fates experienced by her two husbands, several immediate family members and two associates known to her. Sketch of the accused killer by journalist Marguerite Martyn, November 1911 ==Early life== Louise Vermilya was born Louesa Woolf in Cook County, Illinois, to parents Wilhemina (née Munaroe) and John Woolf, Prussian immigrants. She was the oldest daughter of five girls and third oldest child out of 11 siblings.Tenth Census of the United States, 1880. (NARA microfilm publication T9, 1,454 rolls). Records of the Bureau of the Census, Record Group 29. National Archives, Washington, D.C. She married 24-year-old Fred Brinkamp on April 2, 1885 at the age of 16 and moved to the village of Barrington within the Cuba township of Lake County in northern Illinois.\\"Illinois, Cook County Marriages, 1871–1920.\\" Index. FamilySearch, Salt Lake City, Utah, 2010. Illinois Department of Public Health records. \\"Marriage Records, 1871–present.\\" Division of Vital Records, Springfield, Illinois. ==Early murders== The string of homicides began in 1893, when Vermilya claimed the life of her first husband, Fred Brinkamp, while living on their farm near Barrington, Illinois. The coroner ruled Brinkamp's death to be attributed to a heart attack. Following his death, she inherited $5,000 from a life insurance policy Brinkamp had which named her as the beneficiary. Due to Brinkamp's age at death, no suspicions arose as it was thought to be due to natural causes.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/11/01/105033813.pdf Brinkamp left behind six children, two of whom met similar fates to their father shortly after his death. Cora Brinkamp was the first to die at age eight, with her sister Florence following at three and a half years old. Undertaker E.N. Blocks, who owned a mortuary in Barrington, recalled that Louise enjoyed working around bodies. Despite not being a salaried employee, Vermilya seemed too eager to work in the mortuary with Blocks \\"while I never employed her for a couple of years I couldn't keep her out of the office\\". Blocks also stated that \\"at every death she would seem to hear of it just as soon as I and she would reach the house only a little behind me.\\" ==Subsequent murders== Vermilya moved to Chicago in 1906 with her minor charges in tow. It was while living in Chicago that Vermilya claimed the life of her stepdaughter, 26-year-old Lillian Brinkamp. The coroner, however, ruled her cause of death as \\"acute nephritis\\". Due to the unusually high number of deaths within the Brinkamp family, they were thought to be cursed. Around this time, Vermilya remarried to a man named Charles Vermilya, aged 59. Three years later, he died, apparently victim to sudden illness. He left his widow with $1,000 in cash and a home in Crystal Lake, Illinois, forty-five miles northwest of Chicago. Her stepson, Harry Vermilya, followed his father in death shortly after quarreling with Louise over the sale of the Crystal Lake estate. No suspicions arose after the deaths, and coincidence was blamed. The following year, in 1910, Vermilya inherited $1,200 after the death of her 23-year-old son from her first marriage, Frank Brinkamp. Frank had been married to a widow and divorced her, receiving $1,200 from the divorce proceedings. On his death bed, he voiced suspicion involving his stepmother to his fiancée, Elizabeth Nolan, stating he was \\"going the way his father did.\\" Uncharacteristically, Vermilya began poisoning acquaintances. Jason Rupert, a railroad fireman, fell ill after dining with Vermilya on January 15, 1910. He died two days later, but was only the first in a series of deaths of boarders in Vermilya's home. In February 1910, Vermilya married Richard Smith, a train conductor and boarder at her home. On March 11, 1910, two days after eating a meal prepared by Vermilya, he met a similar fate to Vermilya's prior boarder. His death was determined to be caused by gastritis. Smith was still married at the time of his supposed nuptials to Vermilya. His estranged wife believed that the circumstances surrounding her husband's death were suspicious. She believed that Smith was murdered for one of three reasons, \\"either Mrs. Vermilya loved Smith and was afraid that he would desert her, or he was murdered for his money, or C. C. Boysen, the undertaker, thought to be in love with Mrs. Vermilya, was jealous\\". While her motive in the earlier deaths of her family members was pursuit of financial gain, they became unclear after the deaths of her boarders, for whom she gained no monetary rewards. ==Undoing== It wasn't until Arthur Bissonette came to dine with Vermilya did she experience her undoing. While dining with his father at the Vermilya home in October 1911, both of the Bissonettes started experiencing abdominal pain. Homicide detectives became suspicious after questioning Bissonette's father who states he saw Vermilya sprinkling \\"white pepper\\" over their meals prior to serving them. This led the Chicago Police Department to do an autopsy on Bissonette's body revealing arsenic poisoning. Vermilya was taken into custody soon after its discovery. There is some speculation as to whether Bissonette's death was precipitated by financial motives. With Vermilya's assistance, Bissonette was accepted into the Home Guard, a militia-like entity for those men who were unable to qualify for the military. In return, Bissonette was to make a will naming Vermilya as the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy he would carry as a result of this employment. Vermilya was to name him as her beneficiary for the life insurance that she carried after their nuptials. Bissonette authored a will shortly before his death, but named his fiancé who lived in nearby Kankakee, Lydia Rivard, as the beneficiary of his estate. Though Vermilya was listed as the witness, she claimed to have no knowledge of ever signing the document. ==Suicide attempts and trial== On November 4, Vermilya was rushed to the hospital after playing victim to her own modus operandi. Authorities reported Vermilya had been ingesting the \\"white pepper\\" since her house arrest on October 28. By November 9, she was reported as being near her death with comorbidities such as valvular heart problems adding to her demise. Vermilya was discharged from the county hospital on November 24, 1911. By December 9, she was stricken with paralysis, which physicians stated was a permanent condition. Nevertheless, Vermilya was required to attend all her court proceedings, and usually did so in a wheelchair. Vermilya was arraigned before Municipal Judge Walker on 6 November 1911 for the death of Arthur Bissonette. On 7 March 1912, nolle prosequi was filed after it had been found that Bissonette had been taking medication containing arsenic. In an effort to expedite court proceedings, a conference was held between the presiding judge, Judge Kersten, attorney Joseph R. Barres, and the prosecutor on the case. The prosecutor was reticent as to the strongest points and the motive in Smith's death stating \\"There are several cases as to which Mrs. Vermilya may be tried and I don't want to try her more than once...For that reason, I want to pick out the strongest one and I have concluded the Smith one is the strongest one.\\" Vermilya was rearrested and charged for the murder of Richard Smith. Evidence of arsenic poisoning was found in Smith's liver via autopsy conducted by Prof. Walter S. Haines, the Rush Medical College expert chemist. His findings showed \\"arsenic in sufficient quantities in the viscera of the two men to cause death.\\" Vermilya was taken into custody and detained in the county jail where she attempted suicide again. The trial began on 21 March 1912 and lasted 16 days. The case was resubmitted for trial ten days later, ending in another hung jury as evidence against her was deemed circumstantial. There were subsequent difficulties that further complicated the progression of the trial. Juror selection had become an arduous process as men were unsure of if they could inflict the death penalty on a woman as freely as they would on a man. Nearly every man called forward had established a bias based on current newspaper accounts of the crime. A good percentage of these were sure that because of the impression made by the newspaper stories, they could not give a fair verdict. About 50% of those who passed this barrier had a prejudice against circumstantial evidence which necessitated their being excused. Up to this point, the jury had been composed of an all-male panel, who were unable to not only impose a death sentence on a woman, but whose attitudes toward female defendants in murder cases also came into question. By 12 October 1912, Vermilya was still in custody awaiting trial along with fellow murderess Louisa Lindloff. On 28 June 1913, Vermilya was released on $5,000 bail due to concerns for her continued failing health and exposure to the summer heat in a non-airconditioned jail, pending her trial for the poisoning of Richard Smith. ==Dismissal of charges== On 18 April 1915, a conference was held between the Assistant State's Attorney, Michael Sullivan, and the State Attorney Hoyne regarding continuation of the trial. It was decided that it would be impossible to obtain a conviction on the Smith indictment, with Sullivan remarking \\"We could only see that another trial would entail a heavy cost without any assurance of being able to show any strong evidence.\\" Per the request of Vermilya's attorney, all charges were dropped. Vermilya led a quiet life following the dismissal of her charges as no further documentation exists of her in local papers past this point. It is estimated that Vermilya amassed a total of $15,000 from the nine deaths. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== Category:1868 births Category:Date of birth uncertain Category:1893 crimes Category:19th-century American women Category:20th-century American women Category:American female serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:People from Illinois Category:Suicides by poison Category:People from Cook County, Illinois Category:1913 deaths ","title":"Louise Vermilya"},{"id":"54233398","text":"Von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the VWA5A gene. == References  Further reading == * * ","title":"VWA5A"},{"id":"54233403","text":"Park Hee-jung (born October 20, 1988) is a South Korean actress.

In 1668 The Ticket Office was managed by one of the members of the Navy Board. Its management was taken out of the hands of the Comptroller in 1668 and given to the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts. The Comptrollers of Treasurers' Accounts respectively inspected all the accounts of the money received and paid by the Treasurer of the Navy. In December 1679 the commissioners of the Navy Board ordered a thorough inquiry into naval expenditure resulting in the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts was abolished, and its duties reverted to the Comptroller. In 1691 after a period of internal auditing the office was restored though this time supported by an Assistant Comptroller Treasurers' Accounts. In May 1692 superintendence of the Ticket Office once again relieved the Comptroller of one of his duties and was placed back under the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts office. The post existed until 1796 when the Navy Board was restructured: the post of the three Controllers of Accounts were abolished along with the Clerk of the Acts following recommendations put forward by the Commissioners on Fees who conducted an internal audit within the Navy Office.

By the 1820s he had a chimney-sweeping business. During this period there was a movement to prevent boys being employed in cleaning chimneys. The Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys (SSNCB) was founded in 1803 under the patronage of the Duchess of Gloucester. The SSNCB and the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce promoted a competition for an effective apparatus for cleaning chimneys. Several systems were invented; one invented by George Smart was awarded a gold medal by the Society of Arts in 1805. However it had little effect on the campaign.Jackson, Lee (2014). Dirty Old London: The Victorian Fight Against Filth Yale University Press, p. 218. Glass invented an apparatus in which cane rods were connected with brass screw joints, creating a flexible rod which coped with bends in the chimney. A wheel was fixed to the top of the stock, to prevent jamming. Glass's system, introduced in 1828, was considered superior to Smart's apparatus. It was approved by the SSNCB, and from 1829 the Home Secretary Robert Peel ordered the apparatus to be used in government offices. In 1834 there was a committee of the House of Lords to which Glass gave evidence, resulting in the Chimney Sweepers Act 1834. He did not patent his invention. He was active in the campaign against the employment of \\"climbing boys\\", prosecuting those who tried to evade the provisions of the Act. Since many sweeps still employed boys, there were further Acts of Parliament: the Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840 and the Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864. Glass died at his home in Brixton on 29 December 1867, in his seventy-sixth year; his death was noticed in the Court Circular, since Queen Victoria was interested in the campaign. His son Henry became a newspaper editor, and another son Joseph became a Congregational minister. ==ReferencesCited sources== * Category:1791 births Category:1867 deaths Category:People from Colchester Category:English inventors Category:19th- century inventors Category:English philanthropists Category:19th-century philanthropists ","title":"Joseph Glass (inventor)"},{"id":"54233504","text":"Albert Severin Roche was a distinguished French soldier, known for his numerous successful missions and capture of enemy soldiers throughout the First World War. ==Origins== Albert was born at Reauville in the Drôme in south-eastern France on the 5th of March 1895. He was the third son from a modest family of farmers. ==First World War== Initial Rejection In 1913, Albert was rejected by an assessment board of the French Army, because it considered him too puny to serve. This apparently delighted his father who stated, “We need arms to run the farm.\\" In August 1914 Albert, however, wanted to fight and in opposition to his father took his bag and ran away. Albert reported in another district at the Alban training camp, which assigned him to the 30th Battalion of Chasseurs. His military training did not go well, he was badly assessed and not respected. His temper finally got the better of him and he walked off the camp, whereupon he was immediately caught and arrested for desertion. His defence on these charges was that he was not a deserter and that \\"Bad soldiers are sent up there, but I want to go where we fight.” Assigned to the Blue Devils Albert was assigned on 3 July 1915 to the 27th Battalion of Chasseurs Alpins, engaged in Aisne, in today's Hauts-de- France region, a northern region of France. This battalion was nicknamed the \\"blue devils\\" by the Germans.http://diables-bleus-du-30e.actin forum.com/t2737-albert-severin-roche Assault on a German block house Albert volunteered to destroy a German block house. Creeping up to the enemy's trenches, Albert noticed that the Germans were pressed against a stove in the block house for heat and threw a handful of grenades down the stove chimney. The position was neutralized with several deaths and the surrender of the survivors, believing that they had been attacked by a large force. Albert returned to his base with the captured machine guns and 8 prisoners. Sudel Trench In another instance, Albert found himself one day the only survivor of his position, a trench in Sudel in Alsace. He then used the weapons of his dead comrades, alternately firing them, making the enemy believe the resistance of the garrison was still resolute. The Germans eventually gave up this attack. Captured and Interrogated Albert volunteered regularly for reconnaissance missions, but on one occasion, he was captured with his wounded lieutenant. Isolated in a bunker during an interrogation, he managed to overwhelm and kill his interrogator stealing his pistol. If this was not enough, he returned to the French lines with 42 new prisoners while wearing his wounded lieutenant on his back. Leopard crawl through no-man’s land During the battle of the Chemin des Dames, Albert’s captain was seriously wounded and fell between the lines. Albert crawled under fire for six hours to reach him, and then another four hours to finally hand him over to stretcher- bearers. Exhausted, he fell asleep in a guard hole, but was awakened by a patrol that mistook him for sleeping on duty. Abandoning a post under fire, was punishable by being shot within 24 hours. In spite of his denials, Albert had no witnesses and he was sent to a detention barracks to await execution. Albert wrote to his father: \\"In an hour I shall be shot, but I assure you that I am innocent. “ As Albert was taken in front of a firing squad, a messenger arrived interrupting them: Albert’s captain had just awoken from his coma and brought his favorable testimony.Albert Rochepériodique=Le BleuetJanuary 2010 ==End of hostilities== By the end of World War One, Albert had been wounded nine times, and had personally captured 1,180 prisoners. At the end of the conflict, at 23, he was still a second class soldier. On November 27, 1918, on the balcony of the City Hall of Strasbourg, Albert was presented to General Foch in front of a huge crowd with these words: \\"Alsatians, I present to you your liberator Albert Roche. He is the first soldier of France! \\". Shortly before, Foch had surprisingly discovered Albert's service record, exclaiming: \\"He has done all this, and he has no rank.\\" ==Honors== Legion of Honor Albert was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honor from the commander of the Army of the Vosges, General de Maud'huy. He was also invited to dine with General Mangin. File:Legion Honneur Officier ribbon.svgOfficier de la Légion d'honneur. File:Ruban de la médaille militaire.jpg Médaille Militaire.

Tomb of the Unknown Soldier In 1920 he was one of 11 soldiers chosen to select the Unknown Soldier and with seven of his comrades, carried the coffin of the latter at the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe. Ceremony of the choice of the unknown soldier destined to rest under the Arc de Triomphe; Underground citadel of Verdun. Reconstruction. Funeral of Lord French Albert was a member of the French delegation to London in 1925 with General Gouraud to attend the funeral of Field Marshall Lord French. He and five representatives of the Army was also invited to dine with King George V. Later life and death Albert returned home to Valréas in the Vaucluse where he worked modestly as a municipal labourer, marrying a woman from Colonzelle in the neighboring Drôme. They had two daughters, Magali and Marie-Pierre. Albert eventually became a firefighter in the powder magazine of Sorgues. In April 1939, Albert was involved in an accident with a car on departing from a bus that took him to work. The car belonged to the former President of the Republic, Emile Loubet. He was transferred to the Sainte-Marthe hospital in Avignon, where he died on 14 April (at \\"five o'clock\\" according to his death certificate) at the age of 44. As the historian Pierre Miquel writes in La Grande Guerre day-to-day, Editions Pluriel writes: \\"This man had gone through four years of war, he had been wounded nine times, he had been close to death a thousand times, Almost unjustly shot as a mutineer. He had escaped all dangers, all accidents. [...] All of this to be killed twenty years later, on his way home, on the descent of the bus. \\" Honours Édouard Daladier, the politician and prime minister of France requested that full military honors be given to him at his funeral. In 1971, the municipality of Réauville erected a cenotaph to his memory in front of his family house. Originally buried in Sorgues, the body of Albert Roche was transferred on September 22, 1967 to the cemetery Saint-Véran d'Avignon, where it still lies (square 40, row north, grave 15). A stela in his memory was inaugurated in Réauville in 1971 by the Mayor of the time, Gabriel Jarniac. ==ReferencesSee also== * Chasseurs alpins Category:1895 births Category:1939 deaths Category:French military personnel of World War I Soldiers Category:Grand Croix of the Légion d'honneur Category:Western Front (World War I) Category:Military units and formations of France in World War I ","title":"Albert Severin Roche"},{"id":"54233509","text":"The 1945 Hamilton by-election was a by-election held during the 27th New Zealand Parliament in the Waikato electorate of Hamilton.

This triggered the Hamilton by-election, which was contested by four candidates. Hilda Ross contested the election for the National Party. She had served as a member of the Hospital Board and Council in Hamilton for several years and was at the time of the election the Deputy-Mayor. Former Hamilton MP Charles Barrell was selected as the Labour Party's nominee. He had been MP for Hamilton between 1935 and 1943, before losing his seat to Findlay. Leader of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), John A. Lee was his party's candidate. Lee had lost his seat of in 1943 following his split with the Labour Party in 1940 and contested the Hamilton seat in an attempt to re-enter Parliament, where the DLP no longer had any presence. The fourth person to put their name forward was independent candidate Douglas Seymour. The by-election was held soon after VE Day (which Walter Nash decided should be celebrated on 9 not 8 May), and a \\"badly-timed\\" gazette notice calling up more 18-year olds for unspecified military service. The National Party proposed that New Zealand troops should be withdrawn from Italy and New Zealand's role in the Pacific restricted to food supply.

The tunnel gets its name from the Z shape of the road that it will replace between Sonamarg and Gagangir. The 6.5 km long road tunnel is being constructed near Gagangir or Gagangair in Ganderbal district of the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It has a high strategic importance for India. The tunnel would avoid the regions of snowfall and avalanches. Along with Zoji La tunnel (which is 22 km from Z-Morh tunnel towards Leh), the Z-Morh tunnel will ensure year-long road connectivity between Srinagar and Kargil which currently remains closed for about seven months due to snow. The tunnel will also benefit social and economic development of region apart from boosting the tourism in Sonmarg region as the area witnesses heavy snowfall during winters. Once all tunnels are put in place, the time to drive from Srinagar to Leh will be reduced and will not require overnight halt at Kargil. The entire stretch will become motorable throughout the year. ==Features== * Z-Morh tunnel will be two lane bi- directional road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonmarg starting at 69.5 km stone and ending at 81.3 km stone on NH 1. * The tunnel itself is be 6.5 km long, and the length of the approach roads between the tunnel portals and NH 1 will be 6.05 km for both the ends. * The tunnel will be 10 m wide with the 7.5 m wide parallel escape tunnel to be used in emergency, escape tunnel will also act as the railway tunnel. * The tunnel is designed for flow of 1,000 vehicles an hour at an approved maximum speed of 80 km per hour. * The tunnel is located at elevation of above sea level. * The total capital cost of the project was approved at ₹2,717 crore in the 53rd Meeting of PPPAC held in July 2012. This includes ₹36.48 crore for the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities. * The tunnel will help keep the highway open the entire year. * The western portal of the tunnel (towards Srinagar) is located at village Rezan just after Gagangir at and the eastern portal (towards Sonamarg) is located at village Shetkari at . There is a ventilation tunnel at Adit between the two portals. * The tunneling is being built using NATM tunneling method in view of fragile Himalayan Geology. ==Development & Construction agency== Initially it was USD450 million project being executed under PPP (DFBOT - Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer Mode) by Srinagar-Sonamarg Tunnelway Limited, an Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS;) owned company which was also concessionaire for the project. Earlier, the project was envisaged to be implemented by BRO as owner and nodal agency however now it has been transferred to NHIDCL for implementation. ITNL (IL&FS; Group entity) was appointed as EPC contractor which in turn has appointed Apco - Titan (Joint Venture) as a construction contractor for the project. The work was suspended by construction contractor in July 2018 due to financial stress of concessionaire (IL&FS; Group). Project Authority (NHIDCL) foreclosed the concession agreement / contract with Srinagar Sonamarg Tunnelway Limited and reinvited the bids for construction of balance work in June 2019. The revised (Balance Work) Total Project Cost stands at ₹2,378 crore (~USD 340 Million). The work need to be completed in 42 months from the appointed date. August 2019 - Apco Infratech emerged as lowest bidder in the International Bidding Process. December 2019 - Authority issued Letter of Award (LOA) for the project.

The tunnel along with 6.5 km long Z-Morh Tunnel, (which is 22 km before Zoji La tunnel towards Srinagar) will ensure year-long road connectivity between Srinagar and Kargil which currently remains closed for about seven months due to heavy snowfall on the Zoji La pass which is situated at an altitude of 3,528 m (11,578 feet) on Srinagar-Kargil-Leh highway. Zoji La is 15 km from Sonamarg and provides a vital link with Drass and Kargil in Ladakh but remains closed for 6-7 months (from November to May) during winter due to heavy snow fall & snow avalanches. It takes more than 3 hours to cross the pass but the tunnel will reduce the time. This tunnel was a strategic requirement of the army and the Ladakhi people as the pass is close to LOC and vulnerable to hostile actions by terrorists. Zoji La was re-captured from Pakistani raiders under Operation Bison. The Zoji La tunnel project was approved by the Government of India in January 2018 and the commencement of its construction was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018. The tunnel will be built under EPC mode (engineering, procurement, construction) wherein the Government of India will provide the money and the executing agency will do the construction and will later hand over the project to the Government of India. Earlier it was supposed to be built under PPP mode where private player was supposed to make the investment and later recover via toll but despite calling for bids five times since 2013, no bid came for one time and for rest only single private player showed interest thus each time bid was cancelled. ==Features== * . Its construction period will be five years because of a very difficult terrain where in some areas the temperature drops to minus 45 degree Celsius. * The project aims at construction of 14.2 km long two-lane bi-directional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.2 km long egress tunnel. The western portal is at Baltal at about 3,000 m altitude (about 400 m lower than the altitude of the existing highway there), about 15 km east of Sonmarg. The eastern portal after Zoji La is at Minamarg towards the Dras / Kargil end. The length of the tunnel does not include the lengths of the approach roads to both ends of the tunnel from the existing highway. * Planned as a smart tunnel, it will have the latest safety features such as fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply, emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs, traffic logging equipment and tunnel radio system. * The safety features will include emergency telephones and fire-fighting cabinets at every 125 metre, pedestrian cross- passages at every 250 metre and motorable cross passages and lay-bye at every 750 metre. * The civil construction cost of the project is ₹ 4,900 crore. The total capital cost of the project is ₹6,800 crore. It includes the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years. * Defense forces have to face a hard time ensuring supplies to border posts during winters across Zoji La pass which is most strategic for the entire Kargil sector which has seen intrusion and war in the past. The tunnel will help keep the highway open for the entire year. ==Project timelines== * October 2013: Cabinet approves the road tunnel project. * May 2017: Four private players bid for the ₹10,000 crore project namely L&T;, ILFS, Jaypee Infratech and Reliance Infra. * June 2017: Contract to be awarded to the bidders by June end and work to start in August 2017. * July 2017: IL&FS; Transportation Networks Ltd, the firm which developed Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel emerged as lowest cost bidder for the tunnel.

Construction is expected to begin in 2020, with the first of nine vessels to enter service in the late 2020s. The Program is expected to cost AU$35 billion and a request for tender was released in March 2017 to three contenders: Navantia, Fincantieri, and BAE Systems as part of a competitive evaluation process. The genesis of the Future Frigate Program came in 2009, when the Rudd Government’s Defence White Paper signalled Australia’s intent to \\"acquire a fleet of eight new Future Frigates, which will be larger than the Anzac-class vessels\\" with a focus on anti- submarine warfare. With an initial tender expected in 2019–20, in 2014 the Abbott Government announced that work had been brought forward, funding a preliminary design study focussed on integrating a CEAFAR Radar and Saab combat system on the hull of the Hobart-class destroyer. Following a report by the RAND Corporation into options for Australia’s naval shipbuilding industry, the Government announced an $89 billion naval shipbuilding plan. This plan brought the schedule of the Future Frigate Program forward by three years and announced a \\"continuous onshore build program to commence in 2020\\" in South Australia. A competitive evaluation process was announced in April 2016, with Navantia, Fincantieri, and BAE Systems revealed as the contenders to design the ships. In June 2018, the BAE Systems Type 26 was selected as the winner. == Project history ==  Planning  The 2009 Defence White Paper outlined \\"ambitious plans for the Navy’s surface fleet.\\" At its centre was the requirement for twelve Future Submarines and \\"eight new Future Frigates, which will be larger than the Anzac-class vessels\\" with a focus on anti-submarine warfare. The accompanying Defence Capability Plan stated that a Government decision would be expected \\"beyond 2019.\\" The 2013 Defence White Paper reaffirmed the Future Frigate program and suggested that the replacement of the Anzac-class vessels could be brought forward. In the early 2010s, there was significant concern over the ‘valley of death’ in Australian shipbuilding following the conclusion of the Hobart-class destroyer program. With concerns both over the cost and management of the Hobart-class program and a union campaign calling for job security at government-owned shipyard ASC, the Abbott Government committed over $78 million to preliminary studies to determine whether the Hobart-class hull could be utilised for the Future Frigate. The 2016 Defence White Paper increased the number of future frigates by one to a total of nine ships. Against this backdrop, the Abbott Government commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation to determine options for the future of naval shipbuilding in Australia. The report found that: * Australia could sustain a naval ship building industrial base by carefully managing a continuous ship building strategy in the longer–term, with a regular pace of delivering the new ships. But this would need to be premised on reform of the Australian naval ship building industry and significant improvement in productivity. * Australian naval ship builders can sustain an 18–24 month pace of large ship construction starts if Defence carefully manages its acquisition program and keeps the Future Frigates operational for 25 to 30 years. * The gap between the completion of the Air Warfare Destroyer project and the start of the Future Frigate cannot be overcome, but the impact could be lessened. The cost of building naval ships in Australia is 30–40 per cent greater than United States benchmarks, and even greater against some other naval ship building nations. Australia is currently one of the most expensive places to build naval vessels. This premium can be reduced by improved productivity. In response to the RAND report, the Government announced a $89 billion shipbuilding program. This included bringing forward the Future Frigate program with a \\"continuous onshore build programme to commence in 2020.\\" The budget for the program has been confirmed as \\"more than $35 billion\\" and the Government claims it will \\"directly create over 2,000 jobs.\\" All nine vessels will be constructed in Adelaide, South Australia.  Tender process  In April 2016 the government announced a competitive evaluation process between Navantia, Fincantieri and BAE Systems for the Future Frigate Program. Additionally, a tender for the combat system was also held between Saab and Lockheed Martin. In October 2017, the government announced that the Aegis combat system and a Saab tactical interface would be used for the class.Two Hobart-class destroyers being fitted out / built in South Australia. HMAS Hobart is in the water, HMAS Brisbane is in dock.  Navantia (F-5000)  Navantia offered an evolution of its F-100 base design, which forms the basis for the destroyers currently being built in Adelaide for the RAN. In 2014, the Australian Government commissioned a study to use the Hobart-class hull which Navantia claims shows it could be adapted to meet the requirements of the Future Frigate program, including integration of the CEAFAR radar and Saab 9LV combat system. Based on this study, a Navantia-designed Future Frigate would have 75 per cent systems commonality with the Hobart-class destroyers. Systems on the Hobart class include a 48-cell Mk41 vertical launch system, five-inch Mark 45 naval gun, undersea warfare capabilities including a hull mounted sonar and active and passive towed variable depth sonar, as well as the capability to operate a MH-60R \\"Romeo\\" Seahawk. The Hobart-class Air Warfare Destroyer program has attracted criticism for cost and schedule over-runs: by 2015 the program was three years behind schedule and $800 million over budget. In late 2015, Navantia was selected to bring a shipbuilding management team into government-owned shipyard ASC as part of the AWD reform program. Following the reform program, initiated by ASC prior to Navantia management integration, ASC has stated that \\"when we reach our budget on ship three...we will be as good as the other Aegis yards in the world.\\" The Italian FREMM Carlo Margottini  Fincantieri (Modified FREMM)  Fincantieri offered the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant of its FREMM frigate (Bergamini class). The Italian Navy will purchase four ASW FREMMs and six of the general purpose variants. The vessels are equipped with an Italian weapons and sensor suite, including a 76 mm OTO Melara gun fore and aft, a 16-cell vertical launch system (VLS) for missiles including the MBDA Aster 15 and 30. Fincantieri says that the general hull configuration of the Bergamini design will require little or no modification to meet Australian requirements, including the incorporation of the CEAFAR radar, although it has confirmed that some redesign would be required if Australia requires the incorporation of the US Navy Mark 45 five inch naval gun. However, when discussing the FREMM, Minister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne said that \\"the weaponry of course will be United States' weaponry. That will be integrated into the winning vessel.\\" In 2016, Pyne stated that \\"one of the advantages for this company is that this vessel has been built, it is already in operation. One of the disadvantages is that the company doesn't operate here.\\"  BAE Systems (Type 26/Global Combat Ship)  BAE Systems offered an export variant of its Type 26. First conceived in 1998, the UK's Future Surface Combatant program was originally intended to replace the Royal Navy's Type 22 and Type 23 frigate fleets. In 2010 BAE Systems were given a four-year contract to fully design a new class of warship, the Type 26 or 'Global Combat Ship.' The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review announced that the Royal Navy would procure 13 of the vessels, however repeated delays saw the program scaled back to eight vessels with five slightly smaller, less capable but substantially cheaper vessels, that being the Type 31 warships, which have a target unit cost of £250m, which are also being ordered by the Royal Navy for missions that do not require the level of technology and the same level of survivability. Construction of the ships in the UK was expected to start in 2016, but was delayed with critics saying it was \\"due to the Minister of Defence's attempts to save money.\\" Work began in 2017 with the first vessel set to enter service in the early 2020s, after Australia's build program commences. The Royal Navy's eight vessels are expected to cost £8 billion (AUD $13.8 billion). The Type 26 'Reference Ship Design' will be equipped with an advanced anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability, a 24-cell strike length Mk 41 VLS for long-range strike weapons such as the Tomahawk, a 48-cell vertical launch silo (VLS) for Sea Ceptor anti-air missiles, a 5-inch gun, and is capable of landing a Chinook helicopter on its flight deck. In April 2018 BAE claimed it would be able to offer the best ASW performance of the three contenders, despite not having a ship of the class in the water at the time. == Design and construction == The Hunter-class frigate will be an Australian variation of the Type 26 class frigate that is to be operated by the Royal Navy from the mid-2020s. The class will have a full load displacement and will be approximately in length. The vessel will be capable of sailing in excess of and will have a full complement of 180 crew. A Saab tactical interface with the Aegis combat interface will be used. The vessel will be able to carry one MH-60R ASW helicopter, and has the ability to host other Australian aircraft such as the MRH90 helicopter. The ships will be built by BAE Systems Australia at Osborne Naval Shipyard.Here comes the Hunter: BAE awarded $35bn SEA 5000 Future Frigate Contract Defence Connect 28 June 2018 == Ships == { - efefef;\\" !

During the war he passed on to the French Resistance information which he received in the course of his work as a navy radio operator based for six months in Jersey, and subsequently in mainland France. After the war he was for many years deputy General Secretary of the East German Peace Council. Sources sometimes identify him by the cover names he used in the course of his wartime activities. These were Robert Vidal and Hugo Erb. == Life == Kurt Hälker was born into a catholic family in Duisburg during the Franco-Belgian occupation. By the time he left school the French army had left the Rhineland: he undertook and completed an apprenticeship as an upholsterer. Shortly after that, however, in 1941 he was conscripted into the army. He was sent to Paris, which had been under German occupation since the previous summer, and trained for work as a naval radio operator. Hälker had managed to live the first nineteen years without taking too much interest in political developments, and his initial reaction to being sent to Paris as a member of an army of occupation was delight that he would become a \\"god in France\\". Half a century later, in a television interview, he recalled how the daily experience of Nazi occupation, including the frequent shooting of hostages, progressively transformed \\"essentially unpolitical people\\" such as himself into committed opponents of the war. In the Autumn of 1941 he was sent on a six month posting to Jersey and Guernsey. The German high command became convinced, from the accuracy of British bombing of military targets on the Channel Islands, that detailed information was being transmitted to the British from the islands. They were probably right. Details of resistance activity within the German forces occupying the islands are sketchy, but the radio operator Kurt Hälker was part of it. Early in 1942 the Germans sent a Corvette Captain to investigate. Hälker later recalled that when he arrived on his brief but intense intelligence gathering mission this man was the most senior German naval officer on the islands, which was eloquent testimony to the priority that the Nazi authorities attached to his mission. After his posting in the Channel Island he returned to Cherbourg and then Paris where he was seconded to work, still as a radio operator, with the Naval General Staff. Through Hans Heisel, a junior German naval officer described in one source as a \\"like minded comrade\\", he came into contact with various exiled German resistance fighters such as Thea Saefkow. Through such links he also formed contacts during or before November 1942 with the French resistance. It has been estimated that there were around 3,000 Germans who were members of the French resistance. Most of these had been forced into exile because they were Communists or Jews (or both). Among German resistance members Kurt Hälker was unusual in that he was also a serving member of the German military machine. As a radio operator he was able to obtain militarily important information and pass it to Resistance members who were able to convey it to London. After the formation of CALPO (\\"Comité „Allemagne libre“ pour l'Ouest\\" /\\"National \\"Free Germany\\" Committee in the west\\") in September 1943 he was also involved in distributing printed anti-war material provided by the Resistance to members of the German army. He was already by this stage, with Hans Heisel and Arthur Eberhard, a member of a three man resistance cell recently formed within the army: the cell's activities would remain undetected by the German authorities till after the Liberation of Paris in August 1944. In the run up to the Liberation of Paris Kurt Hälker slipped away from his work with the German navy and joined the rapidly emerging French resistance force, using the cover name Robert Vidal. He was among the insurgents who defended the building occupied by the French Communist Party central committee from attacks by German troops. At around this time he became a member of the French Communist Party, till the start of 1945 acting as a German speaking representative of the CALPO on the frontline in Alsace-Lorraine where the fighting continued for several months after Paris itself had been liberated Starting in March 1945, together with three dozen other \\"German antifascists\\" he embarked on a training course at St. Germain-en-Laye near Paris, with the US army and the OSS (US intelligence services). \\"Robert Vidal\\" disappeared overnight and he became \\"Hugo Erb\\" of the US army. Selection resulted from an approach made by the OSS to the CALPO organisation in France. The idea was that those selected should be parachuted into Germany behind the German lines. However, it quickly became apparent that the speed of the German military collapse during the next few weeks was making Hälker's original understanding of the tasks to be undertaken out of date. Instead of being trained in close combat with fire arms and use of plastic explosives, the real objective became working to ensure that with Germany under military occupation, political developments should progress towards the right kind of democratic future according to the evolving perceptions in Washington and London. Hälker had only agreed to the training after very careful consideration, and he now took steps to withdraw from it. His withdrawal from the programme was agreed, \\"on medical grounds\\", with effect from 2 June 1945. In July 1945 he returned to Duisburg, his home city, joined the Communist Party of Germany, and became involved in youth work. Since May 1945 the western two thirds of Germany had been divided into zones of military occupation. Duisburg was in the British military occupation zone. Two years later, still himself aged only 25, he relocated to Leipzig in the Soviet occupation zone. There are suggestions that one reason for moving may well be that since 1945 he had been repeatedly contacted by the British and American intelligence services, keen to find out more about the war time exploits of Robert Vidal and Hugo Erb. In Leipzig he pursued his studies and became a member of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), established through a contentious party merger in April 1946 and now well along the way to emerging, in October 1949, as the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party state. His wartime \\"antifascist\\" activities as a young man were celebrated openly and without nuance in ways which further to the west would, some felt, have been unthinkable, at least before 1990. In East Germany, from 1950 Hälker held various positions in the peace movement and in \\"antifascist\\" organisations, both full-time and honorary. In 1976 he was appointed Deputy General Secretary of the East German Peace Council. == Awards and honours == * 1979 Patriotic Order of Merit in silver * 1982 Star of People's Friendship in silver * 1987 Patriotic Order of Merit in gold ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Duisburg Category:French Resistance members Category:Kriegsmarine personnel ","title":"Kurt Hälker"},{"id":"54234075","text":"The Lady with the parrot () is a 1988 Soviet romantic comedy directed by Andrei Prachenko. ==Plot== Every year Sergei Zverev goes on vacation to the Black Sea coast. During this time he leads the life of a real wealthy playboy. Imported clothes, a cassette tape recorder, a polaroid camera, stories of how he traveled as a pilot of international flights around the world... all this creates the status of an irresistible man for Sergei, whose charms no \\"simple Soviet woman\\" can withstand. However, the unexpected happens: Sergei genuinely falls in love with a very beautiful but strange woman, who carries a cage with a talking parrot everywhere. The woman calmly rejects all of Sergei's \\"patterned\\" courtship, she reports that she has a son who is an excellent student and a prodigy, and that she is married, but all this only fuels Zverev's interest. From time to time, Sergei is annoyed by a certain teenager named Aleksei, who came for holidays to a pioneer camp, but because of his behavior is constantly subjected to disciplinary punishment. As a result, the \\"disobedient\\" pioneer is expelled from the camp, and the lady with the parrot, without saying goodbye to Sergei, also disappears. Zverev returns to Moscow, and it turns out that there is no \\"playboy\\" but only a well-organized \\"screen\\". In fact, Sergei works as a simple aircraft technician at the Sheremetyevo-2 airport, and all the foreign accessories he brags to girls at sea are rented: the tape recorder, camera, and even sunglasses! Zverev begins his \\"ordinary\\" inexpressive life, but now he has a goal: to find the woman with whom Sergei fell in love. Alas, Sergei's search is futile, but here he is unexpectedly found by Aleksei, that same hooligan teenager. Having become attached to the boy with a father's sympathy, Zverev tries to help the \\"difficult\\" teenager. In turn, Aleksei, deeply pained by the fact that he is brought up by a single mother, tries to present Zverev in school as his father. The scandal that arises in this regard ends in the police department, where Aleksei's mother - the very same \\"lady with a parrot\\" - comes running. ==Cast== * Aleksei Zharkov as Sergei Alekseevich Zverev * Svetlana Smirnova as Elena Ivanovna Stepantsova * Dmitry Kopp as Aleksei Stepantsov, Elena's son * Maria Vinogradova as Sergei's mother * Stanislav Sadalsky as Gennady Fedorov * Tatyana Lyutaeva as Milochka * Albert Filozov as Aristarch * Bohdan Beniuk as director of the pioneer camp * Nikolai Gudz as Gennady, friend on the beach * Sergei Ivanov as Victor, the driver airport * Aleksandr Vokach as cardiologist ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1988 films Category:1988 romantic comedy films Category:Soviet romantic comedy films Category:Dovzhenko Film Studios films Category:Russian-language films Category:Soviet films Category:Russian romantic comedy films Category:Russian films Category:1988 comedy films ","title":"The Lady with the Parrot"},{"id":"54234091","text":"Praznik or Prazdnik means holiday in several Slavic languages and may refer to *Darren Praznik (born 1961), Canadian politician *Rok Praznik (born 1980), Slovenian handball player *Holiday in Sarajevo (Praznik u Sarajevu), a 1991 Bosnia and Herzegovina film *Praznik za uši, a 2009 album by the Serbian DJ Timbe ","title":"Praznik"},{"id":"54234095","text":"Le Visage nuptial (The Nuptial Face) is a secular cantata for soprano, contralto, choir of women and orchestra by Pierre Boulez.

He is the representative of Mangalkot constituency in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly as a member of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) party. He is also the president of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind's West Bengal branch. == Political career == Chowdhury contested the 1984 and 1989 Lok Sabha elections from Katwa constituency as a candidate of the Indian National Congress. Chowdhury has become a prominent figure in state politics during Nandigram Movement. Chowdhury also contested from the Basirhat seat as a candidate of the All India United Democratic Front in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. In January 2016, Chowdhury hinted at the possibility of his Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind party entering into a pre-poll alliance for the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections. In March 2016, it was announced that Chowdhury would contest from the Mangalkot constituency as a candidate of the Trinamool Congress party. He said that the Mamata Banerjee-led government has worked for the development of minorities. He won the election by defeating his nearest rival, Sahajahan Chowdhury of Communist Party of India (Marxist), by nearly twelve thousand votes. He was subsequently made a cabinet minister and given the portfolio of minister of state with independent charge in mass education, library, and parliamentary affairs. He became one of the seven Muslims who was made a cabinet minister. In December 2016, Chowdhury stated in an interview with the Indian Express that only 1.5% of West Bengal's population was using the government libraries. In response, Chowdhury said that the government was taking steps to \\"turn people back towards books and libraries\\". He also said that journals, magazines, and books about agriculture must be present in libraries funded by state government. == Views ==  Indian Muslims  Chowdhury is of the opinion that Muslims should not learn patriotism from other citizens of the country or from the government. According to him, if Muslims had not participated in the Indian freedom struggle, then it would have taken \\"another 100 years\\" for India to become independent. He said that if India became a Hindu state, then India would collapse.  Government of Bangladesh  Chowdhury is critical of the Sheikh Hasina led government of Bangladesh. He has criticised the government for their treatment of the Razakars (an anti Bangladeshi paramilitary force organised by Pakistani army during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971) whom he has hailed as \\"religious leaders\\". He also said that assaulting pious citizens was a part of the Bangladesh government's conspiracy.

Reacting to it, Chowdhury said that the practise was an integral part of Islam. He termed the verdict of supreme court as \\"unconstitutional\\" and criticised it for interfering in Islamic laws. He also said that Muslims would continue to follow the sharia (Islamic laws). Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party national secretary Rahul Sinha demanded his arrest as according to him, Chowdhury refused to abide by the laws of the country. == Controversies == On 17 May 2017, Ebela reported that Chowdhury was using a red beacon on his car to avoid traffic congestion after a Central BJP Govt. order the previous month banned its use. He defended himself by contrasting his usage of the beacon with that of Noor ur Rahman Barkati, imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque, who had previously been spotted using it. Chowdhury said that unlike Barkati, his beacon was given to him by the state government and he had not received any notice from that authority to discontinue its use. Regarding Barkati, Chowdhury commented that if he is to continue to live in India, he must follow Indian rules. He also stated his belief that Barkati would obtain a political position in Pakistan. Consequently, Barkati was sacked from his post. ==References== Category:Bengali Muslims Category:Politicians from Kolkata Category:West Bengal MLAs 2016– Category:All India Trinamool Congress politicians from West Bengal ","title":"Siddiqullah Chowdhury"},{"id":"54234258","text":"Anthony Braxton's Charlie Parker Project 1993 is an album featuring live and studio performances of compositions associated with Charlie Parker arranged and performed by saxophonist Anthony Braxton which was recorded in Switzerland and Germany in 1993 and released on the HatART label as a double CD in 1995.Anthony Braxton discography accessed June 6, 2017Enciclopedia del Jazz: Anthony Braxton accessed June 6, 2017 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated \\"Braxton uses the melodies and some of the original structures of such tunes as \\"Hot House,\\" \\"Night in Tunisia,\\" \\"Bebop,\\" and \\"Ko Ko\\" as the basis for colorful and often-stunning improvisations.

It revolves around a few Chinese scholars and their encounter with a tiger spirit named Miao. ==Plot== En route to Xi'an for an examination, Minzhou (岷州) scholar Gong (龚) stops for a drink at an inn, where he is approached by a burly but well-mannered stranger who introduces himself as \\"Miao\\" (苗). Gong buys him a drink, but this does not satisfy Miao; Miao heads to the marketplace and returns with a considerably large jar of wine. Gong is coerced into drinking a few more cups of liquor, whereas Miao drinks from a bowl. Miao admits to Gong that he is not adept at entertaining guests, and tells him that he may leave if he pleases. Shortly after bidding Miao farewell, however, Gong's horse collapses; Miao, who happens to be in the vicinity, comes to Gong's aid, and single-handedly carries the horse to a nearby lodge. Amazed and thankful, Gong invites Miao to another round of drinks. Following their examinations, Gong and a group of friends are picnicking at Flowery Hill (华山), only to be joined by Mr. Miao, who is warmly received by Gong's friends. Amidst the food and wine, a game of \\"capping verses\\" (completing the couplet) is proposed; Miao suggests that the stakes be death, but this is taken to be a joke by Gong and his friends. The game proceeds, but the quality of verses recited by Gong's friends is deemed so egregious by Miao that he agitatedly roars and jumps about. Simultaneously, Gong's friends have begun to act rowdily under the influence of alcohol. After a failed attempt to quieten them, an incensed Miao transforms into a tiger and kills all of the men present, save Gong and a fellow scholar Mr. Jin (靳). Three years after the harrowing experience, Mr. Jin, having recently obtained his master's degree, returns to Flowery Hill. To his shock and horror, he is stopped by Ji (釉), one of Gong's friends and Miao's victims. Ji reveals that he has been condemned to enslavement under Miao for eternity, unless he can find another soul to replace his. Ji pleads with Jin to help him find a scholar for Miao to eat in three days' time. Miao has laid out the conditions that the victim must be at the Dark Dragon Ridge (苍龙岭) dressed in scholar attire. Jin has no actual intention of helping Ji but recounts the tale to a friend, Jiang (蒋). Jiang, who has a vendetta against another scholar named Yu (尤), plots to make Yu the next victim of Miao's because Yu had performed as well as he did during the examination. Despite the strange caveat that only Yu is to come dressed, Yu accepts Jiang's invitation to a reception at Flowery Hill. However, a government official and family friend of Jiang's coincidentally is at the hill too, and upon learning of Jiang's presence, calls upon him. Embarrassed to greet him in a state of déshabillé, Jiang borrows Yu's clothes and is promptly devoured by Miao in tiger form. ==Literary significance== Allan Barr observes that \\"Pu Songling was keenly conscious that vivid effects could be achieved by the use of dialogue\\" and \\"he frequently relied on colloquial speech to lend immediacy to a scene\\" as is evidenced by Mr. Miao's rebuke of Gong's friends at the picnic. In his essay \\"How to Make a Story Beautiful: On Aesthetic Dialectics of Liao zhai zhi yi\\", Li Hong-xiang lists Mr. Miao as an example of how \\"(i)n order to highlight the aesthetic effect, Pu Songling tended to describe the sudden changes of beautiful things in his story.\\" Mr. Miao's metamorphosis into a tiger is a reflection of his apathy towards Gong and friends' \\"boring talking and mutual admiration\\". Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges especially enjoyed Mr. Miao, amongst a few other Liaozhai entries, and wrote a prologue for it to appear in his Library of Babel (1979), a collection of writings on his favourite stories.SUNG-LING, P'U El invitado tigre.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has dark green, brown and white flowers which lean slightly forwards and have sharply-pointed petals and a long, curved labellum. ==Description== Pterostylis longipetala is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of between three and six egg-shaped, dark green leaves lying flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide which leans slightly forwards, on a flowering stem high with between three and five stem leaves. The flowers are dark green, brown and white. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal has a thread-like tip long and the petals have pointed tips. The lateral sepals are erect, held closely against the galea, have thread-like tips long and a V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide, dark reddish-brown and curved, and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from April to June. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis longipetala was first formally described in 1943 by Herman Rupp from a specimen collected at Batemans Bay. The description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (longipetala) is derived from the Latin words longus meaning \\"long\\" and petalum meaning \\"petal\\". Rupp did not give a reason for this epithet but did note that \\"the petals are narrower and longer than in any other species of Pterostylis known to me\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The curved greenhood grows on moist slopes in coastal and near coastal forests in New South Wales. ==References== longipetala Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1943 Category:Taxa named by Herman Rupp ","title":"Pterostylis longipetala"},{"id":"54234339","text":"Commonhead (Airdrie North) railway station, was a railway station in Airdrie, Scotland.

The battle began on 6 June 2017, and was supported by airstrikes and ground troops from the US-led coalition. The operation was named the \\"Great Battle\\" by the SDF. It concluded on 17 October 2017, with the SDF fully capturing the city of Raqqa. The battle ran concurrently with the lifting of the Siege of Deir ez-Zor (2014–2017) as well as the Battle of Mosul (2016–17), which started seven months earlier, as part of an effort by the CJTF–OIR and its allies to strip ISIL of its regional centers of power and to dismantle it as a state. == Background == In 2015, ISIL began to fortify the city and its surrounding areas with bunkers and a network of tunnels. By June 2017, Raqqa remained the only major Syrian city fully under ISIL control and was, therefore, its effective center of operations. With its large number of foreign fighters, Raqqa was a planning center for terrorist attacks against European cities. The Raqqa campaign was launched by the SDF on 6 November 2016 in an effort to capture the city, and it had resulted in the SDF capturing a large amount of territory in the Raqqa Governorate from ISIL, including the city of al-Thawrah, and the infrastructure at Tabqa Dam and Baath Dam. As many as 500 US special forces operated on the ground in northern Syria in support of the Raqqa campaign. The US and other coalition members supplied heavy weapons, intelligence collection, communications support and other assistance to the SDF as part of their intervention in the conflict. The battle began in the wake of a tumultuous period for the coalition, as internal pressures had been elevated by the Qatar diplomatic crisis, which had seen diplomatic relations between Qatar and other coalition members severed, and was publicly supported by President Donald Trump. Local residents stated that many ISIL militants had already abandoned the city and traveled to Deir ez-Zor in anticipation of the impending attack on their capital. ISIL assaulted the regime's enclave in Deir ez-Zor, which at the time was split between ISIL and the Syrian government, launching a series of strong attacks against the Syrian Army from June to August. It was reported by AFP that in a US airstrike, 21 civilians were killed while attempting to flee Raqqa by dinghy on the Euphrates River. The event was also reported by Al Jazeera, but with uncertainty as to who carried out the bombing.\\"Beirut (AFP) - 06/05/2017 - 22:50\\" (Top site flash \\"US-led strike kills 21 civilians fleeing Syria's Raqa\\"), afp.com, 5 June 2017.

The Associated Press The battle was officially launched by the SDF in the dawn of 6 June 2017. The offensive came from Raqqa's north, east, and west. Supported by US airstrikes, the SDF attacked the former base of the 17th Division north of Raqqa and the Mashlab district in the southeastern part of the city. By the end of the day, the SDF captured more than half of Mashlab district and also attacked the Andalus district in the northwest. The SDF also captured the village of al-Jazra. On 7 June, the SDF captured a ruined fortress on the edge of the city, and a U.S. coalition official said the attack was set to accelerate. On the same day, the SDF captured Tell Harqal districts of the city. Brett H. McGurk, the special envoy with responsibility over the US-led military coalition, stated that the fighting in the city would be accelerated by the failures of ISIL in the Battle of Mosul, and stated that the forces were prepared for a \\"difficult and very long-term battle\\". The SDF entered the 17th Division base and the nearby sugar plant on 8 June, but retreated, due to casualties as a result of ISIL resistance. The following night, Coalition airplanes heavily struck the city, killing 23 civilians. At the same time the SDF, backed by special forces, were close to capturing the entire al-Mashlab neighborhood. Later that day, the SDF entered Sabahiyah neighborhood from the western axis and captured the remaining parts of the al- Mashlab neighborhood within hours. On 10 June, the SDF entered the Roman suburb and were locked \\"in fierce fighting\\", while they were reinforcing the western half of Al-Sabahiya. The International Coalition itself stated that they had destroyed numerous targets in Raqqa between 7–9 June; a minefield, eleven fighting positions, four vehicles, three ISIL headquarters, two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and an ISIL-held building. At the end of the day, the SDF took control over Harqaliya Suburb. During the battle, US forces used white phosphorus munitions in the city several times, per ISIL video footage and statements, the Syrian foreign ministry, and human rights organizations. A spokesman for the US military did not confirm or deny the statements, the US later confirmed it was using white phosphorus \\"for screening, obscuring, and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures\\". SDF fighters walk through a destroyed area in the suburbs of Raqqa. By 11 June, 79 civilians reportedly had been killed. The SDF captured \\"wide parts\\" of the Roman suburb and advanced into al-Sinaa neighborhood and al-Hal Market near the northern banks of the Euphrates River. ISIL fighters attacked the sugar plant that the SDF had captured three days earlier in the northern part of the city. On 12 June, the SDF began the process of capturing al-Sinaa and al-Hattin neighborhoods, along with the al-Sinaa industrial zone. SDF captured Sahil village southwest of Raqqa after clashes between the SDF and ISIL broke out and lasted until the next morning. On 14 June, the SDF entered the al-Berid neighborhood in the western part of Raqqa, following intense fighting in which an ISIL suicide bomber was killed. On 15 June, the SDF captured the al-Sinaa neighborhood and entered the Batani neighborhood. Several CJTF-OIR troops were injured by a VBIED planted by ISIL in al-Sinaa neighborhood. On 18 June, the SDF captured Kasrat Sheyh Juma village, to the south of Raqqa. The SDF forces also captured a greenhouse in the south of the city as well as Batani neighborhood in the east.  Encirclement of Raqqa  On 19 June, ISIL counter-attacked at the old city walls and managed to encircle a group of SDF fighters, among them members of the Elite Forces (SEF). The Elite Forces then attempted to break the encirclement of their comrades, shooting down an ISIL bombing drone, breaking through to their fifteen besieged fighters at the Bab Baghdad gate of the old city. In the course of this operation, the SEF lost its first member in the battle for Raqqah city and its fourth in the \\"Euphrates Wrath\\" Operation. On the next day, the SDF, supported by especially heavy airstrikes, continued to advance in northwestern Raqqa amid \\"desperate\\" attempts of ISIL to stop their progress. An ISIL counter-attack on the Batani district was repelled. On 23 June, the SDF began an assault on the Qadisiya district, which led to fierce fighting in the area. On the next day, the SDF completely encircled and besieged Raqqa city, trapping about 4,000 ISIL militants. The United States Marine Corps provides fire support to the SDF during the battle. By 25 June, the SDF had captured the western Qadisiya district, whereupon ISIL launched a major counter-attack, leading to extremely heavy fighting. On the following day, however, the SDF finally captured all of Qadisiya, making it the sixth district in the city under SDF control. In response, ISIL launched multiple counter-attacks in the city and on the Euphrates' southern bank, though these failed. By the end of the day, the SDF had also taken control of al-Farkha village to Raqqa's southwest. CJTF–OIR spokesman Ryan Dillon said that the resistance of ISIL increased as the SDF further advanced into the city. On 27 June, the SDF launched an attack against the old city, which was repelled by ISIL, though they succeeded in capturing the village of al-Ghota south of Raqqa. On 28 June, the SDF clashed with ISIL militants near a kindergarten in Ar-Ruda neighborhood in eastern Raqqa, killing 8 ISIL fighters. The SDF also entered al-Nahda neighborhood in western Raqqa where they clashed heavily with ISIL militants, which resulted in 19 ISIL fighters being killed. In course of the next two days, the SDF cut off all remaining escape routes for ISIL from Raqqa. Clashes between the SDF and ISIL militants also began in al-Yarmouk and Huteen neighborhoods in western Raqqa, while the SDF captured another village south of the city. Nevertheless, a major ISIL counter-attack on 30 June, spearheaded by numerous VBIEDs, retook the al-Sinaa neighborhood after 350 SDF fighters who were part of an unidentified Free Syrian Army (FSA) unit abandoned their posts and fled.  SDF advance into the Old City  SDF fighters in a largely destroyed part of Raqqa's downtown During 1–2 July, SDF fighters cleared the al-Hal market in eastern Raqqa of ISIL militants, while the SDF continued to advance in other neighborhoods of the city with the help of heavy CJTF–OIR airstrikes. Ratla, a village southeast of the city also fell to the SDF. The SDF entered the Hashim Bin al-Melek neighborhood in southern Raqqa and the al-Yarmouk neighborhood in the west on 3 July. In the night of 3–4 July, a CJTF–OIR precision airstrike destroyed a 25-meter long section of the medieval wall surrounding Raqqa's old city. This was done so that the SDF could finally enter the heavily fortified Old City, while at the same time preserving most of the wall. The SDF advanced into the Old City, capturing the Palace of the Maidens, albeit encountering heavy resistance. Meanwhile, the US-backed forces continued to make progress in other parts of Raqqa, reportedly capturing half of the Hisham ibn Abd al- Malik neighborhood, while a major assault by the Elite Forces managed to retake the al-Sinaa neighborhood from ISIL. Some less disciplined Elite Forces units, however, were demoralized by the heavy fighting and retreated from the city, against the orders of the SDF command, and their own superiors and comrades. Nevertheless, the other Elite Forces units remained at the frontlines. Heavy fighting in the Old City continued through the next two days, and the SDF advances were slow despite heavy airstrikes in their support. Intense ISIL counter-attacks inside Raqqa and south of the city at Ratla were mostly repelled, though ISIS militants managed to retake a part of the al-Hal market. Especially intense clashes also took place in the western city, mostly for the al-Bareed neighborhood, as both sides launched repeated attacks in attempts to gain territory. By 6 July, pro-SDF media stated that the Coalition forces were making progress in the west and that the ISIL defenses there showed signs of breaking. The international coalition also sent further weapons, supplies, and reinforcements to Raqqa. Meanwhile, ISIL put up a bounty of approximately US$4,000 for every US soldier or foreign SDF fighter killed. Over the next days, the fierce fighting in Raqqa continued, with the SDF capturing the Harun al-Rashid Castle in the Old City, and the al-Mazarie Square in the west. By 10 July, the battle in Raqqa was described as increasingly \\"desperate house-to-house fight\\" without frontlines, as ISIL fighters holed up in small pockets of resistance that proved to be only extremely difficult to clear out for the often not adequately armed SDF fighters. ISIL suicide attacks also hampered the advance of the Coalition forces. Yazidi fighters of the YJÊ also participated in the battle for Raqqa. Yazidis were massacred or enslaved by ISIL, and the YJÊ aimed to liberate Yazidi slaves who still lived in the city, while taking revenge on ISIL. The SDF progress was also reportedly hindered by disputes within the SDF and the distrust of the locals toward the anti-ISIL Coalition. Due to ISIL propaganda and long-standing distrust between the ethnic groups in Syria, many of Raqqa's Arabs are wary of the Kurdish forces within the SDF. On 8 July, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the Arab Elite Forces had withdrawn from Raqqa as result of disputes within the SDF, and their sometimes inferior battlefield performance; the SDF, however, denied this statement as baseless rumors and said that the Elite Forces were still involved in the operation. One Elite Forces' commander, Abu Saleh, later confirmed that at least the unit of around 1,000 fighters that he led had withdrawn from Raqqa; nevertheless, there were still reports that at least some of the Elite Forces still continued to be active in Raqqa. The reports of the Elite Forces' reported retreat furthered the distrust of the local population toward the SDF. There were also statements that members of the Manbij Military Council were looting houses in the city. Whereas progress in Raqqa city during this time proved slow, the SDF made some progress south of the Euphrates on 10 and 11 July, capturing two villages, including al-Ukeirshi, which had served as major military base for ISIL. Over the next four days, the SDF made some major advances, securing the al-Batani, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, al-Bareed and al- Qasyeh neighborhoods, and about 50% of the old city; after heavy counter- attacks, however, the SDF had to abandon some of its newly captured territory in the old city and the aforementioned neighborhoods. Meanwhile, CJTF–OIR chief commander Stephen J. Townsend said that the only options for the ISIL fighters in Raqqa were to \\"surrender or be killed\\". Between 15 and 18 July, fighting mostly concentrated on the western neighborhoods of al-Tayyar and Yarmouk as well as the Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik neighborhood in the southeast, as both sides tried to gain/regain ground. Even though the SDF eventually prevailed in the former two, the coalition made little to no progress in the eastern and Old City, while casualties among both the SDF as well as the civilian population had risen drastically. As result, the SDF began to shift its strategy in the east and the Old City, advancing slower and with more caution, in order to minimize further losses and to avoid the destruction of historic monuments, such as the Abbasid al-Atiq Mosque. In course of the fighting, a major ISIL headquarters and weapons storage center was destroyed. On 20 July, ISIL launched intense counterattacks against all the areas where the SDF had progressed over the previous several days.  Capture of the city's south and center  anarchist IRPGF, a unit of the International Freedom Battalion, in Raqqa Despite these continued counterattacks, the SDF further advanced against ISIL during the following four days. By 24 July, the coalition had fully secured the neighborhoods al-Romaniya, Hutteen, Qadisiyah, Yarmouk, Mashlab, al-Batani and al-Sinaa, while having taken control of parts of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, al-Rawda, al-Rumaila, al-Muazzafin, al-Hamra, and Nazlat Shehada, and the old city. As a result, around 41% of Raqqa was held by the SDF. By this time, the center of fighting was in the southern city, namely for the Nazlat Shehada, Hisham bin Abdul Malik and al-Kournish neighborhoods. By 28 July, the SDF had made further important advances in the western and southern city and increased their territorial control to 50% of Raqqa. While combat in the central and southern city continued, the SDF advanced into the al-Nahdah neighborhood in Raqqa's northeast on 30 July. Between 1 and 3 August, the SDF captured most of the Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Nazlat Shehada neighborhoods and other important locations, thus largely securing southern Raqqa. ISIL was also pushed back in the old city, losing control of the Uwais al-Qarni Mosque and the 'Ammar Ben Yasser shrine, and in Raqqa's north, where the SDF conquered around 10 km2 (four square miles) of territory. As result of their shrinking territory and constant bombardments, both the 2,000 militants, as well as tens of thousands of civilians still trapped in the ISIL-held areas, increasingly suffered from shortages of food, medicines and drinking water, causing ISIL to alleviate the situation by granting 3,000 civilians safe passage from their territory to SDF-held neighborhoods. Nevertheless, ISIL's deteriorating prospects in Raqqa were beginning to seriously undermine the morale of the group's Syrian fighters, many of which wanted to escape or surrender. These native militants remained, however, due to fear of ISIL's foreign mujahideen. These foreigners wanted to make their last stand at Raqqa, and are ready to kill all who want to surrender. The hardcore ISIL elements in Raqqa also reportedly had chemical weapons in their possession, which they would use when their position became completely untenable, regardless of possible civilian casualties. Much of Raqqa suffered extensive damage during the battle, while an activist in the ISIL-held neighborhoods said that the situation for the besieged populace was \\"beyond catastrophic, I can't describe the situation as anything besides hellish. People are just waiting for their turn to die.\\" By 6 August, the SDF controlled around 55% of Raqqa. Over the next days, the SDF, bolstered by new reinforcements, evicted ISIL fully from the southern city. By 10 August the western and eastern fronts of the SDF linked up in the south and thereby cut off the access to the Euphrates from the ISIL militants. The remaining ISIL forces responded to these advances by launching major counter-attacks between 12 and 14 August in an attempt to regain ground in the northeastern and southern city; although the assaults were reportedly unsuccessful, both sides suffered numerous casualties. Despite this, the SDF managed to capture more territory in the Old City, bringing about 57% of Raqqa under their control by 14 August. In course of the next days, the SDF cleared out the remaining ISIL holdouts in the southern city, and by 20 August had begun to push into the neighborhoods north of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Nazlat Shehada. Between 22 and 29 August, the SDF further advanced in Raqqa's old city, capturing several symbolic or strategic locations such as the old clock tower (a site for ISIL's public executions). Nevertheless, ISIL continued to fight fiercely for the 10% of the old city it still controlled, as well as other neighborhoods in the city center in which the militants still held territory: Al-Moror, al-Nahda, al-Mansour, and most importantly al-Thaknah (the location of ISIL's former government buildings). In the course of this heavy close-quarter fighting, Adnan Abu Amjad, leader of the Manbij Military Council and high-ranking SDF commander, was killed in combat. SDF fighters with a Humvee in central Raqqa By 1 September, the SDF had secured almost all of the old city, though some ISIL holdouts continued to resist in the al-Busariyah alley and the Grand Mosque. These ISIL forces were finally destroyed with the support of U.S. Boeing AH-64 Apaches on 2 and 3 September, bringing all of the old city under SDF control. The coalition forces also advanced into the Al-Morour and Daraiya neighborhoods, which were captured by 6 September. By 9 September, ISIL control over Raqqa had been reduced to about 36%, most importantly the northern neighborhoods of Al-Andalus, Shamal Sekket al-Qitar, al-Huriyah, Teshreen, and al-Tawaso'eiyah. Besides these, ISIL pockets of resistance were reported by SOHR in nine mostly SDF-held neighborhoods.  Battle for the north and the last holdouts  Flags of the SDF, YPG, and YPJ in the centre of Raqqa city after its complete capture by the SDF On 14 September, the SDF fully secured al-Thaknah, \\"one of [Raqqa's] most important neighborhoods\\", after a 24-hour-long battle. With al-Thaknah captured, the SDF controlled about 70% of Raqqa. By this time, the situation of the remaining ISIL fighters in the city had become desperate, as they lacked fresh water, food, ammunition, and weaponry; some of them were even sent foraging into SDF-held territories in order to get direly needed supplies. Nevertheless, many ISIL militants refused to consider surrender, and instead launched suicide attacks on coalition forces when their positions became untenable. The remaining ISIL resistance was centered on Raqqa's north as well as enclaves in the south-west and central city. Activists criticised that the anti-ISIL coalition did little to avoid civilian casualties at this stage. Though it was said that ISIL used the civilians as human shields, the activists also said that neither the SDF nor CJTF–OIR took any \\"extraordinary measures to assist civilians who [were] trying to flee the city\\", with the United States Air Force instead indiscriminately bombing all who attempted to escape by boat or car. Such airstrikes did, however, also decisively weaken ISIL's defenses at its last strongholds. Heavy airstrikes by the U.S. Air Force on 20 September caused ISIL to retreat from five northern neighborhoods into the central city, which the militants deemed more secure. Most of northern Raqqa was subsequently occupied by the SDF without much resistance. By 22 September, it initially was reported that ISIL had lost all of its territory in Raqqa, but the SDF later said that the militants still controlled or at least had a presence in 20–25% of the city. Over the next days, heavy fighting continued for areas in the northern, western, central and southwestern city in which ISIL still had a substantial presence. Progress proved slow against these last ISIL forces, as in many cases small groups or even individual militants holed up in their hideouts and waited for the SDF to come for them while sniping at them. The SDF fighters, not well enough equipped for such tasks, often could not clear out these fortified and booby-trapped holdouts without risking disproportionate casualties. Thus, they had to call in airstrikes; \\"time and time again, entire buildings are taken to kill a single [ISIL] fighter\\". ISIL also continued to launch counter-attacks. Its militants used their hidden tunnel networks to assault the SDF from behind or disguised themselves as civilians and even SDF members to infiltrate enemy positions. On 26 September, for example, dozens of ISIL militants with YPG insignias managed to enter SDF positions in the northeastern city, killing at least 28 coalition fighters before they were themselves overwhelmed. The exact number of ISIL fighters who were still active in Raqqa at this point was disputed, with estimates ranging from around 400 (according to local SDF troops), to 400–900 (United States Department of Defense estimate), to 700 regular militants and 1,500 pro-ISIL militiamen (intelligence and information obtained from former ISIL members). Of these forces, only the foreign mujahideen were expected to fight to the end. Native Syrian Arab ISIL militants had instead fled the city by the hundreds, often disguised as civilians. The fighting between advancing SDF units and ISIL holdouts was especially bitter at the al-Naim roundabout in Raqqa's center, which had been dubbed \\"the Circle of Hell\\", and various fortified ISIL strongholds. Among these were the National Hospital, where ISIL had one of its headquarters and held hostages; a sports stadium, where the militants were storing weapons; and around grain silos in the north of the city. On 15 October, close to 50 trucks, 13 buses and more than 100 ISIL vehicles evacuated around 4,000 people from Raqqa under an agreement with the SDF, including 250 ISIL fighters and 3,500 of their family members, along with weapons and ammunition. Around 400 civilians were reportedly used as human shields by ISIL during the transportation. After the ISIL convoy left Raqqa under the agreement on 15 October, the SDF announced the \\"final phase\\" of the battle, code-named the Battle of Martyr Adnan Abu Amjad, to capture the remaining ISIL holdouts in 10% of the city. On 16 October, the SDF reportedly destroyed the last ISIL forces in the al-Andalus and al-Matar neighborhoods, and finally secured the al-Naim roundabout. On 17 October, the SDF launched an attack overnight and captured the National Hospital and further advanced towards the ISIL-held stadium, the jihadists’ last foothold in the city. The stadium was later captured, marking the defeat of ISIL in Raqqa. On 20 October, the SDF officially declared victory in Raqqa. == Aftermath == Around 80% of Raqqa had been left \\"uninhabitable\\" after the battle, according to the UN. According to Airwars, a team of independent journalists, by October 2017, \\"at least 1,300 civilians likely died as a result of Coalition strikes (more than 3,200 such deaths have been reported in total). Overall, local monitors say at least 1,800 civilians were killed in the fighting.\\"\\"More than 1,800 civilians killed overall in defeat of ISIS at Raqqa, say monitors\\". Airwars. October 19, 2017. In April 2019, a joint investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars reported that 1,600 civilians were killed by coalition airstrikes and U.S. artillery shelling.  Cleaning and reconstructions  Efforts to clear the city of mines started in a controlled area, which have later killed and injured hundreds of civilians. The U.S. pledged minor assistance to rebuild the city.  Mass graves  In February 2019, 3,500 bodies were found in an ISIL mass grave in the al-Fukheikha agricultural suburb. In March 2019, another ISIL mass grave was discovered with 300 buried bodies. In July 2019, 200 corpses were found near Raqqa. == Official reactions == ;: The U.S. Secretary of State's statement of 20 October 2017 said: ″We congratulate the Syrian people and the Syrian Democratic Forces, including the Syrian Arab Coalition, on the liberation of Raqqa.

It is known to the Pitjantjatjara people as kata-kultu, kata-puru, ulpa or urara, the Warlpiri people as yurlurnkuru and the Arrernte as lunkere. X. thorntonii is the only grass tree found in Central Australia including the Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert and MacDonnell Ranges. ==Description== The perennial grass tree typically grows to a height of with the trunk reaching , scape of and the flower spike to . It blooms between August and December producing cream-white flowers. It has numerous long linear entire leaves radiating from the apex of one or more stout trunks. The white flowers are densely packed into long- stalked robust spikes. The plant is slow growing, long lived and fire- resistant with a crown of strongly reflexed leaves that are quadrate-rhomboid in cross section. It produces an acaroid resin that was used by Indigenous Australians to fix spear heads to shafts. ==Taxonomy== The species was first formally described by the botanist Ralph Tate in 1896 in the W.B. Spencer work Botany. Report on the work of the Horn Scientific Expedition to Central Australia from samples collected during the Horn Expedition in 1894. The only synonym of the species is Xanthorrhoea thorntoni which was also described by Tate. ==Distribution== It has a scattered distribution in the arid central parts of Western Australia in the Pilbara, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in sandy soils. It is also commonly found in the north west of South Australia and the south of the Northern Territory to the south west of Alice Springs.

It is dehydrogenated estrane with double bonds specifically at the C1, C3, and C5(10) positions. Estrin is a parent structure of the estrogen steroid hormones estradiol, estrone, and estriol, which have also been known as dihydroxyestrin, ketohydroxyestrin, and trihydroxyestrin, respectively. Unlike its estrogen derivatives, estrin itself possesses minimal estrogenic activity, as hydroxyl and/or keto substitutions at the C3 and C17 positions are critical for high binding affinity to the estrogen receptors. Estrin has been found to be on the order of 1,000-fold less potent than estradiol in inducing estrogenic responses in vitro. In addition to estrin, estratrien-17β-ol, which lacks the 3-hydroxyl group of estradiol, and 3-hydroxyestratriene, which lacks the 17β-hydroxyl group of estradiol, both have measurable affinity for the estrogen receptor and are able to activate the receptor and induce progesterone receptor expression. The term estrin is also a synonym for estrogen. It was coined by Sir Alan S. Parkes and C. W. Bellerby in 1926 to describe the hormone secreted from the ovaries that induces estrus in animals (i.e., estrogen). ==See also== * 1-Keto-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene ==References== Category:Estranes ","title":"Estrin (compound)"},{"id":"54234751","text":"Fleming Amyx was a member of the California State Assembly for Tuolumne County from 1855 to 1856, and from 1861 to 1862.

Vocea României Junior began airing on 26 February 2017 on Pro TV and Pro TV Chișinău. Based on the original The Voice of Holland, the concept of the series is to find new singing talent contested by aspiring singers with the age limit being 7–14 years old, drawn from public auditions. The winner is determined by public and he is entitled to a €50,000 prize. The first season was won by Maia Mălăncuș, and the second season was won by Maya Ciosa. The hosts of the series are Robert Tudor and Mihai Bobonete. The coaches of the series are Inna, Andra and Marius Moga. ==History== In March 2014, ProTV announced their intention to turn season 4 into a children's competition, according to The Voice Kids format, but they changed their minds a month later and decided to have a competition for people ages 16 and up, as in previous years. In early 2016 it was announced that Pro TV had ordered The Voice Kids, a junior version of Vocea României. ==Format== One of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Three coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner. There are four phases to the competition: * Stage 1: Blind Auditions * Stage 2: Battle Rounds * Stage 3: Semi-Final * Stage 4: Live Final Blind Auditions Three judges/coaches, all famous musicians, will choose teams of 9 contestants each through a four- episode-long blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditionee's performance to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer then the singer gets to choose which coach they want to work with. Battle Rounds In the \\"Battle Rounds,\\" each coach groups three of his or her team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Semi-Final In the Semi-final three artists within a team sing individual performances in succession. At the conclusion of the performances, coaches then decided out of the three artists who won. Live Final The final (the winner round) will be decided upon by the public vote. ==Hosts and coaches== Hosts In July 2016 Mihai Bobonete and Robert Tudor were confirmed hosts for the Voice of Romania Junior. Coaches In June 2016 pop singer and judge at Românii au talent, Andra, singer, dancer and philanthropist, Inna and R'n'B musician, composer and adult show coach, Marius Moga were confirmed coaches for the Voice of Romania Junior.

In 2013, manufacturing contributed 10% of GDP, compared to 21% for industry as a whole and 25% for agriculture. Half of GDP came (54%) from the services sector. In 2012, Uganda's main exports were all agricultural products: unroasted coffee (30.6%), cotton (5.6%) and tobacco (5.5%). In 2010, it spent less than 5% of GDP on agriculture, despite African countries having committed to the target of 10% when the African Union adopted the Maputo Declaration in 2003 . They reiterated this goal in the Malabo Declaration adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target. In 2014, Uganda was ranked 36th out of 52 countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. Some 16% of the population had access to internet and 44% a mobile phone subscription in 2013. One in four (26%) Ugandans had access to sanitation, 42% to improved water and 15% to electricity in 2011. The government spent 4.3% of GDP on health and 1.9% of GDP on the military in 2013. Inflows of foreign direct investment amounted to 4.8% of GDP in 2013. In 2013, the population was growing at a rate of 3.31% per year. In sub-Saharan Africa, only Niger (3.87% per year) and South Sudan (3.84%) recorded faster growth rates. Public expenditure on education amounted to 3.3% of GDP in 2012. Of this, 11% (0.4% of GDP) was earmarked for higher education. Uganda has achieved universal primary education but only one-quarter of pupils attend secondary school (27% gross enrolment ratio in 2013) and 4.4% university. == Science policy framework ==  National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy  The National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy dates from 2009. Its overarching goal is to ‘strengthen national capability to generate, transfer and apply scientific knowledge, skills and technologies that ensure sustainable utilisation of natural resources for the realisation of Uganda’s development objectives.’ The policy precedes Uganda Vision 2040, which was launched in April 2013 to transform ‘Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years,’ in the words of the Cabinet. Uganda Vision 2040 vows to strengthen the private sector, improve education and training, modernize infrastructure and the underdeveloped services and agriculture sectors, foster industrialization and promote good governance, among other goals. Potential areas for economic development include oil and gas, tourism, minerals and information and communication technologies (ICTs). The National Council for Science and Technology falls under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. The Council's strategic objectives include: * the rationalization of science and technology policy to boost technological innovation; * enhancing the national system of research, intellectual property, product development and technology transfer; * strengthening public acceptance of science and technology; and * upgrading institutional research capacity. The National Council for Science and Technology identified the following shortcomings in higher education in 2007: * very few science degree programmes exist; * enrolment in basic sciences is negligible; * laboratories are generally scarce, under-equipped and obsolete; * very limited funding exists for capital or recurrent expenses for training in science and engineering; * almost all research funding comes from external (donor) sources, making it unsustainable and difficult to ensure a national research for development-driven agenda; * Despite the burgeoning enrolment, very little systematic attention is being paid to the development of domestic graduate education. Fewer than 500 professors in the entire country have PhDs and fewer than 10 new PhDs are awarded annually in sciences and engineering; * fee policies and lack of adequate infrastructure for science and engineering encourage the expansion of undergraduate programmes in arts and humanities, resulting in a dwindling intake for courses in science and engineering and a general lack of interest in, and focus on, these areas; * the universities and the general higher education, be it public or private, lack strategies to improve conditions for research.  Millennium Science Initiative  In 2007, the National Council for Science and Technology launched the Millennium Science Initiative (2007–2013), which was co-financed by the World Bank. At a time when the economy's formal sector was expanding rapidly and real investment was rising sharply, the Council considered that continued economic progress would require more and better use of knowledge and more and better qualified human resources for science and technology. To correct these shortcomings, the Millennium Science Initiative established a funding facility and an outreach programme. The funding facility provided competitive grants through three windows: * top-end research involving both senior researchers and graduate students; * the creation of undergraduate programmes in basic science and engineering; and * support for co-operation with the private sector, which consisted in company internships for students and grants for technology platforms through which firms and researchers could collaborate on solving problems of direct interest to industry. The Outreach Programme proposed a series of school visits by top scientists and researchers to change negative perceptions that deterred Ugandans from pursuing careers in science. A National Science Week was also established. In parallel, this second component sought to strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Council for Science and Technology and the Uganda Industrial Research Institute and, more generally, to improve policy implementation, evaluation and monitoring.  Presidential Initiative on Science and Technology  In July 2010, the Presidential Initiative on Science and Technology offered a further boost by creating a fund to foster innovation at Makerere University over the next five years. When President Museveni visited Makerere University in December 2009, he noticed that many undergraduate students had produced interesting prototypes of machines and implements and that PhD students and senior researchers were working on inventions with potential for transforming rural Ugandan society but that innovation was being held back by the lack of modern research and teaching laboratories. After the visit, he decided to create a Presidential Innovations Fund endowed with UGX 25 billion (circa US$8.5 million) over five years to support innovationrelated projects at the university's College of Engineering, Art, Design and Technology. The fund became operational in July 2010. It covered the cost of modernizing laboratories and the implementation of ten projects at the university. It also financed undergraduate science and engineering programmes, academia–private sector partnerships, student internships, science policy formulation and science popularization in schools and communities. By 2014, the projects had developed: * an academic records management system; * more than 30 internet laboratories (ilabs) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; * a business incubator, the Centre for Technology Design and Development; * a Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation; * more than 30 innovation clusters for metal, salt, coffee, milk, pineapple, etc.; * appropriate irrigation; * a vehicle design project (the Kiira EV car), which evolved into the Centre for Research in Transportation Technologies; * makapads, the only sanitary wear for women in Africa made from natural materials (papyrus and paper), including for maternity use; * a Community Wireless Resource Centre. == Measures to promote innovation ==  Innovation hubs  Business incubation and innovation are being promoted by several Ugandan institutions, including the Uganda Industrial Research Institute and the Uganda Investment Authority. The latter is a parastatal agency which works in conjunction with the government to facilitate private sector investment. One of the authority's most flourishing sectors is ICTs. This sector has seen major investment in recent years to develop Uganda's backbone infrastructure network, which consists of fibre-optic cables and related equipment, as well as mobile broadband infrastructure. Uganda has an innovation hub named Hive Colab, which was launched in 2010 by AfriLabs and is headed by Barbara Birungi. It serves as a collaborative space to facilitate interaction among technology entrepreneurs, web and mobile app developers, designers, investors, venture capitalists and donors. Hive Colab provides facilities, support and advice to members to help them launch successful start-up enterprises. The hub offers a virtual incubation platform that is intended to assist entrepreneurial activity, particularly in rural areas. Its three programme focus areas are ICTs and mobile technologies, climate technologies and agribusiness innovation. Another incubator, the Consortium for enhancing University Responsiveness to Agribusiness Development Limited (CURAD), is a public–private partnership which targets young innovators in the agribusiness sector with the goal of generating new enterprises and employment. This non- profit company was launched in May 2014 and is based at Makerere University. In September 2013, the government launched a Business Process Outsourcing Incubation Centre at the Uganda Bureau of Statistics House. The facility can accommodate 250 agents and is run by three private companies. The Government of Uganda has targeted this industry to address youth unemployment and stimulate investment in information-technology-enabled services.  Prizes  Since 2010, two annual prizes have incentivized innovation in Uganda. The first are the Community Innovations Awards, a competition for mobile apps that encourages university students to innovate in the areas of agriculture, health and education. Each year since 2012, Orange Uganda, a division of France Telecom, has sponsored this prize. Since 2010, the Uganda Communications Commission has also organized the Annual Communications Innovation Awards, which reward excellence in ICT innovation that contributes to national development goals. The prizes are awarded in several categories, including digital content, ICT for development, service excellence, business excellence and young ICT innovators. == Research trends ==  Financial investment  Research funding climbed between 2008 and 2010 from 0.33% to 0.48% of GDP, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. More than half of research expenditure (57.3%) came from abroad in 2010. The government contributed a further 21.9%, businesses 13.7%, higher education 1.0% and private non-profit organizations 6.0%. The business enterprise sector's share of research funding progressed from 4.3% to 13.7% between 2008 and 2010 and spending on engineering rose from 9.8% to 12.2% of total research expenditure. This progression occurred to the detriment of agricultural research, which shrank from 53.6% to 16.7% of total spending. Expenditure per researcher remained low in 2010 ($85 in purchasing power parity dollars) and amounted to just $7 per inhabitant.  Human capital  Researchers (HC) in Southern Africa per million inhabitants, 2013 or closest year Enrolment in higher education rose from 92,605 to 140,087 between 2006 and 2011, in a context of strong population growth of 3.3% per year. In 2011, 4.4% of young Ugandans were enrolled at university. These figures cover students enrolled in post- secondary non-degree programmes, bachelor's, master's and PhD programmes. The government invested 0.4% of GDP in higher education in 2012, 11% of public education expenditure. The number of researchers has climbed steadily over the past decade, even doubling between 2008 and 2010 in head counts from 1 387 to 2 823, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This represents a leap from 44 to 83 researchers per million inhabitants over the same period. One in four researchers is a woman.  Research output  The number of scientific publications tripled between 2005 and 2014 to 757 a year, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). In 2014, Uganda had 19.5 publications per million inhabitants recorded in this international database. This places Uganda fifth in East and Central Africa for scientific output after Gabon, Cameroon, Kenya and the Republic of Congo. The average for sub-Saharan Africa in 2014 was 20 publications per million inhabitants and the global average 176 per million inhabitants Ugandan research focuses on life sciences. Kenya and South Africa count among Uganda's top five research partners. Between 2008 and 2014, Uganda's main collaborators came from the United States (1,709 articles), United Kingdom (1,031 articles), Kenya (477 articles), South Africa (409 articles) and Sweden (311 articles). == Regional economic communities ==  East African Community   Towards economic and scientific integration  Uganda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), along with Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. The EAC's founding treaty of 1967 makes provision for co-operation among member states to develop science, technology and innovation. On 1 July 2010, the five EAC members formed a common market; the agreement provides for the free movement of goods, labour, services and capital. In 2014, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya agreed to adopt a single tourist visa. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have also launched the East African Payment System. The EAC Common Market Protocol (2010) makes provision for market-led research, technological development and the adaptation of technologies in the community, in order to support the sustainable production of goods and services and enhance international competitiveness. States are to collaborate with the East African Science and Technology Commission and other institutions to develop mechanisms for commercializing indigenous knowledge and ensuring intellectual property protection. Member states also undertake to establish a research and technological development fund for the purpose of implementing the provisions in the protocol. Other clauses include: * promoting linkages among industries and other economic sectors within the EAC community; * promoting industrial research and the transfer, acquisition, adaptation and development of modern technology; * promoting sustainable and balanced industrialization to cater for the least industrialized members; * facilitating the development of micro-, small and medium-sized (SME) enterprises and promoting indigenous entrepreneurs; and * promoting knowledge-based industries. On 30 November 2013, the EAC countries signed a Monetary Union Protocol with the aim of establishing a common currency within 10 years. On 10 June 2015, the EAC, Southern African Development Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) signed a Tripartite Free Trade Agreement. These agreements are part of a pan-African movement to create a free trade area and customs union in each regional economic community with a view to creating a pan-African Common Market by 2023 and an African Economic Community by 2028. Increasingly, regional economic communities are also driving regional scientific integration. The Inter-University Council for East Africa (IUCEA) was formally integrated into the operational framework of the EAC by the East African Legislative Assembly in 2009 through the IUCEA Act. IUCEA has been entrusted with the mission of developing a Common Higher Education Area by 2015. In order to harmonize higher education systems in EAC countries, IUCEA established the East African Quality Assurance Network in 2011, which is in the process of developing a regional policy and an East African qualifications framework for higher education. IUCEA also established a partnership with the East African Business Council in 2011 to foster joint research and innovation by the private sector and universities and identify areas for curricular reform. The two partners organized the region's first forum for academia and private firms under the auspices of the EAC in Arusha in 2012 and a second with the East African Development Bank in Nairobi in 2013.  Centres of excellence in biomedical sciences  The East African Community (EAC) commissioned a study in 2011 which designated 19 centres of excellence from five EAC partner states. In October 2014, the 10th ordinary meeting of the EAC Sectoral Council of Ministers responsible for Health selected five of these centres for first-phase EAC funding, namely: the National Institute of Public Health (Burundi), Rift Valley Technical Training Institute (Kenya), University of Rwanda (formerly the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology), Uganda Industrial Research Institute and Taasisi ya Sanaa na Utamaduni Bagamoyo (Tanzania). Complementing the EAC project, the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved bilateral loans in October 2014 amounting to US$98 million to finance the first phase of its own East Africa's Centres of Excellence for Skills and Tertiary Education in Biomedical Sciences programme. The AfDB project will contribute to developing a highly skilled labour force in biomedical sciences to meet the EAC's immediate labour market needs and support implementation of EAC's ‘free’ labour market protocols. One potential area for growth is medical tourism. The first phase of the AfDB project will support the creation of specialized centres of excellence in nephrology and urology in Kenya, cardiovascular medicine in Tanzania, biomedical engineering and e-health in Rwanda and oncology in Uganda. During the project's second phase, a centre of excellence will open in Burundi in nutritional sciences. The East Africa Kidney Institute will operate as part of the University of Nairobi and its teaching hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital. The other centres of excellence will be established at the University of Rwanda's College of Medicine and Health Sciences, the Uganda Cancer Institute and, in Tanzania, at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences. Some 140 master's and 10 PhD students will benefit from the programme, as well as 300 interns. The centres of excellence will be expected to collaborate with internationally renowned establishments to develop quality curricula, joint research, promote interuniversity exchanges and mentoring programmes and to give access to documentary resources.  Intergovernmental Authority on Development  Uganda is a member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional economic community grouping Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan. IGAD's flagship programme for the period 2013–2027 sets out to develop drought-resilient communities, institutions and ecosystems in the IGAD region by 2027.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is now operated as the Cappon House Museum. ==History== Holland was first settled in 1847 by Dutch immigrants led by of the Rev. Albertus C. van Raalte. Hundreds of additional Dutch immigrants settled in Holland in the following few years. Isaac Cappon arrived in New York City in 1847, then came to Holland in 1848. He worked in a tannery until 1856, when he and fellow immigrant John Bertsch founded the Cappon and Bertsch Leather Company. The tannery grew in size, and the partners built a new building in 1863, and enlarged it a few years later. As Cappon's business grew, so did the settlement of Holland. In 1867, Holland was incorporated as a city, and Isaac Cappon was elected as the first mayor. He eventually served four one-year terms in office, being elected in 1867, and again in 1870, 1874, and 1879. However, in 1871, a disastrous forest fire swept through the city, destroying a substantial number of building, including Cappon's house and the Cappon and Bertsch tannery. The firm rebuilt, constructing a new plant in 1872, adding a drying house the next year, and continuing to grow through the 1870s. Cappon also rebuilt his own house, hiring builder John R. Kleyn of Holland to construct this house in 1872. The house was completed in 1874. The house remained in the Cappon family until 1978, when the last occupant, Miss Lavina Cappon, died. After this, ownership was transferred to the city of Holland, and the house began operating as a museum. The house has been partially restored to its appearance in 1900, and along with the nearby Thomas and Anna Morrissey House is open to visitors. ==Description== The Isaac Cappon House is a two-story T-shaped Italianate structure with a hipped roof with a central cupola. The house is of balloon-framed construction and sits on a rubble foundation. The front facade has a projecting central section, with recessed sections to each side. The double-door main entrance is located in the corner in one recessed section, underneath a bracketed canopy, with a secondary entrance located in the opposite corner. A single story wing projects to the rear. On the interior, the main entrance opens into a broad hall, flanked by the main staircase. Off the hall is a formal parlor, the original sitting room (now remodeled into a dining room), the original dining room (now remodeled into a kitchen), and a small bedroom. The original kitchen, located in the single story addition, is now a garage. The first floor contains substantial Victorian woodwork and detailing. Upstairs there are two large bedrooms, two smaller ones, and a large bathroom. A small staircase leads to the unfinished attic and then the cupola. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1874 ","title":"Isaac Cappon House"},{"id":"54235573","text":"Senate Bill 1556 (SB 1556), officially called An act to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4; Title 49 and Title 63, relative to conscientious objections to the provision of counseling and therapy, is a 2016 anti-LGBT law in the state of Tennessee that allows licensed counselors in private practice to use their own religious beliefs as an excuse for terminating care or referring away clients because of moral objections to how the client identifies.Tennessee House Advances Anti-LGBT Legislation ==Passage== On April 6, 2016, the Tennessee House of Representatives passed SB 1556, with 71 yeas and 21 nays.

His most famous work is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge over the Danube River in Budapest, which was one of the longest bridges in the world when it opened. Clark oversaw its construction from 1839 to 1849, and ensured its safety during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He remained in Hungary after the bridge's completion, and married a Hungarian. ==Early life== Clark was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 14 August 1811.Adam Clark at Encyclopædia Britannica; retrieved 20 June 2017. He served his engineering apprenticeship with Darling & Hume and G. Manwaring & Co., and then found work with Hunter & English. In 1834, Clark was sent to Budapest to supervise the construction of a new dredger, which had been ordered by Count István Széchenyi for use on the Danube. He returned to Scotland after two years. ==Széchenyi Chain Bridge== In 1839, Clark moved back to Hungary to serve as resident engineer on the Chain Bridge, which was being built to link the twin towns of Buda and Pest across the Danube. With a central span of and a total length of , it was one of the longest bridges in the world when it opened in 1849, just behind the central span of then third longest Hungerford Bridge (a footbridge opened earlier in 1849).Brody (1988), p. 112. The bridge's designer and chief engineer was an Englishman, William Tierney Clark (no relation), but he was unable or unwilling to remain in Hungary to supervise its construction. Clark spent ten years working on the bridge, with an annual salary of £400. He supervised the selection of the timber for its 5,000 piles, travelling to Slavonia and Tyrol to find appropriate wood. The Chain Bridge was finally opened in November 1849, with the final stages of its construction having taken place during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.Brody (1988), p. 116. In the early stages of the revolution, a crowd of demonstrators gathered at the bridge to demand the expulsion of foreign workers. Clark refused to meet their request, and the demonstrators were eventually dispersed by police.Brody (1988), p. 115. Clark in fact supported the revolutionaries, and in late 1848 assisted Lajos Kossuth's army in retreating across his bridge – still unfinished and untested. By one estimate, 70,000 men and 300 pieces of artillery crossed over in a single day. On two other occasions, Clark saved his bridge from military destruction. In early 1849, he received information that the Austrian Imperial Army was planning to blow up the bridge, in order to prevent the rebels from crossing over from Pest to Buda. He immediately took action to minimise any damage, flooding the bridge's anchorage chambers to ensure its stability and then destroying pumps. The Austrians placed four canisters of gunpowder on the bridge, but only one detonated and the damage was insignificant. In June 1849, Clark was informed that the Hungarian revolutionaries were going to demolish the bridge to prevent the Austrians from crossing the river. He met with General Henryk Dembiński, the Hungarian commander-in-chief, and convinced him that it was not necessary to destroy the entire structure to make it impassable for troops. Instead, Clark had the bridge platform dismantled and set some of the bridge components adrift on barges, allowing construction to easily resume at a more suitable time. ==Other works and later life== In 1850, Clark was commissioned by the Hungarian government to design and build a tunnel under Buda Castle, emerging directly opposite the Chain Bridge. This would significantly shorten the journey for those travelling to and from Buda's outskirts, who would otherwise have to go all the way around Castle Hill. Work on the Buda Castle Tunnel began in February 1853, with the tunnel opened to foot traffic in March 1856 and to horse traffic in April 1857.Buda Castle Tunnel, Budapest.com; retrieved 20 June 2017. After the completion of the tunnel, Clark worked on several smaller commissions. He died of lung disease in 23 June 1866, aged 54, and was buried in Kerepesi Cemetery. In 1855, Clark married Mária Áldásy, a member of the local aristocracy, with whom he had three children.The engineer and the politician, CoinsWeekly, 8 September 2011; retrieved 20 June 2017. One of his descendants was the famous mathematician György Hajós.. ==Legacy== A commemorative coin was issued in honour of the 200th anniversary of Clark's birth. Because of his contributions to the Budapest cityscape and his support for the Revolution of 1848, Clark became \\"something of a folk hero in Hungary\\". He is virtually unknown in his native Scotland, however. In 1912, the public square between the Széchenyi Chain Bridge and the Buda Tunnel was renamed Clark Ádám tér (\\"Adam Clark Square\\") in his honour. Adam Clark Square contains Hungary's Zero Kilometre Stone.Clark Ádám tér, BudapestCity.org (in Hungarian); retrieved 20 June 2017. Clark was deprecated somewhat by the Hungarian People's Republic during the 1950s, due to his association with the aristocracy, but his reputation was rehabilitated by later governments. In 2011, the Hungarian National Bank issued a 5000 forint coin to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Clark's birth. It was designed by László Szlávics. A floating crane of 200 t lifting capacity, used in the raising of the sunken passenger ship Hableány is named after him. ==References== Category:1811 births Category:1866 deaths Category:British bridge engineers Category:British emigrants to Hungary Category:Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Scottish civil engineers Category:Hungarian people of Scottish descent Category:Hungarian engineers ","title":"Adam Clark (engineer)"},{"id":"54235683","text":"Adam Clark may refer to: * Adam Christian Clark (born 1980), film director * Adam Clark (engineer) (1811–1866), Scottish civil engineer * Adam Clark (meteorologist), American meteorologist * Adam Clark (actor), actor in Star Trek: Enterprise ==See also== * Adam Clarke (disambiguation) ","title":"Adam Clark"},{"id":"54235827","text":"Mihaela Sandu (born 19 February 1977) is a Romanian chess player who holds the title of Woman Grandmaster (WGM, 2008). ==Chess career== In 1991 in Mamaia Mihaela Sandu won silver medal in the European Youth Chess Championship in age category U14.

It is the public transport hub of the Sömmerda district and the only Turmbahnhof (\\"tower station\\"—two-level interchange station) in Thuringia. == History== The first railway reached Sömmerda on 14 August 1874. It was the Straußfurt–Großheringen railway (known as the Pfefferminzbahn—\\"Peppermint Railway\\"), which connects Straußfurt in the west via Sömmerda to Großheringen in the east. This line was built by the Nordhausen-Erfurt Railway Company (Nordhausen-Erfurter Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and owned by the Prussian state railways (Preußische Staatsbahn) from 1887. On 24 October 1881, the second and more important line, the Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway was opened through Sömmerda. In preparation for it, the station had to be developed into a two- level interchange station in order to link both lines. Since then, the higher Sangerhausen–Erfurt railway has run above the Peppermint Railway. This line served the traffic from Erfurt to the then capital of the Prussian Province of Saxony, Magdeburg. It was built by the Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberstädter Eisenbahngesellschaft) and was taken over by the Prussian government in 1886. A second track was built between Erfurt and Sömmerda. The second track was dismantled in 1946 to provide reparations, but was restored after the reunification of Germany. The line was electrified by the end of the 1990s.

Electrical disruptions caused by squirrels are common and widespread, and can involve the disruption of power grids. It has been hypothesized that the threat to the Internet, infrastructure and services posed by squirrels may exceed that posed by terrorists. Although many commentators have highlighted humorous aspects of the concern, squirrels have proven consistently able to cripple power grids in many countries, and the danger posed to the electrical grid from squirrels is ongoing and concerning. Instances of power grid shutdowns caused by squirrels have been tabulated. ==Scope== Electrical disruptions caused by squirrels are common and widespread. Between Memorial Day and August 31, 2013, at least 50 power outages caused by squirrels (POCBS) were recorded in 24 U.S. states. Cities affected by POCBS included Mason City, Iowa and Portland, Oregon. Most media coverage of such events has compared the number of electrical grid shutdowns due to squirrels and those due to terrorists. Commentators often embellish and parody descriptions of the squirrels responsible for interrupting electrical service with allusions to military action or concerns, for example: \\"Squirrels mobilize, plot acts of cyber terrorism against humankind—And they're not acting alone.\\" or \\"Squirrelus interruptus: 5 things shut down by squirrels—How can a squirrel bring a nuclear weapons site to its knees?\\" Electrical grids are not the only types of infrastructure at risk from squirrels, but nuclear weapons sites have also been described as targets of squirrel attention. Ground squirrels have interfered with underground nuclear missile sites at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The squirrels are able to tunnel under fences, bypassing motion detectors. Like their arboreal relatives, they can damage electrical cables by biting them. In addition, those that do take above-ground routes onto the base trigger thousands of false alarms each year. ==Prevention== Squirrels damage electrical distribution facilities by tunneling, by chewing through electrical insulation, or by simultaneously coming into contact with two conductors at different electrical potentials. Typically the animal is killed by the passage of current through its body. Prevention is complicated by the ability of squirrels to bypass plastic animal guards, gnaw through insulation and squeeze through small openings into substations. Some utilities are beginning to prevent animals from compromising the power supply by developing automated switching capabilities and other features designed to forestall service disruptions caused by squirrel damage. ==Metrics== Squirrel-caused grid disruption in the U.S. is monitored by the American Public Power Association (APPA). The APPA has developed a data tracker called \\"The Squirrel Index\\" (TSqI) to analyze the pattern and timing of \\"squirrel attacks\\" on electrical power systems. The TSqI is a metric that quantifies the rate per 1,000 customers over a period of time, and indicates two peak periods of highest \\"squirrel activity\\" or \\"squirrel peaking months\\" (SqPMS) in the year, in May–June and October–November, when disruption is greatest. This is the rate per 1000 electrical customers and squirrel related outages ==Analytics== Intentional damage by human terrorists is often the first concern in assessing threats to the U.S. power supply; some cybersecurity experts believe a country's infrastructure, such as its power grid, is a likely terrorist target. But according to the security researcher Cris Thomas, also known by the pseudonym SpaceRogue, \\"We've had power outages caused by squirrels in all 50 states ... [including] Hawaii, where they don't even have squirrels, but they do have chickens.\\" ==Specific cases== In 1987 a 90-minute loss of power to Nasdaq's automated trading computer, caused by a squirrel, affected twenty million trades. Nasdaq was shut down for about 30 minutes again in 2014 by a squirrel-induced power outage. Other commentators have noted that actual cyber attacks by human terrorists are much rarer than disruption caused by squirrels. John C. Inglis, the former deputy director of the U.S. National Security Agency, said in 2015 that he judged the electrical grid was as likely to be paralyzed by a natural disaster as by a cyberattack and added: \\"[F]rankly, the No. 1 threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels.\\" Similar concerns exist in Germany, where in 2005, a \\"cyber squirrel\\" crippled the entire electrical grid south of the River Elster for an hour. This squirrel was described as \\"a furry suicide bomber\\" (\\"pelzige[r] Selbstmordattentäter\\"). Squirrels have been the cause of many power outages in Pennsylvania. Cris Thomas has said that in the United States there have been six deaths associated with squirrel interference with infrastructure, such as downed power lines (and two with other animals). One commentator criticized the UK press for what he saw as an emphasis on \\"the ethnic struggle between Britain’s populations of red and grey squirrels, and the latter’s demonization (as immigrants and terrorists) and threatened eradication\\". In at least one circumstance, a physical attack by a squirrel has been characterized as a \\"terrorist squirrel.\\" ==See also== *Animal attack ==NotesReferencesExternal links== *APPA squirrel index (American Public Power Association) *35 Years of Cyberwar: The Squirrels are Winning at National Science Foundation (webcast with speaker Cris Thomas) Category:Electric power distribution Category:Electric power transmission systems Category:Electrical grid Category:Squirrels in human culture ","title":"Electrical disruptions caused by squirrels"},{"id":"54235972","text":"One of the first big businesses that developed in the new colony of Australia was the wool industry. It had an important impact on the development of Geelong as the centre of wool sales and exports. Geelong's location and the ambition of local merchants made it perfect for shipping Australian wool worldwide. As the industry boomed, throughout Geelong large storehouses were built for the storage, assessment, sale and transport of wool bales from throughout Victoria and even further. As the industry declined the buildings were no longer required for their original purpose and fell into disrepair, some being lost to demolition. Those surviving have now been repurposed for a variety of functions, which allows the city to continue to develop whilst still celebrating its heritage. == The Woolstore's Architecture == Prior to the 1850s wool storage was fragmented within Geelong. Few Geelong merchants handled wool exclusively. However, as the economic importance of wool began to rise, local wool brokers recognised the need for local auctions and sales. C.J Denny was a leading figure in creating collective action to commence wool auctions in Geelong. He proposed a series of objectives to establish a Local Wool Mart in Geelong. These were: *To concentrate into one spot a sufficient number of bales of all wools intended for public sale, as will afford owners an opportunity of comparing the condition of their respective clips, and to purchase, a ready and rapid examination of the lots. *To attract purchasers from all parties by the quantity and quality of the wool offered at each sale. *To lot off the wool…so as to increase the circle of purchasers. *To avoid the expense of transmission of a re-shipment from the Melbourne wool warehouse. These aims served to influence the design of Woolstores that were built in Geelong. Subsequent stores were required to meet certain demands. This included the parameters of location, light, space, size, handling facilities and ventilation. In 1857, C.J Dennys conducted the first wool auction in Geelong. As the wool industry expanded, large numbers of modern Woolstores were built, altered, and extended.  Dennys Lascelles & Co.  In 1872 Dennys Lascelles bluestone Woolstore was erected. Architect Jacob Pitman designed the basement of the building and Jonathan Coulson designed the remainder of the building. The Woolstore measured 132 x 64 ft. Windows featured on every side of the building. These were incorporated with the intention that two rows of bales could be placed between each window, leaving a well-lighted passage between each double row of bales. These windows also allowed for adequate ventilation. The cellar, used for the sale of hides and skins, included a cement floor. With the light from the windows, this feature was intended to ensure ideal temperatures in summer and winter. A pivotal feature of the building was the show floor that measured 129 x 61 ft. The walls and ceilings were painted pale grey to control lighting. This was to enable buyers and growers a high standard of visibility when inspecting products. The Woolstore is positioned on a slight incline, affording facilities for waggons to load and unload on the ground floor. The 1872 Woolstore was the first building in Victoria planned to facilitate the storage, inspection, and marketing of wool in one operation and upon completion was the second largest store in the colony. Over the years, extensions to the bluestone building were added, including a mansard tower in 1889. These extensions reflected small variations in detailing. In 1880 an additional building was erected to the west of the original building, in Brougham Street. While incorporating elements of the original design, the store was made of rendered cement, a material more widely used at the time on construction. The Woolstore was deliberately misaligned with the 1872 façade. This gave the impression that the building was only two storeys, rather than its actual three. In 1910 a major extension, constructed of reinforced concrete, was added to the original 1872 building. Edward Giles Stone designed the new store. Stone was known for pushing design boundaries and has been credited for influencing design trends into the 1920s. The most striking feature of the building was the bow string truss roof system. This consisted of a 55 x 52 metre concrete roof span. This was roofed without any intermediate columns. The saw tooth roof trusses, which pass through the giant curved concrete structure, allowed for abundant natural light to flow into the building. This allowed for ideal viewing of products on the new show floor. Whilst formerly known as the Denny Lascelles Woolstore, it became known as the Bow Truss Building. Despite the building’s listing on several Heritage Registers, it was controversially demolished in the 1990s.  Strachan & Co.  Strachan & Co. had been associated with the wool industry since 1840. Their Woolstore complex provides a contrast in design to the Dennys Lascelles buildings, located a block adjacent. In 1889 a two-storey brick Woolstore was erected. The building features a façade consisting of five bays with segmental arch headed windows. The load bearing red brick walls was topped with a simple parapet. This design was to directly influence subsequent Woolstores constructed in the complex. In 1896 a three-storey section, south of the original building, was constructed in Moorabool Street. A further extension was added in 1925 to embrace the whole of the Moorabool St and Corio Terrace frontages. The final addition was completed in 1954. Whilst the construction period of the complex spanned six-five years, stylistic features remained consistent. This gave the group of buildings uniformity and can be considered a complete entity, despite the lengthy construction period.  Dalgety & Co.  The first Dalgety & Co Woolstore was built in 1891. The newly established Geelong architecture firm, Laird and Buchan, designed the building. The building was a two-storey brick and render built on Gheringhap Street. The design for the 1891 Woolstore consisted of a two-storey warehouse and office building without a basement level. The structure had solid brick walls and an enclosed timber roof, floor, and structural system. This became the model for all later Woolstores built of Dalgety’s on the site. In 1896, an additional storey, consisting of a brick show floor was added to the 1891 Woolstore. The addition copied the earlier structure in almost every way. A further Woolstore was built in 1901. Similar to Strachan’s Woolstore, it was constructed using red brick. However the building reflects a very different design. The north east side of the Woolstore consists of small windows with the façade unified by the use of giant arched panels of brickwork. This design closely resembles Woolstores constructed in Sydney in the late 1890s. The overall form and scale of the store closely resembled the 1891 building, however, with the addition of a basement. In 1940 a three-storey brick building with basement was built on the corner of the Gheringhap and Brougham streets. This also included the construction of a new façade along the entire length of Gheringhap Street. Consequently, the original exterior of the 1891 building was refaced with red brick. This alteration related to the new Woolstores that were built in the 1950s and 60’s. There were some distinctive features to the 1940 Woolstore. The building included a spacious show floor that allowed the entire store to hold 55,000 bales of wool. It also incorporated large sliding doors on the west and south, façades that allowed for ventilation to regulate the temperature. The ceiling height was greatly increased, and by the use of steel columns and roof trusses the number of columns within the space were reduced to a single row of seven in the centre. The saw tooth roof form was retained but the scale increased dramatically. == Social Context ==  The rise of the woolstore  Geelong’s woolstores are closely associated with the growth of Geelong as a commercial centre, supporting pastoral and agricultural interests in Victoria, particularly the wool industry. The first Australian wool was sold at Garraway’s Coffee House in London in 1821 - a place where businessmen would gather and various goods were auctioned off. Between 1830 and 1850, Australian wool exports increased from 892 tonnes to 18,791 tonnes. The swift growth of the industry made the pastoralists wealthy. The wool trade became highly profitable, and local spaces for storage and sale were needed to facilitate the shipping of wool. In 1840, James Strachan constructed the first woolstore in Geelong. In 1857, Charles Dennys conducted the first wool auction in Geelong, which highlighted the possibility of a local wool trade. The other consequence of the rapid growth of the wool industry was that the population of Geelong grew quickly. The small town became a booming sea port, and between 1841 and 1843, the population exploded from 454 to 2,065. At first, the growth of large wool firms in Geelong was checked by their resources. However, by the 1870s, large investments by British banks and finance companies bolstered the industry significantly, ensuring its significance as Australia's biggest export. Vastly expanded woolstores were constructed throughout Geelong and the country. As a signifier of this economic expansion, the Dennys, Lascelles Ltd woolstore, constructed in 1872, now houses the National Wool Museum, and is emblematic of the design that became popular in the construction of woolstores in Geelong and the wider region. The growth of Geelong as the centre of the wool industry wasn’t without its competitors. Melbourne considered itself the centre of exports and sales. By commencing wool sales in Geelong, Charles Dennys fuelled the competitiveness, stating that making Geelong the centre would save costs for local agriculturalists as they wouldn’t need to cover the costs of shipping to Melbourne. By the 1890s, wool made up two-thirds of Australia’s exports. That meant the industry provided a huge number of employment opportunities, many of which centred around woolstores. Victoria was the centre of a lively union movement, with workers fighting for better conditions and wages, and the woolstores weren't immune to that. The main unions involved in Geelong woolstores were the Amalgamated Fellmongers Woolsorters & Woolscourers Union of Australia, the Wool and Basil Workers' Federation of Australia, the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union of Australia, and the Wool & Skin Stores Employees Union. Even if woolstore workers weren’t striking, others involved in the industry were. Throughout the late nineteenth century, strikes by wharf workers meant wool couldn’t be shipped. There were also significant strikes by shearers in the 1890s.  The decline of the industry  Two World Wars and an economic depression seriously affected not only available labour and demand, but also the price of wool. Although the industry boomed briefly in the 1950s, the growing popularity of synthetic fibres, rising production costs, and sinking international prices threatened the industry. As a response, the Australian government introduced a protectionist reserve price scheme in 1974, which involved the government acquisition of the wool clip if the price fell below a certain level. The scheme continued until 1991, when it was buried by so much excess wool that it threatened to overwhelm the Australian economy. The industry was forced to shrink, and mineral extraction took over as the core of the Australian economy. The woolstores in the Geelong area had closed by the late 1970s, when notable local firms such as Strachan and Denny’s were acquired in 1978 by the Australian Mercantile Land & Finance Company, which had its main centres in London, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. == Functions of a Woolstore == The Dennys Lascelles Wool and Produce Warehouse was the first building in Victoria planned to facilitate the storage, inspection and marketing of wool in one operation and upon completion, was the second largest store in the colony. Certain specialist functions developed in these storage buildings e.g. the raising of the entire ground floor to a convenient loading level from the street frontage, allowing a basement underneath, containing the wool press. A Woolstore carried out the following functions for growers and brokers: *Receive *House *Store *Display *Dispatch  Receive  From the 1870s wool, skins and hides were delivered to the Woolstores by bullock dray and were sorted, stored and catalogued. At first transport was largely by drays, bullock wagons and even riverboats brought bought the wool clip in bales from outback stations, then rail and road transport took over. Wool continued to come and go by land, sea and rail. Specialised sorters and packers would sort the wool depending on where it was going once it was received into the stores. By the early 1950s it was realised that all this handling was unnecessary and professional wool classers began to be employed on the stations and the wool was properly packed at the beginning of its journey.  House  Wool was weighed, conveyed, classed, baled, branded, stored, displayed, marketed and sold. Within multi-storey ‘wool-warehouses’ bales were moved on trolleys, by steam or hydraulic lifts and dropped down chutes. Within the one-storey modern wool store, wool was moved by vehicles. Improvements made to Woolstores in the 1940s included metal wool gates for dividing the wool, electric lifts and elevators, wool presses and wool drops. Wool brokers charged growers a fee for handling and selling the wool in the store. Brokers also provided a range of other services such as credit facilities, banking, advice, and hotel and travel bookings. They linked the wool grower to the outside world of commerce and international trade. As buildings that were visited by clients, whether they be buyers or suppliers, the stores had to provide a reasonable level of amenity and could not simply be regarded as large sheds. Changing rooms and showers were also installed in the larger Woolstores for use of buyers and growers and of course the offices of wool valuers.  Store  Immediately before classing ‘skirting’ happened, the object being to render the fleece as evenly as possible by removing any wool which did not match the major portion of the fleece. Once a fleece has been handled, baled and pressed it did not lend itself to further skirting. Skirting and packing enhanced the value of the wool clip as a whole. Classing was one of the most important jobs i.e. grading of the skirted fleece in its entirety. This was the application of sound knowledge acquired from experience and practice. Wool was put into lines according to its class. The first thing was to separate the Woollen and Worsted by the Wool Sorters, then the fleece was graded according to the following factors: *Quality: referred to the diameter of the fibre, which was indicated by the even-ness and number of crimps. *Soundness: tensile strength, ability to withstand tension placed on the fibre during the combing process. *Length of staple: there were well defined lengths for long, medium and short wools for each quality or count. *Condition: was the amount of yoke and moisture adhering to the wool fibre. Other important factors were: *Colour: Pure white wools gave the widest field of usefulness. *Style: character, clearness of colour, bloom or lustre, regularity, elasticity, distinctiveness of crimp, pliancy, softness and fullness all contributed to the seven distinct standards of style in wool: Choice or extra super, Super, Good to super, Good, Good Average, Average and Inferior. After greasy wool had been sorted and classed it was scoured. All impurities such as grease or yolk, sweat and earthy matter were removed by scouring or washing in a solution of soap and weak alkali. Carbonizing was necessary when burr, seeds or any other vegetable matter was of such a nature that it could not be eliminated by carding, combing and subsequent processes. Carding was where fine wire teeth removed foreign matter, smooth and straighten out the fibres. The mesh was then condensed into a soft rope form known as a silver. Backwashing and gilling occurred to straighten out the fibre and sometimes oil was added as a substitute for the lost natural grease. Finally, combing straightened the long fibres and removed all the short and imperfect fibres. The rejected wool collected was known as the Noil. A ball of continuous length known as a ‘top’ was the result which was ready for packing.  Display  After the bulk classers had sorted the wool it was taken to bins, examined by an overlooker and then made into sale bales, sent to be shown by wool lifts. The warehouse show floors made sure to provide ample space and light, which would mean wool from different districts could be easily separated. One of the ways in which this was achieved was the use of saw tooth roofs. The new Woolstores built in 1872 put Geelong on par with Melbourne. They were especially built for wool and were designed by keeping wool selling needs in mind, which included storage, inspection, viewing and sales. Owners of the wool were able to readily compare the condition of their clips. It also meant that those buying could examine the wool lots quickly. On sale days, the wool was moved up to the top floor, with its bright natural light, and opened so that potential buyers could inspect the wool. Often sampling occurred on the show floor where wool was taken and assessed. The raw wool would be sold at auction and then dispatched by road, rail or sea.  Dispatch  In Geelong, wool was brought down to the beach to be put on a ship and delivered. When dispatching wool, it needed to be packed well enough to survive the sea trip and the handling later in its journey. This was done by sorters and packers initially and then after the 1950s professional wool classers performed the job. Bales that were waiting to be delivered were in warehouse stacks. Local orders were delivered immediately. The initial storemen lived on the woolstore land and these woolstores were built near various transport facilities.

In the mid-twentieth century, Australia boasted the greatest wool industry in the world. Yet toward the end of the century, the industry declined to be a third of its former size because of flawed economic, fiscal, and industrial government policies. The city of Geelong is closely associated with the wool industry. For many years the city was known as the 'wool centre of the world'. Sheep farming began here in 1835 and numerous Woolstores were opened from the second half of the century onward. Today, Geelong stands as an emerging health, education and advanced manufacturing hub. Despite experiencing the drawbacks of losing much of its heavy manufacturing, it positions itself as one of the leading non-capital Australian cities.  Significance of the Geelong Woolstores Historic Area  The Geelong Woolstores Historic Area is one of remarkable coherence and integrity. The Area represents an important aspect of the process of settling the land in Victoria. For Australians as inhabitants of an industrial nation, the last century may be considered as the most relevant period of their past since the specific changes made during that period provide the foundation of their present society. Significant Woolstore groups do exist elsewhere in Australia, but they do not match the group qualities of the Geelong Woolstores and were not specifically erected for the storage, handling and marketing of wool. Thus, the former Dennys Lascelles Woolstores can be seen as quintessentially Australian as a manifestation of the wool industry. These buildings meet criterion A (Importance to the course, or pattern, of Victoria's cultural history), F (Importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period), and H (Special association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in Victoria's history). They can be associated with the fifth topic of the Victorian Historical Themes (“Building Victoria’s Industries and Workforce”, subtheme “wool processing”). == Revitalisation of the Woolstores Conservation Area and Waterfront == With the decline of the wool industry, the Woolstores and associated commercial and industrial buildings turned obsolete. Consequently, since the early 1980s the Waterfront and Woolstores Conservation Area entered into a revitalisation process. In that sense, new uses and contemporary creative interpretation practices have been promoted in the buildings. The aim of this project is also to preserve the inner city’s landscape and its unique architectural character, since the area shares an architectural integrity that gives a local distinctiveness to the city and its port. Moreover, to preserve the aesthetic and historical values of the buildings, as well as the streetscape, the Greater Geelong Planning Scheme established some strategies and policy guidelines, making sure that any “external alterations (would) make a positive contribution to the built form and (the) amenity of the area”; while at the same time raising awareness that such constructions are a legacy for future generations that represent the community’s identity. For instance, the former Dalgety & Co. Woolstore became the Deakin University Waterfront campus in a project that won the President’s Award for Recycled Buildings in 1997. This event became the starting point of Geelong’s business central district revival, and signified the arrival of the modern age in the ‘new Geelong’. The twenty seven buildings situated in the Woolstores Conservation Area have found a new purpose, mainly related to entertainment, education and tourism: seven of them are now restaurants, bars, or event centres, three are part of a shopping mall (Westfield Geelong), two are offices, one is a university (Deakin University), another one a hotel (Bush Inn Hotel), one complex a Museum (National Wool Museum), six buildings were demolished, and the current use of the remaining three is unknown. Geelong’s Woolstores Conservation Area was not the only one in Australia to go through these urban reinvention processes. During the last two decades, other Woolstores located in Adelaide, Brisbane, Fremantle, Melbourne, and Sydney have also encountered new uses as apartments, offices and shopping centres. == A Timeline of Geelong's Woolstores == *1838 - Geelong was proclaimed a town and two stores, the Woolpack Inn and a customs station were opened. *1872- Construction of the former Dennys Lascelles wool store in blue stone (Moorabool Street). At the time of its construction, it was the second largest wool store in the colony after Goldsborough & Co. in Melbourne. *1889 - The four-storey brick complex of the Strachan, Murray and Shannon Woolstore (now housing the Westfield shopping centre) was constructed. *1917 - The George Hague & Co. Woolstores were partially demolished. *1970-80 - The wool industry weakened. The buildings turned obsolete due to changes in wool selling and handling. *1988 - Creation of the National Wool Museum in the former Dennys Lascelles Woolstore in Moorabool street. *1990- Demolition of the Bow Truss Building (built in 1910) in a controversial decision. *1996- Establishment of the Deakin University Waterfront campus in the former Dalgety & Co. Woolstore. *1998- Opening of the Westfield shopping centre in three former woolstores. Today, only the façade of the Strachan Woolstores Complex remains. *2000 onwards- Redevelopment of former Woolstores and associated buildings into commodity amenities == References == #n.d.

But Evenus refused his request because he wanted her daughter to remain a virgin. Idas went to his father Poseidon and begged for the use of a winged chariot.Jeanie Lang. A Book of Myths, p. 90-99. After Poseidon consented to his use of the chariot, Idas raped Marpessa and carried her away from a band of dancers and to Pleuron in Aetolia.Baccchylides. Dithyrambs, 6.1 Her father, after chasing the couple for a long time, realized that he could not catch up to them. In his madness, he killed his horses and then drowned himself in a nearby river Lycormas and became immortal.

In most cases, molecular phenotyping quantifies changes of pathway reporter gene expression to characterize modulation of pathway activities induced by perturbations such as therapeutic agents or stress in a cellular system in vitro. In such contexts, measurements at early time points are often more informative than later observations because they capture the primary response to the perturbation by the cellular system. Integrated with quantified changes of phenotype induced by the perturbation, molecular phenotyping can identify pathways that contribute to the phenotypic changes. Currently molecular phenotyping uses RNA sequencing and mRNA expression to infer pathway activities. Other technologies and readouts such as mass spectrometry and protein abundance or phosphorylation levels can be potentially used as well. == Application in early drug discovery == Current data suggest that by quantifying pathway reporter gene expression, molecular phenotyping is able to cluster compounds based on pathway profiles and dissect associations between pathway activities and disease phenotypes simultaneously.

She is also remembered as one of the most important memoirists of her day, writing letters and diaries documenting important events, including the career of her husband, Anton Frederik Tscherning (1795–1874) who served as a member of Parliament and the Council of State as well as Defence Minister. ==Biography== Born on 4 July 1817 in Helsingør, Eleonora Tscherning was the daughter of military officer Adam Tobias Lützow (1775–1844) and Bodil Rasmussen (1790–1865), his unmarried housekeeper. It was only in 1837 that she discovered the identity of her father when, on being promoted head of the artillery corps, he decided to adopt her. The family moved to Copenhagen where she studied painting at the school run by her cousin, the author and flower painter Christine Løvmand. Tscherning moved from flower painting to landscapes, happy to work in the open air. She gained experience by copying works by Fritz Petzholdt and Jens Juel. She also developed friendships with P.C. Skovgaard, Johan Lundbye and Thorald Læssøe. She exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition from 1842 to 1849, initially anonymously, later using her own name. As a result, she was one of the first female painters in Denmark who signed their works with their names rather than with pseudonyms. In 1845, she married A.F. Tscherning, who encouraged her to continue painting but marriage to a politician and raising a family of five children left her little time for creative work. As an artist, she found that married life was too demanding for her to paint but she was nevertheless able to travel abroad with her daughter, in 1869 to Switzerland and in 1873 to Italy. From 1864, she decorated vases at the P. Ipsens Enke terracotta factory but retired some 20 years later after suffering a heart attack. After her husband died in 1874, she supplemented her income by running a flower painting course for young women together with her youngest daughter, Sara Ulrik (1855–1916). Her elder daughter Anthonore Christensen (1849–1926) was also an artist. Tscherning also wrote a number of articles some of which appeared in Fortællinger in 1870. Between 1871 and 1875, she wrote and published a series of poems and short stories. Her memoirs and letters were published for the first time in 1908. Eleonora Tscherning died on 3 July 1890. She was buried at Garnisons Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==References== Category:1817 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Danish women writers Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish women painters Category:People from Helsingør Category:19th- century Danish memoirists Category:19th-century women artists Category:19th- century women writers Category:Danish women memoirists Category:Women memoirists ","title":"Eleonora Tscherning"},{"id":"54236425","text":"Hector Gosset (9 September 1926 - 27 October 2007) was a Belgian sprinter.

He discovered the first human coronavirus (designated B814) in 1965. With June Almeida he made the first comparative study of human and chicken coronaviruses in 1967, and invented the name coronavirus in 1968. ==Biography== Å, and are surrounded by a distinct 200 Å long fringe. They are indistinguishable from the particles of avian infectious bronchitis\\" – Almeida and Tyrrell 1967 Tyrrell was born on 19 June 1925 to Sidney Tyrrell and Agnes Kate Blewett. He had a younger brother Andrew. He attended elementary schools at Ashford, Middlesex. His family moved to Sheffield in 1940, where he completed secondary education at King Edward VII School. While studying medicine at the University of Sheffield he suffered from a detached retina, which meant he was exempted from military conscription, and had a lifelong preference for monocular microscopes. He graduated in 1948 and earned membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1949. During those years he worked as a house physician at the Professorial Medical Unit of Sheffield Royal Hospital and at the City General Hospital in Sheffield. He was appointed as the first Research Registrar post under the Hospital Endowment Fund of Sheffield in 1950. He moved to the Rockefeller Institute in New York to work under Frank Horsfall as an assistant from 1951 to 1954. He was briefly enrolled in the US Army during the Korean War (1950–1953). In 1954, he then gained an appointment as External Scientific Staff of the Medical Research Council at the Virus Research Laboratory in Sheffield, where he worked until 1957. Upon an invitation from Sir Harold Himsworth, Secretary of MRC, he moved to the MRC's Common Cold Unit on the outskirts of Salisbury on 1 April 1957, becoming its Head from 1962 succeeding Christopher Andrewes. He was also appointed as Head of the Division of Communicable Diseases in 1967 and then Deputy Director of the MRC's Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, in 1970, while still attached to CCU. The Clinical Research Centre was closed in 1984 following which Tyrrell returned full time at CCU in 1985, and remained there till its official closure in 1990. In the 1960s, after June Almeida produced the first images of the rubella virus using immune-electronmicroscopy, Tyrrell and Almeida worked on characterising a new type of viruses, now called coronaviruses. He retired from the Common Cold Unit in 1990 and subsequently carried out research at the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research at Porton Down, where he also worked on his scientific autobiography, Cold Wars: The Fight Against the Common Cold. He died of prostate cancer on 2 May 2005 at Salisbury.  Personal life  Tyrrell married Moyra Wylie, a general practitioner, in 1950. They had one son and two daughters. He was a devoted Christian and served as an organist and choirmaster at his local church. == Scientific achievements ==  Discovery and invention of coronavirus  Soon after he joined CCU, Tyrrell developed a system of categorising cold viruses. Some viruses could be maintained only in human-embryo-kidney cell culture and were designated H strain, and others could be maintained both in human-embryo- kidney cell culture and monkey-embryo-kidney cell culture and were labelled M strain. One nasal swab sample collected on 17 February 1961 from a schoolboy in Epsom, Surrey, was different as it could not be maintained in any of the culture media. The specimen designated B814 when experimented on healthy volunteers was highly contagious and produced the symptoms of cold within a few days. Due to its unusual nature, they were uncertain whether the pathogen was a virus of a bacterium. Without any other method to study, the specimen was preserved for four years. Returning from a visit to the Lund University in Sweden in 1965, Andrewes told Tyrrell that there was a young Swedish surgeon who was able to grow complex viruses. The Swede was Bertil Hoorn who had developed a culture method using human trachea tissue. Tyrrell immediately invited Hoorn to visit CCU, and after which they were was able to grow different viruses which could not be cultured earlier. Specimen B814 could the be confirmed as a virus, but was unique from all known cold viruses based on its antigenic property and symptoms it produced. Tyrrell and Malcolm L. Bynoe reported the discovery in the 5 June 1965 issue of the British Medical Journal, concluding: \\"After considerable initial doubts we now believe that the B814 strain is a virus virtually unrelated to any other known virus of the human respiratory tract, although, since it is ether-labile, it may be a myxovirus.\\" This was the discovery of human coronavirus. But the virus was difficult to maintain in culture and the structure was difficult to study. In 1966, June Dalziel Almeida had just joined as an electron microscopist at the St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London. She had earlier developed techniques for studying viruses under electron microscope, and had also studied the first two coronaviruses discovered, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Tyrrell sent her the specimen, including one new human virus called 229E, which was recently discovered by Dorothy Hamre and John J. Procknow at the University of Chicago. Almeida revealed that the two human viruses were identical to each other, and to IBV as well. Almeida and Tyrrell reported in the April 1967 issue of the Journal of General Virology, writing: \\"Probably the most interesting finding from these experiments was that two human respiratory viruses, 229 E and B814 are morphologically identical with avian infectious bronchitis.\\" The new discovery was supported by independent discovery of new human viruses (OC43) by Kenneth McIntosh and co-workers at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, almost at the same time. It was becoming evident that all these viruses including MHV were of the same kind. Almeida and Tyrrell came up with the name \\"coronavirus\\". As Tyrrell recollected in Cold Wars: The Fight Against the Common Cold: > We looked more closely at the appearance of the new viruses and noticed that > they had a kind of halo surrounding them. Recourse to a dictionary produced > the Latin equivalent, corona, and so the name coronavirus was born.  Other works  At the Rockefeller Institute, Tyrrell worked on the epidemiology on poliomyelitis. He presented his findings at the second International Congress on Poliomyelitis in Copenhagen on 3–7 September 1951, and published in The Lancet at the end of the year. At CCU, he developed techniques for culturing different cold viruses. He was the first to grow certain cold viruses (rhinoviruses) using nasal epithelial cells. He published a series of papers on his new technique in The Lancet in 1960. With researchers from University College London, he also investigated the role of human parvovirus B19 during 1985–1987. They discovered that the virus is the causative agent of erythematous rash illness and temporary stoppage of blood formation in persons with chronic haemolytic anaemia. ==Awards and honours== Tyrrell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1970, and was appointed Commander of the Order of British Empire (CBE) in 1980. He held honorary degrees from the University of Sheffield (1979) and the University of Southampton (1990), and received the Stewart Prize (1977), the Ambuj Nath Bose prize (1983), and the Conway Evans Prize (1986). == References  External links == Category:1925 births Category:Place of birth missing Category:2005 deaths Category:British virologists Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"David Tyrrell (physician)"},{"id":"54236751","text":"Máximo Reyes (born 8 January 1929) is a Peruvian sprinter.

He claimed that the label approached him to licence the rights to the song but a dispute in the terms of the contract prevented it from going forward and T-Series eventually produced the song. T-Series responded with a statement saying that the song was a remake of a 2007 sing titled Girl Friend Boy Friend sung by Gopal Sharma that was produced by the label as part of a Punjabi-language compilation. The label further warned Singh against misleading people and stated that he should be thankful that no legal action was taken against him by them for infringement of the 2007 song. ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:Songs written for films Category:Hindi film songs Category:Arijit Singh songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Kumaar Category:Neha Kakkar songs ","title":"Main Tera Boyfriend"},{"id":"54236826","text":"Arhopala alaconia is a species of butterfly belonging to the lycaenid family described by William Chapman Hewitson in 1869.

He is the Thomas Jefferson Professor for Discovery and Space Exploration, a Professor of Astronomy, and Chair of Undergraduate Studies at and Vice Chair of The Ohio State University Department of Astronomy. He was chair of the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis Group (2012–2014) and the NASA Astrophysics Advisory Committee (2012–2014). In 2018, Gaudi was co-chair of the National Academy of Sciences Exoplanet Science Strategy study. == Background == Prof. Gaudi grew up in a small rural town in Illinois of less than 5000 people called Staunton, which is situated about an hour northeast of St. Louis. He received his high school diploma from the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, his Bachelors of Science in Astrophysics from the Michigan State University, and his PhD in Astronomy from The Ohio State University. Gaudi has been a faculty member of The Ohio State University Department of Astronomy since 2006. He previously was a Menzel Fellow at Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a Hubble Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. Dr. Gaudi was the recipient of the Helen B. Warner Prize of the American Astronomical Society in 2009, won a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, a Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering (PECASE) in 2012, and received NASA's Outstanding Public Leadership Medal in 2017. Gaudi is single, and self-identifies as a gay man. He has worked to bring equality to underrepresented groups in astronomy and to eliminate harassment of all kinds, and has fostered engagement in astronomy among LGBTQ and HIV-impacted youth. == Academic research == Gaudi is a leader in the discovery and statistical characterization of extrasolar planets using a variety of methods, including transits and gravitational microlensing. In 2008, he and his collaborators announced the discovery of the first Jupiter/Saturn analog using microlensing. In 2017, as one of the three Co-PIs, he led the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope ground-based survey collaboration in announcing the discovery of KELT-9b, the hottest transiting gas giant ever discovered. Gaudi's first major media appearance was in Discover, when the magazine named him one of “20 Young Scientists to Watch in the Next 20 Years.” He's since moved to the forefront of worldwide planet- hunting collaborations, where he frequently coordinates the efforts of astronomers around the globe. Gaudi has helped discover over fifty planets with several techniques, with his work earning him coverage in the New York Times, Washington Post, New Scientist, Sky & Telescope, Astronomy and Wired, among many others. He gave a TEDxColumbus talk in 2013. == Exoplanet mission development == Generally, Gaudi is deeply immersed in analytic and numerical techniques for assessing the yield, biases, and discovery potential of current and next-generation surveys to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and has recently turned his attention to developing space telescope concepts that could address one of humanity's most fundamental questions: Is there life elsewhere in the universe? He is a member of the Formulation Science Working Group for NASA’s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and is currently co-community chair of NASA's Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission study. ==References== Category:Ohio State University faculty Category:Living people Category:People from Staunton, Illinois Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:American astronomers Category:1974 births Category:Harvard College Observatory people Category:LGBT people from Illinois Category:LGBT scientists from the United States Category:Gay academics ","title":"Scott Gaudi"},{"id":"54236845","text":"The canton of Foix is an administrative division of the Ariège department, southern France.

After the February Revolution of 1917, he became a commissar of the Provisional Government. == Biography == Peter Levanidov was born on 24 June 1864, in Klimovskaya village of in the Shenkursk uyezd (Arkhangelsk Governorate) in a peasant family: his father was Alexander Stepanovich Levanidov, a volost clerk. Peter got only an initial (home) education, since the nearest school was as far as 20 versts from the village. Between 1887 and 1889, he served as a clerk in the village; then, for almost 17 years, he was the forestry inspector. In 1905, during the peasant unrest of the Russian Revolution, he had to leave the service. After that Levanidov became a head of his volost (volostnoy starshina) – according to the Arkhangelsk governor, Petr Levanidov was \\"an ordinary peasant, underdeveloped, right [in political views]\\". On 20 October 1912 he was elected to the Fourth Imperial Duma from the Arkhangelsk Governorate. Despite the governor's opinion, in the IV Duma, he joined the faction of the Constitutional Democratic Party – he also became a member of a number of Duma commissions. Later he joined the Progressive Bloc. Levanidov negatively spoke about the progress of the Stolypin agrarian reform – in June 1913, protesting against the violence, which in practice was accompanied its conduct, he claimed: After the February Revolution of 1917, Petr Aleksandrovich received the post of a commissar of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and the Provisional Government of Russia in Arkhangelsk Governorate.

Cornelis Bicker (25 October 1592 – 15 September 1654), heer (lord) Van Swieten and of Kasteel Swieten, was a regent of the Dutch Republic and a governor of the Dutch West India Company. He was also a sugar merchant, hoogheemraad of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland and a counsellor of the States of Holland and West Friesland for Amsterdam at The Hague. Born in Amsterdam, he was a member of that city's Bicker family - along with their allies the De Graeff family, they controlled Amsterdam's city government and the province of Holland for half a century. Both families were powerful and influential between the 1640s and 1672 during the height of the Republic's power. Biography of Andries Bicker on DBNL ==Life== The old town hall by Abraham Rademaker In 1617 he and his new wife settled at Singel 130 in Amsterdam, in a building which his family only sold in 1767. In 1622 later Bicker became governor of the West India Company and also held several directorships, such as of the Amsterdamse Wisselbank. In 1628 he became a schepen. In 1632 he bought the Swieten estate and manorhouse from Hugo Cuyk van Mierop - from these he later derived his title. Het kasteel Zwieten te Zoeterwoude Het Kasteel Swieten In 1634 he was appointed a captain in the militia or schutterij. He was mayor of Amsterdam in 1646, 1650 and 1654. In 1647 he became a deputy for East Friesland at the States General. Cornelis Bicker supported his brother Andries, Jacob de Witt and Cornelis de Graeff in the signing of the Peace of Münster and in May 1650 supported a proposal that suggested military cutbacks to encourage peace efforts. On 30 July 1650 he activated the militia to defend against an attack on Amsterdam by William II of Orange after being warned of William's approach by a postman travelling from Hamburg to Amsterdam, who passed on the news to Bicker's nephew (via his brother, the former mayor Andries) Gerard Bicker, then the bailiff or drost of Muiden. Gerard set off for Amsterdam immediately and after receiving the news Cornelis and Andries raised the bridges, shut the gates and deployed artillery. The attack failed but after the attack De Graeff passed on a message from William that Cornelis and Andries must resign from their posts on the town council. However, they were restored to them on 22 November the same year. ==In art== Bailly's portrait of Bicker's wife. Blick commissioned a large-format portrait of himself and his family from Cornelis van der Voort in 1618.

Today, Richard Veenfliet is perhaps best known for his postcards. ==Early Life, Family and Education== Richard Veenfliet was born on August 2, 1843, in Wesel, Prussia. Veenfliet was the second child of eight children. The Veenfliet family emigrated to the United States of America after his father, George F. Veenfliet, a former Prussian officer, professor of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the University of Bonn and professor of Languages and Sciences at the High School of Aix-la-Chapelle, became embroiled in the Revolutions of 1848.Mill, James Cook (1918) History of Saginaw County, Michigan: Historical, Commercial, Biographical, Volume 2 Soon after the family arrived in Detroit, and in the company of a companion, Carl Post, a friend of similar thought and character, they began to explore the country toward the Saginaw River. The Veenfliets then became one of the founding families of Blumfield Township, Michigan. Many Native Americans lived in this part of Michigan and, perhaps unique to its time, the two groups were friendly and lived peacefully together. In fact, they often had to work together. While the primeval forest of Blumfield was very beautiful, it often proved to be hazardous and full of unexpected hardships. The Veenfliets named Blumfeld Township after Robert Blum, also a political offender, who was shot in 1848 by the King's soldiers for daring to take the part of his oppressed fellow men. The Veenfliets, along with Rudolph Diepenbeck, were advocates for immigration. They established and manned offices in New York City and Detroit, from which they sent promotional pamphlets abroad.Ziegler-McPherson, Christina (2017) Selling America: Immigration Promotion and the Settlement of the American Continent, 1607–1914 They were also liberal in their religious views.Portrait and biographical record of Saginaw and Bay Counties, Michigan : containing biographical sketches of prominent and representative citizens, together with biographies of all the governors of the state, and of the presidents of the United States.Chicago: Biographical Pub. Co., 1892. The beliefs of the Veenfliets often reflected those of Robert Blum and, by extension, the period of Romanticism. Veenfliet attended school in Blumfield, Saginaw and Detroit, where he studied architecture. In Saginaw in the summer of 1863, he took drawing lessons from a Mr. Haugh and the following year enlisted in a Michigan Infantry unit in the Civil War. ==Civil War== A picture of Robert Blum long graced the walls of the primitive log school house in Blumfield Township. It represented him kneeling on the ground, his Executioners ranged in front, and he in the act of tearing the folds from his eyes, and saying: \\"An honest brave man does not fear death, he glories in the thought of dying for his country.\\" This would later inspire many young men in Blumfield County to join the Union Army, including Richard Veenfliet and his older brother Fred. Specifically, men from Blumfield were inspired by Robert Blum to wipe out slavery as a national institution. Richard's father, George F. Veenfliet, was one of the delegates to the 1860 Republican National Convention, which nominated Abraham Lincoln for president. Both Richard and his brother Fred were part of the 14th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 29th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Richard Veenfliet's brother Fred died in the Battle of Nashville, December 15, 1864, when rebel General John Bell Hood surrounded and attempted to capture the city. ==Post Civil War and World War I== After the war, he worked as a laborer, salesman and architect. In 1884, he moved to New York City, where he took a job as a foreman of the art department with Frankmann Bailey & Blanpy. It is highly likely that Richard Veenfliet had to register as German and report to county court during World War I, as records have confirmed his younger sister Augusta's registration. This was a time in which many Americans were angry and suspicious towards German-Americans, and during the course of the war the government registered nearly half a million \\"enemy alien\\" civilians and interned nearly 6,000. Unfortunately, many states have not released these records and thus cannot be confirmed. Richard Veenfliet was a member of the Cincinnati Art Club and held a position at the Strobridge Lithographic Company. He also exhibited his work at the Chicago Art Institute. He died in 1922, painting at his easel one of the many watercolors for which he is well known. ==References== Category:German male painters Category:Artists from Michigan Category:1843 births Category:1922 deaths Category:American male artists Category:American artists Category:Union Army soldiers Category:People from Saginaw, Michigan Category:People from Detroit Category:People from Wesel Category:German emigrants to the United States ","title":"Richard Veenfliet"},{"id":"54237070","text":"Koah LaOvdim () is an Israeli labor union organization founded on 30 May 2007 (registered in 2008) as an initiative by a group of social and labor activists to create a new, active and militant general labor union in Israel. The organization was established as a result of several failed labor struggles and unionization attempts in Israel in the preceding years, primarily that of the temporary labourers in the Ben Gurion international airport in 2006. Koah LaOvdim differed from other Israeli labor unions of its time by having a democratic internal organization and by the fact it was actively establishing new union branches. In the years since its establishment, Koah LaOvdim have increased its numbers substantially and by 2017 it became Israel's third largest labor union with around 35,000 workers represented by the organization. The organization's establishment is often credited with initiating the \\"unionization boom\\" of the late 2000s in Israel. The union's political position is on the left, with their stated aims being: * To assist unorganized workers in getting organized in their workplace both in the public and the private sector. * To promote the existence of organized labor in the Israeli economy. * To wage an uncompromising struggle in the defense of workers’ rights and the improvement of their pay and working conditions. * To work for the establishment of social and economic justice, a welfare state and industrial democracy. Koah LaOvdim is a multi-national, transethnic and cross- sectional organization, unionizing workers from all sectors of Israeli society, with equality and solidarity between Jews and Arabs being one of the organization's core beliefs, and the organization have worked against racist incidents against Arab workers in Israel.

He did not remain the position for long, instead taking up weaving as a profession. In 1896 he married, but it was an unhappy marriage, and he left to become a pedlar for a while. After his wife's death he moved to Usk, and for a few years earned a living as a shopkeeper. In 1812 he took up a schoolmaster position at Usk School, before in 1815 opening a new school at Devauden. He is described as being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a generous man, and provided Bibles and other books at his own expense. He held strong religious beliefs, and it would seem thus, the school- house eventually became a 'chapel-of-ease' (where he served as a clerk), and a new school (the 'James Davies School') was built.

Much of her life and research was concerned with the study of parapsychology, mainly in order to examine how psychic abilities might demonstrate the abilities, breadth and power of the human mind. She began to exhibit and develop psychic abilities herself around 1901, and became both a recipient and analyst of many cross-correspondences produced by psychics, most notably the Palm Sunday scripts. == Life == Born at 4 Dorset Gardens, Brighton in 1857, Margaret was the eldest of two daughters born to Frederick Merrifield (1831-1924) and Maria Angélique de Gaudrion (1824/5–1894). Her father was a clerk to the County Councils of East and West Sussex. Her mother was of French origin and the daughter of Colonel V.P.J. de Gaudrion, said to be from an old French family. She entered Newnham College (then Hall) in 1875 intending to study political science, but was persuaded to take a Classical Tripos by a friend, and passed with second-class honours in 1880. She was appointed a lecturer at the college the same year. She married fellow classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall on 17 Jun 1882, and they went on to have two daughters, Helen, born in 1883, and Phoebe, born in 1888, who died in 1890. Arthur Verrall was the first Edward VII professor of English Literature, but Margaret remained active in lecturing and research even after her marriage, somewhat unusually for middle-class woman in that period. She collaborated with her husband on some work, notably the text of Pausanias for The Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens, published jointly with colleague Jane Harrison in 1890. She edited some of his lectures after his death. It was said that both the Verralls were supporters of the Liberal Party at a time when Cambridge was a staunchly Tory supporting area, but the couple did not find that to be a barrier to being accepted by the local community. Margaret was a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and her parents, sister, Flora de Gaudrion Merrifield, and sister-in-law, Marian Verrall, were all suffragist campaigners. However, it appears that Margaret was not actively a Suffragist She was a member of the Ladies Dining Society, a private women's dining and discussion club that had been established by Louise Creighton and Kathleen Lyttelton in 1890. Between 1914-1915, Margaret was the Secretary of the Cambridge University Hospitality Committee. The committee was formed to make arrangements for refugee Belgian students coming to Cambridge to continue their studies (often with their own professors). Her knowledge of French was undoubtedly useful in this work, but it petered out as the students drifted off into war service or to the front lines. This work was remembered at her burial in 1916, which was attended by leading members of the Belgian University Committee who contributed a wreath inscribed 'Le corps professorial Belge reconnaissant.' She died of cancer on the 2 July 1916, at her home, 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge. == Research into Parapsychology == Margaret joined the Society for Psychical Research in February 1889, and became an interested and active member. She wrote about her own experiments on a number of subjects, including thought-transference, crystal-gazing and later more famous articles on automatic writing. She became a member of the Council in, and also acted as a proof reader for the Proceedings of the Society on their Committee of Reference from 1904, reviewing all papers submitted for publication.

A symbol of rebirth after the Umbria-Marche earthquakes of 1997, it occupies a place where a temporary housing for displaced residents once sat. The religious building was commissioned by the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) after the earthquakes of the late 1990s. Fuksas was assigned to the project after winning a competition that was announced in 2001. == Architecture == Inside view, where both the internal and external boxes, one inside the other, are visible The building is chiefly composed of reinforced concrete, as a box within a box; the external section is 22,50m wide, 30m long, and 26m high; while the internal one is three meters above the floor and three meters from the external walls. Light enters through irregular windows found in the outside walls and through the roof. Though the church appears to be a monolithic block of cement, it was actually made using a structure of beams made of concrete with an internal and external liner of self-compacting cement 10 cm thick. The relationship between the building and sky, between light and the concrete structure, is to be noted. Outside light enters from either the top or the bottom of the church. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and the presbytery and altar are placed in the center of the interiore space. The architect was inspired by Le Corbusier's Notre Dame du Haut in particolare as well as Gio Ponti's Villa Nemazee in Teheran. Mimmo Paladino created the 14 Stations of the Cross for the church. == Criticism == Detail of the lamps that hang from the ceiling and the irregularly formed windows. Even though it was the Italian Episcolap Conference that chose Fuksas' design for its innovative character, the architect received some severe criticism. Vittorio Sgarbi, for example, maintained that the building does not fit in with its surroundings and therefore sticks out too much (this was, however, the intent of the architect), and seems more like a shoebox than a sacred space. == Note  Bibliography == * Category:Roman Catholic churches in Foligno Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 2009 Category:Massimiliano Fuksas buildings Category:Church buildings by Italian architects ","title":"San Paolo Apostolo, Foligno"},{"id":"54237244","text":"The Daily Inter Lake is a newspaper in Kalispell, Montana, the county seat of Flathead County.

It is also referred to as perfluoromethanol or trifluoromethyl alcohol. The compound is the simplest perfluoroalcohol. The substance is a colorless gas, which is unstable at room temperature. ==Synthesis== Like all primary and secondary perfluoroalcohols, trifluoromethanol eliminates hydrogen fluoride in an endothermic reaction and forms carbonyl fluoride. : ⇌ + (I) At temperatures in the range of -120 °C, trifluoromethanol can be prepared from trifluoromethoxy chloride and hydrogen chloride: : + → + (II) In this reaction, the recombination of a partially positively charged chlorine atom (in trifluoromethoxy chloride) with a partially negatively charged chlorine atom (in hydrogen chloride) is used as elemental chlorine. The undesired products, by-products chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and chlorotrifluoromethane, can be removed by evaporation at -110 °C. Trifluoromethanol has a melting point of -82 °C and a calculated boiling point of about -20 °C. The boiling point is thus about 85 K lower than that of methanol. This fact can be explained by the absence of intramolecular H—F bonds, which are also not visible in the infrared gas phase spectrum. A simpler synthesis uses the reaction (I); an equilibrium can be shifted to the thermodynamically preferred trifluoromethanol at lower temperatures. If the synthesized trifluoromethanol is protonated by superacids, for example (fluoroantimonic acid), the equilibrium can be further shifted to the left towards the desired product. Similar to reaction (I), trifluoromethoxides () can be prepared from saline- type fluorides (e.g., ) and carbonyl fluoride. However, if the ion is, for example, in an aqueous solution displaced by an acid, trifluoromethanol decomposes at the room temperature. ==Occurrence in upper layers of atmosphere== While trifluoromethanol is unstable under normal conditions, it is generated in the stratosphere from and radicals by reaction with and radicals. In this case, decomposition of trifluoromethanol is negligible under the conditions prevailing in the atmosphere due to the high activation energy of the reaction. The expected lifetime of trifluoromethanol is several million years at altitudes below 40 km. ==See also== *Trifluoroethanol ==References== Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds Category:Primary alcohols Category:Trifluoromethoxy compounds ","title":"Trifluoromethanol"},{"id":"54237359","text":"The Badouel ray-triangle intersection algorithm, named after inventor Didier Badouel, is a fast method for calculating the intersection of a ray and a triangle in three dimensions without needing precomputation of the plane equation of the plane containing the triangle. == External links == * Ray- Polygon Intersection An Efficient Ray-Polygon Intersection by Didier Badouel from Graphics Gems I Category:Geometry ","title":"Badouel intersection algorithm"},{"id":"54237380","text":"James Davies (Iago ap Dewi) (1800 - 16 April 1869) was a Welsh poet, and printer.

The town is the site for the Kumasi Military Hospital. It is one of the successful towns in the Atwima Nwabiagya district and currently the leading developing town in the district. It is among the oldest towns in the Ashanti region. The main work of the inhabitants of Afari has been farming and pottery. The royals in the town are said to be the descendants of Oheneba Acheampong Kwasi who was the son of Oti Akenten the first Chief of Kwaman, modern Kumasi before Kumasi became part of the Ashanti Kingdon. The royal family is said to have migrated from Abrenyase ,the current Yaa Asantewa Girls Senior High School at Tanoso and settled in Afari. The town has been without a traditional ruler for the past twenty years now when the occupant of the Oheneba Acheampong Kwasi stool expired in the year 2000 leaving the town without effective leadership and this has affected the development of the area. In recent times the town has seen various infrastructural developments making it one of the fastest developing towns in the region. One should however be extremely careful buying parcel of land for development since there is no traditional ruler who is supposed to be the sole person with the capacity to sell stool lands to any third party. Farmers who till the lands have taken advantage of the absence of a traditional ruler and selling their lands to unsuspecting parties which may in long term create confusion especially after the installation of traditional ruler. The people of Afari are said to be friendly and hard working. With the influx of strangers who are building houses and settling in Afari people should be on guard against stealing ,break and petty robberies. When the Military Hospital is commissioned Afari will be among the best towns to live in since the proximity to the Regional capital Kumasi is about 30 minutes drive.

Hons) at the University of Wales and an M.Sc. at the University of Clermont-Ferrand (France). She completed her PhD in endocrinology and physiology at the University of Calgary (Canada) in 1977 as well as her Doctorat d’Etat (D.Sc.) at the University Paris VI in 1983. == Research career == Between 1970 and 1981 Barbara Demeneix taught at different levels in Malawi, Canada, Morocco and France, before taking up a Lectureship at the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg from 1981 to 1989. During this period she undertook two research fellowships in the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory in Cambridge (1986) and in the Max Planck Institute in Munich (1988-1989). Since arriving at the National Museum of Natural History in 1990 her research focused on the evolution of thyroid hormone signalling. She sought to understand how thyroid hormones activate or repress gene activity in different tissues at various developmental states and in changing physiological conditions. Working with amphibian and mouse models, she contributed to developing and optimising techniques to study gene regulation in integrated contexts. Technologies have been patented and licensed out to SMEs (Polyplus, WatchFrog). In the laboratory, these methods have been applied to advance understanding of: * how thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback effects on hypothalamic controls, * how thyroid hormone regulates adult neurogenesis during aging, * how thyroid hormone acts in early amphibian development and in metamorphosis. Barbara Demeneix was nominated to the Chair of Comparative Physiology in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris in 1995. This position was previously held by Claude Bernard, Jean-Pierre Flourens and Frédéric Cuvier. In 1998 she took on the twin direction of Museum Comparative Physiology Laboratory and the CNRS unit UMR 7221 ‘Evolution of Endocrine Regulations’ (1998-2013). In 2001 she became director of the Department ‘Regulations and Development’ of the National Museum of Natural History, a post she held until 2017. This department grouped 3 main research units representing 200 staff. During this period she coordinated two large-scale European projects: CRESCENDO (2005-2011) on nuclear receptors in development and aging, and SWITCHBOX (2011-2015) on maintaining health in old age through homeostasis. Barbara Demeneix is active with international committees addressing thyroid hormone and endocrine disruption (including the OECD and the European Thyroid Association). In 2016 she co-published an opinion column in Le Monde with more than 100 other scientists, in which they asked the EU and the international community to act against endocrine disrupting chemicals. They also condemned the use of strategies for manufacturing doubt employed by industries in the climate change battle. == Awards == * 2004 Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur * 2011 Nature Award for Mentoring in Science (France) * 2014 Officier de la Légion d’Honneur * 2014 CNRS Medal for Innovation * 2017 Finalist of the EU Prize for Women Innovators * 2018 Commander of the French National Order of Merit == Publications == Barbara Demeneix has published more than 170 scientific publications, and two first-author books.

The man injured the officer with the hammer, and was found to be in possession of kitchen knives. French police opened a terrorism investigation. The accused is an Algerian-born journalist named Farid Ikken, who won an award for his prize-winning human rights writing in Sweden, before returning to Algeria where he started an online news site, and then, moved to France on a student visa, he was pursuing a PhD in communications at the time of the attack. According to the prosecutor, a video in which he pledged allegiance to ISIS was found at the accused's apartment. ==Context== The attack followed other attacks or attempted attacks on French landmarks in 2017, including the Louvre machete attack in February, the Orly airport attack in March, and the Champs-Elysées attack in April. French landmarks have received constant police protection because they are regarded as being \\"especially vulnerable,\\" these security measures are part of a state of emergency which has been in place in France from 2015 to late 2017. On the day following this attack, the Macron government officially announced the creation of a new intelligence task force, dubbed the National Centre for Counter Terrorism. The Centre, which had been in the planning stages for some months, is under the direct authority of the French President. Macron appointed Pierre de Bousquet de Florian to head the new Centre. ==Attack== According to a police spokesman, the accused \\"approached a police officer, took a hammer from his backpack and hit a police officer over the head,\\" injuring the officer. The assailant was also carrying knives. The accused reportedly shouted \\"c'est pour la Syrie\\" (\\"this is for Syria\\") during the attack, before being shot in the chest by another officer. After being shot, the accused asserted that he was \\"un soldat du califat\\" (a soldier of the caliphate). Immediately after the incident, Gérard Collomb, the French Minister of the Interior, said the man had a form of identification indicating he was a student from Algeria. Nine hundred people were locked down inside the cathedral for two hours. American diplomat and national security expert Nancy Soderberg and her 16-year-old niece were among the visitors trapped inside the Cathedral; the international press ran photos tweeted out by Soderberg showing hundreds of visitors sitting with their hands in the air. ==Legal proceedings== The accused appeared in court on 10 June 2017 and was charged with associating with terrorists and attempting to murder law enforcement officials. According to prosecutor Francois Molins, the accused's laptop and USB keys contained: a manual for \\"lone wolves\\" issued by so-called Islamic State (IS); images of the London attack three days previously; videos \\"glorifying\\" earlier attacks in Paris and Brussels; (and) a videoed message of support for IS which Mr Ikken had tried but failed to upload on to social media on the eve of the attack. Molins added that Ikken had never shown any sign of radicalisation to those close to him, had never been convicted, was unknown to the intelligence services and that, no signs of contact with anyone in Iraq or Syria had been found. The investigation has been assigned to the antiterrorist section of the criminal Brigade and to the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI). Prosecutor Francois Molins described Ikken as an intellectual and a successful man who had never given the slightest indication of Islamist sympathies. Molins said that Ikken had described himself as having radicalized himself over the course of 10 months. Hany Farid, Dartmouth professor and advisor to the Counter Extremism Project, cites Ikken's self- radicalization to argue that social media companies have a responsibility to crack down on incitement to violence. ==Perpetrator== Farid Ikken (born 1977 in Akbou, Algeria), who was in France legally as a PhD student of communications who had been registered at the University of Lorraine, Metz campus, since 2014. His thesis advisor described him as a \\"strong advocate of western democracy.\\" The London Times described Ikken as having a biography that is \\"far removed from those of the disaffected young extremists who have carried out a dozen attacks in France over the past three years.\\" Jason Burke wrote about Ikken in The Guardian as an older, highly educated, man described by friends as \\"soft, secular\\" and attracted to violent jihad without being attracted to the Muslim faith, thereby demonstrating the impossibility of detecting potential terrorists by watching for particular profiles. Born in Algeria to a \\"middle class\\" family, Ikken married a Swedish national and moved to Sweden in 2004. The marriage broke up in 2004. He studied journalism in both Stockholm and Uppsala. He worked as a freelance journalist for several newspapers and a radio station. Radio Sweden has confirmed that he worked for them as an intern for 6 weeks in 2010, reporting local news in Gothenburg. Swedish Security Service (Säpo) have stated that they have no previous knowledge of Ikken. In 2011 he returned to Algeria, where he worked as a journalist, created an online newsletter, and opening a public relations agency, before deciding to return to France and earn a PhD. According to relatives, he had grown up in a secular family, but became a devout Muslim while living in Sweden. He was living in a rented flat in Cergy-Pontoise at the time of the attack. He additionally worked as a journalist in Sweden and Algeria. In 2009 he was awarded the \\"National Journalist Prize\\" from the European Commission for his work in Sweden. According to the Swedish Union of Journalists, Ikken won the general category of the EU Commission's National Journalist Prize Against Discrimination for an article entitled Olaga vård (\\"Unlawful care\\") published in the newspaper Folket i Bild. The article was about \\"asylum seekers who are not entitled to medical care and who are therefore forced to seek medical care, as well as healthcare staff and others who still provide health care to asylum seekers.\\" Ikken described himself as gratified to have been able to bring attention to the important topics of \\"discrimination and diversity\\". He had lived in France for three years and was writing a dissertation on information science and communications. He claimed to be a \\"soldier of the caliphate\\" for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Police searched his residence and found a video in which he pledged allegiance to ISIS. According to government spokesman Christophe Castaner, Ikken \\"never showed any sign of radicalisation\\" before the attack. On the day following the attack, Ikken was hospitalized for gunshot wounds to the chest and was reported to be recovering. In October 2020 Ikken was found guilty and was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Ikken showed no remorse at the verdict. ==See also== * Notre-Dame de Paris bombing attempt ==ReferencesExternal links== * Notre-Dame attacker lunges at cop with hammer in dramatic video (ABC News) Category:2017 in Christianity Category:2017 in Paris Category:ISIL terrorist incidents in France Category:June 2017 crimes in Europe Category:June 2017 events in France Category:National Police (France) 2017 attack Category:Terrorist incidents in France in 2017 Category:Islamic terrorism in Paris Category:Terrorist incidents involving knife attacks Category:Crimes against police officers in France Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 Category:Stabbing attacks in France es:Anexo:Atentados terroristas en 2017#Junio fr:Chronologie des attentats en France en 2017#Juin ","title":"2017 Notre-Dame de Paris attack"},{"id":"54237678","text":"The canton of Portes d'Ariège is an administrative division of the Ariège department, southern France.

She later became known for her roles in the plays of Henrik Ibsen, especially as Nora in A Doll's House. ==Biography== Born on 26 October 1850 in Copenhagen, Betty Mathilde Schnell was the daughter of the tailor Stig Jørgen Schnell (1816–70) and Regine Sophie Dorothea Schmidt (1819–81). On 25 July 1877, she married the music publisher and composer Henrik Hennings. She trained as a ballet dancer at the Royal Danish Theatre under August Bournonville who recognized her talents, giving her leading roles including Hilde in A Folk Tale and promoting her to solo dancer in 1869. But her potential was also noticed by the dramatist Frederik Høedt who encouraged her to become an actress. She decided to accept his offer, preferring a more relaxed career on the stage to that of a ballet dancer. Her theatre début was in 1870 when she played Agnès in Molière's The School for Wives. As she matured, she began to perform in a number of Ibsen's plays, including Nora in A Doll's House, Hedvig in The Wild Duck, the title role in Hedda Gabler, and Ellida in The Lady from the Sea. She starred in other Scandinavian works, such as those by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Holger Drachmann and Gunnar Heiberg but also performed in a variety of other dramas, including Shakespeare's Hamlet, playing Ophelia and later Gertrude, and as Schiller's Maria Stuart. In later life, Hennings continued to act in Ibsen's plays, taking on increasingly mature roles. One of her later roles was Clara in Gustav Wied's Skærmydsler. On her retirement in 1908, she was acclaimed as the first lady of the Royal Theatre. All in all, she had played 170 parts in almost 3,000 performances. Betty Hennings died on 27 October 1939 in Gentofte. ==References== Category:Danish ballerinas Category:19th-century Danish actresses Category:Danish stage actresses Category:20th-century Danish actresses Category:1850 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Actresses from Copenhagen Category:19th-century Danish dancers ","title":"Betty Hennings"},{"id":"54237789","text":"John Newlove (birth registered fourth ¼ 1944) is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

His wife, Jennie, was a well-known journalist and politician. His parents were Rachel and Dafydd Davies, who worked a farm in the Nantgaredig area of Carmarthenshire. He attended Nantgaredig Primary School and then the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Carmarthen. Tragedy struck when his brother Emrys was drowned when they were swimming in the River Tywi near Llain. He was much comforted by the local chapel community, and it was they who later influenced his decision to enter the ministry. Following a preparatory year at Trevecka College, he studied for a degree at University College of Wales, Swansea. He then sought theological training at the 'United Theological College' in Aberystwyth, and was well known in the area as a popular (and unconventional) student-preacher. In 1949, he was ordained a Methodist minister, ministering in Hirwaun and Penderyn, Cynon Valley (1949-1954). In the same year he married Jennie Howells, and they had two sons, Siôn Eirian (later an actor and writer) and Guto Davies. He later moved to Brynaman (1955-1961), and then to Bethesda, Mold and Nercwys in Flintshire (1962-1981). Jennie died suddenly in 1982 and an open verdict was recorded by the coroner; the sudden loss deeply affected Davies.

It runs entirely in Hancock County for a distance of between Ellsworth and Aurora. ==Route description== SR 179 begins at a skewed intersection with U.S. Route 1A (US 1A) about northwest of downtown Ellsworth, but still within the city limits. Within the small commercialized settlement of Ellsworth Falls, SR 179 immediately crosses a disused railroad and a new rail trail past the US 1A intersection. It heads northwest past a church and then sharply bends to the north. At this point, houses and woods line both sides of the road. At Mariaville Road (formerly SR 180 which also used to continue south on a concurrency with SR 179 to US 1A until 2013), the road bends to the northeast and begins to follow the eastern shoreline of Graham Lake. It briefly enters the unorganized territory of Central Hancock before entering the town of Waltham. Houses are sparse along this stretch of the highway as most of the surrounding area is forest. It reaches the northern terminus of SR 200 near the center of the town. North of SR 200, SR 179 heads north and slowly climbs into the Waltham Ridge while some houses and small farms line the road. Near the summit of the hill, the road curves to the northeast and begins to descend from the ridge. Approaching the East Branch Union River, it descends quicker until reaching the river upon which the road enters the town of Mariaville. The road name becomes Tourtelotte Ridge Road upon entering Mariaville; it then begins to ascend hill of the same name passing through forest along the way. It reaches a small clearing at the top of the ridge and curves to the northeast to begin descending the hill. SR 179 clips the northwest corner of Osborn; while in the town, it passes several houses and small farm houses. It also passes to the west of Moose Hill's summit though the road does climb part of the way up the mountain. SR 179 then enters Aurora passing over rolling hills, traveling west of Giles Pond, and heading through a mix of cleared and wooded areas. The road ends at Airline Road, SR 9 in Aurora. ==Major junctionsReferencesExternal links== *Floodgap Roadgap's RoadsAroundME: Maine State Route 179 179 Category:Transportation in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Maine State Route 179"},{"id":"54238061","text":"Seán \\"Georgie\\" Leahy (1938 – 6 June 2017) was an Irish hurling manager, coach, selector and player. His league and championship career with the Kilkenny senior team lasted just one season from 1970 until 1971. Leahy first played competitive hurling with the James Stephens club in his teens, winning a county junior championship medal in 1955. He progressed onto the senior team and was in the twilight of his club career when he won a county senior championship medal in 1969. Success at club level saw Leahy come to the attention of the inter-county selectors. He made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. An All-Ireland runner-up in this grade, he later joined the senior team during the 1970-71 league. Leahy was an All-Ireland runner-up later that year, however, he won a Leinster medal as a non-playing substitute. After beginning his coaching career as a sixteen year old, Leahy became more involved in team management and coaching in his retirement from playing. At club level he enjoyed championship and league successes with Galmoy, Tullaroan, Barrow Rangers, Mooncoin, Conahy Shamrocks and Castletown. In 1976 Leahy was the sole trainer, coach and selector when he guided James Stephens to the All-Ireland title. He repeated the feat with Glenmore in 1991, becoming the first person to manage two different clubs to All-Ireland titles. At inter-county level Leahy enjoyed much success as a coach and a selector at all grades with Kilkenny between 1972 and 1978. With the senior team he was a selector with the All-Ireland-winning teams in 1972, 1974 and 1975. As an under-21 selector he won back-to-back All-Ireland titles in 1974 and 1974, having earlier coached the minor team to the All-Ireland title in 1972. During that same period Leahy was a selector on four Railway Cup-winning Leinster teams. Leahy later worked as a manager, coach, trainer and selector with numerous inter- county teams, including Waterford, Wexford, Laois, Carlow, Armagh, Antrim, Offaly, Westmeath and Meath. ==Career statistics== {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"3\\"National League !colspan=\\"2\\"Leinster !colspan=\\"2\\"All-Ireland !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score - rowspan=\\"1\\"Kilkenny 1970-71 rowspan=\\"1\\"Division 1A 20-0100-0000-0020-01 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total 20-0100-0000-0020-01 } ==Honours== As a player ;James Stephens *Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1969 *Kilkenny Junior Hurling Championship (1): 1955 ;Kilkenny *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1971 *Leinster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 1955 In management ;James Stephens *All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 1976 *Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 1975 *Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1975, 1976 ;Kilkenny *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (3): 1972, 1974, 1975 *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (5): 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1978 *All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship (2): 1974, 1975 *Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship (2): 1974, 1975 *All- Ireland Minor Hurling Championship (1): 1972 *Leinster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 1972 ;Offaly *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1988 ;Leinster *Railway Cup (4): 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977 ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2017 deaths Category:James Stephens hurlers Category:Kilkenny inter-county hurlers Category:Hurling managers Category:Hurling selectors ","title":"Georgie Leahy"},{"id":"54238068","text":"Professor Donald Longmore OBE, FRCSEd, FRCR (born 1928) is a British consultant surgeon and clinical physiologist.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. ==History== A small settlement developed at this location in the 1860s. Development was slow until construction of the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad in 1874 brought more settlers, primarily Dutch immigrants. By 1897, over 400 people lived in Hudsonville. Christian Reformed congregants who settled in Hudsonville initially worshipped in the surrounding communities, but in 1901 the Rev. G. G. Haan established the Hudsonville Christian Reformed mission. The congregation built a church in 1904. In 1913, the congregation established the Hudsonville Society for Christian Instruction. Church members donated a site for the school and construction began in 1917. The original school contained two rooms, but initial enrollment was larger than expected, and a third classroom was conducted in the basement. In 1921 enrollment had increased so much that two additional classrooms were constructed. In 1943, two more classrooms were added. However, enrollment continued to grow, and in the late 1940s, it was decided that the site was too small to continue adding capacity. In 1948, the school purchased another site, and in 1950 constructed a new building. The original building remained part of the Hudsonville Christian School; although fluctuating enrollment made the school attempt to sell the building in 1968, a spike in 1970 caused the building to again be utilized. In the 1970s and 1980s the building was renovated. It was closed at the end of the 2004/05 school year, although the Hudsonville Christian School continued operation in other buildings. The building was purchased by investors and renovated, and leased to a child care center. ==Description== The Hudsonville Christian School Building is a one- story structure clad with white-painted clapboards and capped with a combination hip and gable roof. The building contains six classrooms, constructed in three phases of two classrooms each. The western end of the building, topped with a hipped roof, houses a vestibule with two classrooms. The vestibule projects from the front of the building. The middle section of the building contains two more classrooms, a corridor separating them from the original rooms, and a restroom. The eastern section contains two more classrooms, another corridor, and a second restroom. These two sections are covered with a single broad hipped roof with a gable section connecting to the western hipped roof. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:School buildings completed in 1917 ","title":"Hudsonville Christian School Building"},{"id":"54238157","text":"Joseph Stanley Brown served as private secretary to the twentieth President of the United States, James A.

Its stories focus on the lives of rural Americans, especially how their lives are affected by gender, class, and sexuality. The author Samantha Hunt described the book as \\"it's Murakami meets meth heads,\\" in reference to one of the stories where the narrator returns home to find her family struggling with local meth dealers. ==Background== Woods has previously published a collection of short stories and a novel as well as several poems and short stories in various journals (including the title story in 2013). ==Reception== A work from this book Take the Way Home That Leads Back to Sullivan Street won Woods the Shirley Jackson Shirley Jackson Award for best novelette, 2018. This collection also received mention from film and television actress, Emma Roberts Emma Roberts (American Horror Story, Scream Queens) who posed with it in a series of photos, as part of her book club, Belletrist Belletrist. This has spurred a trend of people posing with the book while dressed in gothic fashion, in rural and pastoral settings and posting pictures on social media, often using the tag #thingstodowhenyouregothinthecounty. (example here: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/thingstodowhenyouregothinthecountry/ ) The title story was awarded the Cobalt Writing Prize for Fiction prior to the book's its publication. The book received rave reviews in Booklist, The Rumpus, Full Stop Magazine, Electric Lit, Lit Hub, and many others, and received positive review in Publishers Weekly. Many of the stories center around queer characters and particularly focus on issues of class, gender, and sexuality, which The Rumpus reviewer Erin Wilcox said might seem to be at the expense of analyzing racial issues, but Wilcox also noted that many of the stories deal with race in the gothic tradition as it has been explored by critics like Toni Morrison in her book Playing in the Dark. Despite their attention around these issues, the \\"ambivalence\\" of Woods's writing prevents the stories from being reduced to \\"rhetoric,\\" as another reviewer noted, they are never \\"only\\" about queerness, but rather center around characters for whom that is a part of their identity. Corinne Manning of Electric Lit considered the political nature of the collection, saying that the stories seemed \\"like they were ready made for a post 2017 election,\\" but are in reality of \\"the world that's always been here.\\" ==References== Category:2017 short story collections ","title":"Things to Do When You're Goth in the Country"},{"id":"54238175","text":"Rock 'n' Roll High School is a 1979 American musical comedy film.

Like her sister, the painter Molly Cramer, she also began her training as a painter in 1882 after the death of their father Cesar Cramer. At the beginning of their studies Helene was 38 years old. The sisters first teachers were the Hamburg illustrator as well as the painters Carl Rodeck and Carl Oesterley. At the end of the 1880s Helene Cramer went to The Hague to train under Margaretha Roosenboom and together with her sister at the Belgian still life painter Eugène Joors in Antwerp.Helene Cramer at Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) Joors taught them in the art of still life painting. Returning to Hamburg, Helene Cramer mainly painted still life flower pieces. Her works were regularly exhibited at major German exhibitions, such as at the Glass Palace Munich and the Great Berlin Art Exhibitions (Große Berliner Kunstausstellung). In Berlin she exhibited several times between 1893 and 1908, always with her sister Molly. She also exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, and in 1900 at the Woman's Exhibition, Earl's Court, London with: Fir Forest; Trapäolum; Narzissen; Morgensonne im Wald; Gloxinien and Fuchsien.Helene Cramer, Hamburg, Uhlenhorst, Carlstrasse 18 In: Official Fine Art, Historical, and General Catalogue, Woman's Exhibition 1900, Earl's Court, London, S.W.

Lichtwark, who often frequented the sisters house at Uhlenhorst, also established contact with members of the Hamburg Artists' Club of 1897 (Hamburgischer Künstlerklub), including among others , and Paul Kayser. Through visits by the artists in their house, this became an artistic achievement at the beginning of the 20th century. Without joining the club, the sisters later exhibited their paintings together with them. Helene Cramer was a member of the Allgemeine Deutsche Kunstgenossenschaft, the Association of North-West German Artists, in the Berlin Association of Women Artists and in the Association of (Women) Authors and Artists of Vienna.

It was filmed on location in London, Milford Haven and Corsica. ==Premise== The series centres on three brothers, nicknamed Toughy (wants to be a soldier), Smarty (clever), and Mouse (likes cheese). Their real names are not revealed. Presumably orphaned (their parents are never seen or mentioned), they have lived with a succession of different people – 'some nice and some nasty, but no-one who they liked in particular'. Being boisterous, adventurous and imaginative, they are regularly in trouble and consequently resent their situation. Eventually they decide to run away to sea. After escaping, they hitch a ride courtesy of the bizarre Elderly Boy in his converted lifeboat. They eventually arrive on an apparently uninhabited island, where the Elderly Boy abandons them, and they set up home. After a while they discover that the island is home to the eccentric grasshopper expert Cornelius Button and his feisty housekeeper Lupus. After making friends with their new neighbours, they join forces with them to defeat the unsavoury Doctor Hopper, who wants to destroy Button's reputation and seize Grasshopper Island. Afterwards, they decide to stay on Grasshopper Island permanently. ==Characters== Smarty The cleverest of the three brothers, so named because 'he always had answers to all sorts of questions'. His elaborate plans are not always needed, as simpler ones are often pursued by the others. Toughy So- called because 'he wanted to be a soldier'. He is an avid reader and is very creative, being adept at painting and drawing. Mouse So-called because 'he liked cheese'. He loves hats, usually sporting more than one in each episode. Cornelius Button (Julian Orchard) An eccentric grasshopper expert who has lived on Grasshopper Island for many years. He is presumably the island's tenant (as Dr Hopper tries to have him removed). He spends all his time obsessively studying the grasshoppers and trying to avoid being ordered around by Lupus. Many years ago, he discovered a rare grasshopper, which was named the Button's Blue in his honour, and now yearns to find another one. Button has a sister called Amelia who is the headmistress of a girls' school and sometimes visits him, though he dreads these occasions, and will do anything he can to prevent them. Lupus (Patricia Hayes) Cornelius Button's formidable housekeeper, who has lived with him for 20 years. Even though she is Button's employee, he is often intimidated by her into doing tasks such as taking out the rubbish. Despite this, her brisk manner hides a softer side, and she is genuinely fond of Button and the boys. Dr Hopper (Frank Muir) A longstanding professional enemy of Cornelius Button, who concocts a scheme to have him expelled from Grasshopper Island (which naturally would then go to Hopper) unless her finds another Button's Blue, the existence of which Hopper does not believe in. He drives a pedalo and arrives at the island in the last episode, although Toughy, Smarty and Mouse soon succeed in frightening him away. The Elderly Boy (Charles Hawtrey) The owner of the converted lifeboat who gives the boys a lift to the island. He owns a pet dove called Cecil. He initially wants to stay with the boys, but soon leaves after finding the environment too hot and the terrain too taxing. The Voices of Authority (all played by Tim Brooke-Taylor) A succession of overbearing (and mostly unpleasant) characters known to Toughy, Smarty and Mouse before they leave home. They include a businessman who shouts at them for making too much noise, a matronly woman who forbids Toughy to talk with his mouth full, a barber who gives a reluctant Smarty a short back and sides because 'curls is for girls' and a grumpy taxi- driver who drives them to the docks. ==EpisodesAvailability== The series has been available on DVD by Grasshopper Productions (Whitby's own company) since 2008. ==BookReferencesExternal links== * Grasshopper Island at IMDb Category:ITV children's television shows Category:1971 British television series debuts Category:1970s British children's television series ","title":"Grasshopper Island"},{"id":"54238611","text":"The 2017 Reno 1868 FC season is the club's inaugural season of existence, and their first in the United Soccer League, the second tier of American soccer. == Background == Ahead of the 2017 season, there had been three professional soccer clubs in Northern Nevada: Reno Rattlers, Northern Nevada Aces, and Nevada Wonders.

The player is scored based on how the enemy is defeated at the end of a gaming session. ==Gameplay== Players take up the role of a starship captain ordered to defeat an enemy fleet ranging from 1 to 3 ships. The player selects the number of ships and the type of each ship at the beginning of the game. The player can then defeat the enemy fleet by destroying them, forcing them to retreat, or surrender. To accomplish this, the player must provide commands to the different ship consoles each turn which includes communications, defense, engineering, life support, science, and weapons. At the end of each turn, the player and computer commands are executed and evaluated and the results displayed on the player's screen. The player can continue to play the next turns until the end of the game or save the game to be resumed later. After the game ends, the player is evaluated based on how the game was won with points being assigned based on the different winning conditions and number of opponents. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World praised the game's level of detail and immersion, adding the graphics were a \\"mixed blessing as it adds mystique which makes role-playing more fun, but it makes it harder to figure out a winning strategy.\\" The magazine also panned the game's documentation, stating it as \\"weak; it explains the commands and options but does not provide any insight into what is happening\\" but did close that \\"for those who are willing to dig for this understanding, the game offers considerable challenge and satisfaction.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1981 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Apple II-only games Category:Space combat simulators Category:Starship simulators based on Star Trek Category:Video games based on Star Trek Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Starship Commander (1981 video game)"},{"id":"54238823","text":"The Matrons' Council for Great Britain and Ireland was established in 1894 during the campaign for the registration of nurses.

It released for iOS and Android on February 9, 2017, after its beta testing period ended. ==Gameplay== Players take on the role of a postknight, a postal worker that must fight their way past enemies such as wolves and bandits. During missions players control the postknight via three buttons that allow them to charge enemies, block their attacks, or heal wounds. After performing an action, players must wait a certain amount of time, typically only a few seconds, before they can perform that action again until the end of the mission. For each successful mission, players receive rewards which can be used to upgrade armor, weapons, and potions. Players can level up the postknight characters in 4 areas: strength (increases damage), agility (increases chances of dodging and landing critical hits), intelligence (increases magic defense and experience gain rate) and vitality (increases maximum health) Another interesting game mechanic is relationship, wherein players can give gifts to certain female NPCs in the game and raise their heart meter with them, which will in turn result in the characters gifting items to the player if certain levels are reached. However, if player gift wrong/unwanted gifts to the female NPC or do not talk to them for a while, the heart meter will drop. ==Reception== Gamezebo gave Postknight four out of five stars, stating that the game's pacing allowed for little downtime and near constant gameplay while also criticizing it for its repetitive nature. Common Sense Media rated the game at three stars, criticizing its repetitive gameplay and freemium options, while also stating that it was perfect for playing for small periods of time. TouchArcade also reviewed the app, naming it its \\"Game of the Week\\" during the app's first week of release. Postknight was nominated and won the Grand Prix of the SEA International Mobile Gaming Awards 2017, making it the first ever winner of the SEA Grand Prix. By the end of the year, Postknight received Google Play's recognition as 'Google Play's Best Games of 2017'. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Postknight on Facebook Category:2017 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in Malaysia ","title":"Postknight"},{"id":"54238842","text":"Dr Alan Gilston FRCS, FFARCS (1928-2005) was a British anaesthesiologist.

On May 18, 1906, Moraes delivered a lecture on \\"Problema Feminista\\" (Feminist Problem) at the Sociedad de Geografía de Lisboa.SARMENTO, Olga Moraes. As Minhas Memórias (Lisboa: Portugália, 1948), pp. 189. She also traveled as a lecturer to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. In Brazil, she met and became friends with the writer Júlia Lopes de Almeida.SARMENTO, Olga Moraes. ==Personal life== Moraes lived in Paris during the First World War. For more than thirty years, she was a companion and partner of Baroness Hélène van Zuylen, of the Rothschild banking family of France, whom she saved from the Holocaust by taking her to Lisbon and then to New York City.As Minhas Memórias, pp. 312-13. She also devoted herself to writing the Baroness' memoirs. Moraes was closely linked to her city of birth, Setúbal, leaving all her assets to the Municipal Chamber, including her personal library and a vast collection of autographs of personalities from art, music and literature in postcards, letters, and books. This legacy is part of the collection of the Museo de Setúbal/Convento de Jesús. She died in Lisbon, 17 October 1948. == Selected works == * Problema Feminista (1906) * Mulheres illustres: A Marqueza de Alorna (sua influencia na sociedade portuguesa, 1750-1839) (1907) * Arte, Literatura & Viagens (1909) * A Infanta Dona Maria e a Corte Portuguesa (1909) * La Patrie Brésilienne (1912) * Sa Majesté la Reine Amélie de Portugal, Princesse de France (1924) * Teófilo Braga: Notas e Comentários (1925) * As Minhas Memórias: Tempo Passado, Tempo Ausente (1948) == Honors == * Legión de Honor * Orden de Cristo * Orden de Santiago de la Espada == References == Attribution * Bibliography * Category:1881 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Chevaliers of the Légion d'honneur Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT history in Portugal Category:Portuguese women writers Category:Portuguese-language writers Category:Portuguese feminists Category:20th-century Portuguese poets Category:Portuguese republicans Category:Portuguese suffragists Category:Portuguese women poets Category:20th-century Portuguese women writers ","title":"Maria Olga de Moraes Sarmento da Silveira"},{"id":"54239102","text":"Carphania fluviatillis is a species of tardigrades.

Raised as coastal defence artillery, it later served as field artillery in Mesopotamia during the First World War and in the Battle of France and Second Battle of El Alamein during the Second World War. Its successor units later operated as medium artillery in North West Europe, and as jungle artillery in Burma. Postwar, it became an anti- aircraft unit. ==Volunteer Force== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer Movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. A large number of coastal artillery units were formed in the seaports along the Kent and Sussex coast (the ancient Cinque Ports), and in September 1862 these artillery volunteer corps (AVCs) were brought together to form the 1st Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers at Dover:Beckett, Appendix VIII.1st Cinque Ports Artillery at Regiments.org.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 41–5.Army List. In May 1890 the Sussex batteries were separated from the 1st Cinque Ports Artillery to form the 2nd Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers with the following organisation:2nd Cinque Ports Artillery at Regiments.org. * HQ at St Leonards-on-Sea * No 1 Battery at St Leonards – originally 7th Cinque Ports AVC, raised on 23 November 1867 * No 2 Battery at Hastings – originally 6th Cinque Ports AVC, raised on 20 February 1860 * No 3 Company at Ninfield – originally 2nd Bty, 9th Cinque Ports AVC, raised in 1874 * No 4 Company at Pevensey – originally 1st Bty 9th Cinque Ports AVC, raised on 9 April 1866 * No 5 Company at Bexhill-on-Sea In 1901 the unit was converted to 'position artillery' as part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and on 1 January 1902 became the 2nd Cinque Ports RGA (Volunteers) ==Territorial Force== 15-pounder gun. Band of the 4th Sussex Battery, 2nd (Home Counties) Brigade, RFA (TF), c1910 When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 2nd Cinque Ports RGA merged with the 2nd Sussex RGA and transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) to form the II (or 2nd) Home Counties Brigade with the following organisation:Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 160–4.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, pp. 230–2.Sussex at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. II Home Counties Brigade, RFA * HQ at The Goffs, Eastbourne, – from 2nd Cinque Ports * 4th Sussex Battery at Eastbourne – from 2nd Sussex * 5th Sussex Battery at Hatherley Road, St Leonards – from 2nd Cinque Ports * 6th Sussex Battery at The Downs, Bexhill – from 2nd Sussex * 2nd Home Counties Ammunition Column at Hailsham – from 2nd Cinque Ports The three batteries were each equipped with four 15-pounder guns. The unit was assigned to the Home Counties Division of the TF.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49–54.44 Div at Long, Long Trail.44 Div at Regimental Warpath Affiliated with the unit were the Imperial Service Cadet Corps, Eastbourne, and St Leonards Collegiate School Cadet Corps. ==First World War== Mobilisation On the outbreak of war, the Territorial Force was mobilised for home defence and units were then invited to volunteer for overseas service. On 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. Duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were thereby created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way the 1/II and 2/II Home Counties (Cinque Ports) Brigades were formed.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82.67 Div at Long, Long Trail. 1/II Home Counties Brigade The bulk of the Home Counties Division, including the 1/II Home Counties Brigade without its Brigade Ammunition Column, embarked at Southampton and sailed on 30 October 1914 for India to relieve Regular Army units to fight on the Western Front. The Territorials disembarked at Bombay 1–3 December, and were allotted to various peacetime stations across India. Although the Home Counties Division remained in the order of battle and received a number (as the 44th (Home Counties) Division) in May 1915, it never served as a complete formation during the First World War. The 1/II Home Counties Bde was assigned to the 3rd Lahore Divisional Area in the Punjab (the fighting units of the 3rd (Lahore) Division having gone to the Western Front in September). 1/4th Sussex Bty went to Ambala, then to Rawalpindi in June 1915, the 1/5th Sussex went to Multan and 1/6th Sussex to Ferozepore.Perry, pp. 55–8. The Territorials completed their training in India to prepare them for possible active service, and supplied drafts to units serving in the Mesopotamian campaign. In 1916 the brigade was formally renumbered as CCXXI Brigade (221st Bde). In December 1916 the 1/4th Sussex Bty (now at Ferozepore) and the 1/5th Sussex Bty (now at Ambala) joined with the 1/1st and 1/3rd Sussex Btys (from 1/I Home Counties Brigade) to form the I Combined Home Counties Brigade. In May 1917 the 3rd (Lahore) Divisional Area was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to 16th Indian Division. CCXXI Bde was under the command of this division from April to September 1917.Perry, pp. 137–40. The brigade was finally re-equipped with the modern 18-pounder gun during 1917 and the batteries redesignated 1067, 1068 and 1069; 1069 Bty was then broken up between 1067 and 1068 to bring them up to a six-gun establishment. It also reformed a Brigade Ammunition Column ready for active service. It sailed to Basra, where it landed between 18 and 25 October 1917 to reinforce the forces fighting in Mesopotamia. 2/II Home Counties Brigade De Bange 90 mm French field gun issued to 2nd Line batteries. Because the 1st Home Counties Division had gone to India, the 2nd Home Counties Division was among the earliest 2nd Line formations to be formed. By 27 November 1914 the division was settled in billets round Windsor, Berkshire and was reported ready to receive its weapons. However, the only guns available for the RFA brigades were obsolete French 90 mm guns, and even then there were only 4 guns per brigade. It was not until January 1916 that the division's gunners received their modern 18-pounders, and even then some time elapsed before sights were received.Becke, Pt 2b, Appendix 3, p. 136. Meanwhile, the division had been numbered as 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division and given a dual role of training drafts for units serving overseas and at the same time being part of the mobile force responsible for home defence. From November 1915 it formed part of Second Army, Central Force, quartered in Kent. Twice the division was warned to prepare for moves to Ireland, and in April 1917 to deploy to France, but these moves never happened and the division remained in England for the whole war. In May 1916 the field brigades were numbered, with 2/II Home Counties becoming CCCXXXVI Brigade (336 Bde) and the batteries were designated A, B and C. A howitzer battery (D (H)) equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers was added later in the year when CCCXXXVIII (2/IV Home Counties) Howitzer Bde was broken up. In 1917 the 18-pounder batteries were brought up to a strength of six guns when CCCXXXV (formerly 2/I Home Counties) Bde was broken up. The brigade left 67th Division on 9 November 1917 and sailed to Mesopotamia where it fought alongside its 1st Line Brigade. Mesopotamia 18-pounder in action in Mesopotamia. CCXXI Brigade made its way from Basra to Baghdad where it joined the newly formed 17th Indian Division. In April 1918 it was joined by 404th (Howitzer) Bty from England equipped with six 4.5-inch howitzers and a Volunteer Battery with four 18-pounders from 15th Indian Division.Perry, pp. 141–6.Perry, p. 135.Moberley, Vol IV, Appendix XLIII, p. 357.Moberley, Vol IV, Appendix XLV, p. 368.Moberley, Vol IV, Appendix XLVI, p. 384.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 287. Meanwhile, CCCXXXVI Bde under the command of Lt-Col F.A. Buzzard moved up from Basra to join the newly formed 18th Indian Division.Perry, pp. 147–50.Wilson-Johnston, p. 1; 'Part II: Roll of Officers', pp. 50–1. The two new divisions constituted the bulk of I Indian Corps Lt-Gen Sir Alexander Cobbe, VC, which concentrated at Tikrit on the Tigris Front in October 1918. By now the Turks were in retreat in Palestine and on the Euphrates Front in Mesopotamia, and it was time for the forces on the Tigris Front to exert pressure by advancing on Mosul. 17th Indian Division moved up the west bank and 18th Division up the east bank. The problem was the strong Turkish position on the Little Zab river and the Fat-Ha gorge, 35 miles further on. Rather than make a direct assault with the untried 17th and 18th Indian Divisions, Cobbe chose to outflank the gorge with a mobile column.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 280–1.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 18–24. On 23 October the 17th and 18th Divisions were within a mile of the Fat-Ha trenches. Both 221st and 336th Bdes (less D/336) were on the west bank with 17th Division. A section of D/336 Bty was with 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade on the right flank. 18th Division advanced as the moon rose at 21.30, with D/336 in the plain north of the pass and all the guns with 17th Division ready to give support from across the river. However, the leading waves found the Turkish trenches empty. When 17th Division advanced, covered by its reinforced artillery, it also found the Turkish positions empty; the flanking column had done its job.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, p. 281.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 24–5. Having passed through the Fat-Ha gorge, 18th Division moved its artillery (including D/336) across appalling going and successfully attacked the Little Zab on 25 October. The following day, 336th Bde crossed back to 18th Division's command and B/336 moved up-river while A/336 was at the Little Zab bridgehead. On 27 October the 17th Division advanced with support from 18th Division's artillery from across the river and once again found the enemy trenches empty. It set off in pursuit to the main Turkish position at Sharqat. At dawn on 28 October the Turks counter-attacked from Sharqat and were engaged by D/336, which had been pushed ahead of 18th Division along the other bank of the river. Having stopped this attack, the 17th Division then drove the Turks out of their position and continued the pursuit.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 283–4.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 27–32. With the cavalry blocking their retreat to Mosul, the Turks at Sharqat were now cut off, and 17th and 18th Divisions turned all their guns on them. 17th Division attacked at 16.00 on 29 October, supported by the guns of 18th Division, then at 19.00 the 18th advanced with 54th Indian Brigade and two batteries of 336th Bde. On the morning of 30 October the cavalry were deployed to attack Sharqat with the leading elements of 18th Division, including B/336, C/336 and D/336 Btys, when the Turks in the town surrendered.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, pp. 284–5.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 33–34. The commander of 18th Indian Division, Maj-Gen Hew Fanshawe, was immediately sent on with a mobile column including C/336 Bty to destroy the remaining Turkish forces and capture Mosul. The column forded the Tigris, with artillery horses assisting the mule carts, and pushed on to the city which fell without a fight after news arrived of the signing of the Armistice of Mudros and the end of hostilities on 31 October.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, p. 285.Wilson- Johnston, pp. 36–9. At the end of the war 17th and 18th Indian Divisions were selected to form part of the occupation force in Iraq and served during the Iraq Rebellion of 1920. It is not clear when the TF units were demobilised and sent home; the 44th (Home Counties) Division began to reform in 1920. == Interwar == With the expansion of the TA after the Munich Crisis, most units split to form duplicates. In the case of the 58th, 231 and 232 Batteries left in 1939 to form a new 114th Field Regiment, RA, at Bexhill, which gained the 'Sussex' subtitle in 1942. At this time batteries consisted of 12 guns each, which in TA regiments were still 18-pounders.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 9. ==Second World War== 84th (Sussex) Medium Regiment Once back in the UK, stationed at Felixstowe, the regiment was converted into a medium artillery regiment on 6 January 1944, with the following organisation:British Artillery in World War 2.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.84 Med Rgt at Royal Artillery 1939–45.84 Med Rgt War Diary 1944, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 171/1066. 84th (Sussex) Medium Regiment, RA * 250 (Eastbourne) Med Bty * 251 (Hastings) Med Bty During January 1944 it received its equipment of 16 x 5.5-inch guns and was officially mobilised on 1 February although AEC Matador gun tractors did not begin to arrive until the end of March. Firing training was held at the Sanctuary Ranges at Burnham Norton, Norfolk, in March and at Redesdale in Northumberland in April. The regiment also practised anti-tank shooting. In May it moved to Clacton-on-Sea for a XXX Corps training exercise and then in the first days of June it boarded transport ships bound for Normandy. Normandy The survey party of 84th (Sussex) Medium Regiment landed in the Normandy beachhead on D + 1 (7 June), having sailed from Tilbury Docks on D-Day, the guns arriving on Gold Beach 9 June.Reminiscences of Denis Walter Pursglove at BBC WW2 People's War.Reminiscences of Raymond Eaglen at BBC WW2 People's War. The regiment again formed part of 5 AGRA, in 21st Army Group.5 AGRA at Royal Artillery 1939–45.Joslen, p. 463. Regimental HQ (RHQ) was established at St Martin les Entrees east of Bayeux, where the regiment's gun positions were protected by 113 Bty of 27th Light Anti-Aircraft Rgt of XXX Corps. The regiment carried out its first fire missions on 11 June. That night, while supporting 69th Brigade of 50th (Northumbrian) Division the FOO (Major Groom) called down fire on a group of Tiger tanks trying to penetrate the position, although he had already been wounded by them. 69th Brigade held their position, which became known as 'Tiger Hill'.Barnes, p. 111. On 27 June, RHQ moved to Loucelles, where I Trp of 399 LAA Bty took over AA defence, and the regiment was assigned to support 15th (Scottish) Division during Operation Epsom. It then moved to Sainte-Honorine-de-Ducy to support 43rd (Wessex) Division on 1 July. 84th Medium Rgt carried out numerous fire missions over the coming weeks, RHQ moving frequently as 5 AGRA supported different formations during the campaign. During July and August the regiment had 284 Bty of 90th Heavy AA Rgt under its command. With the Luftwaffe making few appearances, the 3.7-inch guns of 90th HAA Rgt frequently took part in medium artillery fire programmes.Routledge, p. 314. At the end of August the regiment was involved in the Battle of Falaise. Once the breakout from the Normandy beachhead was accomplished 84th Med Rgt moved to the area of Vernon and then while the rest of 5 AGRA remained behind the regiment was attached to Guards Armoured Division during the rapid advance that culminated in the liberation of Brussels. While with Guards Armoured the regiment received AA protection from the Bofors guns of E Trp, 326 Bty of 94th LAA Rgt. It also had two Sherman OP tanks, and the lorries of a Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) platoon to help it move. Once the Irish Guards had established a bridgehead over the Bocholt–Herentals Canal (Joe's Bridge) on 10 September, 84th Med Rgt, with 275 Bty, 165th Heavy AA Rgt, under command, took up positions near Hechtel and provided fire support for the bridgehead. Arnhem On 16 September the regiment received its orders for Operation Market Garden, which began the following day. 84th Medium Rgt was assigned to support Guards Armoured which was spearheading the advance. The regiment spent the next three days attempting to advance behind the Guards up the road to Valkenswaard, suffering a number of casualties under shellfire and bombing. At 01.00 on 20 September 250 Bty deployed near Malden, and in the morning began shelling enemy gun positions. 251 Battery joined in that afternoon, and the regiment was given a fire plan to support the assault crossing of the Waal at Nijmegen. In the evening a section was ordered over the river to try to give long-range fire support to 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem, while the remainder of the regiment deploying at Nijmegen sports park, with a Troop of 275 HAA Bty under command with its 3.7-inch guns in a ground role. Target information was being supplied by telephone by members of the Dutch resistance.5 AGRA at RA Netherlands.84 Med Rgt at Pegasus Archive, includes extracts of War Diary for September 1944. Lieutenant B.R. Leach of 84th Med Rgt, having previously trained as a parachute FOO, flew back to England on 15 September and dropped with US 82nd Airborne Division on 17 September. He returned to the regiment on 21 September. At 00.15 on 21 September the regiment's advanced section opened fire – the first such support the beleaguered paratroops at Arnhem had received; only the radios of 64th (London) Medium Rgt in 5 AGRA could make contact with them. Shortly afterwards 251 Bty began shelling the presumed HQ of the German 6th Parachute Division, probably the first shots fired by British artillery into Germany. While the HAA troop left to take up an anti- shipping role on the river, the regiment was rejoined by 6 Bofors guns of E Trp, 326 LAA Bty for AA defence of the vital NIjmegen bridges. During the next few days of the battle the regiment was called on for fire missions in several different directions, supporting 82nd Airborne, 50th (Northumbrian) and 43rd (Wessex) Divisions as well as Guards Armoured. Its RASC platoon bringing up ammunition found the main road cut by the enemy and had to take to side roads to get through to the gun positions. The regiment also suffered casualties from anti-personnel bombs dropped by German jet fighters. On 5 October, 84th Med Rgt bolstered 59 AGRA supporting US 101st Airborne Division in repelling German attacks from the direction of Wageningen and Renkum. On 7 October the regiment moved to Ewijk, where it fired against German attacks simultaneously to the NE and NW, and then the following day to Ubbergen, near Groesbeek. From 15 October to 8 November, the regiment formed part of 59 AGRA. Rhineland When Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks, commander of XXX Corps, was given the newly arrived US 84th Division to carry out a difficult attack at Geilenkirchen on 18 November (Operation Clipper), 'I was determined that they should have every possible assistance ... so ... I gave them ... above all the support of my superb corps artillery'.Horrocks, p. 235. 84th Medium Rgt was directly attached to 84th Division, its FOOs up with the US infantry units. A major part of its role was counter-mortar (CM) fire against identified German positions codenamed GOOSE, DUCK, GOAT and FOX, while Air Observation Post (AOP) aircraft flew overhead identifying firing hostile batteries to be engaged by a battery of 84 Med Rgt if required.5 AGRA Operation Order for Operation Clipper, issued 14 November 1944, in 84 Med Rgt War Diary, TNA file WO 171/1066. During December the regiment was at Brunssum, where it received three OP tanks. When the German attack in the Ardennes (the Battle of the Bulge) threatened to break through US forces, 84th Med Rgt was assigned to Guards Armoured Division on 15 December and moved south via Tilburg to take up blocking positions. It returned to 5 AGRA command on 29 December when the danger had passed. On 4 January 84th Med Rgt was assigned to support an attack on the northern side of the German 'bulge' by 53rd (Welsh) Division ('Operation Smash III') and generally to assist VII US Corps.5 AGRA Operation Order for Operation Smash III, issued 3 January 1945, in 84 Med Rgt War Diary, TNA file WO 171/5036. At the beginning of February, XXX Corps began preparing for a major offensive in the Reichswald (Operation Veritable), and the regiment moved back on bad roads to the Eindhoven and Malden area. A complex fire support programme was worked out for the attack on 8 February. 84th Medium Rgt was assigned to counter-battery (CB) fire and then in support of the assault by 15th (Scottish) Division, switching to support 3rd Canadian Division in the afternoon, and then back to 15th (S) Division in the evening.Ellis, Defeat of Germany, p. 256.5 AGRA Operation Order for Operation Veritable, issued 3 February 1945, in 84 Med Rgt War Diary, TNA file WO 171/5036. During this long battle the regiment supported 15th (S) Division in Operation Spider on 18 February, II Canadian Corps on 19 February, 44th (Lowland) Bde of 15th (S) Division during Operation Grenade on 23 February, and then 158th Bde of 53rd (W) Division during Operation Leek to capture Weeze on 24 February.84 Med Rgt War Diary January–April 1945, TNA file WO 171/5036.Ellis, Defeat of Germany, p. 269. Germany 5.5-inch gun of 5 AGRA firing at Bremen, 24 April 1945. XXX Corps provided massive artillery support for the Rhine Crossing (Operation Plunder) on the night of 23/24 March. Around 150 German guns had been identified on the corps' frontage, and the medium regiments of 5 AGRA began firing CB tasks ('DROOP I' and 'DROOP II') at 17.00, four hours before H-hour. Major Martin Lindsay of 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, described the 'continuous ripple of slams and bangs as all our guns, stretching across so many fields behind, were firing', and the 'tremendous rumble of guns behind us, their shells whistling over us'. Then 30 minutes before H-hour 84th Med Rgt was switched to bombardment in support of the assault troops of 51st (Highland) Division.Ellis, Defeat of Germany, p. 285.5 AGRA Operation Order for Operation Plunder, issued 21 March 1945, in 84 Med Rgt War Diary, TNA file WO 171/5036.Horrocks, p. 257.Lindsay, Arrow edn, pp. 218–9. Once the Rhine was crossed, XX Corps advanced rapidly across Germany to Bremen. 84th Medium Rgt was detached from 5 AGRA during these operations and was variously attached to Guards Armoured and to 3rd Division when it crossed the Weser. At the beginning of May the regiment was still carrying out CB, CM and harassing fire tasks for 51st (H) Division attacking towards Bremervörde, even though ammunition was running short as the RASC had to bring it long distances from across the Weser. At 17.30 on 4 May the regiment received the order that all shooting was to stop, and cease fire was ordered at 08.00 the following morning after the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath came into effect.84 Med Rgt War Diary May–December 1945, TNA file WO 171/5037. After VE Day the regiment went to Sandbostel, where 250 Bty became responsible for running a Displaced persons camp of Russians. On 30 May the regiment moved to Blankenburg (RHQ), Braunlage (250 Bty) and Hasselfelde (251 Bty) in the Harz Mountains to carry out occupation duties. In the autumn of 1945 it moved to Lüneburg where it became responsible for law and order. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. 114th (Sussex) Field Regiment 114th Field Regiment mobilised in 12th (Eastern) Division, the 2nd Line duplicate of 44th (HC) Division, but when the division moved to France in April 1940 it was only intended for labour duties and the RA units remained behind in the UK. After the Dunkirk evacuation the 12th Division was broken up, and on 6 July 114th Fd Rgt joined 2nd London Division (shortly afterwards designated 47th (London) Division).Joslen, p. 56.Joslen, pp. 41–2.114 Fd Rgt at Royal Artillery 1939–45. This formation was in Eastern Command, moving to South Wales by September 1940, but by May 1941 was defending the vital West Sussex sector of the anti-invasion defences.Collier, Maps 17 & 20.Collier, Map 7. The regiment left 47th Division on 28 November 1941 and became an Army Field Regiment in Southern Command, then in February 1942 it was assigned to the War Office Reserve preparatory to going overseas.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. India and Ceylon The regiment sailed to India, arriving at Bombay on 11 May and moving via Secunderabad to Bangalore where it joined 20th Indian Division. Field regiments were by now organised in three 8-gun batteries rather than two 12-gun batteries, so it arrived with 231 (Sussex), 232 (Sussex) and 479 Fd Btys.Joslen, p. 505.Farndale, Far East, Annex K. In July 1942 the division was sent to garrison Ceylon, where it remained for a year.Farndale, Far East, p. 119 & Annex H. 3.7-inch Howitzer in action in Burma, 1944. On 19 July 1943 the 20th Indian Division returned to India and proceeded to Ranchi, the base for the Central Front in the Burma Campaign, where 114th Fd Rgt was converted into a jungle field regiment. This was organised with 231 Bty equipped with 16 x 3-inch mortars and 232 and 479 Btys each with 8 x 3.7-inch howitzers. The conversion was complete by September.Farndale, Far East, pp. 119, 139, 173. Burma In November, 144th Jungle Fd Rgt moved up to the Manipur road on the Burma–Assam border with the division, where it remained in reserve during the early part of the 1943–44 campaign. In January 1944 the regiment was temporarily converted to infantry, forming part of 100th Indian Brigade, but on 20 March, as the great battle of Kohima–Imphal began in March it was once more operating as a jungle field regiment. The division was defending the Kabaw Valley 50 miles to the south of the main fighting, later withdrawing to the Pelal–Shenam area.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 6–7, 129, 187–9, 193, 243.Farndale, Far East, p. 181. 3-inch Mortar in action during the battle of Kohima-Imphal. On 12 April, 114th Jungle Fd Rgt and the rest of 20th Divisional artillery supported 80th Indian Brigade's successful attack on 'Nippon Hill' and then defeated the inevitable counter-attack. During the night of 16 April the Japanese regained Nippon Hill and made a major effort to get through the Shenam Pass, but the line held and the Japanese got no further towards Palel.Farndale, Far East, pp. 181, 202. In mid-May the division's 32nd Indian Brigade moved forward to block the Tiddim Road and destroy Japanese supply convoys. The Japanese counter-attacked vigorously, breaking through to attack 32nd Indian Bde's rear areas around Bishenpur and cut off 17th Indian Division's HQ. 32nd India Bde sent up a mixed force from Bishenpur including a battery of 114th Jungle Fd Rgt. This held off the attacks for four days, when Brigadier E.G Woods of 50th Indian Parachute Brigade took command and it became known as 'Woodforce'. After three more days of heavy fighting against Woodforce, the Japanese abandoned their guns and withdrew.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 347–8. Once Imphal had been relieved, 20th Indian Division took part in the pursuit to the Chindwin River during July, through terrible conditions of rain, mud, and sickness.Farndale, Far East, pp. 214, 228. At the end of July the 20th Division was withdrawn to a rest area at Wangjing and the Kabaw Valley.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, p. 371. 7.2-inch howitzer After some months' rest, the advance was renewed in December 1944. 114th Field Rgt had reverted to 24 x 25-pounder guns, with an additional troop of 7.2-inch howitzers. The division's task was to capture Monywa and be ready to cross the Irrawaddy River and attack Mandalay from the south. It reached Maukkadaw on 26 December and headed for Waunggyo and Paluzawa where it made contact with the enemy. The division then hit very bad country, recrossed the Chindwin and moved down the west bank to Kin where it crossed over again to begin its advance on Monywa, which it reached on 14 January 1945 and captured by 22 January.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 176–7, 184–5.Farndale, Far East, pp. 248–52. It then began to prepare for the Irrawaddy crossing. 114th Field Rgt took part in the corps artillery plan to support the crossing of both 2nd British and 20th Indian Divisions. 100th Indian Bde began crossing during the night of 12/13 February 1945, and then 32nd Indian Brigade followed. There was bitter fighting in the bridgehead, but 114th Field Rgt was able to cross on 21 February (the rest of the divisional artillery crossed on 5 March).Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 260–2.Farndale, Far East, p. 269. In the following weeks of fighting, 20th Indian Division captured Kyaukse and cut off the retreat of the Japanese garrison of Mandalay. By 14 March it was up to the Panlaung River, and then was ordered to switch direction towards Meiktila where a major battle was developing.Farndale, Far East, p. 277. As the division advanced towards Prome during May, the roads were infested with small enemy parties, which had to be winkled out using guns and infantry in close cooperation. On 1 June 1945, 20th Indian Division was transferred to Twelfth Army, which was being assembled for Operation Zipper (the amphibious invasion of Malaya). However, there was still some mopping up to do in the Irrawaddy Valley before the division could leave for retraining.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 365–6.Farndale, Far East, pp. 303–5. Indo-China When the Japanese surrender came in August 1945, Operation Zipper was cancelled and the troops assembled for it were instead transported to different locations in South East Asia to receive the handover from Japanese occupying forces; 20th Indian Division was flown to Saigon in French Indochina, beginning on 9 September. The division's advanced guard moved into the city on 13 September, finding law and order breaking down, and the rest of the division was flown in, 114th Fd Rgt beginning to arrive on 6 October. The first officer of the regiment to arrive was given a Jeep with a Japanese driver, and an AOP aircraft with a Japanese pilot. The troops were distributed around the country to disarm those Japanese soldiers not required for internal security, and to maintain peace. On one occasion 321 Bty was ambushed at Biên Hòa near Saigon.Farndale, Far East, pp. 310–14. The regiment moved to Singapore on 14 January 1946 and was then stationed at Kangar Kahang in Malaya. 114th (Sussex) Field Regiment was disbanded in 1947. ==Postwar== In 1947 the regiment was reformed in the reconstituted TA as 258 (Sussex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, at Eastbourne, forming part of 99 (AA) AGRA, which became 99 Anti-Aircraft Brigade the following year. On 14 May 1950 the regiment was redesignated as 258 (Sussex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA.235–265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5. On 10 March 1955, Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded and there was a reduction in the number of anti-aircraft units. On that day 258 LAA Rgt merged with 313 (Wessex), 344 (Sussex Yeomanry) and 641 (Sussex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments to form 258 (Sussex Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. The former 258 LAA Rgt provided S Battery at Eastbourne to the new regiment. In 1961, the new regiment merged with 257 (County of Sussex) Fd Rgt (with P Bty at Bexhill and Eastbourne).289–322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.638–677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. ==Uniforms and Insignia== The full dress of the original artillery volunteers was based on that of the RA, but for ordinary parade the men wore a loose undress tunic and trousers of blue Baize. The 4th Battery of the 6th (Hastings) AVC, however, wore a naval uniform with sailors' caps until 1872. The badge of the Cinque Ports artillery volunteers was the Coat of arms of the Cinque Ports surrounded by a circlet. On officers' pouches the circlet carried the motto 'PRO ARIS ET FOCIS' (For hearths and homes); on later tunic buttons and belt clasps shared with the rifle volunteers the circlet was inscribed 'CINQUE PORTS VOLUNTEERS'. ==Honorary Colonels== The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * 1st Earl Brassey, GCB, later Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in 6th (Hastings) Cinque Ports AVC 1 June 1861, later Captain 9th (Pevensey) Cinque Ports AVC, appointed Hon Col 2 December 1891. * Lt-Col A.C.

She led the structure-function studies and had the first insight into gastrin's role in the clinical pathology of pancreatic Zollinger-Ellison tumours. == Education and personal life == Hilda Tracy was born 14 October 1927 and was one of 4 children. Following her school education in Birkenhead, UK, she began working at Unilever on Merseyside. She was soon seconded to the University of Liverpool and joined the newly appointed Rod Gregory, Holt Professor of Physiology, and Head of Department, as a research assistant in 1950. With his encouragement she enrolled on a degree in medicine, gaining several prizes during her studies. She was a lecturer in the Department of Physiology from 1958 until she retired in 1993. She married in the 1950s and had two children. == Career == Tracy worked primarily with Gregory until his death in 1990. Their collaboration defined understanding of the acid-secretory hormone gastrin during the 1960s and 70s. The hypothesis that a peptide was involved in control of secretion of gastric acid in the stomach had been accepted in the 1930s but the identity of the peptide was unknown. Between 1962 and 1968 their work isolated gastrin for the first time and sequenced it (in collaboration with George Kenner from the Department of Chemistry at University of Liverpool). They developed methods to isolate the 17 aminoacid gastrin peptide, starting from hundreds of pig stomachs for each preparation and initially identified two forms, distinguished by sulphation of a tyrosine residue. They went on to show that the 4 C-terminal aminoacid residues were responsible for all the hormone's activity. She led in the structure-function studies, leading to development of a short peptide as a pharmaceutical. Through her medical training, Tracy linked gastrin to a disease in humans, the rare cancer Zollinger–Ellison syndrome where excessive production of gastrin results in peptic ulcers. She drove this aspect of their research forwards that involved collaborations in the USA. ==Legacy== In 2017 the annual Hilda Tracy Lecture was inaugurated in the Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, the successor organisation to where she worked. The first lecture was given by Dame Nicola Anne \\"Nicky\\" Cullum. The second in 2018 was by Professor Dame Margaret Whitehead about 'How does low income cause ill- health ? A public health perspective.' The 2019 lecture was given by Professor Maria Fitzgerald about 'Pain: a lifelong journey'. == Selected publications== Tracy was author or co-author of over 32 scientific publications.

The album was produced by John Dragonetti of The Submarines and Mike Sawitzke of The Eels, and was mastered by Dave Cooley. A short series of videos was recorded with OurVinyl to document the making of the album.

Between the announcement and the release, the album was made available for pre-order with various rewards, including merchandise, concert tickets, and Skype interviews and pick-up basketball with band members. In March, three months before the album's release, Pete Heimbold announced on the band's public Facebook page that he was taking a leave of absence from the band, including from the tour dates, as he was battling chronic depression. Guest musicians have been present at live performances and on tour. Five songs were released in advance on YouTube between the announcement and the release, as well as live acoustic performances. This resulted in other artists covering songs even before the album's release, something the band encouraged. On the day of the album's release, the band uploaded the full album to be streamed for free. \\"Only the Wild Ones\\", the first single and the first pre-released track, reached No. 9 on Billboard's AAA chart, marking the band's highest position to date on that chart and their first top 20 track on the radio. == Track listing Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2017). ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - -  US Independent Albums (Billboard)  -  US Top Rock Albums (Billboard)  15 } ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:Dispatch albums ","title":"America, Location 12"},{"id":"54239310","text":"The 52nd New Zealand Parliament was a session of legislature in New Zealand, which opened on 7 November 2017 following the 2017 general election and dissolved on 6 September 2020. The New Zealand Parliament comprises the Sovereign (represented by the governor-general) and the House of Representatives, which consists of 120 members. The 52nd Parliament was elected using a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) voting system. Members of Parliament (MPs) represent 71 geographical electorates: 16 in the South Island, 48 in the North Island and 7 Māori electorates. The remaining members were elected from party lists using the Sainte-Laguë method to achieve proportionality. The number of geographical electorates was increased by one at the 2014 election, to account for the North Island's higher population growth. ==2017 general election== The 2017 general election was held on Saturday, 23 September 2017. Voters elected 120 members to the House of Representatives, with 71 electorate members and 49 list members. Official results indicated that the National Party had won a plurality, winning 56 seats; down from 60 in 2014. The Labour Party won 46 seats, up from 32 at the last election. Their partner, the Green Party won 8 seats, down from 14. New Zealand First won 9 seats, down from 11. ACT won the electorate of Epsom, and enough party votes to avoid an overhang, but failed to win any more party votes to entitle it to more seats. New Zealand First was left in the position of Kingmaker between National and the Labour/Green bloc. On 19 October, Winston Peters announced he was forming a coalition agreement with Labour, with the Greens in a confidence-and-supply agreement. The Greens' support, plus the coalition, resulting in 63 seats to National's 56—enough to ensure that Ardern maintains the confidence of the House. ==Major events== * 12 October 2017 — The writ for election is returned; officially declaring all elected members of the 52nd Parliament. * 19 October 2017 — A coalition government between Labour and NZ First is confirmed, with C&S; from the Green Party. * 25 October 2017 — Chris Hipkins is confirmed Leader of the House. * 26 October 2017 — Jacinda Ardern is sworn in as Prime Minister of New Zealand. * 7 November 2017 — The Governor-General issued the Commission of Opening of Parliament.

The bill establishes standalone legislation that provides a legal framework for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand for a period of up to 2 years. ==Ministry== The Sixth Labour Government began with the 52nd Parliament, following the announcement of a coalition deal between the Labour Party and New Zealand First, with the Green Party providing confidence and supply, thus giving the government 63 seats, opposite the main opposition party, National, with 56 seats.

This Parliament had its last scheduled sitting on 6 August 2020 and was originally set to be dissolved on 12 August. However, the dissolution of Parliament was delayed to 17 August after four cases of COVID-19 outside of a quarantine facility were reported in Auckland leading to an increase in the region's alert level, and was later delayed further to 6 September. Parliament resumed sitting on 18 August for a further three weeks. The business of the House in this period was limited, sitting only two days a week, for no more than two hours at a time, and for the sole purpose of scrutinising the government's response to COVID-19, with no further legislation progressed. The last sitting of the additional period was held on 2 September, and the Parliament was dissolved as scheduled on 6 September. ==See also== *Opinion polling for the 2017 New Zealand general election *Politics of New Zealand *New Zealand House of Representatives committees ==References== Category:New Zealand parliaments Category:2017 elections in New Zealand Category:Lists of political office- holders in New Zealand Category:November 2017 events in New Zealand Category:September 2020 events in New Zealand ","title":"52nd New Zealand Parliament"},{"id":"54239311","text":"Holly Norton (born 1 January 1993) is a South African–British rower. ==Biography== Born and raised in Harare, Zimbabwe, Holly's family moved to South Africa in 2003.

At the time of its nomination it consisted of 120 resources, which included 94 contributing buildings and 26 non-contributing buildings. with This section of the city was developed as the population increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The growth was due, in part, to the expansion of the University of Iowa and its hospitals. There was also an expansion of the central business district at the same time. Both professionals and business owners built houses here. The district contains houses for the upper class and the middle class, side by side to each other. It was also the place where German and Bohemian immigrant families resided. The architectural styles and vernacular house forms found here are representative of those built in the city from the 1860s through the 1930s. The Queen Anne and Greek Revival styles are particularly evident. Local architect Orville H. Carpenter designed at least eight houses in the district. The Emma J. Harvat and Mary E.

The Aloha 26, 27, 8.2, 271 are all closely related designs. Although the hulls are identical and were produced in the same mould, the builders used several different sail and mast suppliers during the production run of the designs and specifications for the boats produced varied accordingly. Many of the boats produced have interchangeable sails and other parts. Despite having so many designations for the vessel, Aloha 27 is colloquially used as the model designation. ==Production== The design was built between 1979 and 1987 by Ouyang Boat Works in Whitby, Ontario, Canada, under the Aloha Yachts brand. During that period the company built 188 of the Aloha 27 design. After the bankruptcy of Ouyang, DH Boatbuilding of Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia purchased the mould and built two (as the Parks 27), one in 1989 and the last in 1995 before DH ceased building boats altogether in 2000. ==Design== Aloha 27 The Aloha 27 series are all small recreational keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. They all have fractional sloop rigs, internally- mounted spade-type rudders and fixed fin keels. They are fitted with a tiller, although a wheel was a factory option. They all displace and carry of ballast encapsulated inside a fibreglass keel. The series all have a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat came with an outboard motor provision as standard with the option of an inboard BMW, Volvo Penta or Westerbeke diesel engine powering a saildrive unit. The early versions had the BMW powerplant of , which some owners found underpowered and that led to the Westerbeke engine of being substituted. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The original production run boats featured such amenities as Barient winches, tufted crushed velour cushions, oversized spars, pulpit and lifelines, as well as internal halyards.

The framework aims to strengthen institutions, government capacity, and public financial management as aid and concessional financing rapidly decline. == Background == In September 1953, Haiti became a nation member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the first of five member institutions of the World Bank Group. Despite its urgent need for humanitarian aid as the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Haiti's political instability under a series of dictatorial regimes limited its access to international aid and development programs. Due to poor governance, the country was considered a risky recipient of foreign assistance. This resulted in little improvement and the country remained dysfunctional and impoverished despite billions in foreign aid over decades.  Debt Relief and Funds  The World Bank Group’s involvement in Haiti has focused on reconstruction and development. The country has suffered deterioration from Western slavery and imperialism, ceaseless civil unrest, decades of the extreme poverty, and devastation from a series of natural disasters. Following its satisfaction for the requirements of domestic, economic, and social reforms, Haiti was granted a total of US $1.2 billion in 2009 by reaching the finishing point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt relief initiative approved by the Boards of the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the IDA waived the country's remaining US $36 million debt in May, and the World Bank made US $479 million available for Haiti's recovery from the earthquake and development through June 2016. == Country Partnership Framework and Projects == In September 2015, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors endorsed the New Country Partnership Strategy in Haiti. The Country Partnership Framework is collectively set by the Haitian Government and branches of the World Bank Group including the International Development Association (IDA), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The World Bank in Haiti focuses on projects to increase government capacity by enhancing energy accessibility and developing a renewable energy infrastructure that facilitates the country's economic opportunity, strengthening human capital through improvement in education, welfare and health services, and improving climate resilience and disaster response capacity. As of April 2017, the World Bank’s portfolio in Haiti comprised 13 ongoing projects with a net commitment of US $637.8 million.  Recent Projects  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has focused Haiti’s flagship private sector projects. The IFC committed a portfolio of US $122 million in Haiti through the Country Partnership Framework in 2015. Sylvain Kakou, the IFC Country Head in Haiti, said the IFC has become the largest provider of foreign direct investment in Haiti for the private sector to foster economic growth. This support facilitated the resumption of business after the earthquake and provided packages of loans for private sector clients including the independent power producer, two banks, a micro-credit institution, mining exploration, a hotel and an industrial park. The IFC has supported many of Haiti’s private sector projects with its portfolio of investments amounting to the US $32.7 million in 7 transactions.  Significant Projects   Strengthening Primary Health Care and Surveillance in Haiti  The project is projected to aid in providing basic healthcare services to 3 million people. It aims to increase the ability for the government to monitor health risks and the immunization process, as well as better the relationship between the Haitian government and international organizations within the health sector. This is an active project with the project end date being December 31, 2024. Currently the results of this project are: 45.3% of children aged 12 to 23 months in project intervention areas are fully vaccinated, 45% of suspected cases of cholera are given notifications within 10 days, 72% and 77% of suspected cases of diphtheria and measles, respectively, were investigated and reported within 48 hours. The project is being lead by Andrew Sunil Rajkumar and the total project cost being $70 million dollars with $50 million dollars being the commitment amount.  Providing an Education of Quality in Haiti  The goal of this project is to increase the enrollment in public and private primary schools, create a better learning environment by improving the condition of schools, and close the gender gap in education. The focus of this project is regional with the selected area being the Southern departments. This active project is headed by Yves Jantzem and Elena Maria Roseo. The total project cost is $57 million and the commitment amount being $39 million.  Strengthening Disaster Risk Management and Climate Resilience  The project objective is to create enhanced infrastructure to support efficient disaster risk management by implementing a national early warning system, better emergency response, and improve the evacuation process in high risk areas. It will also implement the development of schools and community centers to be used as emergency shelters, create improved building codes, and give training. The project is active and is headed by Claudia Ruth Soto Orozco and Roland Alexander Bradshaw. The total project cost is $35 million and the commitment amount being $35 million as well. This project was approved on May 16, 2019 and the end date being April 30, 2025.

The World Bank's priorities in Haiti are listed as follows. Growing the economy outside of Port-au-Prince by revitalizing energy sources, increasing the activity in the private sector, and increasing access to funds. Increase human capital through promotion of primary education, maternal and child healthcare. Aiding communities affected by the cholera outbreak by providing water and sanitation in these areas. Rebuilding stronger infrastructure to decrease the disaster risk by floods and other natural disasters as well as having greater emergency preparedness. Improve the government’s capacity for data and creating effective policy around that data, while also providing a system of transparency. == Controversy ==  Mining  The World Bank has been criticized because of their assistance in drafting a revision to a mining bill that would expand the mining sector and increase the potential of foreign companies interest in Haiti, by bypassing the current bureaucratic system and parliamentary oversight altogether. This initial act in 2013 was met with multiple Haitian groups filing an appeal through the World Bank's office of complaints, due to the lack of public input in the matter, a requirement of the World Bank. The case was rejected by the Inspection Panel due to the technical assistance coming from Bank-executed trust fund, meaning the social and environmental safeguards did not need to be followed. Amid the Haitian government dissolving in 2015 concerns arose again regarding the fate of this revision and it’s possible impact on the environment and local communities. The draft bill is considered by activists to have the potential to further political turmoil as elections were underway to select a new president and parliament and this issue could be pushed depending on the political leaning. ==References== The team was led by Raju Jan Singh (Program Leader, LCC8C).

He received the 2017 American Chemical Society (ACS) Award in Inorganic Chemistry for his contributions to the field.ACS Awards, and the 2008 ACS Alfred Bader Award in Bioinorganic Chemistry.ACS Awards == Biography == He obtained his B.S. degree in Chemistry from Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City, Philippines in 1969. He then received his Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota in 1973 under the direction of Prof. Louis Pignolet. From there, Que went on to conduct postdoctoral studies with Professor Richard H. Holm at Massachusetts Institute of Technology followed by a research stint with Eckard Münck at Gray Freshwater Biological Institute from 1975 to 1977. His independent research career began at Cornell University where he held the position of Assistant Professor of Chemistry from 1977 until 1983. Que then moved back to the University of Minnesota where he currently is a Regents Professor. Lawrence Que Jr. has published over 450 research manuscripts and 7 patents during his research career. He has presented almost 300 invited lectures and mentored almost 50 doctoral students. His inorganic chemistry research group at the University of Minnesota focuses on iron chemistry relevant to biocatalysis, in an attempt to better understand oxygen activation mechanisms of nonheme iron enzymes. His group is also working towards designing functional models for iron enzymes and capturing, observing, and categorizing highly active metal-based intermediates. He is also working on creating bio-inspired oxidation catalysts for green chemistry applications. For his contributions to the field of inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, Que received the American Chemical Society's 2008 Alfred Bader Award in Bioinorganic Chemistry and 2017 Award in Inorganic Chemistry. == Bioinspired catalysis == Que has been studying the behaviors of high-valent iron-oxo species in relation to their ability of hydroxylation. Previous high-valent iron-oxo species have been noted and studied by observing [(Por•)Fe(IV)=O]+ in heme systems. However, it is yet to be established that a high-valent state could be accessed without a nonheme ligand environment. Que and his group studied various nonheme iron based complexes and through elaborate mechanistic work proved that Fe(V)=O species can indeed exist without the supporting heme ligand. The structure of [Fe(II)(TPA)(CH3CN)2]2+ can be seen as the catalyst in this reaction scheme. == Nonheme iron oxygenases == (HPCA) 2,3-dioxygenase with heme iron center. Each colored chain contains one iron heme center. The black atom in the cropped picture is the iron nuclei. One of Que’s focuses is on the activation of dioxygen species in biological systems through non-heme iron active sites. More specifically, one of Que’s focuses is on homoprotocatechuate (HPCA) 2,3-dioxygenase, which mediates the electron transfer between catechol substrates and O2 to form a [M(II)(semiquinone)superoxo] intermediate. Non-heme iron active sites, including those involving Mn(II) and Co(II), have proven to be equally potent as heme iron active sites with comparable or greater KMO2 and kcat. By exploring nonheme iron oxygenases, Que hopes to optimize the first steps in the industrial production of methane gas, which would yield enormous energy savings for industry. A reaction scheme of Fe/Co-HPCD as a catalyst. == High- valent iron-oxo == Lawrence Que Jr has been recently working on creating synthetic oxoiron(IV) complexes with S=2 spin. The first crystallographic example of a high spin Fe(IV)=O was achieved in 2009, and in 2011, Que proved that the ligand used in the previous study could also support a tricationic cyanoiron(IV) complex. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Filipino chemists Category:Filipino academics Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Minnesota faculty ","title":"Lawrence Que Jr."},{"id":"54239755","text":"The canton of Aix-en-Othe is an administrative division of the Aube department, northeastern France.

It was the derelict terraces and docklands of Bristol that first drew Harwood to Bristol, but the city was also the home of Berthold Lubetkin and it was an exhibition of his work and the Thirties exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in 1979 that kindled an interest in modernism, and the modern buildings of her childhood – schools and the Nottingham Playhouse – that had been so influential to her education, having come from a modest background. ==Career== Looking for a career, she took a temporary job in January 1984 at what was to become English Heritage, and has stayed there ever since, learning most from an inspiring day release course in Building Conservation at the Architectural Association. In 1987 she joined what had been the Greater London Council Historic Buildings Division, by then absorbed into English Heritage, just as research was needed on post-war buildings, and between 1996 and 2004 was responsible for most of the organisation's recommendations for listing buildings from the period after 1945, as well as for research programmes on earlier cinemas and flats. She completed a PhD on the building of London's South Bank at Bristol University in 2010.

The Earth's waters are said to be \\"under threat as never before\\", with pollution, overfishing, and the effects of climate change severely damaging the health of our oceans. For instance as oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, biodiversity is becoming reduced and changing currents will cause more frequent storms and droughts. Every year around 8 million metric tons of plastic waste leak into the ocean and make it into the circular ocean currents. This causes contamination of sediments at the sea-bottom and causes plastic waste to be embedded in the aquatic food chain. It could lead to oceans containing more plastics than fish by 2050 if nothing is done. Key habitats such as coral reefs are at risk and noise pollution are a threat to whales, dolphins, and other species. Furthermore almost 90 percent of fish stocks are overfished or fully exploited which cost more than $80 billion a year in lost revenues. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that decisive, coordinated global action can solve the problems created by Humanity. Peter Thomson, President of the UN General Assembly, highlighted the conference's significance, saying \\"if we want a secure future for our species on this planet, we have to act now on the health of the ocean and on climate change\\". photographed by Apollo 17 in 1972) The conference sought to find ways and urge for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. Its theme is \\"Our oceans, our future: partnering for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14\\". It also asked governments, UN bodies, and civil society groups to make voluntary commitments for action to improve the health of the oceans with over 1,000 commitments − such as on managing protected areas − being made. ==Participation== Participants include heads of State and Government, civil society representatives, business people, actors, academics and scientists and ocean and marine life advocates from around 200 countries. Around 6,000 leaders gathered for the conference over the course of the week. The Governments of Fiji and Sweden had the co-hosting responsibilities of the Conference. 7 partnership dialogues with a rich state- developed state theme were co-chaired by Australia-Kenya, Iceland-Peru, Canada-Senegal, Estonia-Grenada, Italy-Palau, Monaco-Mozambique and Norway- Indonesia. Ministers from small island states such as Palau, Fiji and Tuvalu pleaded for help as for them the issue is existential not just on the long- term. Outcomes Over 1,300 voluntary commitments have been made which UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Wu Hongbo called \\"truly impressive\\" and stated that they now comprise \\"an ocean solution registry\\" via the public online platform. 44 percent of the commitments came from governments, 19 percent from NGOs, 9 percent from UN entities and 6 percent from the private sector. Delegates from China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines pledged to work to keep plastics out of the seas. The Maldives announced a phase out of its non-biodegradable plastic and Austria pledged to reduce the number of plastic bags used per person to 25 a year by 2019. Several nations announced plans for new marine protected areas. China plans to establish 10 to 20 \\"demonstration zones\\" by 2020 and introduced a regulation which requires that 35 percent of the country's shoreline should be natural by 2020. Gabon announced that it will create one of Africa's largest marine protected areas with around 53,000 square kilometres of ocean when combined with its existing zones. New Zealand affirmed the government's commitment to establishing the Kermadec/Rangitahua Ocean Sanctuary, which − with 620,000 square kilometres − would be one of the world's largest fully protected areas. Pakistan also announced its first marine protected area. The US-based international wildlife organisation Wildlife Conservation Society created the MPA Fund in 2016 as well as the blue moon fund for a combined $15 million commitment which aims to create 3.7 million square kilometers of new marine protected areas with The Tiffany & Co. Foundation adding a $1 million grant toward this fund in the week of the conference. Germany's Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Barbara Hendricks also pledged to allocate €670 million for marine conservation projects and made 11 voluntary commitments. Deputy Director-General of the State Oceanic Administrations Lin Shanqing of China − the world's main fish producer and exporter − stated that the country would be \\"willing, based on its own development experience, to work actively for the establishment in the area of the ocean of an open, inclusive, concrete, pragmatic, mutually beneficial and win-win blue partnership with other countries and international organizations\\". The conference ended with the adoption by consensus of a 14-point Call for Action by the 193 UN member states in which they affirmed their \\"strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use our oceans, seas and marine resources tor sustainable development\\". With this call, the Ocean Conference also sought to raise global awareness of ocean problems. Private sector On 9 June an official side event of the United Nations Ocean Conference for addressing ways by which the private sector provides practical solutions to address the problems such as by improving energy efficiency, waste management and introducing market-based tools to shift investment, subsidy and production. Nine of the world's biggest fishing companies from Asia, Europe and the US have signed up for The Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship (SeaBOS) initiative, supported by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, aiming to end unsustainable practices. Research and technology projects At the conference Indonesia published its Vessel monitoring system (VMS) publicly revealing the location and activity of its commercial fishing boats on the Global Fishing Watch public mapping platform. Brian Sullivan states that the platform is can easily incorporate additional data sources which may allow \\"mov[ing] from raw data to quickly producing dynamic visualizations and reporting that promote scientific discovery and support policies for better fishery management\\". Irina Bokova of UNESCO notes that \\"we cannot manage what we cannot measure, and no single country is able to measure the myriad changes taking place in the ocean\\", and asks for more maritime research and the sharing of knowledge to craft common science-based policies. Peru co-chaired the \\"Partnership Dialogue 6 – Increasing scientific knowledge, and developing research capacity and transfer of marine technology\\" with Iceland. On 7 June researchers at the Dutch The Ocean Cleanup foundation published a study according to which rivers − such as the Yangtze − carry an around 1.15–2.41 million tonnes of plastic into the sea every year. ==Obstacles to implementation== North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone − the location of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch An example of sea pollution which the conference sought to avert. UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that unless nations overcome short-term territorial and resource interests the state of the oceans will continue to deteriorate. He also names \\"the artificial dichotomy\\" between jobs and healthy oceans as one of the main challenges and asks for strong political leadership, new partnerships and concrete steps. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina J Mohammed warns about the harm of overlooking the climate concerns in turn for perceived \\"national gain\\", claiming that \\"a moral obligation to the world which [one] live[s] on\\" exists. India, attended indirectly via two non- governmental organisations until 9 June when Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar told the conference that the negative impact of overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and climate change are becoming increasingly clear and that the time for action would be \\"already long overdue\\". Bolivia's President Evo Morales told the conference that, one of the world's main polluters, the United States denied science, turned its backs on multilateralism, and attempted to deny a future to upcoming generations by its national government deciding to leave the Paris agreement, making \\"it the main threat to Mother Earth and life itself\\". Albert II, Prince of Monaco called Trump's withdrawal \\"catastrophic\\" and the reaction from US mayors, governors and many in the corporate world as \\"wonderful\\". On 30 May Sweden's deputy prime minister Isabella Lövin stated that the United States is resisting plans to highlight how climate change is disrupting life in the oceans at the conference, that the US has negatively affected preparations and that \\"the decline of the oceans is really a threat to the entire planet\\" with a \\"need to start working together\\". Lovin also makes note of difficulties to engage with Washington in the conference, partly because key posts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remain unfilled since the end of the Obama administration. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi states that subsidies from wealthy governments encourage overfishing, overcapacity and may contribute to illegal and unregulated fishing, creating food insecurity, unemployment and poverty for people relying mainly on fish as their primary source of nourishment or livelihood. ==Impact and progress== Marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson notes that the UN's work alone is not nearly enough and that for a solution to this existential crisis of the health of our global environment, strong and inspired leadership at all levels – from mayors, to governors, CEOs, scientists, artists and presidents is needed. In 2010 the international community agreed to protect 10% of the ocean by 2020 in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and Sustainable Development Goal 14. However as of June 2017 less than 3% of the ocean are under some form of protection. Pledges made during the conference would add around an additional 4.4 percent of protected marine areas, increasing the protected total to around 7.4% of the ocean. A later study (in 2018), reveals that 3,6% was protected.The World Has Two Years to Meet Marine Protection Goal. Can It Be Done?Assessing real progress towards effective ocean protection Peter Thomson called the conference was a success, stating that he was \\"satisfied with [its] results\\", that the conference \\"held at a very critical time\\" has \\"turned the tide on marine pollution\\". He says that \\"we are now working around the world to restore a relationship of balance and respect towards the ocean\\". Elizabeth Wilson, director of international conservation at Pew Charitable Trusts thinks that this meeting \\"will be followed by a whole series of other meetings that we hope will be impacted in a positive way\\". The next conference is scheduled for 2020. Portugal's Minister for the Seas, Ana Paula Vitorino stated that Lisbon would like to host the next event in 2020. Kenya's Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed also offered for Kenya to host the next event. ==Culture and society== The event coincided with the World Oceans Day on 8 June and started with the World Environment Day on 5 June. On 4 June the World Ocean Festival took place at New York City's Governors Island. The festival was hosted by the City of New York, organized by the Global Brain Foundation and was free and open to the public. China announced a new international sailing competition and Noahs Sailing Club press officer Rebecca Wang stated that \\"sailing allows for a better appreciation of the ocean and the natural environment. Many wealthy Chinese think of luxury yachts when they think of maritime sports, and we're trying to foster a maritime culture that's more attuned to the environment\\". Users of social media worldwide use the hashtag #SaveOurOcean for discussion, information and media related to the conference and its goals. The #CleanSeas cyber campaign calls on governments, industry and citizens to end excessive, wasteful usage of single-use plastic and eliminate microplastics in cosmetics with its petition getting signed by more than 1 million people. ==See alsoReferencesExternal links== * * #OceanConference on Twitter * United Nations – LIVE – UN Ocean Conference, recording of the livestreamed conference on YouTube Category:2017 conferences Category:2017 in international relations Category:2017 in New York City Category:2010s in Manhattan Category:2017 in the environment Category:Diplomatic conferences in the United States Category:Environmental conferences Category:June 2017 events in the United States Category:Marine conservation Category:Ocean pollution Category:United Nations conferences Category:Events in New York City ","title":"United Nations Ocean Conference"},{"id":"54239886","text":"Warren Braren (2 September 1931 – 17 August 2015) was a consumer protection advocate in the United States. In his early career Braren worked at Ted Bates advertising firm. In 1960 he began work as manager at the National Association of Broadcasters where he stayed till 1969. While there, Braren began to criticize that the industry self-regulation regarding tobacco advertising was ineffective and that it led to youth smoking. In June 1970 Braren testified to the United States Congress by sharing confidential industry documents which demonstrated industry awareness that the tobacco ads targeted young people. Braren said that broadcasters were unwilling to regulate themselves, and would do whatever benefited the financial interests of those who purchased advertising. This led to the ban on tobacco ads on television, in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970. In 1971 Braren worked at the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting. After leaving the National Association of Broadcasters Braren worked at Consumers Union were among other things, he advocated for restrictions on advertising to children. Later Braren worked at the Times Mirror Company. Braren spoke on behalf of Consumers Union on various occasions, including in 1971 about advertising to children, in 1973 about the safety of microwave ovens, in 1977 at a meeting of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association regarding cable television in the United States. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Industry Documents Library holdings of Braren's archives at the University of California San Francisco Category:Anti-smoking activists Category:Consumer rights activists Category:1931 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American health activists ","title":"Warren Braren"},{"id":"54239887","text":"The 2017 Il Lombardia was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 7 October.

By supporting physics and mathematics, it honours one of the greatest of physicists, James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), and works to increase the public awareness of science. It maintains a small museum in Maxwell's birthplace which is in the ownership of the Foundation. ==Purpose== James Clerk Maxwell's birthplace at 14 India Street, Edinburgh, home of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation The James Clerk Maxwell Foundation aims to increase the public awareness of the many scientific advances made by Maxwell over his lifetime and to highlight their importance in the world today. It summarises Maxwell's many innovative technical advances and displays, in Maxwell’s birthplace, the history of Maxwell's family. The Foundation awards grants and prizes and supports mathematical challenges designed to encourage young students to study as mathematicians, scientists and engineers and become leaders in the world tomorrow. ==History== The James Clerk Maxwell Foundation was formed in 1977 by the late Sydney Ross,Sydney Ross, Royal Society of Edinburgh, UK. Professor of Colloidal chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, USA. Ross was born in Scotland and he inherited monies from his late father’s whisky business, Ross, Campbell Ltd. In 1993, the Foundation acquired 14 India Street, Edinburgh, the birthplace of Maxwell. Since 1993, the house has been refurbished to its original standard and a small museum has been developed which features Maxwell’s family, life and scientific advances. These have resulted in Maxwell now being recognised as the most famous scientist in the era between Newton and Einstein. ==Maxwell's birthplace== Bust of James Clerk Maxwell on display at Maxwell's birthplace Maxwell was born at 14 India Street on 13 June 1831. This four-floor townhouse has 3–4 rooms on each floor. The Foundation lets the basement and top floor to tenants and maintains on the ground and first floor a modest museum which can be opened for visits by prior appointment. Maxwell’s father, John Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie, had previously inherited land at Corsock in Galloway and he divided his time between Galloway and his 1820s townhouse in Edinburgh’s New Town. In 1830, John Clerk Maxwell commenced building a new house on his Corsock farm and would later name this Glenlair House.. The Clerk Maxwell family moved permanently to Glenlair when James was two years old. Maxwell’s mother died when he was only eight years old and, two years later, he returned to Edinburgh to attend school at the Edinburgh Academy. Maxwell studied at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cambridge and his career followed professorial appointments at Marischal College Aberdeen, King's College London and the University of Cambridge. While in Aberdeen, Maxwell married the College Principal’s daughter Katherine Dewar. ==Museum== The restored entrance hall contains a copy of the bust of Maxwell by Charles d’Orville Pilkington Jackson, the original is located at Marischal College, Aberdeen. The Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing plaque by the American Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) commemorates Maxwell’s contributions to electromagnetic theory. Displayed here is a timeline starting with Maxwell’s life and going up to today, where Maxwell’s electromagnetics is central to the performance of cellular mobile phones, GPS and Radar. Exhibition Room This room, originally the dining room, contains several family portraits: a copy of James Clerk Maxwell by Lowes Cato Dickinson located in Trinity College, Cambridge; and of Maxwell’s father, John Clerk Maxwell. Early pastels from the Cay’s, his mother’s family, of Maxwell’s uncles, Robert and John, his aunt Jane and Maxwell’s mother Frances Cay. These are by Maxwell’s maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Cay, there is also a portrait in oils, after Sir Henry Raeburn, of Elizabeth’s husband Robert Hodshon Cay by Maxwell's cousin, Isabella Cay (1850–1934). The final portrait is of Maxwell’s lifelong friend and scientific colleague Peter Guthrie Tait who was the Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University. Tartan Ribbon One of Maxwell’s major technical advances is the first full colour projected image produced at a time when only black-and-white photography was known. The projection of this coloured image on a screen was famously demonstrated in 1861 at Faraday's Royal Institution in London. In this, the foundation of virtually all practical colour processes, he made three black-and-white photographic plates which were photographed through red, green and blue filters respectively. He then used three magic lanterns to superimpose these three black-and-white images, each projected through the same red, green and blue filters, to produce the first colour image of the ‘tartan ribbon’. This production of colour images is still used today in printing, digital cameras, televisions, and computers. The replica of Maxwell’s colour box, which he used to quantitatively analyse and synthesise light colours in order to underpin his observations on colour mixing and colour perception (thereby extending Newton's work on Optics), was produced in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University. Maxwell's celebrated equations as depicted on the James Clerk Maxwell Statue in Edinburgh Maxwell’s most celebrated contribution was in deriving the equations governing electromagnetics (Maxwell’s equations). In his 1865 paper, A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, (This article followed a December 8, 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.) Maxwell defined electromagnetics in terms of 20 equations, later summarised in his 1873 book Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, James Clerk Maxwell, Clarendon Press, 1873 Hendrik Lorentz subsequently reinterpreted these as the fundamental equations of electrodynamics and Oliver Heaviside developed the notation we use today. The theory behind Maxwell's equations was the first grand unification theory of the forces of Nature as this theory united the electric and magnetic fields. A person who is stationary may experience only an electric field but a person who is in relative motion may experience an electric current and a magnetic field. Thus the one field (called the electromagnetic field) may appear in different guises. In his famous 1905 'Special Relativity' paper, Albert Einstein showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under a Lorentz transformation (as opposed to a Galilean transformation) and, inter alia, used this evidence to support his 'relativity theory' that the Lorentz transformation was the true transformation of Nature (between the viewpoints of two observers, one moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other). On display is a replica of part of the balance arm of Maxwell’s apparatus to measure the ratio of electromagnetic to electrostatic units of electrical charge. Maxwell showed mathematically that the numerical value of this ratio was equal to the speed of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell recognised that the speed of electromagnetic waves (as derived from his equations) was also equal to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau and as previously measured in the 17th century by Ole Roemer. In his 1865 paper, Maxwell stated the immortal words “…it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat and other radiations if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated …according the electromagnetic laws”. This was stated by the Nobel Laureate physicist Richard Feynman in 1964 to be the most stunning conclusion of 19th-century theoretical physics! The display cabinet shows a few pages, on loan from The Edinburgh Academy, of Maxwell’s work on oval curves, where Maxwell simplified earlier work of René Descartes. He presented this work to the Royal Society of Edinburgh (or rather Professor Forbes did as Maxwell, then aged 14, was considered too young!). Maxwell's second scientific paper “The Theory of Rolling Curves” was written at age 17 while at university in Edinburgh. The cabinet displays here 3 of Maxwell's medals: the 1860 Rumford Medal from Royal Society for colour composition, the 1871 Keith Medal from Royal Society of Edinburgh for forces and frames in structures, and the 1878 Volta Medal from University of Pavia, when he was awarded an honorary degree. The Library This room (originally John Clerk Maxwell's business office when he practiced as an advocate in Edinburgh) contains wall displays celebrating Maxwell’s other major scientific achievements: his work on governors for machine speed control; Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and his contribution to statistical physics; discovery of the form of Saturn's rings; contributing to the committee that defined the Ohm; reciprocal figures or frames for the design of structures such roofs and bridges. The final set of wall panels describes the friezes on his Edinburgh statue placing Maxwell’s contributions in context between Newton and Einstein. The library also contains a selection of books on Maxwell, Newton, Lord Kelvin, Michael Faraday etc. The Staircase Detail of Jemima Wedderburn watercolour depicting a young James Clerk Maxwell paddling a washtub on the River Urr The engravings on the staircase walls are from Sir John Herschel's Collection purchased by our founder, Sydney Ross. They sample the history of science and mathematics from Copernicus onwards, arriving at Maxwell’s contemporaries Michael Faraday and Lord Kelvin. Upper Exhibition Room The upper exhibition room is the annexe of the original drawing room, and it was in this room that James Clerk Maxwell was born in 1831. It displays material relating to the Clerk family, Maxwell’s childhood, early life and career, including some of his poetry. There is a reproduction of the William Dyce portrait of James and his mother, from Birmingham art galleries (Dyce was the brother of Maxwell's aunt). The main display here is of watercolours by Maxwell’s cousin Jemima Wedderburn. Jemima later married Hugh Blackburn, Professor of Mathematics at Glasgow University and a colleague of Lord Kelvin. Conference Room Peter Higgs portrait by Lucinda Mackay hanging at James Clerk Maxwell Foundation The Conference Room, originally the Drawing Room, which is used for receptions and seminars contains a Latin epigram which can be translated as: From this house of his birth, his name is now widespread – across the entire terrestrial globe and even to the stars. The major painting here (by Lady Lucinda L. Mackay) is of a near neighbour, Nobel Laureate and Honorary Patron of the Foundation, Professor Peter Higgs, whose research led to the search, in the Large Hadron Collider, to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson. ==ReferencesExternal links== * The James Clerk Maxwell Foundation website * Guide to Maxwell's birthplace Category:1977 establishments in Scotland Category:Organizations established in 1977 Category:Charities based in Edinburgh Category:Museums established in 1993 Category:Historic house museums in Edinburgh Maxwell, James Clark ","title":"James Clerk Maxwell Foundation"},{"id":"54239922","text":"Newmarket Heath is a 279.3-hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Newmarket in Suffolk.

The town had been built for its limestone quarries. When the painting was made, the town was in rapid decline due to the development of Portland cement.

After minor cuts it was included into the Ward No. 6 collection (St. Petersburg, 1893) to feature unchanged in its 2–7 (1893–1899) editions. In July 1891 Ivan Gorbunov-Posadov approached Chekhov with the request: to publish as a separate edition \\"...this brilliant tale of a local Tartuffe, a vile, debauched, God-fearing hypocrite\\", and Chekhov gave him his permission. The story came out in 1894 via the Posrednik Publishers, but with the Varvara and Sofya's nightly dialogue cut out, the scene which is crucial for the understanding of the whole story.

The latter asks the former about a boy named Kuzka who travels with him, and Matvey Savitch relates a strange and harrowing story of his adopted son, who looks and behaves more like a frightened little servant. It is a story of Mashenka, Kuzka's mother whom Matvey Savvich had seduced, while her husband Vasya was serving in the army. When Vasya returned, Mashenka refused to return to the man she hated: she fell madly for her lover... So the latter betrays her – first to Vasya, who viciously beats her up, and then to the police, after Vasya had been found dead, a victim, apparently, of arsenic poisoning. Some people suggest it might have been suicide, but Marvey Savish confidently points at his former lover as a culprit, so she gets sent to jail, then Siberia... After which he adopts Mashenka's son, for his \\"soul's salvation\\", as he optimistically puts it. Dyudya is totally on the side of Matvey Savich: they both are convinced Mashenka is the only one who's to blame for her own demise... Two of Dyudya’s daughters-in-law, Varvara and Sofya, who happen to hate their husbands too, beg to differ. The story gives some strange ideas to Varvara who, as the night comes, suggests to Sofya that they both might also get rid of their hated men, Dyudya's sons Fyodor and hunchback Alyushka, respectively. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Бабы, the original Russian text * Peasant Wives, two early English translations, 1908 and 1918 Category:Short stories by Anton Chekhov Category:1891 short stories ","title":"Peasant Wives"},{"id":"54240138","text":"Agabar is a sizeable town which is part of Woqooyi Galbeed region of Somaliland.

Pacchi then directed his intellectual efforts to the study of the history of Modern philosophy, giving special attention to the philosophical personality of Thomas Hobbes. One of the outcomes of his labour in this direction was Convenzione e ipotesi nella formazione della filosofia naturale di Thomas Hobbes. The book appeared in 1965, published by La Nuova Italia.

Pacchi, La filosofia inglese da Fludd ad Harvey, chapter 22, pp.495-504; Hobbes e la trattatistica politica, chapter 23, pp.505-527; Platonici di Cambridge e Latitudinari, chapter 30, pp.675-687; La filosofia sperimentale e John Locke, chapter 31, pp.689-715; in M. Dal Pra (edited), Storia della Filosofia, vol.VII, Milan 1976. Concurrently, Pacchi devoted his attention to new problems and new authors in the history of philosophy, later publishing the book La Materia, a concise history of the concept of matter, from the beginnings of the notion in Ancient Greece to the redefinition of the meanings of the term in the 19th and 20th centuries.A. Pacchi, La Materia, Milan, 1976 In 1978, Pacchi edited a collection of excerpts taken from the works of a group of 19th century materialist philosophers. He introduced the texts explaining the choice he made, putting the authors in their historical and cultural context. There, Pacchi stated how, “notwithstanding their general diffidence to philosophy, the German materialists had two “protective deities”, Schopenhauer and Feuerbach, whom they often refer to, although they quite never understood them completely. You can wonder of the connection, but your surprise will be short lived, if you ponder the fact that these two thinkers voiced, from different perspectives, the quickest and the most intransigent anti-idealist reaction in Germany in the second quarter of XIX century”.See A. Pacchi, Materialisti dell’Ottocento, p.16. “Nonostante la loro generale diffidenza verso la filosofia, I materialisti tedeschi ebbero due numi tutelari, sovente citati anche se non sempre compresi a fondo: Schopenhauer e Feuerbach. L’accostamento può sorprendere, ma non più di tanto, se si considera che questi due pensatori diedero voce, da posizioni pur molto lontane tra loro, alla più vivace e intransigente reazione anti-idealistica che si sia espressa in Germania nel secondo quarto del secolo.” In 1979, Pacchi wrote an essay on Schopenhauer’s materialism, as part of a work by various authors on the Legacy of Enlightenment.A. Pacchi, Schopenhauer tra Illuminismo e Materialismo, in “Eredità dell’Illuminismo”, Bologna 1979, pp.203-230. In 1983, he published an Introduction to the reading of the Essay on Human Understanding.A. Pacchi, Introduzione alla lettura del Saggio sull’Intelletto Umano di Locke, Milano, 1983. A second, revised edition, edited by Francesco Tomasoni, appeared in 1997. As Tomasoni underlines, in the introductory note, the published text came out of the recordings of the lessons Pacchi actually gave during the Academic Year 1982-1983. The book, printed as a didactic tool, was the second work on Locke by the Italian scholar.The first was the article Pacchi wrote for the VII volume of the history of philosophy edited in 1976 by Mario Dal Pra. The article, titled La filosofia sperimentale e John Locke, gives significant heed to the political and religious themes in Locke’s philosophy (pp.694 – 705), perceiving such questions as a key to earn some new insight on the making of the masterwork of the English philosopher. (See p.706: It is a fact that Locke himself connected the studies whose outcome was the Essay on Human Understanding to the need of defining the limits of knowledge in relation to what his friend Tyrrel will note down as related to “the principles of moral and of revealed religion”). From 1981 to 1988, Pacchi came back to the study of the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. The first clue of his renewed interests on this subject is a contribution he gave to the International Congress on “Coscienza civile ed esperienza religiosa nell’Europa Moderna”.The relation by Pacchi was titled Hobbes e la Bibbia, published in 1983 in Brescia. Concerning the growing interest of Pacchi about Hobbes and religion, see, besides, A. Pacchi, review of R. Polin, Hobbes, Dieu et les hommes (Paris, 1981), in “Rivista Critica di Storia della Filosofia”, XXXVIII, 1983, pp.233-237. In his analysis of the work of the French author, Pacchi, while acknowledging the fine sensibility of Polin, underscores the difficulty to generalize a method he looks upon with some suspicion. We can perceive here a shift in the interests of the Italian scholar toward the role of religion on the mature political philosophy of the author of Leviathan. In fact, Pacchi published shortly afterward, a contribution in homage to Mario Dal Pra titled Hobbes e il Dio delle cause.See La Storia della Filosofia come sapere critico. Studi offerti a Mario Dal Pra, Milano 1984, pp.295-307. During this time, Pacchi authored several works about Hobbs, including Filosofia e Teologia in Hobbes, Milan 1985. Hobbes e la Potenza di Dio, Sopra la volta del mondo. Onnipotenza e Potenza Assoluta di Dio tra Medioevo ed Età Moderna. Bergamo 1986, pp. 79-91. Hobbes e la Teologia, “Ragioni Critiche” IV, 1988, n.5-6, pp.36-41. Some Guidelines in Hobbes’ Theology,“Hobbes Studies”, II, 1989, pp.87-103. Hobbes and Biblical Philology in the Service of the State, in \\"Topoi\\", 7, 1988, pp.231-239. An Italian version of the same article was published in Antropologia biblica e pensiero moderno, Atti del Convegno Internazionale (Modena 15–17 September 1988). “Annali di Storia dell’Esegesi”, 7, 1990, pp.277-292. His last work, a set of introductory notes to each chapter of a new Italian translation of Leviathan,See Agostino Lupoli, Alcune note di Arrigo Pacchi e Bibliografia dei suoi scritti, in “ACME”, vol.XLV, 2, 1992, pp.105-119. was put abruptly to an end by his premature death.  Methodology  The method of research followed by Pacchi in his studies is described by Mario Dal Pra: \\"His research, from its beginnings, stands out for the attention to the great philosophical doctrines, resorting at the same time to philological methodology. [Pacchi] examined inedited sources and manuscripts, deriving from them new perspectives and new historical connections never considered before\\".M. Dal Pra, La morte di Arrigo Pacchi, cit., p.II: \\"La sua indagine si è subito distinta per il riferimento, da una parte, alle grandi correnti dottrinali, e, per l'altra, ad una accurata metodologia filologica, con l'esame di documenti e manoscritti inediti, dai quali trarre elementi precedentemente non considerati e rielaborazioni originali di derivazioni e di connessioni storiche.\\" Pacchi applied such a methodological approach to the history of philosophy in his review of Raymond Polin's book that criticized the value of religious faith on Hobbes’ conceptions.See A. Pacchi, Review of R. Polin, Hobbes, Dieu et les Hommes, in “Rivista Critica di Storia della Filosofia”, vol.38, 1983, n.2, pp.233-237. In the first place he praises how the French author connects Hobbes’ mechanical conception of nature to his political philosophy. In the same review, Pacchi showed some perplexity as to the “liberal” interpretation of that same philosophy. What Pacchi also insisted upon the need for the historian of philosophy to be “fair” to his sources. Pacchi emphasized the \\"fair\\" approach, when describing a logical fault in Polin’s conclusions: the French author cites the same sources and the same arguments, but reaches different conclusions.Pacchi, op.cit., p.236: “Ma qui il discorso si fa necessariamente metodologico: l’attribuzione di un discorso diverso al De Homine rispetto al De Corpore, pur in presenza di espressioni letteralmente molto simili, se non pressoché identiche, può sostenersi solo se si ritiene che in taluni casi sia lecito andare al di là del testo[…]. mediante quella lettura ‘tra le righe’ della quale Polin condanna giustamente l’uso ‘abusivo’ e ‘troppo facile’ che si fa ai nostri giorni […]”. == References  Bibliography == * Primary literature (compiled on the basis of the one published by Agostino Lupoli in his \\"Alcune note di Arrigo Pacchi e Bibliografia dei suoi scritti\\" in ACME, vol.XLV, II, 1992) 1\\\\.

The chapel was founded after an incident that took place on July 10, 1902 when two drunken sailors started throwing stones at a house near the bridge leading to Manoel island. One of the stones became stuck between the glass and an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in a small shrine on the wall of the house. Locals took this as a divine sign. The image and stone were carefully removed and preserved in the parish church of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Sliema. After some years the mage was returned to Gżira and a small chapel was built to house the image. On July 7, 1913 Archbishop Pietro Pace made the small chapel a vice-parish church serving the locals under the authority of the parish of Sliema.\\"Churches\\", Local Councils.

As a first-call studio guitarist and session musician, Ruppert has worked with a roster of top artist and commercial clients since the 1980s. He recorded guitar with Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, Phil Collins of Genesis, Chuck Mangione and Richie Havens. In conjunction with Electro-Harmonix, he has created a series of Effectology videos using effects pedals to imitate different instruments, recreate classic songs, and mimic real-life sounds. Working with Electro-Harmonix, Ruppert was one of the principle designers of the B9/C9 organ machines as well as the Key9 electric piano machine, Mel9 Mellotron emulator, Synth9 synth machine and Bass9 bass machine. Ruppert has also worked with the Kemper profiling amplifier company as a consultant and sound designer. == Life and career == Ruppert was born in Chicago, Illinois to Frances and Clyde Ruppert. Clyde Ruppert was a saxophonist who played in the Glenn Miller division of the Air Force Band during WWII and later touring the world with Guy Lombardo Orchestra and other popular big bands. Ruppert's grandfather played drums with a young Benny Goodman during Goodman's early years in Chicago. Growing up in a musical family, Ruppert focused his goals in that direction. After graduating from college, Bill taught guitar/music to grammar school and college students. By 1986, he was the first-call guitarist in the Chicago commercial studio scene. == Awards == Ruppert won a Clio Award in 1989 for his advertising music production role in the Durasoft Color Contacts commercial \\"Parachute\\" for Young & Rubicam, Chicago. == Effectology == In 2009, Ruppert began creating a video series called Effectology, in which he recreated extraordinary sounds with a regular electric guitar and Electro-Harmonix gear. Topics ranging from inventing Halloween sounds to re-creating Kraftwerk's 'Autobahn' to generating Caribbean steel drum effects are covered. Ruppert is currently working with the design team at Electro-Harmonix creating new effects for electric guitar. == Selected Discography == Ruppert played on hundreds of commercially released recordings and soundtracks.

Recorded with longtime collaborator Jørgen Træen in breaks between Sundfør's travels across the world, the album represents a departure from the synth-pop of Ten Love Songs (2015) in favor of a return to her roots as a folk singer- songwriter. The album received highly positive reviews from music critics, with some calling it her best work to date. It debuted at number one on the Norwegian album charts, making it her fourth consecutive album to achieve this feat. The album was supported by two singles, \\"Undercover\\" and \\"Mountaineers\\". The first was released as the album's lead single on 6 June, and the latter, which features American singer-songwriter John Grant, on 24 July. ==Background== Sundfør released her fourth studio album, Ten Love Songs, on 16 February 2015. The album showcased Sundfør experimenting with an electronic dance pop sound alongside textured orchestral arrangements. The album was considered to be Sundfør's international breakthrough, while also debuting at number one in Norway, receiving universal acclaim from music critics and appearing on various year-end lists. She later went on tour in promotion of the album. Sundfør has stated that after she finished the album she became ill, both physically and mentally: \\"I was getting flu all the time. Depression, anxiety. It's taken me a long time to get back again. I was wobbling and...I'm still struggling with it.\\" She believes this was partly a result of almost every aspect of the album's making, including production, composition, mixing and recording, which she mostly worked on by herself, but also as a result of the album's themes, \\"in which she delved into her own life to examine the links between extreme love and violent hatred.\\" It was shortly after when she began work on Music for People in Trouble. ==Writing and recording== In a November 2015 interview, Sundfør stated that she was working on the album, calling it \\"very cosmic\\" and added that a lot of the inspiration for it came from reading the book A Universe from Nothing. The album was mainly inspired by a journey Sundfør made, \\"travelling across continents to contrary environments and politically contrasting worlds from North Korea to the Amazon jungle.\\" She stated: \\"[The trips] made me focus on something other than myself; it made me curious and hungry for new impressions and new motives for my photography. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how it affected my music, but all experiences are potentially inspiring for creativity. I didn't travel to write; I traveled to take pictures, which to me is an important part of the album. that emptiness is the place where things start to grow. Most of the universe is empty. So, I'm not afraid of that anymore.\\" She said the album is about how \\"we are living in a time of great changes. Everything is moving so rapidly, sometimes violently, sometimes dauntingly. I think a lot of people experience anxiety these days. I wanted to address these emotions on the album.\\" She also cited American poet Robert Bly's 1980 anthology News of the Universe as one of the album's inspirations. Sundfør wrote most of the songs \\"in bed in Dalston, looking at foxes pooping in the garden\\", with an ease she hadn't experienced since her self-titled debut album (2007). She began writing all the \\"guitar songs\\" at home in London, while she later traveled to Los Angeles and wrote \\"Good Luck Bad Luck\\" and \\"No One Believes in Love Anymore\\". She then went back to London and wrote \\"Mountaineers\\", followed by \\"Bedtime Stories\\" at a cabin in Woodstock, with the final track she wrote for the album being \\"The Golden Age\\". Unlike the self-produced Ten Love Songs, which led her to depression, Sundfør decided not to try and do everything herself this time, and worked with longtime collaborator Jørgen Træen, which she thought \\"was a very good idea.\\" The recording of the album was completed in 2016 in Bergen. ==Music and lyrics== Music for People in Trouble represents a departure from the synth-heavy, \\"disco-infused prog\\" Ten Love Songs (2015), with a stripped back focus on Sundfør's \\"high, plangent\\" voice and acoustic guitar and piano. Sundfør explained this by being \\"tired of technology\\": \\"I wanted to feel like I was a musician again. But also, what I wanted to say needed something organic to convey it.\\" She called the album a return to her roots, whereas Ten Love Songs was \\"more of a detour.\\" Throughout the album, Sundfør's vocals are mostly accompanied only by piano or guitar, with occasional usage of samples and electronic textures which \\"take the songs into experimental territory,\\" such as \\"trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps,\\" inspired by Sundfør's travels from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest. Sundfør stated she wanted to \\"try and mix up some innocent romantic sounds with something very industrial and dry sounds.\\" The album has been described as Sundfør's most personal, affecting and poignant record yet. Characterized primarily as an art pop and folk album, Music for People in Trouble also incorporates jazz, ambient, chamber pop, country, drone and musique concrète. Sundfør co-produced the album with Jørgen Træen, who could contribute through his arrangements, \\"such as the sounds of an old lady in her apartment and a ticking grandfather clock on \\"Bedtime Story\\" or the spoken-word intro on \\"Music for People in Trouble\\".\\" Sundfør has cited several influences on this album, including Carole King, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, Elton John, Leonard Cohen, and alternative music. The Daily Telegraph described the album's subject matter as \\"dark, conflating a destructive personal relationship with environmental damage, heartbreak and climate change,\\" while also noting that it represents an almost complete about-turn from the shiny commercialism of Ten Love Songs. The Guardian called the album Sundfør's Biophilia moment. PopMatters noted the experimental sound of the album, and thought it resonates with the music of Jenny Hval. Songs and lyrical content The albums opens with the acoustic \\"Mantra\\", where Sundfør proclaims herself to be \\"as clever as a crow, as lucky as the moon, and as mighty as a shark.\\" Sundfør said \\"all the objects in the song often have ominous or negative connotations in history,\\" so she \\"wanted to give them a more positive meaning.\\" Evening Standard said Sundfør sings on the track \\"like she's haunted by Leonard Cohen.\\" On the second track \\"Reincarnation\\", which is the first she wrote for the album, Sundfør sings over an \\"achingly beautiful\\" slide guitar about disbelieving the news, questioning mortality and the nature of love. She stated she thinks the song is \\"more about light than about darkness.\\" \\"Good Luck Bad Luck\\" is a \\"resigned end-of-romance dirge\\" sung over folk guitar, piano, double bass and baritone sax, and ends with a slowed-down jazz break. The Guardian Harriet Gibsone said it is \\"like an Adele song, if Adele sung about oil spills to the sound of smoky, late-night jazz.\\" The next track, \\"The Sound of War\\" is a near eight- minute folk song that declares \\"chaos remains.\\" It features the lyric \\"the buzzing of the drones,\\" which appear later in the song, adding a \\"moody, cinematic soundscape.\\" The track begins \\"with the sound of a mountain stream and all manner of bird calls, it blossoms out into a modern madrigal, with lute-like guitar and Sundfør's voice restrained and husky. About halfway through, it falls away to leave a hellish, industrial synth drone, reminiscent of the textures of The Knife's Shaking The Habitual, or the ambient sound design of a David Lynch soundtrack.\\" Described as \\"an art installation-like interlude,\\" the \\"glitchy\\" title track begins with an echoing voice punctuated by bleeps (samples of Gesang der Jünglinge by Karlheinz Stockhausen) that recall sound effects from 80s sci-fi, and follows with a spoken passage from naturist Andres Roberts, in which he responds to the question: \\"What would you say to someone who has given up on life?\\" asked in an interview by Sundfør. Halfway through the song, a plucked acoustic guitar, later accompanied by a flute, carries the song to its conclusion. Tom Pinnock of Fopp said Sundfør embraces musique concrète on the track. The \\"spooky, meditative\\" track \\"Bedtime Story\\" contains \\"ambient footsteps, cell phone beeps, and wandering clarinet that highlight the cruel boredom of insomnia.\\" The Quietus described it as the album's \\"most lyrical moment: a sweeping fusion of piano and clarinet that recalls the heady, jazz-flecked adventuring of Joni Mitchell and her woodwind virtuoso Tom Scott on For the Roses.\\" The lead single \\"Undercover\\" is a country-tinged piano ballad that grows as the song progresses, and ends with climactic, \\"chilling vocals.\\" Sundfør has stated she was inspired by Dolly Parton when she wrote the song. The eighth track \\"No One Believes in Love Anymore\\" is a mournful piano ballad that is a \\"cynical loss of faith in romance.\\" \\"The Golden Age\\" is the last song Sundfør wrote for the album. It contains a \\"bleeping Moog melody\\" which The Irish Times described as \\"a gloriously avant garde moment.\\" The song is built on a simple arpeggio progression, and has hints of jazz, folk and electronica, although according to MusicOMH \\"its real roots lie with \\"Feed the Birds\\" from Mary Poppins, a song that not only deals with keeping the wildlife well fed, but also concerns social responsibility and empathy. For a song so delicate and gentle, there's a surprising amount going on here.\\" The album closes with \\"Mountaineers\\", a \\"gothically glittering\\" duet with American singer-songwriter John Grant, who \\"chants a tale of romantic breakdown and plane crashes over an ominous drone reminiscent of late-period Scott Walker.\\" The songs contain electronic textures and gospel influences within its church organ and soulful choir. ==Release and promotion== On 28 May, Sundfør started posting on Twitter every day a song title with a few of its lyrics in the order of the track listing until 6 June, when she announced the album's release. That same day, \\"Undercover\\" was released as the first single along with a pre-order of the album, which was originally scheduled for release on 25 August 2017. \\"Undercover\\" was supported by a radio edit, cutting the song to a length of 3:28. The album is her first to be released under Bella Union. It includes the song \\"Reincarnation\\", which Sundfør released in 2016. Tour dates in support of the album were later announced via her official website. On 24 July, \\"Mountaineers\\" featuring John Grant was released as the second single. On 18 August, Sundfør announced that the album's release date has been delayed to 8 September for CD and digital download and 29 September for vinyl release, due to \\"unforeseen circumstances.\\" On 21 August, \\"Mantra\\" was premiered on the BBC Radio 6 Music show, Jon Hillcock sits in. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on twelve reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In her review for the Guardian, Harriet Gibsone said the album is \\"another triumph for Sundfør, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects with lightness and majesty.\\" Claire Biddles from the Line of Best Fit said \\"Music for People in Trouble perhaps doesn't have the crossover appeal that Ten Love Songs had, and its head-on engagement with contemporary struggles will certainly not be for everyone. But for those who are done with escapism, at least for an hour or so, its sustained mood brings rich rewards.\\" writing for the Observer, Emily Mackay said, \\"as the album's title suggests, Sundfør wishes to pour oil on the choppy waters of a weary world, and the warm clarity of her voice offers beautiful moments of respite.\\" MusicOMHs Sam Shepherd stated that the album \\"will perhaps be a surprise for those who came to Sundfør via her last album, but they won't be disappointed. This is an album full of hidden depths, stark emotion, and most importantly, absolutely beautiful songs.\\" The Quietus Gary Kaill praised the album, saying Sundfør \\"turns experience into art with a painter's eye and a warrior's heart, and Music for People in Trouble is a profoundly humanist work: her finest by some distance.\\" Jennifer Gannon of the Irish Times said the album \\"is a sweeping, seductive cinematic slice of sorrow. It's not all brooding bombast, though: the pastoral folk of The Golden Age, with its bleeping Moog melody, gives it a touch of Wicker Man weirdness, a gloriously avant garde moment that leaks into the haunting finale of the John Grant duet Mountaineers, which soars to anthemic levels of beauty. This kind of sadness can truly be a blessing.\\" James Christopher Monger of AllMusic said the album \\"is rooted in empathy, and even at its most cynical – the woebegone \\"No One Believes in Love Anymore\\" comes to mind – the warmth of its core radiates outward.\\" Jonathan Wright from God Is in the TV said \\"Sundfør has followed perfection with an equally brilliant album. The sparse instrumentation and bleak lyrics are part of her captivating journey into new territories, where she continues to create enriching music. She does it all with no sign of compromising. Music for People in Trouble is another exceptional masterpiece from the best songwriter around.\\" Clashs Luke Winstanley wrote, \\"Music for People in Trouble takes more creative risks than its predecessor, and though this may deter some, it proves to be a decision that pays off. Far from diminishing the project, the end product is another outstanding record, executed with fearlessness and grace.\\" Spectrum Cultures John Paul praised the album, writing, \\"Music for People in Trouble is nothing short of a personal and professional triumph for Susanne Sundfør.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Music for People in Trouble. * Susanne Sundfør – vocals, production, grand piano, acoustic guitar, synthesizer, arrangements, programming, recording, creative direction, photography * Jørgen Træen – production, double bass, electric guitar, synthesizer, arrangements, programming, mixing, recording * John Grant – vocals * Jesse Chandler – flute, clarinet, alto clarinet * Jon Balke – grand piano * Gard Nilssen – drums, percussion * Frans Petter Eldh – double bass * Greg Leisz – pedal steel guitar * André Roligheten – saxophone * Megan Kovacs – kanklės * Erik Johan Bringsvor – acoustic guitar * Andres Roberts – spoken vocals * Lewis Sebastian Kay-Thatcher – spoken vocals * Iggy B – recording * Johnny Skalleberg – recording * Scott Petito – recording * Clay Schmitt – recording * Kåre Christoffer Vestrheim – recording * Greg Calbi – mastering * Luke Jarvis – layout, design ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2017) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - - - - } ==CertificationsRelease history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Region ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Various  8 September 2017  rowspan=\\"2\\" Bella Union   rowspan=\\"2\\" -  29 September 2017  LP } ==See also== * List of number-one albums in Norway ==ReferencesExternal links== * Music for People in Trouble at Bella Union * Category:2017 albums Category:Bella Union albums Category:Susanne Sundfør albums ","title":"Music for People in Trouble"},{"id":"54240538","text":"World on Fire is the twentieth studio album by Swedish virtuoso guitar player Yngwie Malmsteen and the eighth under this moniker.

The label has had multiple albums chart at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart, including Easy Star's Lonely Hearts Dub Band, two albums by The Green, and Vines by Passafire, who signed to the label in 2013.http://www.easystar.com/about In 2014 the label released albums by Rebelution,http://mtnweekly.com:80/music/album-review/dub-side-moon-special- anniversary-edition-album-review Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, Backbeat Soundsystem,/http://www.thepier.org:80/review-backbeat-soundsystem-together- not-apart New Kingston,http://www.thepier.org/new-kingston-signs-w-easy-star- records/ and The Expanders, whose June 2015 album Hustling Culture debuted at No. 1 on the Top Reggae Albums chart.

Eric Smith, a native New Yorker, studied political science and sociology at SUNY Albany, while maintaining his interest in live reggae and vinyl. He was also working as a news assistant on The New York Times’ Metro desk. Without any previous experience; Eric, Lem, Michael, and Remy gathered most of their savings -equating to about $5,000 per person, to start Easy Star Records.http://www.c-ville.com/Easy_Star_All_Stars_get_by_with_a_little_help_from_a_Lem/#.WUP_SxPysgF Eric states, \\"We had to start from scratch, but we methodically learned everything we could. We focused on the challenges at hand, rather than becoming overwhelmed by the scope of starting a business.” In 1997 Lem Oppenheimer moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, but stayed connected with the label, serving as an executive from a distance. == Founding Easy Star All- Stars == Michael Goldwasser, already a musician in the New York City reggae scene, brought together a number of musicians to work on original music that he had been working on. Goldwasser stated, \\"We wanted to be an original Jamaican reggae label, although not run by Jamaicans.\\" The label shortly started working with artists and producers with unreleased material mostly from the 1970s and 1980s and began reissuing tracks as well. The New York reggae and dub collective, Easy Star All-Stars, was then formed by the label co-founders in 1997. With a rotating roster of musicians, the band originally functioned as a studio band for the label's earliest recordings, however only beginning to tour in 2003. Early on, the Easy Star All-Stars would play around New York City backing up Jamaican artists, including Sugar Minott and Johnny Osbourne. The band also put on tribute shows to artists such as Augustus Pablo, Dennis Brown, and Jackie Mittoo.http://www.mahala.co.za/culture/covered-in-dub/ To note, not all of the co-founders were musically involved in the band; Oppenheimer, for example, remained VP of the label and not a touring member.http://spectrumculture.com/2012/09/19/interview-michael-goldwasser-of- easy-star-records/ Michael Goldwasser serves as the group's original composer and \\"unofficial creative director,\\" playing various instruments on their releases and writing the adaptations before the band goes on tour.http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/blog/culture/interview-michael- goldwasser-and-the-easy-star-all-stars/ ==1997–2002: Easy Star Records' Early releases== Easy Star Records released several singles on 7\\" vinyl, including \\"Time Has Come,\\" the first single by Ossie Dellimore, in 1997. Dellimore, a roots reggae singer based in Brooklyn, performed locally for several years before recording with the Easy Star All-Stars. After 1997, the label ceased releasing singles, instead focusing on EPs and LPs. In January 1998, Easy Star Records released its first compilation, Easy Star Volume One, which included covers by the Easy Star All-Stars and guest performers such as MC Trouble, Rob Symeonn, Gary Pine, Sister Carol, Sluggy Ranks, Ranking Joe, The Meditations, and Sugar Minott.http://www.allmusic.com:80/album/easy-star- vol-1-mw0000041759 Among the songs were Dellimore's previous single, \\"Time Has Come,\\" and other singles the label already released on 7\\"./https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0313331588 AllMusic called the album an \\"exceptionally good collection of reggae singles...Although all of the tracks benefit from state-of-the-art production technology, the singing and playing are all reminiscent of the late '70s and early '80s, the period when Rastafarian-themed roots reggae was ceding ground to the slicker and more secular dancehall styles.\\" Also giving it 4/5 stars with a positive review. Regarding the album's production, \\"The prime mover behind this album is producer Michael G, who provides all the rhythms and a virtuosic touch at the mixing board.\\" ==1999–2002== On February 9, 1999 Easy Star Records came out with Ghetto Knowledge by The Meditations, a reggae vocal harmony group from Jamaica and the second release on the label. AllMusic describes Ghetto Knowledge as \\"a match made in heaven: the Meditations, a roots harmony trio that has maintained the same style and lineup since the early 1970s, and Easy Star Records, a label devoted to releasing modern roots reggae that partakes of the spirit and flavor of reggae's classical period while taking advantage of 21st century recording technology.\\" http://www.allmusic.com/album/ghetto-knowledge-mw0000231509 Almost nine months later, the label released Sugar Minott's compilation album, Hidden Treasures Vol. 1. In 2000, the label started releasing 7\\" vinyl again, with over ten singles alone in that year by artists including singer Luciano, Jamaican deejays Anthony B and Triston Palma, and The Meditations. The label also released three full-length albums that year, with the first being the March reissue of Ghetto-ology, a 1979 album by singer and producer Sugar Minott. In October of that year, the label released Sugar Minott's compilation, Hidden Treasures Vol. 2, followed in November by Jamaican deejay Tristan Palma's album, Two Roads. In February 2001, the label saw the release of All I Have Is Love; a compilation album and the label's seventh release.http://www.discogs.com/label/21661-Easy-Star-Records The original album included artist record remakes of classic Studio One songs produced by Sister Carol. It was received positively by critics such as Stephen Cook of AllMusic, who called it \\"successful look back at the music before the digital hegemony of dancehall and ragga.\\" http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-i-have-is- love-mw0000003929 In August 2001, Sugar Minott released Rare Gems, his second release on Easy Star Records. Want Some Freedom by The African Brothers was then released in September 2001, with only two albums released in 2002: Easy Star Vol. 2 Dancehall Culture, and the compilation album Can't Stop Us Now. ==2003: Dub Side of the Moon== Several years after Can't Stop Us Now, the label released one album annually.https://www.discogs.com/label/21661-Easy- Star-Records On February 18, 2003, the Easy Star All-Stars released Dub Side of the Moon, a reggae reinterpretation of Pink Floyd's classic The Dark Side of the Moon. Dollarman, Corey Harris, Frankie Paul, The Meditations, and Ranking Joe were among the performers.http://www.allmusic.com:80/album/dub- side-of-the-moon-mw0000593574 The Easy Star All-Stars \\"hit the ground running in 2003 with the Pink Floyd tribute Dub Side Of The Moon, [and] ...followed that up with regular three-year installments: first came Radiodread, a spacious tip of the hat to Radiohead's OK Computer, before Easy Star's Lonely Hearts Dub Band and Easy Star's Thrillah – a Jamaican-infused take on Michael Jackson's world sales-record album.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/features/benjamin-gibbard-teenage-fanclub-bandwagonesque- django-bates-frankfurt-radio-big-band-sgt-peppers-a7860466.html AllMusic gave 'Dub Side of the Moon a positive review, stating \\"dub's psychedelic mysticism is a perfectly good match for Pink Floyd's mannered weirdness.\\" Dub Side of the Moon stayed on the Billboard Reggae Charts for several years after its release in 2003. After its release. there was \\"a great demand for live renditions of the album all over the world,\\" and the label put together a touring group which has been on the road since 2003. The Easy Star All-Stars were also coined as the trendsetter for cover albums taking off; the Independent states, \\"The concept only began to take off in the early Noughties, thanks partly to the genius of New York-based reggae outfit The Easy Star All Stars, who have recorded some of the most accomplished and inspired cover albums.\\" Despite the frequent pop song covers, Easy Star co- founder and executive producer Eric Smith has stated \\"There is a lot of suffering and pain in reggae. It's a struggler's, it's a sufferer's music. The casual fan sees reggae as a summer, spring-break-type music, and that's really far from what it's about. We like some of the darker areas of reggae, and one of our concerns with combining [reggae and Dark Side of the Moon], was we'd have a really, really dark album on our hands.\\" https://www.villagevoice.com/2006/06/13/my-irie-lung/ ==2005–2008: EPs== The label had no releases in 2003 or 2004.

Unlike their previous albums, this album consists of mostly non-cover material, except for \\"Dubbing Up the Walls,\\" a cover of the Radiohead song \\"Climbing Up the Walls.\\" ==Marketing and events== The label previously organized Easy Star Reggae Tuesdays, a long- running reggae party in New York.

Caulton is an inorganic chemist who works on, and has made significant contributions to, projects dealing with transition metal hydrides. He is currently Distinguished Professor at Indiana University. Specifically, Caulton has worked on the chemistry of paramagnetic organometallic complexes, metal polyhydride complexes and the dihydrogen ligand, catalytic activation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and alkoxide chemistry. Caulton's work with transition metal complexes is ultimately aimed to create complexes that exhibit unexpected and novel reactivities. Caulton received his B.S. degree from Carleton College in Minnesota. Following his undergraduate degree, he worked under Richard Fenske at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he studied transition metal bonding with various computational methods dealing with molecular orbital theory. Caulton then worked with Alfred Cotton at MIT, where he continued to study transition metal bonding. == Research ==  Ruthenium Complexes  Upon dissociation of phosphine, RuCl2L3 equilibrates with the dimer species [RuCl2L2]2. Caulton's early work on RuCl2L3 complexes provided an important contribution to the class of compounds molecule which would later become the primary precursor for Grubbs olefin metathesis catalysts.Nguyen, S. T., Johnson, L. K., Grubbs, R. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 3974-3975., Schwab, P., Ziller, J. W., Grubbs R. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 100-110., Schwab, P., France, M. B., Ziller, J. W. and Grubbs, R. H., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1995, 34, 2039–2041. Caulton performed early studies on the structure and dynamics of RuCl2L3 and RuCl2L4 (L = PPh3) in solution. Caulton concluded the dissociation of a phosphine from RuCl2L4 in solution can be significant.Hoffman, P.R., Caulton, K.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97 (15), 4221-4228. Previously, the structure of RuCl2L3 had been shown to be square pyramidal.La Placa, S. A., Ibers, J. A. Inorg. Chem., 1965, 4 (6), 778–783. Caulton further demonstrated that RuCl2L3 species dissociate phosphine in some organic solvents, and ultimately equilibrate with the dimer species [RuCl2L2]2. The dimer consists of a halogen bridge between the two square pyramidal structures.  Transition Metal Hydride Complex  Diagram of phototransient rhenium complex after light excitation with(right) and without(left) polyolefins present Caulton has dedicated much of his career into studying transition metal hydride complexes. Specifically, Caulton has looked at the dynamics of hydrogen, hydrides and the dihydrogen ligand and their relations to transition metal catalysis. In catalysis design, the most reactive species are often short lived and unstable. Much work has been done to better understand how to stabilize these compounds. Caulton has specifically worked on stabilizing a rhenium polyhydride. Caulton and his colleagues showed polyolefin-cyclooctatetracene can trap a phototransient intermediate of rhenium polyhydrides. This phototransient species, which is formed from excitation from light, is highly reactive, where the initial rhenium complex is not. If you could trap the highly reactive, short-lived state, then you can make a much more efficient catalyst. The end result of this was they were able to determine that the reason for this trapping of the phototransient intermediate was a result of the intramolecular hydrogen transfers and the unusual rigidity of the rhenium complex.Caulton, K. G., Huffman, J. C., Green, M. A., Trimarchi, M. C. L.. ”Photoinitiated Intramolecular Hydrogen Transfer from Rhenium Polyhydrides to C8 Cyclopolyolefins”. Organometallics. 4(3). 1985. 514-519.  Recent work  (PNP)Ni molecule In recent years, Caulton worked on studying the reactions of small typically inert molecules with metal complexes. Notably, he synthesized a nickel complex, (PNP)Ni, and using it to cleave the C=O bond in CO2. The nickel in this complex draws significance from its d9 configuration, which is similar to Cu(II), but is a stronger reducing agent. The T-shaped geometry and low coordination number of this complex suggested it would be a good reducing agent. However, Caulton's research has shown that, in spite of the one- electron reducing power of Ni, the Nickel reacts more as an amide nucleophile than as a reducing agent.Fullmer, B. C.; Fan, H.; Pink, M.; Caulton, K. G.. \\"O/C Bond Cleavage of CO2 by Ni,\\" Inorganic Chemistry, v.47, 2008, p. 1865. Furthermore, he investigated the reaction of the same complex (PNP)Ni with a hydride group attached. This study was aimed at analyzing which ligand, the amide nitrogen or the hydride, would undergo reaction with CO2. After using NMR spectroscopy to analyze the data, it was determined that the hydride ligand is inactive with CO2. However, this ligand weakens the Ni-N bond, thus increasing the nucleophilicity of the amide group.Laird, M. F.; Pink, M.; Tsvetkov, N.

Brocklebank) was an English shipping line that operated during the 19th and 20th centuries. Daniel Brocklebank founded a shipyard in Whitehaven in 1785, and expanded in the following years into operating ships. Following Brocklebank's death in 1801, his sons Thomas and John took over the business, which was incorporated as Thomas and John Brocklebank. The line expanded steadily in the first half of the 1800s, opening routes to South America by 1809, India in 1815 following the end of the East India Company's monopoly, and China in 1829. The line's operations were based out of Liverpool and run by Thomas Brocklebank, while John ran the Whitehaven shipyard until his death in 1831. The next generation of Brocklebanks, Thomas Jr. and Ralph, became partners in the business in 1843, and the following year the line reached its peak with a fleet of fifty ships. In 1865, the shipyard at Whitehaven closed, with most of the line's subsequent ships built at Harland & Wolff. In 1911, the Brocklebank family gave up full control of the company, when Sir Percy, Frederic and Denis Bates --descendants of shipping magnate Sir Edward Bates--acquired a stake in the line. In 1912, the Anchor Line, a Cunard Line subsidiary, took a controlling interest in Brocklebank. In 1916, Brocklebank purchased the Wells Line, and came under the control of Cunard in 1919 when the latter purchased the entirety of the Brocklebank and Bates families' shares. After retraction during the 1930s, Cunard purchased the remaining outstanding Brocklebank stock in 1940, and while the line lost the majority of its ships during World War II, it rebuilt following the war. In 1967, a Cunard restructuring led to a renamed Cunard Brocklebank Line taking over all of Cunard's cargo traffic. Cunard suffered financially in the following years, however, and the freight business was eventually shuttered, with the last Brocklebank-flagged ships sold in 1983. ==References== Category:1801 establishments in England Category:1983 disestablishments in England Category:Shipping companies of England Category:Cunard Line Category:Defunct shipping companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Brocklebank Line"},{"id":"54240786","text":"Howard Kane (born Howard Kirchembaum, 1945), also known as Howie Kane was a member of Jay and the Americans.

MIH is considered a worldwide problem and usually occurs in children under 10 years old. This developmental condition is caused by the lack of mineralisation of enamel during its maturation phase, due to interruption to the function of ameloblasts. Many factors have been suggested, such as genetics and medical problems during pregnancy, but only childhood illness, fever in particular, seems to be associated with MIH. However, further studies on the aetiology of MIH are required because it is believed to be multifactorial. MIH often presents as discolouration on one to four affected permanent molars and the associated incisors. The enamel of the affected teeth appears yellow, brown, cream or white and thus are sometimes referred to as ‘cheese molars’. These teeth are deemed less aesthetically pleasing, hence causing distress in children with MIH and their parents. It is important to note that although there is difference in enamel translucency in the affected teeth, there should not be any changes to the enamel thickness, unlike in enamel hypoplasia. As a consequence, children with MIH are more likely to experience tooth decay compared to those without the condition. Moreover, the development of tooth decay is very rapid due to the less mineralised enamel. MIH only becomes visible once the permanent molars start to erupt and that is when opacities on the tooth can be observed if it is affected. It will be useful for the children who are suspected to suffer from MIH to visit their dentist more frequently during the eruption of their first permanent molars to prevent any further complications affecting their oral health. == Signs and symptoms == The distribution of disease in those affected with MIH can vary greatly. It can be common for the enamel of one molar to be affected while the enamel of the contralateral molar is clinically unaffected, or with minor defects only.  Lesions  The lesions that appear in teeth affected with MIH can present as opacities that vary from white to yellow- brown. They are usually asymmetrical in appearance, with a sharp demarcation that distinguishes between normal and affected enamel. The lesions usually do not involve the cervical third of affected teeth.  Post-eruptive breakdown  Post-eruptive breakdown (PEB) is a clinical feature, often observed in the majority of severely affected cases. The rate of PEB may be increased by the loading of masticatory forces on enamel weakened by MIH. The lesions resulting from PEB are irregularly shaped, with rough margins from the shearing of the enamel. PEB is more likely to occur in MIH affected teeth with yellow or brown opacities rather than those with white opacities, as darker lesions reflect a greater deficit in mineral content.  Atypical caries  Teeth affected with MIH are at an increased risk of acquiring dental caries. This is because the properties of the enamel are altered by increased porosity and decreased hardness. Essentially, the balance between mineralisation and demineralisation shifts to favour demineralisation of enamel, giving the tooth less resilience in structure, thereby making it vulnerable to caries. The poor structural properties of the enamel in teeth with MIH also increase the likelihood of cavitation of any lesions, thereby causing the lesion to progress at a faster rate. Progression of the carious lesion is also more rapid in teeth with MIH as patients may experience tooth sensitivity while carrying out oral hygiene, causing them to avoid doing so and consequentially accelerating the decay.  Hypersensitivity  Teeth affected by MIH are often affected by hypersensitivity due to changes in temperature or toothbrushing. A study has suggested that a possible cause of hypersensitivity in MIH is the inflammatory reactions in the pulp due to oral bacteria penetrating through the hypomineralised enamel into the dentinal tubules.  Difficult to anaesthetise  It has been reported that MIH-affected teeth were more difficult to anaesthetise. Difficulty achieving anaesthesia in MIH- affected teeth may be caused by the chronic inflammation of the pulp due to the penetration of bacteria as the presence of inflammation can reduce the efficacy of local anaesthetics which may then result in more anaesthetic being given to achieve anaesthesia. Some dental treatment has been undertaken without local anaesthesia which could result in a child becoming more fearful and anxious when receiving dental treatment. This can be especially challenging in paediatric dentistry thus more specialised methods may be needed to increase the efficiency of anaesthetising teeth. Opacities due to MIH can be quite visible especially on anterior teeth which could present as a problem aesthetically. Patients frequently claim aesthetic discomfort when anterior teeth are involved. The discoloured appearance of the anterior teeth could also have negative effects on a child’s psychological development and self-esteem.  Tooth breakdown and restoration problems  MIH-affected teeth are more prone to breakdown as they are hypomineralised which weakens the enamel structure. Restorations placed on MIH-affected teeth were found to be more prone to failure due to both loss of tooth structure and material loss. The enamel can also fracture more easily due to chewing forces. == Causes == The exact cause of MIH is unknown but thought to be multifactorial. Pre-natally: risks, such as infection, maternal psychological stress and frequent exposure to ultrasonic scans were all correlated with increased risks of MIH. During the perinatal stage, Pitiphat found that cesarean section and complications during vaginal delivery could contribute to an increased chance of MIH. Children born preterm and those with poor general health or systemic conditions in their first 3 years of development also run a higher risk of developing MIH. It has also been proposed that developmental dental defects were associated with long-term breastfeeding due to exposure to dioxin. More recent evidence has suggested a relationship between respiratory diseases and oxygen shortage of the ameloblasts and MIH. Lastly oxygen shortage combined with low birth weight is suspected to be a contributing factor ==Diagnosis==  Differential diagnosis  It is essential to exclude other causes of enamel opacities, differentiating MIH from them, to ensure an appropriate treatment plan is made. These conditions include: * Dental caries, which is the most common cause of destruction of dental hard tissues. This is more unlikely in a patient with a previously intact primary dentition. White spot lesions are also uncommon on incisors, hence ruling out dental caries. * Fluorosis, which can result from an intake of a high fluoride concentration while the tooth is still undergoing mineralisation. Fluorosis presents as irregular, diffuse enamel opacities which affect more than 1 tooth, in contrast to the well-demarcated borders of hypomineralised enamel seen in MIH. * Amelogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition, and thus there may be a history of similar defects in other family members. This condition affects both the primary and permanent dentition, and all surfaces tend to be equally affected, differentiating it from MIH. * Trauma to primary incisors resulting in discolouration of permanent incisors. * Administration of tetracycline during pregnancy and to children under 6 resulting in tooth staining (grey or yellow). * Enamel hypoplasia, caused by defective enamel matrix formation, is a quantitative defect which presents as a localised reduction in enamel thickness. This differs from hypomineralisation, which is a qualitative defect affecting the translucency of enamel.  Classification  MIH examination should be carried out on clean, wet teeth. The ideal age for examination is when the child is 8 years old - the age where all permanent first molars and most of the incisors are erupted. The permanent first molar will also still be in a comparatively sound condition without excessive post-eruption breakdown. Judgements of each individual teeth should be recorded, aiding the correct diagnosis of the condition. There is currently a lack of standardisation in the scoring system and severity indices used to record the diagnosis of MIH. Various systems commonly employed in studies include: * Modified Defect of Dental Enamel (DDE) Index: This set of criteria allows for enamel defects to be detected, enabling a distinction between demarcated and diffused opacities. * European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (EAPD) judgement criteria: This set of criteria was developed in 2003 to standardise classifications for use in epidemiological studies. However, while it allows the categorisation of the enamel condition, it does not address the severity of the enamel condition. * Molar Hypomineralisation Severity Index (MHSI): This set of criteria has been developed to address deficiencies in indices concerning the severity of hypomineralisation. It is based on both the clinical characteristics of hypomineralised defects and the EAPD judgement criteria. It was found to be effective in guiding the clinical management of children by predicting treatment undertaken for affected permanent first molars. == Prevention == Prevention is of prior importance at an early developmental age as the defective tooth is more likely to have caries and post-eruptive breakdown due to its increased porosity. Appropriate dietary advice and toothpaste with a fluoride level of at least 1,000 ppm F should be recommended. For treating spontaneous hypersensitivity professional applications of fluoride varnish (e.g. Duraphat 22,600ppm F) or 0.4% stannous fluoride gel may be helpful. Casein Phosphopepetide-Amorphus Calcium Phosphate (CPP-ACP) provides a supersaturated environment of calcium and phosphate on the enamel surface to enhance remineralisation in the form of toothpaste or sugar free chewing gum. Its clinical effectiveness is still debatable but may benefit those patients who complain of mild pain to external stimuli. == Treatment == The frequency of first permanent molar treatment for children with MIH is nearly 10 times greater compared to children without MIH. The available treatment modalities for MIH is extensive but the decision on which treatment should be used is complex and multi-factorial. Factors may include: condition severity, the patient’s dental age, the child/parent’s social background and expectations. There are treatment modalities available to manage children affected by MIH; however, the evidence supporting these modalities are still weak.  Anterior teeth   Etch-bleach-seal technique  Involves repeated cycles of etching with 37% phosphoric acid followed by applying 5% sodium hypochlorite until improvement of discolouration is achieved. Clear resin composite or resin infiltrate can be used to seal the lesion after the technique.  Microabrasion  This image shows a dental veneer, usually used to improve aesthetics of teeth. The aesthetics of a child’s anterior teeth is a concern for both children and their parents alike. Yellow or brownish-yellow defects are of full thickness, and therefore may respond to bleaching with carbamide peroxide. However, careful consideration should be made of the risks including hypersensitivity, mucosal irritation and enamel surface alterations. Creamy- yellow or whitish-creamy defects are less porous and variable in depth, and may respond to microabrasion with 18% hydrochloric acid or 37.5% phosphoric acid and abrasive paste. Again, this should be undertaken cautiously as microabrasion may result in loss of enamel.  Veneers  Direct or indirect composite veneers can be effective in improving aesthetics with minimal tooth tissue removal. Ceramic veneers as a treatment option should be delayed due to the risks of resulting in a short clinical crown height, immature tooth pulp irritation and also the instability of the gingival margins during the eruption of teeth.  Posterior teeth   Fissure sealants  The placement of fissure sealants on permanent molars without post-eruptive breakdown should be undertaken. Use of a 5th generation bonding adhesive prior to fissure sealant application may improve retention rates of fissure sealants. For partially erupted molars with inadequate moisture control, glass ionomer cements (GIC) can be considered as an interim treatment option. As the retention rate of GIC is often poor, replacement with a resin- based fissure sealant is recommended following tooth eruption. Resin-based fissure sealants can be beneficial to patients affected with mild MIH where the first permanent molars have fully erupted, although the degree of hypomineralization affects the bond strength of said sealants. The bond strength of resin based fissure sealants to affected MIH can be enhanced by pre-treating with 5% sodium hypochlorite for one minute after etching, and applying a bonding agent. However, more evidence is needed from clinical based studies.  Direct restorations  = Cavity design = There is still much debate of whether margin extension should include removal of all defective enamel or only the porous enamel. The former provides sound enamel for bonding but leads to excessive tooth tissue loss. The latter is less invasive, but the margins may have a high risk of breakdown due to defective bonding. Yet, it is agreed that adhesive restorations should be used as opposed to those reliant upon mechanical retention (such as amalgam). = Composite resin restorations = Composite resin material has been shown to have longer-term stability in MIH teeth, with a median survival rate of 5.2 years and a success rate of 74%-100% during a 4-year follow-up period. Self- etching adhesive was found to have better bond strength to enamel affected by MIH compared to total etch single-bottle adhesive. The use of composite should be considered both for permanent molars affected by MIH, as well as incisors. Furthermore, composite veneers may achieve a better aesthetic result where deep lesions are seen in incisors. = Glass ionomer cement (GIC) restorations = GIC materials have adhesive capabilities with both enamel and dentine, long-term fluoride release and hydrophilicity when there is inadequate moisture control intra-orally, during early post-eruptive stages. However, GIC’s poorer mechanical properties suggest avoidance in stress- bearing areas. In later post-eruptive stages GIC may be valuable as sub-layer beneath composite restorations.  Indirect restorations  = Preformed metal crowns = Pre-formed metal crowns (PMC), also known as stainless steel crowns, can be used to reduce the risk of marginal breakdown, coronal leakage and has a good longevity. The use of preformed metal crowns on MIH-affected molars can prevent further tooth loss, control hypersensitivity and aim to establish correct interproximal and occlusal contact. They are relatively inexpensive and require little preparation. To prevent further tooth preparation and tissue loss, use of the Hall Technique should also be considered. There advantage is use during any stage of post-eruptive breakdown, but evidence of their efficacy is limited. Although the PMC has evidence to show that it is well accepted, a few of the children and their carers expressed their concerns about the metallic appearances of the restoration. = Cast restorations = Cast restorations may include full coverage crowns for MIH-affected permanent teeth. Generally cast restorations requiring tooth preparation are not recommended in young children due to large pulp size, short crown height and potential difficulties in obtaining a good impression for subgingival crown margins.  Extractions  Tooth extraction is one of the treatment options for MIH, especially for symptomatic cases. A list of considerations can affect the final decision on whether extraction of the affected teeth should be carried out or should it be retained such as: severity of MIH; patient’s aesthetic expectations; whether the patient is suitable to undergo orthodontic treatment; orthodontic concerns (e.g. crowding, facial profile, missing or supernumerary teeth, presence of third molars).Leen A, \\"The interrelationship between molar hypomineralisation and orthodontics [Thesis],\\" The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, 2013. Timely extractions are often the preferred treatment plan for first permanent molars that are severely affected and symptomatic. The facilitation of eruption of the second permanent molars to the space of the first permanent molar removes the burden of continuous restorative treatment. A favourable occlusion may be acquired following a well-planned treatment and this eliminates the need for fixed orthodontic appliances therapy. However, a comprehensive discussion of the possible need of orthodontic sequelae and treatment is important. Favorable eruption position of the second permanent molar may result if the first permanent molar is extracted when the child is at the age of between 8–10 years old. This is when the crown formation of the second permanent molar is complete and the mineralization of the bifurcation is commenced. Extraction of first permanent molars before 8 years old increases the chances of the unerupted second permanent premolar drifting distally. Extraction after the age of 10 years reduces the likelihood of the mesial movement of the second permanent molar in to the first permanent molar space and may result in tilting of the second permanent molar. == Epidemiology == Since first recognised in the late 1970s, the condition has puzzled many people. It is thought to be a unique defect unlike other enamel disturbances e.g. fluorosis or amelogenesis imperfecta. Many prevalence studies have now been published from findings across the globe. However, there is a large amount of variation across the results of these studies. It is reported that the prevalence of MIH ranges from 3.6% to 40.2% with an estimate of 14.2% of the global population suffering. Worldwide there is much variation between continents with South America having the highest prevalence (18%), closely followed by Oceania (16.3%). The continent found to have least sufferers was Africa (10.9%). Multiple studies have provided evidence that there is no gender difference. However, a study by Kathmandu University reports that post eruptive breakdown occurs more frequently in boys than it does in girls. A different study found that children under the age of 10 are more highly affected by the disease (15.1%) compared to older children (12.1%). ==References== Category:Teeth ","title":"Molar incisor hypomineralisation"},{"id":"54240820","text":"Jammura is a village in Kalikapur Union in Chauddagram Upazila of Comilla District in the Division of Chittagong, Bangladesh. ==References== Category:Villages in Comilla District Category:Villages in Chittagong Division ","title":"Jammura"},{"id":"54240823","text":"A view of the International Smelter near Tooele, Utah facing east towards the Oquirrh Mountains taken in August 1972, shortly after the facility shut down. The International Smelting and Refining Company was a subsidiary of Anaconda Copper which operated primarily out of the International Smelter near Tooele, Utah. The International Smelter began operation in 1910 as a copper producer handling ores from Bingham Canyon and was expanded into a lead smelting operation in 1912. Copper smelting finished at International in 1946, and the lead smelter shut down in January 1972. The closure of the smelter would lead to the associated Tooele Valley Railway (which had their primary railyards at the smelter) to be shut down ten years later in 1982. The company also handled several other Anaconda owned interests. After the shut down of several of the International Smelting sites, environmental reclamation has been performed by Anaconda Copper's successor company ARCO and the EPA Superfund program. ==History== Interest in constructing a smelter outside of Tooele was begun by the Utah Consolidated Mining Company in the early 1900s due to the \\"James Godfrey et al. v. American Smelting and Refining Company et al.\\" lawsuit, which shut down several of the smelters operating in the Murray, Utah area due to air pollution concerns.http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/thesaltlakevalleysmelterwar.html While several of the largest smelters in the area such as the ASARCO smelter in Murray were able to settle out of court, many of the smaller smelters such as the Utah Consolidated and Highland Boy shut down due to the court ruling. The mine and smelter owners who were affected by the lawsuit began to search for a new smelter site away from the populous Salt Lake Valley. A prime site was found in Tooele on the western slope of the Oquirrh Mountains which was isolated from the growing Salt Lake Valley, had strong headwinds which it was hoped would take most of the pollution up into the nearby Pine Canyon instead of towards nearby Tooele City, and was located close to the rapidly growing Bingham mining district. After negotiations to smelt the Highland Boy ores at the ASARCO copper smelter at Garfield, Utah fell through, Utah Consolidated pushed for the founding of the International Smelting and Refining Co. which was formally founded on December 1, 1908 in New Jersey. Corporate offices for the company would at one point be located in New York City http://utahrails.net/mining/smelters-tooele.php#timeline The Tooele Valley Railway which was built to serve the smelter construction and operation had been chartered in Utah on November 18, 1908.http://utahrails.net/utahrails/tooele-valley.php The administrative offices at the International Smelter site in Tooele. This building would survive long past the demolition of the smelter being used as offices for the nearby Carr Fork Mine, before being finally demolished in the mid 1980s. Construction on the smelter began on December 9, 1908 several days after the formal foundation of the company. Among the founders of the new smelter were mining moguls John D. Ryan (mining) and Thomas F. Cole who would eventually bring the company under the control of Anaconda Copper. In 1909 the company purchased the Raritan Copper Works a copper refinery in New Jersey which would eventually process most of the product produced in Tooele and Anaconda's smelter in Butte, Montana (some sources state though the Raritan-International merger didn't take place until 1934).Info on Google Books The copper smelter in Tooele opened in 1910, with an aerial tramway having been built to bring ores in from the Bingham Canyon mining district.https://donstrack.smugmug.com/UtahRails/Bingham-Canyon/Aerial- Tramways/ In 1911 the decision was made to construct a lead smelter as an addition to the Tooele site, which opened in 1912. The 1910 Mexican Revolution caused several Arizona mines to begin shipping their ores to the Tooele Smelter since the conflict cut off access to the Cananea, Mexico smelter. In response by 1913 work began in Miami, Arizona to construct a new International Smelting plant.https://tucson.com/news/local/mining-in-globe-miami-area- marked-by-innovation/article_7b90b42e-8946-5fe8-9293-2be97f7002db.html The International Smelter in Miami was designed by Louis D. Ricketts to process the local copper ore. By 1915 the new Arizona smelter began production.http://www.mininghihttps://tucson.com/news/local/mining-in-globe- miami-area-marked-by- innovation/article_7b90b42e-8946-5fe8-9293-2be97f7002db.htmlstoryassociation.org/Globe.htm The smelter was designed with efficiency in mind, and proved to be one of the most successful smelters in the region. Freeport-McMoRan continues to operate a smelter at this site in the present day.http://tucson.com/news/local/mining- in-globe-miami-area-marked-by- innovation/article_7b90b42e-8946-5fe8-9293-2be97f7002db.html An overhead view of Miami, Arizona in 1944. Smoke from the International Smelting operation in the city can be clearly seen in the background coming from the site's smokestack In 1914 the Anaconda Copper group bought full ownership of International Smelting Company.https://www.bizapedia.com/mt/international- smelting-and-refining-company.html The assets of the International Smelting Co. at the time included in addition to the Tooele operations, International Lead Refining Co. in East Chicago, Indiana, the Arizona smelter, the Raritan works and the associated Raritan Terminal and Transportation Co. The International Smelting and Refining Company was re-founded in Montana upon the completion of the complete Anaconda purchase. By the 1920s the Tooele operation had become a custom smelter, processing ores from mines across the intermountain west. A large fire on May 9, 1942 destroyed the Tooele smelter's labs, machine shop, and the Tooele Valley Railway's locomotive works; all of which were rebuilt anew a short time later.Penrod, Emma \\"Tooele Valley Railway\\". Arcadia Publishing, 2013, p.114 The interior of the ore crusher at the International Smelting and Refining Company site near Battle Mountain, Nevada By 1937 the National Tunnel and Mines Company began construction of the Elton Tunnel to replace the tramway connecting the Apex Mine and Utah Delaware Mine in Bingham Canyon with the smelter. The tunnel was named after J.O. Elton the General Manager of the International Smelter who conducted the ground breaking ceremony. By 1940 the National Tunnel and Mines Company was considered a subsidiary of majority owner Anaconda Copper.http://utahrails.net/bingham/national-tunnel-mines.php The tunnel was completed by 1941.https://plus.google.com/+GoldrushexpeditionsInc/posts/aQ3eaXobB4A Expectations were that the tunnel would provide increased production at the smelter, and many Tooele locals celebrated the new tunnel with a local \\"Tunnel Days\\" festival.http://www.tooelepioneermuseum.org/images/2015011006.jpg An electric narrow gauge railroad system ran through the tunnel, and interchanged with the Tooele Valley Railway at the surface portal.https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=575304&page;=2&q;=Tunnel&facet;_setname_s=(dha_awg%20OR%20dha_alwmc%20OR%20dha_cbfm%20OR%20dha_ccc%20OR%20dha_cccook%20dha_ccmu%20OR%20dha_ce%20OR%20dha_cp%20OR%20dha_crscpc%20OR%20dha_crvs%20OR%20dha_drgpl%20OR%20dha_ersp%20OR%20dha_goc%20OR%20dha_gmo%20OR%20dha_grcc%20OR%20dha_hill%20OR%20dha_jppc%20OR%20dha_kdfc%20OR%20dha_kued_trc%20OR%20dha_mmupc%20OR%20dha_obl%20OR%20dha_oddtwr%20OR%20dha_olyleg%20OR%20dha_rkc%20OR%20dha_ptfttc%20OR%20dha_pu%20OR%20dha_rucc%20OR%20dha_scnpp%20OR%20dha_sim%20OR%20dha_sltnc%20OR%20dha_scp%20OR%20dha_sslv%20OR%20dha_tpc%20OR%20dha_twpc%20OR%20dha_uplp%20OR%20dha_uslp%20OR%20dha_wehgn%20OR%20dha_wpabs) While demand for metal production kept the tunnel busy during World War II, the post-war environment caused a dramatic drop in demand for metals. This post-war market lead to the Elton Tunnel being shut down, the closure of the Apex and Utah Delaware mines, and the end of copper smelting operations in Tooele. The National Tunnel and Mines Company declared bankruptcy in 1948, a move which forced all the remaining assets into complete control by Anaconda. From 1941 to 1944 the International Smelting and Refining Company leased and expanded the Copper Canyon mining camp near Battle Mountain, Nevada. The site included an ore crusher, mill, and employee housing.https://www.loc.gov/item/nv0172/ It appears much of the equipment used at Copper Canyon came from other International/Anaconda properties. The lease at Copper Canyon appears to have been quickly ended though by 1945.https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/nv/nv0100/nv0172/data/nv0172data.pdf It also appears that sometime in this era the company looked into creating a busing company to transport employees to work at the Tooele smelter known as the International Bus Company, but those plans failed to come to fruition.Penrod, Emma \\"Tooele Valley Railway\\". Arcadia Publishing, 2013, p.103, p.81 With the copper smelter having been shut down, the remaining operations in Tooele focused on lead and zinc recovery. The nearby U.S. Smelting in Midvale, Utah contracted with International to smelt their milled ores in 1958. By 1960 Anaconda/International had sold off their Miami, Arizona smelter to Inspiration Consolidated Copper. The Tooele smelter's remaining years of operation were difficult, with aging equipment and decreasing profits. When Chilean socialist president Salvador Allende nationalized Anaconda Copper's Chuquicamata mine and El Salvador mine in 1971 it forced the company to close off unprofitable mines and smelters to remain profitable. When the International Smelter finally shut down in early 1972, over 30 mines in the intermountain west were forced to close due to the lack of any other nearby smelter. The smelter which had once hired 2000 employees during its peak, had only 350 full-time employees by the time of the closure of the Tooele operation.Penrod, Emma \\"Tooele Valley Railway\\". Arcadia Publishing, 2013, p.103, p.115 Meanwhile, the Raritan Copper Works were shut down in 1976.http://www.njmt.org/number_9.htm Demolition of the Tooele smelter began shortly afterwards. The machine shops and administrative offices survived for a short while longer as part of Anaconda/ARCO's Carr Fork Mine operation until after that mine was closed and sold to Kennecott Copper.http://utahrails.net/mining/anaconda.php Environmental Protection Agency work in the area began in 1986 to study the site. In 1994 a buffer area around the smelter site which included both the smelter and the Elton Tunnel location was declared to be the \\"Carr Fork Reclamation and Wildlife Area.\\" Long term site reclamation of the Tooele smelter began with a Utah Environmental Department Study in 1996 which detected high concentrations of lead and arsenic downhill from the smelter site. In 2000 the EPA declared the area a Superfund project and began a remediation project at the smelter site and parts of the Tooele Valley Railway route.http://tooelehealth.org/intermountain-smelter-refining-superfund-site/ Guidelines for land developers in the area were set in place and made available for the public via the Tooele County Health Department.http://tooelehealth.org/wp- content/uploads/ISR_Developer_Guidelines_Brochure_2010.pdf The smelter site was removed from the active Superfund list in 2011. Environmental clean up of the East Chicago Anaconda/International lead site and the neighboring USS Lead facilities started in 2009 with the EPA declaration of the area as a Superfund site. Due to the low income neighborhoods built in the area after the shut down of the lead facilities, clean up has been a difficult and controversial process. In 2016 the EPA began evicting residents from the West Calumet housing complex which had been built over the former Anaconda/International site with plans to demolish the structures there.http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-east- chicago-one-year-later-st-0723-20170721-story.html Soil remediation is an ongoing process at the site. == Preservation == A steam crane used at the Tooele smelter stored in Nevada as seen in 2019. Several locomotives used at the Raritan Copper Works by International have been preserved. Locomotive #8 is in a private collection and has been modified to have a tender.http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1459 Locomotive #9, is preserved in the New Jersey Museum of Transportation.http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1767 Locomotive #10 is in Boothbay, Maine.http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=569 Locomotive #11 is preserved in South Carver, Massachusetts.http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=570 Significant artifacts from the International Smelter in Tooele were preserved in the Tooele Valley Railroad Museum to the west of the smelter site. Artifacts preserved included work tools, laboratory sampling equipment, signs used on the smelter site, and documents pertaining to the operation of the smelter and the local workers unions. The Carr Fork Reclamation and Wildlife Area has sign markers and monuments with information on the historic smelter site. As of June 2016, several pylons of the aerial tramway between the smelter and Bingham Canyon remain standing across the Oquirrh Mountains. The only surviving structure from the Tooele smelter site is an ore conveyor bridge, which was dismantled and rebuilt into a sky bridge at the Trolley Square mall in Salt Lake City. The bridge passes over 600 South, with a small informational placard near it in the mall detailing its history. At the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada a steam crane known as 'The Crab' that was used at the Tooele smelter is stored. ==See also== *Tooele Valley Railway *Anaconda Copper == References == Category:Copper smelters Category:Defunct companies based in Utah Category:Tooele County, Utah Category:Anaconda Copper ","title":"International Smelting and Refining Company"},{"id":"54240828","text":"Gaius Trebonius Proculus Mettius Modestus was a Roman senator of the 2nd century AD who held a number of offices in the imperial service, as well as serving as suffect consul in 103 as the colleague of Marcus Flavius Aper.Fasti Ostienses, frag.

Seamen's Church of the Redeemer (1878, burned 1974) Dolobran\\" (1881, altered) Evans brought social connections to the firm, and initially designed houses for family and friends. He developed a small-scaled but vibrant version of the Shingle Style. Based on stylistic grounds, Furness expert George E. Thomas suggests that Evans made major contributions to the Seamen's Church (1878, burned 1974), \\"Dolobran\\" (1881), and \\"Windon\\" (1882). He was a founding member of the Merion Cricket Club, designed its Ardmore clubhouse (1880, burned 1892), and its clubhouses and other buildings in Haverford. Following the Civil War, his father purchased more than 100 acres of land northeast of Haverford Station. This was later sold off in parcels to Alexander Cassatt (to build \\"Cheswold\\"), Clement Griscom (to build \\"Dolobran\\"), J. Randall Williams (to build \\"Harleigh\\"), and the Merion Cricket Club. Dr. Evans and other relatives built their own country houses (and a rental property) on the land, all designed by the architect in the family. Like his father, Evans invested in real estate. In Philadelphia, he designed and built a speculative row of four city houses (1883), west of Rittenhouse Square. The house at 237 South 21st Street became his own residence. In Berwyn, he developed land on a ridge overlooking the Great Valley, and designed \\"Hillcrest\\" (ca. 1887) for William Drennan. Now known as the Mary A. Bair house, it once featured a massive three-story porch crowned by a dome.Bair Estate, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Evans designed St. Mary's Episcopal Church, Ardmore (1887),St. Mary Church, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. where he remained an active member for the next 38 years.

Girard Trust Company Building (1905-07), Philadelphia. Now the Ritz- Carlton Philadelphia. The Girard Trust Company Building (1905-07), at Broad & Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, caused a rift between Evans and Furness. The initial concept for a bank building modeled on the Pantheon in Rome had been Furness's, but the bank's president rejected his participation: > My interest is in you and not in your firm, for while I have the highest > respect and esteem for Mr. Furness we do not wish a building design on his > well known lines. -- Effingham B. Morris to Allen Evans, June 16, 1904. The building was completed by Evans in partnership with McKim, Mead & White.Girard Trust Bank, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Furness had to sue him to recover a share of the architect's fee. Furness, Evans & Company continued as the firm's name, even after Furness's 1912 death. Evans worked at the firm until 1923, more than 50 years. In retirement, Evans designed the rood screen for St. Mary's Ardmore. It was completed after his 1925 death, and dedicated by his widow.A Tour of St. Mary's Historic Ardmore Church, Around Ardmore, December 4, 2012. ==Personal== On April 25, 1876, Allen Evans married Rebecca Chalkley Lewis (1854-1927).

This made her the sixth female commercial pilot in the country. After flying for Alaska for three years, Osterud became the fourth woman graduate of the United Airlines training school, and in May 1978, was hired by United Airlines, becoming the sixth female pilot to fly for the airline.“A Rare and Exceptional Breed,” Reed Magazine, April 1981, https://rdc.reed.edu/c/reedhisttxt/s/r?_pp=20&query;=osterud&s;=4f6bbfa7f227939f13e8e60964af4557b1ead7b7&p;=2&pp;=1∂=1 During her employment with Alaska Airlines, she participated in the investigation into the cause of an Alaska Airlines 727 crash at Juneau on September 4, 1971. Her research was key to finding the elusive cause of an error in VOR station propagation which resulted in the aircraft descending into terrain. Despite her time spent flying for major airlines, Osterud worked steadily as a stunt pilot, working at airshows across the U.S. and Canada most weekends between March and November. She bought her first plane in 1976, a Stephens Akro plane built by Gerry Zimmerman in 1971, which was the first amateur-built Akro to fly. Osterud used the Akro for stunt performance maneuvers like hammerhead turns, tailslides, and lomcevaks (tumbling end over end) in the air show circuit.Museum of Flight Facebook Post, Nov. 15, 2013, https://www.facebook.com/8855517223/posts/10152299668227224http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/stephens- akro She donated the Akro to the Museum of Flight in 1994. Osterud almost set her first record in 1987, where she was supposed to be the first woman to compete in the Reno Air Races. A technical requirement kept her from competing during the weekend in a 40 year old British plane called Blind Man’s Bluff. The plane had been converted to burn methanol, and because of this, it did not pass race checkout.From Critical Mass to Critical Acclaim, http://www.warbirdaeropress.com/articles/Critical%20Mass.htm At an airshow on July 13, 1989 in North Bend, Oregon, Osterud set her first world flight record, flying 208 outside loops in her Sorrell Biplane Supernova. The plane was 21 feet long with a 23-foot wingspan, and topped out at 170 MPH. It had a 230-horsepower engine and a nitrous oxide injection system for an extra boost.Sam Moses, “Sky Princess Passes on Her Scepter,” Sports Illustrated, Dec. 18, 1989. https://www.si.com/vault/1989/12/18/121278/sky-princess-passes- on-her-scepter Osterud modified it with straps to hold her feet to the pedals, and she trained for the time upside down with a special harness that allowed her to hang upside down for long periods of time. Previous record holder Dorothy Stenzel set the record of 62 outside loops in 1931 and, after seeing Osterud perform at an airshow, encouraged her to break her record. Stenzel commented to Sports Illustrated, “I believed it was well past time the record was broken… She’s a smooth flyer and I didn’t think she’d tear her wings off.” The 208 outside loops took her 2 hours, 4 minutes, 38 seconds, and not only broke Stenzel’s record of 62 outside loops, but also the unofficial men’s record of 180 outside loops, which was set by Hal McClain in the 1980s. Osterud also used the record-breaking stunt to raise money for United Way of Southeastern Oregon, allowing people to sponsor individual loops. She raised $1,364.67, and would have quit at 200 loops, but one of her favorite Eagles songs was playing, so she kept going. Osterud next set two records at once on July 24, 1991, for both the longest flight upside down and the longest flight upside down in one stretch, flying for 4 hours and 38 minutes over 658 miles in her Ultimate 10-300S biplane between Vancouver BC and Vanderhoof BC.Ann Lewis Cooper, Stars of the Sky, Legends All Zenith Press, 2008, p. 144-145 She was scheduled to perform in the 1990 Vanderhoof Air Show, so decided to try her hand at breaking Milo Burcham’s 1933 record. She had previously attempted the flight in 1990, but had to end the flight early due to an engine oil leak. Burcham flew 4 hours, 5 minutes, 22 seconds flying upside down from Long Beach to San Diego and back in a Boeing 100 where he had inverted the engine.Ann Lewis Cooper, Stars of the Sky, Legends All Zenith Press, 2008, p. 144-145“Flip-Flop Flier,” People, Aug. 12, 1991, http://people.com/archive/flip-flop-flier-vol-36-no-5/ The records were part publicity stunt for the Vanderhoof Air Show, partly to fundraise for the Canadian Air Cadets, and also to prove that she could do it.Rhonda Nowak, “Oxnard: Pilot Sets Records by Flying Upside Down,” LA Times, Aug. 1, 1991. http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-01/local/me-200_1_pilot-sets Osterud upgraded her biplane with six fuel tanks, specialized oil and electrical systems, special seat belts and drinking tubes, the last two for making the long flight more comfortable. She had the same problems she always did with her body on her inverted flights: painful leg cramps, facial swelling, eyes swelling, and head congestion. During the record-setting flight, she was accompanied by five other planes, including an official observer from the Canadian Federation Aeronautique Internationale and another to navigate for her. \\"The world looks real weird upside down,\\" she said. \\"The normal points of reference just aren't there.\\" As of 1991, she was flying 20-25 airshows a year as well as flying for United Airlines, and compared the difference between the two types of planes as \\"the difference between driving a Cadillac and riding a dirt bike.\\" Osterud’s last stunt flight ended abruptly, when she crashed during an airshow at the MCAS Yuma Airshow in Yuma, Arizona, at the MCAS, Yuma International Airport on April 11, 1997. She was flying her Ultimate 10-300S biplane in a performance at the airshow she called \\"Ring of Fire,\\" which she had performed numerous times over the years both in the United States and abroad. The stunt centered on a giant ring of flames at center stage of the show. She would make multiple passes through the flaming ring, and on the last pass, flew upside down and cut a ribbon suspended between two poles with the tail of her plane, while the plane was 10–20 feet off the ground.\\"Air Show Packed A Whallop,\\" Lethbridge Herald August 16, 1992, p. 1\\"Please Don't Attempt This At Home,\\" Santa Ana Orange County Register May 1, 1995, p. 19; NTSB Accident Report: http://www.asias.faa.gov/pls/apex/f?p=100:17:0::NO::AP_BRIEF_RPT_VAR:LAX97LA155 According to the NTSB accident report, Osterud had personally chosen the location for the poles and ribbon, which was just to the south of the runway over old asphalt and concrete. This meant that her path was free of any obstacles and would parallel the runway. She planned to cut the ribbon while flying inverted on her third pass, and then land.NTSB Accident Report: http://www.asias.faa.gov/pls/apex/f?p=100:17:0::NO::AP_BRIEF_RPT_VAR:LAX97LA155 She ended up flying at dusk, and then had to fly directly into the setting sun before turning around for her last pass, which was the one that was upside down. \\"I remember the turn-around at the west end, rolling inverted [and] establishing my sight picture for the run-in. However, the next few seconds are a total blank in my memory. I can remember the sound of the impact, but my recollection of a visual picture resumes only with the sparks created by the inverted slide.\\" Osterud crashed into the runway while upside down on the third pass, totaling the plane, but was able to walk away from the crash unhurt. She apparently went back to the grandstand covered in soot, dirt and mud in her hair and apologized to the crowd for crashing. Her insurance covered the remaining debt on the plane, but did not leave enough for her to buy another plane. This crash ended her stunt career. The NTSB inspector found no mechanical or engine problems with the plane and cited “the pilot's failure to maintain adequate vertical clearance from the runway, while flying inverted” as well as “the light conditions at dusk, and the pilot's lack of visual ques [sic] due to the light conditions” as factors relating to the accident.https://app.ntsb.gov/pdfgenerator/ReportGeneratorFile.ashx?EventID=20001208X07752&AKey;=1&RType;=HTML&IType;=LA == References == Category:Aviators from Minnesota Category:Aerobatic pilots Category:Reed College alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:People from Minneapolis Category:People from Seattle Category:1945 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Aerobatic record holders Category:Commercial aviators Category:American aviation record holders Category:American female commercial aviators Category:American flight instructors Category:American female flight instructors Category:American female aviation record holders ","title":"Joann Osterud"},{"id":"54240941","text":"The 2017 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team represented the University of Kentucky during the 2017 NCAA Division I baseball season.

While at a pit stop, Jordan gets off the bus, but the bus takes off before he can get back on. As he walks around town, he stops to take a look at a poster until a group of fans sees him and chases him. As he runs away, he bumps into Emily Lowe (Sarah Jeffery), who couldn't care less about Jordan and his status as a star, while she is delivering pizzas. Jordan convinces Emily to give him a ride away. After Emily drives him away, Jordan convinces her to hide him for the night. Emily reluctantly agrees and the two hide out at a bowling ally until Emily's parents go to bed. Emily then sneaks Jordan into her room for the night. The following day, Jordan convinces Emily to use her interest in art, and specifically her interest in street art, and share her designs with people by tagging the school. As they tag the school, the two bond over their feelings of not knowing what to do with their crafts and their futures. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Rotten Tomatoes Category:American romantic comedy films Category:2016 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:2016 comedy films ","title":"Be Somebody (film)"},{"id":"54240976","text":"Elizabeth Economy is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

His father sailed to Crete with some Aeolians and Pelasgians and became the ruler of the island. Asterius inherited the throne from his father and he was the king of Crete at the time when Europa was abducted by Zeus and brought to his kingdom. He married Europa and became the stepfather of her sons by Zeus,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca III.1.2; Asterius \\"having died childless\\" III.1.3; scholiast on Iliad XII.292. who assumed the form of the Cretan bull to accomplish his role. Asterion brought up his stepsons: Minos, the just king in Crete who judged the Underworld; Rhadamanthus, presiding over the Blessed Island or in the Underworld; and Sarpedon, king in Lycia. When he died childless, Asterion gave his kingdom to Minos, who promptly \\"banished\\" his brothers after quarreling with them. Crete, daughter of Asterion, was a possible wife of Minos.Pseudo-Apollodorus.

At standard conditions it is a blue gas. ==Production== Hexafluorothioacetone was first produced by Middleton in 1961 by boiling bis-(perfluoroisopropyl)mercury with sulfur. ==Properties== Hexafluorothioacetone boils at 8°C. Below this it is a blue liquid. Colour The blue colour is due to absorption in the visible light range with bands at 800–675 nm and 725–400 nm. These bands are due to T1–S0 and S1–S0 transitions. There is also a strong absorption in ultraviolet around 230-190 nm. ==Reactions== Hexafluorothioacetone acts more like a true thiocarbonyl (C=S) than many other thiocarbonyl compounds, because it is not able to form thioenol compounds (=C-S-H), and the sulfur is not in a negative ionized state (C-S−). Hexafluorothioacetone is not attacked by water or oxygen at standard conditions as are many other thiocarbonyls. Bases trigger the formation of a dimer 2,2,4,4-tetrakis-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithietane. Bases includes amines. The dimer can be heated to regenerate the hexafluorothioacetone monomer. The dimer is also produced in a reaction with hexafluoropropene and sulfur with some potassium fluoride. Hexafluorothioacetone reacts with bisulfite to form a Bunte salt CH(CF3)2SSO2−. Mercaptans reacting with hexafluorothioacetone yield disulfides or a thiohemiketal: :R-SH + C(CF3)2S → R-S-S-CH(CF3)2. :R-SH + C(CF3)2S → RSC(CF3)2SH (for example in methyl mercaptan or ethyl mercaptan). With mercaptoacetic acid, instead of a thiohemiketal, water elimination yields a ring shaped molecule called a dithiolanone -CH2C(O)SC(CF3)2S- (2,2-di(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithiolan-4-one). Aqueous hydrogen chloride results in the formation of a dimeric disulfide CH(CF3)2SSC(CF3)2Cl. Hydrogen bromide with water yields the similar CH(CF3)2SSC(CF3)2Br. Dry hydrogen iodide does something different and reduces the sulfur making CH(CF3)2SH. Wet hydrogen iodide only reduces to a disulfide CH(CF3)2SSC(CF3)2H. Strong organic acids add water to yield a disulfide compound CH(CF3)2SSC(CF3)2OH. Chlorine and bromine add to hexafluorothioacetone to make CCl(CF3)2SCl and CBr(CF3)2SBr. With diazomethane hexafluorothioacetone produces 2,2,5,5-tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)-l,3-dithiolane, another substituted dithiolane. Diphenyldiazoniethane reacts to form a three membered ring called a thiirane (di-2,2-trifluoromethyl-di-3,3-phenyl-thiirane) Trialkylphosphites (P(OR)3) react to make a trialkoxybis(trifluoromethyl)methylenephosphorane (RO)3P=C(CF3)2 and a thiophosphite (RO)3PS. Hexafluorothioacetone can act as a ligand on nickel. Hexafluorothioacetone is highly reactive to alkenes and dienes combining via addition reactions. With butadiene it reacts even as low as -78°C to yield 2,2-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydro-2H-l-thiapyran. ==See also== *Hexafluoroacetone ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Thioketones Category:Perfluorinated compounds Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds Category:Gases with color ","title":"Hexafluorothioacetone"},{"id":"54241143","text":"The Mind-Benders is an educational antidrug documentary film concerning hallucinogens produced for the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1967.

A two-time recipient of the Navy Cross, Seligman was involved in a security breach in 1942 which brought to an end his promising naval career and forced his retirement in 1944. ==Early life and naval career== Morton Tinslar Seligman was born on July 1, 1895, in Salt Lake City, Utah, in a family of New Mexico pioneers. Senior Class Portrait of Midshipman Seligman Seligman graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1918, in the three-year class of 1919. Immediately following World War I Lieutenant (j.g.) Seligman commanded the former submarine chaser SC-272 on minesweeping operations in the North Sea. He was awarded his first Navy Cross for this historically important work. He then became a naval aviator and was assigned to the aircraft carrier by 1929. Promoted to Lieutenant Commander, he was commander of the Tophatters fighter squadron in 1933–34. In 1938 Seligman was carrier air group commander on the . In 1939 he was appointed operations officer at North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego and became the station's executive officer in 1941. In 1940 Seligman was a technical advisor in a major Hollywood movie production, Flight Command. Promoted to Commander, he became the executive officer of the in 1941. He served in that post through the Battle of the Coral Sea in which the Lexington was sunk after which he was awarded a gold star decoration for his Navy Cross for his service in that action, in lieu of a second award of the Navy Cross. Seligman was credited with effective management of the ship's damage control parties in an ultimately hopeless effort, allowing the ship to be abandoned in an orderly manner with relatively small loss of life. He was one of the last men to leave the ship. ==Tribune incident== Many of the survivors of the Lexington were repatriated back to the United States aboard the . Among the Barnett's passengers was Australian-American journalist Stanley Johnston, who had been the sole journalist present aboard the Lexington during the Coral Sea action. Reporting for the Chicago Tribune, Johnston was on his way back to file his stories about those events. Seligman knew Johnston and may have shared a cabin with him aboard the Barnett. Johnston obtained access to a fleet dispatch containing an intelligence estimate of Japanese forces immediately before the 1942 Midway action that indicated clear foreknowledge of Japanese intentions and movements, a document to which Seligman had access. Johnston's subsequent story in the Tribune raised alarm in the White House and Navy that the Japanese, reading the story, would realize that their codes were broken and that they would change ciphers. At the urging of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who viewed the Tribune and its publisher as an enemy, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Attorney General Francis Biddle was pressed to prosecute Johnston and others at the Tribune for harm to national security under the Espionage Act. At the same time the Navy investigated the source of the breach. No indictments were forthcoming from the grand jury that was convened, in part because the necessary evidence was too sensitive for use in a trial. Investigators established that officers on board the Barnett were careless in their handling of sensitive material, and that Johnston was able to see some of it. Seligman was blamed for the leak, but due to wartime secrecy was not brought before any formal hearing. Instead, Seligman was assigned to shore duty, an unusual situation for a high-ranking decorated officer who up to that time had been on track to flag rank. Promotion to Captain, the expected next step, was denied him after the Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet Admiral Ernest King, in a most unique action for King, personally intervened with the selection board to prevent promotion. After almost two years ashore, Seligman retired in 1944. Although promotion was denied Seligman on active service, on his retirement Seligman was granted a \\"tombstone promotion\\" to Captain. In 1945 he was a technical advisor on the movie A Bell for Adano. Seligman died at age 71 at the Naval Hospital Balboa in San Diego on July 9, 1967. He was survived by his wife Adelia (September 14, 1898 - July 1, 1981) and his mother. Seligman and his wife are interred at Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1967 deaths Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:United States Naval Aviators Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Burials at Santa Fe National Cemetery ","title":"Morton T.

Shortly after, his trumpet was stolen, and the family wasn't able to acquire a replacement for a couple of years, when his junior high school started a band.\\" He learned to read music in this band, but was largely self-taught on trumpet. He briefly attended a Catholic high school, matching his parents' religion, but moved to a vocational school. He left with a General Equivalency Diploma. ==Later life and career== He played early in his career with the St. Louis Creative Ensemble, playing with Charles \\"Bobo\\" Shaw and James Bowie.\\"Rasul Siddik\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld, 2004. Unwilling to be drafted into the Vietnam War – \\"they were drafting all the black people, and sending them straight to Vietnam, [...] I couldn't see going to another country fighting people when we weren't free at home\\" – he left for Chicago. In Chicago, he changed his name from Jan Corlus Mahr to Rasul Olufemi Siddik. After a period of introspection and attending the AACM's music school, he enrolled at the Malcolm X College. However, he was located by the military authorities, so attempted further means of avoiding the draft. Ultimately, he was required to attend an assessment meeting in St. Louis: \\"I went down there looking like one of Sun Ra's boys – space suit, an Indian robe, and a poncho. I had my hair all braided up, a little space hat. I went back to my revolutionary thing – I can't wait to get to boot camp so I can shoot me some honkies and rednecks, I can't stand white people, I can't take orders from no white man, blah blah blah.\\" He was rejected as 4-F. In the 1980s, he worked with Karlton Hester's Contemporary Art Movement and with Michele Rosewoman before joining Henry Threadgill's sextet from about 1984 through the end of the decade. Concomitantly, he played in the latter half of the 1980s with Lester Bowie, Oliver Lake, and Julius Hemphill. He first began working with David Murray around 1987, an association that continued into the 2000s. He moved to Paris in the 1990s, where he worked with Billy Bang, Ghasem Batamuntu, Christian Blazer, Hamiett Bluiett, Benjamin Duboc, Kahil El'Zabar, Bobby Few, Sunny Murray, and Romano Partesi. ==References== Bibliography * Category:American jazz trumpeters Category:American male trumpeters Category:Jazz musicians from Missouri Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Rasul Siddik"},{"id":"54241292","text":"The tornado outbreak of March 10–12, 1986https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/gibbs/image/GOE-6/IR/1986-03-13-03 was a significant and widespread tornado outbreak which produced a high-end F2 tornado which struck Lexington, Kentucky and killing a total of 6 people.

Hernandez, who was reportedly drunk, was supposedly urinating in public which sparked a confrontation between Hernandez and Terry and Chauna Thompson, a Harris County Sheriff's deputy, after Thompson pulled into the Denny's parking lot in the 17700 block of the Crosby Freeway with his children. A fight broke out between the two, unclear who initiated the altercation. Chauna Thompson arrived, off-duty, to meet her family where she saw the altercation and called for assistance from the Sheriff's office. Terry Thompson held Hernandez in a chokehold while his spouse pinned him down. Hernandez was seen kicking and screaming and then became motionless upon the arrival of medical personnel.  Death  Hernandez was rushed to Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital where he was placed on life support and slipped into a coma. He died 3 days later at the age of 24 when his life support was removed. The cause of death was ruled by the Harris County medical examiner as lack of oxygen and chest compression caused by strangulation. == John Hernandez == Hernandez was the common-law husband of Maria Toral with whom he shared a daughter. == Chauna and Terry Thompson == Chauna Thompson was at the time a Sheriff's deputy of the Harris County Sheriff's Department.

Professors Daniel Promislow and Matt Kaeberlein are the co-directors of the project. Together with Chief Veterinarian, Dr. Kate Creevy, the project primarily focuses on research to understand dog aging through the collection and analysis of big data. Additionally, there is a small component of the project that explores the use of pharmaceuticals to potentially increase life span of dogs. The project has implications for improving the life spans of humans and is an example of geroscience. Chemical Structure of rapamycin, a pharmaceutical under evaluation for its effects on longevity The project engages the general public to register their dogs in the studies, and therefore the project is an example of citizen science. The majority of the dogs will participate in a longitudinal study of 10,000 dogs over a 10 year period conducted across the United States. Individual dogs are followed for the duration of their lives to understand the biological and environmental factors that influence dog longevity. A small subset of those dogs (approximately 500) will be enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the pharmaceutical rapamycin, which has shown signs of extending longevity in species such as mice. The Dog Aging Project is an open science initiative. The investigators have committed to releasing all anonymized research data to the public domain. The longitudinal study portion of the Dog Aging Project bears some similarity to the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study of the Morris Animal Foundation although with much larger phenotypic diversity. The entire project also shares operational similarities to Darwin's Ark, a citizen science initiative of companion animals with more specific focus on genetics. The initiatives are each managed to ensure the data can be integrated into a powerful master data set. A premise of the project is that dogs may be a sentinel species for humans since they live in the same environment as humans. The project may thereby help identify risk factors that influence human life span. Since dogs age significantly more rapidly than humans, data on aging can be generated much more rapidly using a dog model than in human studies. A further premise is that the longitudinal portion of the project seeks to understand the underlying biology of aging, as opposed to understanding individual age- related diseases. In this respect, if the aging process itself is addressed, then several age-related diseases could be delayed or avoided simultaneously. This is important because elderly individuals often have multiple chronic disease conditions. The Dog Aging Project commenced in 2016 using a US $200,000 seed grant from the University of Washington, with subsequent funding from small private donors. It is an example of crowdfunding. Initially there was a 10 week trial showing that dogs that received rapamycin had better heart function than the control group. As of 2018, the National Institute on Aging has awarded the Dog Aging Project a five year grant to support its studies. Researchers from the Texas A&M; College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences are also investigators in the study. ==External links== * Dog Aging Project website * The Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute of the University of Washington * Golden Retriever Lifetime Study ==References== Category:Epidemiological study projects Category:Ageing processes Category:Senescence in non-human organisms Category:Dogs Category:Longevity Category:Crowdfunding ","title":"Dog Aging Project"},{"id":"54241472","text":"\\"Slip\\" is the eighth episode of the third season of the AMC television series Better Call Saul, the spinoff series of Breaking Bad. The episode aired on June 5, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. ==Plot== Opening In a flashback, Jimmy and Marco break into the McGills' abandoned store in Cicero, Illinois. Hoping to use an Indian-head penny for a con, Jimmy recovers his childhood coin collection, which he had hidden in an old Band-Aid box inside the panels of the suspended ceiling. He explains that he started his collection of curious-looking coins following his father's futile attempt to return a rare coin to its owner after the owner mistakenly used it at the store. Main story Mike drives to the site where he committed the ice-cream truck robbery. Using a metal detector and shovel to search based on information Nacho provided, he digs holes for several hours until he finds the body of the Good Samaritan who was killed after freeing Ximinez, the driver Mike had left tied up at the scene. He makes an anonymous call and reports the location to the police. At home, Chuck shares with Dr. Cruz journals of his reduced pain levels, hoping that he's close to being cured of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Chuck describes the epiphany that caused him to realize his EHS might be a mental illness and Dr. Cruz advises him not to get excited or try to do too much too soon. He later leaves the house on his own to buy groceries at a nearby supermarket, indicating that his condition is improving. On his return, he is greeted by Howard, who informs him that there is an issue with Chuck's malpractice insurance. After producing a successful commercial for a music store, Jimmy gets into a disagreement with his clients. When the store owners refuse to pay him, Jimmy resorts to a \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\" trick, intentionally stepping on a drumstick to create an injury-producing slip-and-fall accident. Kim is having lunch with Paige and Kevin when Howard stops to greet them. Kim tries to pay back the law school tuition loan she owes HHM, which Howard declines. He accuses her of betraying the firm, to which Kim replies that he should not have tried to cover up Chuck's condition. Kim returns to the office to find Jimmy with his half of the rent, which he can pay because his \\"accident\\" coerced the music store owners into paying him off. Despite Jimmy's assurances, Kim expresses doubts about Jimmy's ability to pay and considers taking on another client. Jimmy later makes $700 while performing his community service, which he earns by threatening the supervisor with a class-action lawsuit, enabling a drug dealer who's also doing community service to leave early so he can \\"see his sick child\\". Nacho puts into motion his plan to kill Hector. He breaks the air conditioning unit in the restaurant so that Hector will feel warm and remove his jacket. Nacho pretends some of the money he's collected looks suspicious, and asks Hector to inspect it. While Hector studies the bills, Nacho steals the nitroglycerin bottle from Hector's jacket pocket, and replaces the contents with lookalike capsules containing ibuprofen. He then returns the bottle to Hector's pocket without being noticed. Mike realizes he cannot spend the remaining $200,000 of the $250,000 he stole from Hector without attracting suspicion. He approaches Gus to seek help in laundering the money so that it can be left to his family. Gus warns him that they should avoid being publicly associated so that the Salamancas don't get suspicious. He tells Mike that the laundering process will be difficult, but agrees to help. ==Production== The episode is directed by Adam Bernstein, who previously directed the season 2 episode \\"Gloves Off\\", and written by Heather Marion, who co-wrote the season 2 finale with creator Vince Gilligan.

Formerly a pair of islands, it became attached to the river bank as a result of engineering work altering the confluence of the Sieg. It was the site of a fort during the Eighty Years' War and is now part of a protected natural area, the Naturschutzgebiet Siegaue. ==History== The Sieg originally flowed into the Rhine through a delta, entering the river at an angle opposite the northern end of the two islands of the Kemper Werth. Fort on the Pfaffenmütze, depicted c. 1621 in Matthäus Merian's Theatrum Europaeum In 1620 the islands were occupied and a fort constructed by forces of the States General of the Netherlands, in one of several pre-emptive strikes against the Spanish and in support of the claim of the Elector of Brandenburg, Georg Wilhelm, to the territories of Jülich-Berg during the Eighty Years' War.Michael Kaiser, \\"Generalstaatische Söldner und der Dreißigjährige Krieg.

In 1851, the Sieg was re-channelled through one of its arms, the \\"Hartfurth\\", to restore the angled confluence, with the Rhine bank being built up upstream. Where the primary mouth of the Sieg had been after the earlier works, the Kemper Werth was joined to the mainland at its southern end by a causeway, becoming a promontory; the causeway was raised in 1854 after the Rhine overspilled it.Eduard Beyerhaus, Der Rhein von Strassburg bis zur holländischen Grenze in technischer und wirtschaftlicher Beziehung, Koblenz: Groos, 1902, , pp. 30–33, Figs. 41–43 .Carl Jakob Bachem, Beueler Chronik: Zeittafel zur Geschichte des rechtsrheinischen Bonn: aus Anlass der 2000-Jahrfeier, Studien zur Heimatgeschichte des Stadtbezirks Bonn-Beuel 26, Bonn: City of Bonn, 1989, , p. 93 .

The company wanted to sell its controls division, which Happ purchased with a second mortgage on his home to form Happ Controls. His three children became employees of the company as they came of age, including Tom Happ who eventually took over from his father as president. In 1998, a distribution center was opened in Las Vegas to serve the local casino industry.

Venezuela is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Its economy is prone to disruption given that price of oil fluctuates rapidly. In 2014, oil prices dropped. Since then Venezuela has had to adapt to a significant decrease in state revenue. The economy has contracted each quarter since then. This caused Venezuela's Central Bank's monetary reserves to decline as well.World Bank Data A severe shortage of goods followed, with necessities such as medical supplies in short supply. Since 2007, Venezuela has not had official financial relations with either the IMF or the World Bank after it paid off its debt five years ahead of schedule under President Hugo Chávez.New York Times article on Venezuela The IMF and World Bank have stated their readiness to offer assistance if called upon. Venezuela has nationalized many industries, specifically in oil production, banking, telecommunications, metallurgy and mining. The high price of oil in recent decades allowed the government to embark on ambitious public programs, paid for by oil revenues when prices were high. Due to such measures and through redistributive policies the poverty rate was cut from 50 percent in 1998 to 30 percent in 2013, based on state figures. Inequality, as measured by the Gini Index, was reduced.  Statistics  The per capita income of Venezuela was $7,808 as of 2015. According to IMF data, since 2013 the economy has shrunk by 30%. Predictions in 2017 stated inflation was expected to reach 720% in 2017, and the economy was forecasted to contract by an additional 7.4%. The official exchange rate is severely overvalued, such that the black market value of the Bolivar is significantly less than the government rate of 10 Bolivar to $1 USD. This has affected the ability of the economy to remain viable.

The derailment was caused by sabotage of the tracks. Despite a manhunt, reward offers, and years of investigation by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), the case remains unsolved. ==Background== The City of San Francisco was a cross country passenger train, running from Oakland to Chicago. The train was jointly operated by three railroad companies, and the Nevada portion was operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP). The incident happened approximately east of Harney, Nevada, a rail siding along the SP main as it follows the Humboldt River through Palisade Canyon, between the towns of Beowawe and Palisade. ==Incident== The City of San Francisco was bound for Oakland, California, but was running behind schedule by around half an hour. After leaving Carlin, Nevada, engineer Ed Hecox had increased the speed to to make up time. At 9:33 p.m., Hecox and his train hit a patch of rail that had been deliberately moved out of alignment and camouflaged with brown paint and a tumbleweed, derailing the westbound City of San Francisco while it crossed the #4 bridge in the Humboldt River Gorge in northern Nevada. Hecox survived and ran to the telephone at Harney to contact emergency services. Volunteers from the nearby towns of Beowawe and Carlin rushed to the scene with medical supplies, but survivors would not be taken to the hospital until a rescue train was assembled and took them to Elko the next morning. The SP tracks were out of service for several months, but the nearby tracks of the competing Western Pacific Railroad were intact and used for both the rescue trains and regular service until the SP tracks were repaired. A total of 24 people died and 121 were injured. Five cars were destroyed and written off: SF 601 Presidio (32-seat coffee shop–kitchen car), SF-602 Mission Dolores (72-seat diner), SF-701 Embarcadero (dormitory-buffet-lounge car), and two sleepers, Twin Peaks and Chinatown. ==Investigation== In the following days, divers discovered tools in the Humboldt River, exposing the disaster as an act of sabotage. Investigators estimated it would take a strong person about an hour to move the tracks, and noted the previous train passed through the area four hours prior; Southern Pacific's lead investigator, Dan O’Connell, estimated several hours, and a reenactment for the San Francisco Chronicle the year of the derailment required four heavy tools. Southern Pacific put out a $5,000 bounty for the saboteurs (eventually raised to $10,000), and numerous lone hobos were arrested although some investigators argued the sabotage was likely carried out by two or more people with knowledge of railroad operations, but the arrests and interrogations led nowhere. The media coverage during the investigation proved hostile to the railroad. One of the first newspaper reporters on the scene was a photographer for the Elko Daily Free Press, who took pictures of the railroad cars dangling over the side of the bridge, in the river and tipped over. The Southern Pacific accused the paper of publishing pictures taken at angles that made the damage appear worse than it was, to which the photographer responded, \\"God knows, it would have been impossible to make it look worse than it was\\". The railroad was criticized for the amounts paid in compensation. In one case where a passenger originally bought a ticket on a coach fare train, but before boarding upgraded to the City of San Francisco, a premium fare train, the railroad only refunded the difference between the two tickets. Other papers promoted a theory that the sabotage story was a coverup to hide the railroad's negligence in allowing the engineer to operate the train at such high speed. These papers interviewed and noted that some passengers were uncomfortable with the speed of the train several minutes before it derailed; as the train rounded corners passengers had difficulty standing and some beer bottles were shaken off of tables. Despite these details, the official position of both the Southern Pacific and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) remains unchanged that the train was sabotaged, noting the evidence the rails were moved and the track circuits were bypassed. The case received new attention after the 1995 Palo Verde, Arizona derailment. One week before the Arizona derailment, the Southern Pacific Historical and Technical Society published an article about the Nevada derailment in their magazine. In addition to both accidents occurring along Southern Pacific track, investigators noticed other similarities with the Nevada derailment, namely tracks moved on a bridge with a high embankment and bypassed track circuits so the signaling systems would not warn of a track break. These similarities and the timing of the magazine article initially led to suspicion the Arizona train wreck may have been a copycat crime of the Nevada derailment. While the FBI interviewed people involved in the publication of the magazine article, no connection between the two crimes was established, and both crimes remain unsolved. To this day, the wreck of the City of San Francisco remains unsolved, and remains the deadliest rail disaster in Nevada. ==References== Category:Railway accidents in 1939 Category:1939 in Nevada Category:Train wrecks caused by sabotage Category:Disasters in Nevada Category:Eureka County, Nevada Category:August 1939 events Category:Accidents and incidents involving Southern Pacific Railroad Category:Unsolved mass murders in the United States ","title":"1939 City of San Francisco derailment"},{"id":"54241589","text":"Birkenes Church () is a parish church in Birkenes municipality in Agder county, Norway.

It runs for about between Newcastle at U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) and Jefferson at SR 32, entirely in Lincoln County. ==Route description== SR 215 begins at an intersection with US 1 Bus. and Academy Hill Road in Newscastle. The business route of US 1 runs to the southwest towards US 1 south and to the southeast towards Damariscotta. SR 215 heads northeast along Mills Road passing a few houses before coming to a half-diamond interchange with the limited-access US 1 expressway. Ramps are provided to US 1 northbound and from US 1 southbound. North of the interchange, SR 215 begins to closely follow the Damariscotta River/Salt Bay on its east side and businesses and churches on the west side. It crosses a railroad at a skewed grade crossing and enters the village of Damariscotta Falls. The road reaches Austin Road which carries the southbound lane of SR 215 through the village. The northbound lane of SR 215 continues north along Mills Road, through the road itself is still bidirectional. After crossing a short bridge over the river, SR 215 northbound enters the town of Nobleboro. At Main Street, northbound SR 215 turns west onto the one-way road and climbs a small hill passing numerous houses. It descends this hill and crosses the river again reentering Newcastle, now arriving at a wye intersection with the other end of Austin Road (southbound SR 215). Both directions of SR 215 continue west along Pond Road heading south of Damariscotta Lake. The road then curves to the north to head along the west side of the lake traveling along rolling hills. After passing the southern terminus of SR 213, SR 215 heads west through a wooded area. It then makes a turn to the north along Ridge Road at its intersection with SR 194's eastern terminus near the settlement of North Newcastle. Along Ridge Road, the route heads past some houses, small clearings, and wooded areas. It enters the town of Jefferson where the road name changes to South Clary Road. The road passes between several hills, the tallest of which is named Dyer Hill. It heads through the settlement of South Jefferson where SR 215 passes several houses and small farms. After crossing the Dyer River, the road briefly jogs northwest and then comes to a wye intersection with SR 126\\\\.

The Southern Wall of Jerusalem's Temple Mount is in length, and which Josephus equates as being equal to the length of one furlong (Greek: stadion). See: Josephus, Antiquities (15.11.3; XV.415–416), who described the dimensions of the Temple Mount in the following terms (apparently not including the extension made to the Temple Mount): “This hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs; [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong (Gr. stadion).” Compare Mishnah Middot 2:1 which states that the Temple Mount measured five-hundred cubits (Heb. amah) by five-hundred cubits. If it can be ascertained that Josephus' stadion is equivalent to the 500 cubits mentioned in the Mishnah, and being that the Southern Wall measured 281 meters, this would place each cubit (Heb. amah) at 56.205 cm. Rabbi Saadia Gaon, on the other hand, holds that a stadion was equivalent to only 470 cubits (v. Uziel Fuchs, \\"Millot HaMishnah\\" by R. Saadia Gaon — the First Commentary to the Mishnah, Sidra: A Journal for the Study of Rabbinic Literature, pub. Bar-Ilan University Press (2014), p. 66), in which case , each cubit was 59.792 cm, close to the 60 cm. cubit espoused by the Chazon-Ish. The basic Jewish traditional unit of distance was the cubit (), each cubit being roughly between Depending on the standards given by Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh and the Chazon-Ish. The standard measurement of the biblical mile, or what is sometimes called tǝḥūm šabbatShulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim §297:2) (Sabbath limit; Sabbath boundary), was 2,000 cubits.Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. Kippurim 6:4Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 51a ==Etymology== The word mīl, as used in Hebrew texts between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, is a Roman loanword, believed to be a shortened adaptation of the Latin mīliarium, literally meaning, \\"milestone,\\"Moshe Fischer, Benjamin Isaac and Israel Roll, Roman Roads in Judaea II - The Jaffa-Jerusalem roads, B.A.R., Oxford 1996, p. 26 and which word signifies \\"a thousand\\" [passuum of two steps each]; hence: Roman mile. The word appears in the Mishnah, a compendium of Jewish oral law compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in 189 CE, and is used to this very day by religious Jews in the application of certain halachic laws. ==Halachic applications== * On Shabbat, one is not allowed to travel further than 1 biblical mile outside one's city; this law is known as techum shabbat. A procedure known as eruv techumin allows one to travel up to one more biblical mile. * The rabbinic ordinance of washing hands prior to eating bread requires of people travelling the roads to go as far as 4 biblical miles if there is a known water source that can be used for washing. This applies only to when the water source lies in one's general direction of travel. However, had he already passed the water source, he is not obligated to backtrack unless the distance is within 1 biblical mile.Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Bikkurim 8:11); Jerusalem Talmud, Hallah 2:2; Babylonian Talmud, Pesahim 34a; ibid. 46a * Sliced pieces of meat that are to be cooked in a pot require salting before they are cooked. The first process is rinsing in water followed by salting with any coarse salt, while laid over a grating or colander to allow for drainage. The salt is allowed to remain on the meat for the time that it takes to walk one biblical mileShulhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah § 69:6; § 69:16; § 69:19 (appx.18-24minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Salting in this way helps to draw out the blood. ==Divergent methods== Nearly two thousand years of Jewish exile from the Land of Israel have given rise to disputes over the precise length of the biblical mile observed by the ancients. Some hold the biblical mile to be 1 km 152 m, while others hold it to be 960 m, depending on the length they prescribe to each cubit. Originally, the 2,000 cubit Sabbath limit was measured with a standard 50-cubit rope. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" +Divergent methods espoused by the Rabbis - ! Scholar ! Cubit !

The film stars Callum Turner, Kate Beckinsale, Pierce Brosnan, Cynthia Nixon, Kiersey Clemons, and Jeff Bridges. The film was released on August 11, 2017, by Roadside Attractions and Amazon Studios, receiving generally negative reviews. ==Plot== Thomas Webb is a recent college graduate who is still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life and has a one-sided crush on his friend Mimi. He meets a new neighbor, W.F., with whom he connects. As Thomas spends time with W.F., he gets advice about life. When Thomas and Mimi socialize in a bar, Thomas sees his publisher father, Ethan, kissing a woman, Johanna. Fearing that the affair would damage his mentally unstable mother, Judith, Thomas starts to follow Johanna. He confronts her and is surprised to learn she knows him. She reveals that she is an editor working with his father and recognizes Thomas from pictures in Ethan's office. He pleads with her to leave his married father alone. Johanna tells Thomas that he is still a child who doesn't know anything and in fact he actually wants to sleep with her too. He repeats the confrontation to W.F., then reluctantly admits that he does want to sleep with her. At a friend's party, Thomas bumps into Johanna with yet another man. He calls her a hooker, but she explains her date is gay. Thomas surprisingly kisses her. An affair starts and Thomas begins to fall for Johanna. He tells her that since he was a child, he has aspired to be a writer, but Ethan told him that his essays were only 'serviceable'. In W.F.'s absence Thomas finds a manuscript titled The Only Living Boy in New York. W.F. is actually a successful, though reclusive, writer; Thomas has inspired him to write again. Thomas shows him his essays, and W.F. tells him that he has talent. Thomas invites W.F. to a party at his father's company. Thomas takes Mimi to the party and she surprisingly shows feelings towards him. She asks him if he is having an affair with Johanna which he denies.

Ethan angrily leaves the room, while Johanna tearfully tells Thomas that she really is in love with Ethan. She tells Thomas he really doesn't know a lot. She shows him a news clipping/photograph that Ethan keeps in his office, of a younger Thomas winning a tennis match, with W.F. standing in the background. Thomas confronts W.F., who explains that he was a close friend to his parents. As Ethan is infertile, W.F. fathered a child with Judith, making him Thomas's biological father. W.F. realized that he was in love with Judith, but stayed away. She realized she loved him too, and his leaving led to her years of depression. W.F. has watched Thomas from afar, hoping to connect with his son, which he now has. Returning to his parents’ home, Thomas finds that Ethan has disclosed his affair to Judith and wants a divorce. Thomas tells his mother that he's been in contact with W.F. and that he knows Judith has always been in love with W.F. One year later, Thomas is working in a bookstore, while trying to get his writing published. Ethan comes into the bookstore and the two catch up. He offers to help Thomas using his publishing connections, which Thomas declines. Thomas asks if Ethan is still in contact with Johanna, and he says no, then admits he's lying.

After this cartoon, Ms. Meany wouldn't be seen in new material until her cameo in 1969's Prehistoric Super Salesman. The cartoon was directed by Paul J. Smith and was one of eight Woody Woodpecker cartoons released to theaters in 1966. Grace Stafford provided both Woody's and Ms. Meany voice. ==Summary== The cartoon starts in a desert, as we see a person with a camel walking into distance. A narrator tells us that the figure is hopling along for a very important mission, and that she's the famous explorer and archeologist, Ms. Meany. She is obviously uncomfortable and seasick by the camel's walking balance. Once the camel takes a stop and she get off, Ms. Meany says to the camel Why can't you walk smoother? then punch him in the nose. In the next scene, we see Woody in the top of a pyramid, looking left and right. Woody sees something and remarks Company coming!, as he runs down to see. He see Ms. Meany with some shovels, as she tell the camel to stay here while she looks for some ancient Egyptian eggs. Woody gets excited by this, as he hadn't a three meal for three weeks. So, Woody enters inside the pyramid. Once in there, he and Ms. Meany meet themselves and have a short conversation, and Ms. Meany remarks that she's looking for old eggs. Woody says that he can show an old egg. Woody then shows a mirror to Ms. Meany's reflection, in response she break the glass in Woody's face. The woodpecker says that she got seven years' bad luck, as he pecks her nose and runs off to hide in a vase. Ms. Meany goes after him, and is pushed by Woody, who plays a flute like a serpent charmer. Then, Woody hides in another vase, while Meany looks for him. Woody reappear in the first vase and inflate one of his hands like a balloon, to slap Meany's fanny into the fase. The two are now in the same vase and hides in. Two Woodys appear and hides in. Next, Two Meanys (one in the second vase, another in the first) also pop out. How he did do that?, the first asks. I don't know, the other answers. Later, Meany is determined to found these eggs, even if she dig to China. What she didn't knows is that Woody was behind her with another shovel, covering the hole with the sand that Meany put off, and the circle continues for a while. Woody uses a Yoo-Hoo to call her attention, and, as so, she catapult him with a shovel into some Egyptian paintings. Once Meany finished digging a hole, she finally found a nest full of Ancient egyptian eggs. She picks up one with her shovel, as she remarks that will be famous and rich. Woody says he's hungry, and steal the egg, and Meany gives chase. Without her notice, Woody ties a mummy with her shovel. The mummy's skeleton reveal after the paper is out. Meany shouts a Yoo-Hoo and Woody responds with a Hello There, which echoes. Once Meany calmly turns around, she saw the skeleton behind her, and freaks out running. Then, a chase starts between Woody, Meany and her camel for who get the egg. Woody advises Meany to enter a metal door, which is locked by concrete. Meany crashes into it, breaking the egg in the process. Meanwhile, Woody steals one egg and runs away with it. Ms. Meany hang herself upsidedown and get the egg, without Woody notice. Once she climbs down the stair, Woody pecks out the blocks, while Ms. Meany tries her best for not falls. Woody takes a column of the stair, which difficult more. Woody uses a saw, and then Meany falls, breaking the egg once again. Woody steals another egg, and decides to hide in a mummy's crate. She knows Woody's in there, but as she opens it, Woody merely throws the egg at her. Meany opens the crate again, just to see the camel throwing another egg at her. Woody once again steal another egg, but before he could run away, Ms. Meany was there, blocking his passage. So, Woody throws the egg like a basketball to the camel, who throws back at Woody, who throws back at him. But, as the camel makes a movement to throw the egg, Meany was now ready to catch it. Bored, he just hit Meany with the egg and leaves. Outside, Woody manages to carry what is seem to be the last egg. But he is stopped by Meany at gunpoint. He give the egg to her and leaves. Meany proudly sits on the egg. But it suddenly starts hatching, as a pair of big legs, tail and head appears, revealing a camel that looks like the one who was with Meany earlier in the short. He start walking with Meany on his back. Of course, this isn't a nice thing for her, as she says Here we go again. Down there, is Woody in a hammock tied to camel. He does his laugh as the cartoon ends. ==References== *The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia - 1966.

It exists since the 1980 decade, when the then President of the Republic, José Sarney, openly Catholic, asked the Banco Central (Central Bank) to include the phrase in the cruzado coin. The Federal Government at the time got inspired by theist doctrines of other secular states such as the United States of America that were already using the motto \\"In God We Trust\\" in its dollar banknotes. The first banknotes with the inscription were printed on February 24, 1986, when the executive order was presented to the Central Bank. This way, the expression remained throughout time, including real banknotes. Despite recent discussions and requests by secularist sectors of civil society for the phrase to be removed, it continues to be printed by the Central Bank, including new banknotes, printed since 2010. Faced with attempts to remove the phrase on the banknotes by the Public Ministry, José Sarney stated: \\"I feel sorry for the man who does not believe in God on the face of the earth\\". == Controversies ==  Criticism  religious diversity in Brazil is not represented by a phrase which privileges only monotheistic religions. In the image, the ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, in a meeting with adherents of different religions of the country The phrase \\"God be praised\\" creates arguments because, according to some, it would be contrary to the secular state, which does not privilege any religion, although there is no consensus on the part of the religious communities, especially the Christian ones. To many people, the phrase would not take into account the existence of non-theistic communities such as agnostics, Buddhists and atheists, as well as adherents of other non- monotheistic religions, such as Hinduism and Afro-Brazilian religions, but the population is in its vast majority adept of Christianity, which does not imply popular dissatisfaction due to the phrase in the coin.  Attempts of removal  In December 2010, the Federal Public Ministry in São Paulo notified the Central Bank to offer an answer on behalf of an \\"offense to the secularism of the Federative Republic of Brazil\\", suing the Central Bank for keeping the term \\"God be praised\\" in real banknotes. On November 12, 2012, the Regional Attorney's Office for Citizens' Rights asked the Federal Court to order the removal of the expression \\"God be praised\\" from the national currency banknotes, so as not to privilege any religion since the state is secular. The lawsuit was filed by Catholic prosecutor Jefferson Aparecido Dias. According to Dias, the measure \\"would not cause expenses to the public finances, since a period of 120 days would be given so that the Casa da Moeda (Brazilian mint) begins to print the new notes without the phrase\\". He also said that no law authorizes the inclusion of religious expressions in money. In addition, he said that the purpose of the lawsuit is to safeguard the right of religious freedom of all citizens. \\"Let's imagine the real note with the following expressions: Allah be praised, Buddha be praised, Save Oxossi, Save Lord Ganesha, God does not exist. There would certainly be agitation in Brazilian society because of the embarrassment suffered by citizens believers in God,\\" says an excerpt from the Attorney's complaint. Christian and political leaders came out with strong criticisms of the representation. Pastor Silas Malafaia said in a video posted on his website that the prosecutor is the same person who accepted and filed a homophobia complaint against him: \\"I'm suspicious that this prosecutor has nothing to do. I think the Attorney General has to get a job for this citizen\\". Malafaia also recalled that the Constitution is presented as being elaborated \\"under the protection of God\\", and that the prosecutor should also propose the change of the name of states such as Santa Catarina (\\"St. Catherine\\"), São Paulo (\\"St. Paul\\") and Espírito Santo (\\"Holy Ghost\\"), in addition to national Catholic holidays. The secretary-general of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), which is part of the Catholic Church hierarchy, Archbishop Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, said: \\"We should be concerned about much more essential things. Many people will only notice the phrase after this lawsuit. This type of lawsuit is not new! The phrase will now recall the presence of God in the life of the Brazilian people\\". For Dom Leonardo, the expression \\"does not embarrass, but it can annoy those who say they do not believe\\". \\"People who live their faith, in their various expressions, certainly do not feel embarrassed, for they live on the greatness of transcendence. It's that faith is not at first worshipping a god, but relationship. If the phrase reminds of a relationship, it could be remembered that money itself must be at the service of people, especially the poor, in sharing and in solidarity. If so, God be praised!\\" says the bishop.  Court's decision  On November 30, 2012, the Federal Court denied the Federal Public Prosecutor's request to enforce the Federal Government and the Central Bank to remove, in up to 120 days, the phrase of Brazilian real notes. In three pages of the decision, it is reported that the Public Ministry did not provide evidence that there was \\"opposition to the statements inscribed on the banknote within the social sphere\\". The judge pointed out that the Federal Public Ministry in São Paulo did not listen to secular or religious institutions of other denominations demonstrating opposition to the presence of the phrase in the banknotes. The court decision said that \\"the citation of God in the notes does not seem to be a targeting of the state in the life of an individual that forces him to adopt or not a certain belief\\". The preliminary decision was subsequently sustained.

Belt conveyor systems are widely utilized for continuous transport of dry bulk materials (i.e. coal, iron ore) over varying distances. A vast variety of industries like the mining, power sector, cement production, and bulk terminals rely on the performance of belt conveyor systems. Compared with other bulk haulage modes like the trucking and railway, belt conveyor systems provide many advantages such as a higher capacity, lower cost, higher efficiency, less human involvement and proven reliability (Roberts, 1981; Smith and Spriggs, 1981).[X. Liu, Prediction of Belt Conveyor Idler Performance, Dissertation, Delft University of Technology, 2016, pg. 1] Along with the growing international trade in major bulk materials, there is an increasing demand for the transportation of bulk materials. Correspondingly, large-scale belt conveyor systems have been installed to meet the demand for higher capacity and longer distance application of continuous conveying of bulk materials (Harrison and Roberts, 1983; Lodewijks, 2011). [X. Liu, Prediction of Belt Conveyor Idler Performance, Dissertation, Delft University of Technology, 2016, pg. 1] The downtime of belt conveyor systems leads to stoppage of transportation of bulk materials, influencing subsequent material processing and production, and consequently causing serious financial loss. In a mining plant, for example, sixty percent of the plant downtime was attributed to conveyor problems (Steinberg, 1983). The downtime cost of belt conveyor systems may vary from one application to another. The financial loss due to the downtime of belt conveyor systems can be in a range of 100,000 to 200,000 Euro per hour, considering the loss of the revenue from material conveying, and shutdowns of subsequent material processing facilities (Lodewijks, 2015).[X. Liu, Prediction of Belt Conveyor Idler Performance, Dissertation, Delft University of Technology, 2016, pg. 1] Conveyor production delays and reliability issues are generally a result of a failure in one of the three main components of a conveyor system. The belt, drives/gearboxes or the conveyor rolling elements. Of which – Conveyor idlers are the most numerous component on the conveyor system. It has been shown that conveyor roller failure in underground coal mines is the premier cause of fires. This presents a significant hazard to coal mine workers.[Fernandez, M., Rodriguez, A., Pruchnicka, J., Hoischen, U., Wojtas, P., Gonzalez, J., and Cole, J. Early detection and fighting of fires in belt conveyor. Technical report, European Commission: Luxemburg, 2013. Page 16] == Inspection methods ==  Internal to the roller  Vayeron is an Australian based company that has developed a hardware sensor device which is designed to be embedded within the conveyor roller itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated conveyor roller condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within conveyor rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict conveyor roller failure. This ultimately makes conveyor roller condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime.http://www.vayeron.com.au The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the conveyor roller, using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make conveyor rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their conveyor roller products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.[Liu, X., Lodewijks, G., and Pang, Y. Intelligent maintenance of large-scale belt conveyor idler rolls: State-of- the-art and opportunities. In Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on Automated Systems and Technologies, Hannover, Germany, 2014a. page 88]https://bulkhandlingreview.com/flippingbook/2016/March-April/index.html#20  External to the roller  Externally mounted monitoring technologies are also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or vibration monitoring transducers mounted to the conveyor frame. The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure. This is because conveyor roller failure is multi-modal and is indicated over a variety of failure signals not solely identified using single mode detection systems which are characteristic of optic fibre or vibration transducers mounted to the conveyor structure.[Pang, Y. Intelligent belt conveyor monitoring and control. Phd thesis, Delft University of Technology, 2010.] == Economic benefits of conveyor roller monitoring automation ==  Increased asset utilization  Increased production levels are the key driver for most improvement projects. The operating profit from increased production levels is extra cash flow entering the business.Thieme, K.R. Economic justification of automated idler roll maintenance applications in large-scale belt conveyor systems. Technical report, Delft University of Technology, 2014. Page 66-67  Maintenance cost control  The improvement project can focus on decreasing the maintenance cost through more efficient operation.  (Non- human) resource allocation  Enhanced inventory control or reduction in overall inventory on site due to the targeted nature of automated conveyor roller monitoring systems will generates large operational savings for the business. A more efficient and focused spare parts management, process could result in less associated business running costs. Also, improving particular equipment such as the conveyors could increase the equipment lifetime, and as such, delay future equipment replacement costs. Therefore, reducing the components total cost of ownership (TCO).  Human resource allocation  In the case of adapting a more maintenance conducive technologies and strategies, fewer personnel may be required.  HSE compliance  Companies must comply more and more with Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) regulations. This can result in negative cash flows from high penalties and/or loss of a license to operate. ==References== Category:Bulk material handling Category:Belt drives Category:Supply chain management Category:Occupational safety and health Category:Nondestructive testing ","title":"Automated conveyor roller condition monitoring"},{"id":"54242069","text":"ES Marks Athletics Field is located in Kensington, Sydney, Australia.

The book was originally published in Spanish in 2010 as Los migrantes que no importan (The Migrants that Don't Matter). It was translated into English in 2013 by Daniela Maria Ugaz and John B. Washington. The book follows the harsh journey of Central American immigrants on the El tren de la muerte to the United States. == Background == The author Óscar Martínez Martinez works as a journalist for El Faro. He spent a year travelling with the migrants across Mexico along with a crew of photographers and filmmakers and made eight trips aboard the freight trains on the El tren de la muerte. The book is a compilation of a series of stories published in the newspaper. The book was first published in 2010 by Icaria and El Faro and a second edition was released by Mexican publishers sur+ Ediciones in 2012. The English translation was published by Verso Books and has an introduction by Francisco Goldman. == Reception == The book was met with largely positive reviews. The Guardian called it a 'gale-force book' and appreciated the 'raw authenticity' of the prose. The New York Times felt that the title change from the Spanish version was to 'subtly shift the emphasis to the train and away from its reluctant passengers' and felt that the translation takes away some of the 'sizzle of the original'. They however lauded the 'graceful, incisive writing' and called it an honorable successor to The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell and How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis. The Economist drew parallels with Joan Didion's book Salvador while also appreciating the translation work. Financial Times lauded the 'precise, empathetic and often poetic language' of the writer which 'summons rage and pity but also admiration in the reader'. Martinez won the WOLA-Duke book award for The Beast in 2014.

It is notable for being the first appearance of Buzz Buzzard in a cartoon since 1955 Bunco Busters. He also would appear in the following cartoon. In addition to Grace Stafford, who provides Woody's voice, Dal McKennon provided Buzz's voice. ==Summary== Buzz Buzzard's Benny's Beanery is not in the greatest situation, as there are no customers. Buzz then watches TV to see a contest, whose contestant is Woody Woodpecker. Woody is given the prize-winning question, to say who built the Ark. Woody doesn't know the answer and says No, but the host misinterprets as he says Noah and gives him the prize, which is a new car, a trip to West and one-thousand dollars. Once Buzz hears this, he builds a plan. Next scene, we see Woody driving his new car in the forest-desert transition. Buzz pokes out of a stone, and puts his plan into action, posing as a hitchhiker, and Woody allows him to ride. Buzz asks Woody for a cigarette, but since Woody doesn't smoke, he doesn't have one. Buzz innocently whistles and starts beating the car, pretending it's a tire with a hole. He advises Woody to stop and take a look, but as Woody does that, Buzz drives off, with Woody running after him. Now at the desert, Woody disguises himself as a lady, who successfully foils Buzz. The buzzard offers her a ride, but he is left behind, as Woody laughs at him. Next scene, Buzz's plan involves him doing a fake fall, and Woody passes straight ahead of him. Woody notices him and goes back and forth, hitting Buzz a few times. Woody finally offers the buzzard a ride, but before he could sit, Woody runs the car at high speed and into the horizon. Buzz's next plan involves using a switch- controlled plaque to stop Woody. Once the woodpecker stops, Buzz Buzzard demands Woody's cash. Just then, a train whistle is heard, and Buzz is hit by a train. Buzz is also run over by Woody's car. The buzzard's next plan has him dig a big hole and place in the road a sign that reads STOP HOLE IN ROAD. Hearing the woodpecker coming, Buzz jumps in the hole. Woody sees the advice and not believing it, Woody covers the hole (with Buzz Buzzard inside) and continues his trip. The buzzard's next plan has an electric beam, which will activate a spring with a glove box, knocking down the woodpecker. As Woody comes, Buzz activates the trap, and hides himself to see his plan executed. However, Woody goes through with no problem, as the trap apparently failed to work. Buzz goes to check this in person, only to be a victim of his own execution. Next, in an old shack, Buzz Buzzard puts a sign that says FREE BOX LUNCH. Woody passes by, but quickly goes back once he see the sign (as he was hungry at the time), and enters the place. He is received by a man with glasses and a big orange beard (actually Buzz Buzzard disguised). The man gives Woody the free box lunch. Buzz takes off his disguise and hides in Woody's car. Meanwhile, in the house, Woody found only a lollipop with a flag in the box. Woody didn't like this and goes away in his car. He then tells the audience that he has the feeling of being followed. Just then, Buzz pops out from the car's back and threatens to shoot Woody if he doesn't hand over the money. As Buzz Buzzard counts – one, two three, the woodpecker then sees that his car has a Seat Ejector and activates it, sending Buzz into the sky in the last minute. Once there, he's hit by an airplane and dragged away. Woody ends this short with his laugh and drives away toward the horizon. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia - 1969.

From 1512 until 1832, the Comptroller was mainly responsible for all British naval spending and directing the business of the Navy Board from 1660 as its chairman. The position was abolished in 1832 when the Navy Board was merged into the Board of Admiralty. The comptroller was based at the Navy Office. ==History== The post was originally created in 1512 during the reign of Henry VIII of England when the post holder was styled as the Clerk Comptroller until 1545 in 1561 the name was changed to Comptroller of the Navy. He presided over the Board from 1660, and generally superintended the business of the Navy Office, and was responsible for the offices dealing with bills, accounts and wages during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the eighteenth century the principal officer responsible for estimating annual stores requirements, inspecting ships' stores and maintaining the Fleet's store-books and repair-bills was the Surveyor of the Navy; however, his duties passed increasingly to the Comptroller of the Navy during the latter half this period. The office of Surveyor did not altogether disappear. In 1832 the Comptroller's department was abolished following a merger of the Navy Board with the Board of Admiralty and the Surveyor was made the officer responsible under the First Naval Lord for the material departments, and became an adviser to the Board of Admiralty. In 1860 the name of the office was changed to Controller of the Navy and in 1869 his office merged with the office of the Third Naval Lord and then became known as Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy, he became independent of the First Naval Lord and himself a member of the Board of Admiralty.30px This article contains text from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. © Crown copyright. ==Office holders== Included: Clerk Comptrollers of the Navy *John Hopton, 1512-1524 *Vice-Admiral, Sir Thomas Spert, 1524-1540 *John Osborne, 1540-1545 *William Broke, 1545-1561 Comptrollers of the Navy *Vice-Admiral, William Holstocke, 1561–1580 *William Borough, 1580–1598 *Sir Henry Palmer 1598–1611 *Sir Guylford Slingsby, 1611–1631 *Sir Henry Palmer, 1632–1641 *Vice-Admiral, Sir George Cateret, 1641–1642 *Sir Robert Slingsby, 1st Baronet, 31 August 1660 - 28 November 1661 *Vice-Admiral, Sir John Mennes, 28 November 1661 – 15 April 1671 * Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, 15 April 1671 – 28 January 1680 * Thomas Hayter, 28 January 1680 - 2 February 1682 *Vice-Admiral, Sir Richard Haddock, 2 February 1682 – 1686 :Post vacant 1686-1688 *Admiral, Sir Richard Haddock, 12 October 1688 – 16 March 1715 *Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Wager, 16 March 1715 – 23 April 1718 *Thomas Swanton, 23 April 1718 - 9 February 1723 *Vice Admiral James Mighells, 9 February 1723 – 27 April 1734 *Captain Richard Haddock, 27 April 1734 – 27 March 1749 *Captain Savage Mostyn, 27 March 1749 – 28 February 1755 *Commodore Edward Falkingham, 28 February 1755 - 25 November 1755 *Captain Charles Saunders, 25 November 1755 – 24 June 1756 *Captain Digby Dent, 24 June 1756 - 29 December 1756 *Captain George Cockburne, 29 December 1756 – 6 August 1770 *Captain Sir Hugh Palliser, 6 August 1770 – 12 April 1775 *Captain Maurice Suckling, 12 April 1775 – 7 August 1778 *Admiral Charles Middleton, 7 August 1778 – 29 March 1790 *Captain Sir Henry Martin, 29 March 1790 – 25 September 1794 *Captain Sir Andrew Hamond, 25 September 1794 – 3 March 1806 *Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Thompson, 3 March 1806 – 20 June 1806 *Admiral Sir Thomas Byam Martin, 20 June 1806 – 2 November 1831 *Rear-Admiral Hon.

It is hydroxylated into the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol and 4-hydroxyestradiol and into estriol (16α-hydroxyestradiol), reactions which are catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes predominantly in the liver, but also in various other tissues. ==2-Hydroxylation== Addition of a hydroxyl group at C2 represents the major hepatic pathway for estradiol metabolism, as mediated by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Extrahepatic 2-hydroxylation is chiefly mediated by CYP1A1 and CYP3A4. 2-Hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) can experience three metabolic fates: methylation to yield 2-meOHE2, oxidation to form quinones, or dehydrogenation to yield 2-OHE1. 2-OHE2 can bind to estrogen receptors but with markedly lower affinity. This metabolite has several physiological consequences: the ability to influence intracellular signalling, adenohypophyseal hormone secretion, radical and quinone formation, and inhibition of tumor formation. Weak carcinogenic activity has been shown, likely due to radical formation and induction of single-strand DNA breaks. Inactivation of 2-OHE2 is catalysed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), with COMT exhibiting a faster rate for the methylation of 2-OHE2 versus 4-OH-E2. COMT, a blood-borne enzyme, mediates the most common form of 2- or 4-hydroxyestradiol inactivation, in addition to glucuronidation and sulfation. However, this inactivation can allow for the accumulation of 4-OHE2, as 2-OHE2 inhibits 4-OHE2 methylation by COMT, but 4-OHE2 does not inhibit 2-OH-E2 methylation in return. Antitumor activity of 2-meOE2 is thought to be mediated by antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects. Inhibition of cellular proliferation and metastasis appears to be via induction of caspase-8, followed by caspase-3 and eventually DNA fragmentation. Induction of apoptosis by 2-meOE2 may be p53 dependent or independent. 2-meOE2 has also been found to inhibit aromatase activity, thereby lowering the in situ synthesis of E2 in cancer tissue. 2-meOE2 has a higher binding affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) than E2 and 2-OH-E2 and has no affinity for the estrogen receptor. 2-meOE2 is also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in tumor tissues. Administration of this estradiol metabolite prevents vascular smooth muscle growth. This inhibition of angiogenesis is eliminated by co-administration with cytochrome P450 and COMT inhibitors, thereby confirming the involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the blockade of tumor blood supply. Further antitumor activity of 2-meOE2 has been identified through immunomodulation. The cytokines IL-6 and TNFα, as well the prostaglandin PGE2, are capable of stimulating aromatase activity. Since macrophages and lymphocytes are present in breast tissue, this provides a concerning means of upregulating in situ estradiol biosynthesis. 2-meOE2 appeared to be able to halve the basal aromatase activity in mammary fibroblasts, possibly through destabilisation of the microtubules that mediate translocation of the cytokine receptors to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of cytokine receptor synthesis and blockade of the autocrine and paracrine actions of cytokines and PGE2 were also observed. ==4-Hydroxylation== CYP- mediated metabolism of 4-OH-E2. Carcinogenic changes are shown in orange. Protective changes are show in blue. Note that this scheme is identical to that for 2-OH-E2, with the hydroxyl, methoxy and quinone groups occurring at C-2 instead of C-4. The enzyme most responsible for estradiol 4-hydroxylation is CYP1B1. In humans, CYP1B1 mRNA and protein exhibit constitutive expression in the lung and kidney, as well as estrogen-regulated tissues such as breast, ovary and uterus. Whereas 4-hydroxylation constitutes the minor pathway in the liver, the greater proportion of CYP1B1 expression in extrahepatic tissues shifts the balance in favor of 4-OH-E2 formation. 4-OH-E2 is thought to be the most carcinogenic of all the estradiol metabolites, especially considering that CYP1B1 exhibits overexpression in breast cancer tumors. 4-OH-E2, like 2-OH-E2, can be physiologically active as well as tumorigenic. 4-OH-E2 is capable of binding ER with a reduced dissociation rate and prolonged activation, thereby inducing cellular growth and proliferation, adenohypophyseal hormone secretion, and prostaglandin production. Das et al. implicated 4-OH-E2 in the induction of estrogen-responsive genes, a response that exhibited partial or no abrogation by coadministration with an antiestrogen, providing evidence for the ability of 4-OH-E2 to carry out genetic upregulation via a pathway independent of ER signalling. Effects independent of ER binding include breakage of single-stranded DNA, especially when interacting synergistically with nitric oxide in human breast cancer cells and the production of quinones and free radicals. CYP1B1 can be induced by E2. ERα, after binding to estradiol, interacts with the CYP1B1 ERE to stimulate CYP1B1 expression. Thus, although E2 causes genetic changes conducive to its own inactivation, the decrease in estrogenic activity yields a toxicologically active metabolite that constitutes an additional pathway of estradiol-dependent carcinogenesis. 4-OH-E2 shares the metabolic scheme of 2-OH-E2: methylation to 4-methoxyestradiol (4-meOE2), oxidation to quinones, or dehydrogenation to 4-OH-E1. Conjugation by the ubiquitously present COMT represents the most common extrahepatic pathway of 4-OH-E2 inactivation. However, if estrogen homeostasis is imbalanced by an increase in CYP1B1 and a decrease in COMT, a greater degree of genotoxic quinone formation from 4-OH-E2 will occur. 4-OHE2 can be oxidized by microsomal CYPs or peroxidases to yield estradiol-3,4-semiquinone. This semiquinone can undergo redox cycling with oxygen to form estradiol-3,4-quinone (E2-3,4-Q) and superoxide. E2-3,4-Q can be converted back to 4-OHE2 in a single step by quinone reductase, or in two sequential steps catalysed by P450 reductase via the semiquinone intermediate. GSH / S-transferase activity can abrogate E2-3,4-Q levels via formation of glutathione conjugates. E2-3,4-Q is a potent nucleophile, and will readily react with electrophilic DNA. This yields the formation of the DNA adducts 4-OHE2-1-N7Gua and 4-OHE2-1-N3Ade via a Michael addition. Destabilization of the glycosyl bond between the nitrogenous base and ribose sugar creates apurinic sites as the unstable adducts are lost from DNA. 4-OHE2-1-N7Gua has a relatively slow depurination half-life of approx. 3 hours, allowing enough time for base excision repair mechanisms to correct the change. However, 4-OHE2-1-N3Ade exhibits instantaneous depurination, leading to error-prone repair and the induction of mutations. Indeed, E2-3,4-Q has been shown to cause A-to-G mutations in the gene coding for H¬-ras, ras being vital to the correct regulation of the cellular response to growth factors. Though 2- and 4-OHE2 have similar redox potentials and thus similar redox cycling activity, the greater carcinogenic capacity of 4-OHE2 can be attributed to its increased reactivity with DNA. Another harmful effect of estrogen redox cycling is the production of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. P450 reductase catalysis produces superoxide radicals, which can, in the presence of superoxide dismutase and Fe3+, form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals capable of damaging virtually all macromolecules. ==16α-Hydroxylation== Through the action of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and the CYP3A isoforms, 16α-hydroxyestradiol (16α-OHE2), also known as estriol, is produced in abundance during pregnancy. 16α-OHE2 can be dehydrogenated to 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1), a metabolite that has been shown to bind covalently to the estrogen receptor via Schiff base formation. This covalent linkage occurs between the steroid carbonyl and the ε-amino group of lysine. In theory, 16α-OHE1 could also bind DNA, although this has not been observed. 16α-OHE2 is a potent ER agonist, capable of levels of cellular proliferation stimulation that near those obtained with E2. Though studies in hamster kidney tumor models showed weak carcinogenicity, the carcinogenic potential of 16α-OHE2 in humans remains unknown. ==Other hydroxylations== The function of the remainder of the hydroxylated E2 metabolites (6α-, 6β-, 7α-, 12β-, 15α-, 15β-, and 16β-OHE2) remain to be elucidated. Some of these metabolites, such as 15α-OHE2, are excreted in relatively large amounts in pregnant women, possibly serving as an indicator of good fetal health. ==References== Category:Estradiol Category:Estrogens ","title":"Hydroxylation of estradiol"},{"id":"54242258","text":"Radio Padma is a Bangladeshi FM radio station.

İncirliin Cave is situated in Gökçeler Canyon in Milas district of Muğla Province, Turkey. It is the most significant one and the only show cave in a group of nearly 30 caves in the canyon area. It is on the northern hillside of Mount Manastır overlooking the canyon. The cave is long, however only about of it is open to tourism. It is a horizontal lying spring cave. Its forming was affected by a distinctive fault in a karst formation. The cave has a wide entrance. It is wide and has a clearance of . It features ponds, giant stalactites and stalagmites. There are many rooms separated from the main gallery by stalactites. The rooms are mostly connected with each other by high passages. The \\"Gösteri Salonu\\" (literally \\"Show Room\\") in the middle of the cave is elevated below the entrance level. The \\"Damlataş Galerisi\\" (\\"Dripstone Gallery\\") at the end of the show cave, which was formed on the fault, is situated higher than the entrance level. In terms of hydrogeology, the cave is in a vadose zone. It remains totally dry but becomes wet by dripping water from the cave ceiling during the rainy period. Generally, the stalactites and stalagmites in the entrance, the \\"Yarasa Galerisi\\" (\\"Bat Gallery\\"), the \\"Havuzlu Salon\\" (\\"Pond's Room\\") and the \\"Gösteri Salonu\\" are partially fossilized, while the formation of the stalactites, stalagmites, columns and draperies in the \\"Damlataş Galerisi\\" (\\"Dripstone Gallery\\") are still continuing. A great number of earthenware pieces, which are dated back to the prehistoric era and antiquity, were found in the ground at the entrance and inside the cave. By December 2016, archaeological excavations were started by the Muğla University in the section of the cave, which is not open to the public, Human and animal bones, stone tools and terracotta pieces were discovered. These finds show that the cave was inhabited in the ancient times already 8,000 years ago in 6000 BC.

The majority of the High Court held that the investigation power was spent once a prosecution had commenced and that under the Act, a corporation could not be required to answer questions. While the decision was based on the wording of the specific legislation, its ongoing significance is its foundation for the requirement that the government act as a model litigant. ==Background== Since 1855 there have been various price fixing arrangements in the Newcastle coal fields that were effective for a period in raising prices and restricting production before waning over time. In 1872 a cartel described as the Coal Vend formed and was effective in raising the price of coal from 7 shillings to 14 shillings a ton until it ceased in 1880. In around 1900 a coal owners association was formed which engaged in price fixing but without restrictions on production, however this arrangement broke down in 1903. A new Coal Vend cartel was formed that had horizontal (coal miners) and vertical (shipping companies) dimensions. The coal miners were organised in April 1906 as the Associated Northern Collieries, which comprised virtually all of the proprietors of coal mines in Newcastle and Maitland. The shipping companies joined the Coal Vend in late September 1906, initially involving were Adelaide Steamship, Howard Smith Co, Huddart Parker & Co and McIlwraith McEacharn & Co, each of which had colliery interests. The cartel later expanded to include the Union Steam Ship Company of NZ, Melbourne Steamship Co and James Patterson & Co. Australian Industries Preservation Act In 1906 the second Deakin government was in power, with support from the Labor party. Prime Minister Deakin's 'New Protection' policy was to provide tariff protection to employers in exchange for 'fair and reasonable' wages for employees. The Australian Industries Preservation Bill, introduced by Sir William Lyne in December 1905, was a part of the package of legislation drafted by the then Attorney-General, Isaac Isaacs. The reason for the Bill was explained as being to protect Australian industries from unfair competition, particularly the International Harvester Co, given the pejorative label of the \\"American Octopus Trust\\" as part of a campaign by H.V. McKay who was a Victorian manufacture of harvesters and other agricultural machinery. While the focus in 1905 was on unfair competition from foreign companies, the debate shifted during 1906 to unfair competition within Australia, including the Coal Vend. By 1907 the parliament was concerned at price fixing within Australia in oil, coal, boot and shoe machinery, bricks, confectionery, tobacco, and proprietary articles and the Australian Industries Preservation Act was amended to give the Comptroller- General of Customs investigative powers including requiring people to answer questions. Huddart Parker and Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead The first action against the Coal Vend were notices issued by Moorehead, who was an officer of Customs, requiring Huddart Parker & Co and its manager William Appleton to answer questions about the alleged arrangement that: # Huddart Parker would only purchase or ship coal from mining companies that were members of the Coal Vend; # those mining companies would only use shipping companies that were members of the Coal Vend; and #Huddart Parker had entered into various price fixing agreements about coal and shipping. There was a subtle difference between the allegations against the company and Appleton in that Appleton was suspected of breaching sections of the Act, which depended on the trade and commerce power, while Huddart Parker were suspected of breaching sections of the Act, which depended on the corporations power. Both Huddart Parker and Appleton were convicted of failing to answer the questions and challenged their convictions in the High Court. The High Court upheld the validity of the inquiry provisions and of those based on the trade and commerce power, thus upholding the conviction of Appleton. The conviction of Huddart Parker however was set aside, with the majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, holding that the provisions based on the corporations power were invalid. Their Honours were strongly influenced by the now discredited doctrine of reserved State powers, holding that the corporations power was to be construed narrowly because the trade and commerce power did not include intrastate trade and commerce such that the Parliament could not make a valid law controlling the intra-State trading operations of foreign, trading or financial corporations. The High Court prosecution The second action, R v Associated Northern Collieries, was a prosecution by the Attorney-General against each of the colliery members of Associated Northern Collieries and the original shipping companies, Adelaide Steamship, Howard Smith, Huddart Parker and McIlwraith McEacharn, commenced in June 1910. The prosecution occupied 76 hearing days between 13 April and 22 December 1911. The corporate and individual defendants challenged every aspect of the prosecution, including denials of membership of the Coal Vend, despite making and receiving payments. Isaacs J found that each of the defendants were engaged in a combination with intent to restrain inter- state trade and commerce in Newcastle coal to the detriment of the public. The shipping companies and their managing directors appealed to the High Court, primarily on the basis that the Australian Industries Preservation Act required proof of intent not just to increase prices, but to cause detriment to the public. The High Court, Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ, held in Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v R, delivered in September 1912, that the intent of the agreement was to prevent unlimited and ruinous competition and to fix the \\"hewing rate\\" paid to miners. The public was not just the consumers of coal, but also the mining companies and the workers. Raising the price paid for coal was held to be of benefit to the public of Newcastle. The intent of members of the Coal Vend was to protect the prosperity of the Newcastle & Maitland Districts. There was no proof that the public suffered a detriment and no intent to cause such a detriment. The appeal was allowed and the prosecutions were dismissed. The Attorney-General unsuccessfully appealed to the Privy Council. Melbourne Steamship inquiry and prosecution Melbourne Steamship were not a defendant in the prosecution of the original shipping companies in the High Court, however the statement of claim included its role in joining the Coal Vend. In the month before the hearing of that prosecution, commencing in April 2011, Melbourne Steamship was directed to answer various questions about its involvement in the Coal Vend. Melbourne Steamship resisted answering the questions, in which the Crown Solicitor's office stated that the answers were needed for the purposes of the prosecution of the original shipping companies. Moorehead, represented by Starke, prosecuted Melbourne Steamship, represented by Mitchell before a Police Magistrate, charged with failing to answer the questions in the time given. On 26 April 1912 the company was convicted and fined £5 plus £10 10s costs. The judgement was stayed pending an appeal to the High Court. ==The High Court== In the High Court Melbourne Steamship was again represented by Mitchell , challenged its conviction in the High Court arguing that (1) the investigative powers could not be used in aid of the pending criminal proceedings and (2) the Australian Industries Preservation Act did not require an incorporated company to answer questions. Starke continued to represent Moorehead and argued that the investigative powers included asking questions for the purposes of pending court proceedings, but not from a party to those proceedings. Investigation after prosecution commenced Griffith CJ & Barton J held that Melbourne Steamship could not be asked questions about pending prosecutions. Griffith CJ held the evident purpose of the section was in relation to the commission of an alleged offence and that once a prosecution for that offence has commenced, the investigation power has been spent. Barton J accepted that questions might have been asked for the purpose of prosecuting Melbourne Steamship, however the evidence as to the purpose of the investigation did not support that approach. Isaacs J agreed that once a prosecution had been commenced the investigation power in relation to a defendant had been exhausted. Isaacs J dissented on the basis that the motive of the Executive was irrelevant and that as Customs had the right to ask questions of a person who had not yet been charged, the request was lawful. Answers by a corporation Griffith CJ noted that definition of \\"answer questions\\" in the Act was to the best of the person's knowledge, information and belief and held that a corporation could not give evidence in that regard. Barton J similarly held that the investigation power was for the purpose of obtaining evidence and a corporation could not be a witness. Isaacs J noted that the section applied to a corporation unless there was a contrary intention and disagreed that the section demonstrated a contrary intention. Obligations of the Crown Griffith CJ stated that one of the arguments put by the government was a technical point of pleading and that it was axiomatic that the government never take a technical point, stating > I am sometimes inclined to think that in some parts – not all – of the > Commonwealth, the old-fashioned traditional, and almost instinctive, > standard of fair play to be observed by the Crown in dealing with subjects, > which I learned a very long time ago to regard as elementary, is either not > known or thought out of date. I should be glad to think that I am mistaken. ==Aftermath== The Coal Vend was the only cartel prosecuted under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. There was little interest or impact in promoting competitive markets until the late 1960s. The members of the Coal Vend had successfully resisted each of the prosecutions against them. Its role in raising pries and restricting production was challenged by a drop in the demand for coal such that it collapsed as a cartel by 1912. The Coal Vend continued to exist through to at least 1929, with the Campbell Royal Commission in 1919 finding that it had ceased to operate outside the law, and the Davidson Royal Commission in 1929 confirmed the continued existence of the Coal Vend, although again there was no suggestion of it operating illegally. The referendums The Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, had held a referendum in 1911 to amend section 51 of the Constitution to give the Australian Parliament power to make laws about \\"Combinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services\\", however this was widely rejected, obtaining support from just 39% of the voters and a majority in just one state, Western Australia.Handbook of the 44th Parliament . In 1913 the Attorney-General tried again, arguing that the changes were said to be necessary because the Commonwealth's powers had been cut down by successive decision of the High Court in applying the inter- governmental immunities and reserved state powers doctrines until they were said to be futile. Huddart Parker v Moorehead and Melbourne Steamship v Moorhead were among the cases referred to by the Attorney-General. This time the proposals were divided into six different questions, with each question addressing a different power. While it was proposed that the Australian Parliament would have power with respect to \\"trusts, combinations, and monopolies\\" it is not apparent how the proposed change would have affected the outcome of Melbourne Steamship v Moorehead. In any event there was a significant increase in support for all questions, however each question fell just short of a majority of voters, and a majority of the voters was achieved in 3 out of 6 states, Writs were issued for a further referendum to be held on 11 December 1915 to cover substantially the same questions as were rejected in 1911 and 1913, however the referendum was cancelled and the writs withdrawn. In 1926 the proposal from Prime Minister Bruce was again a compendium of measures, of which power to make laws about trusts and combinations in restraint of trade was a part. The proposal was supported by just 44% of voters, and a majority of the voters was achieved in 2 out of 6 states, {  + Results ----- ! align=\\"left\\"  Year   Question ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  NSW ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  Vic ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  Qld ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  SA ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  WA ! style=\\"width:50px\\" align=center  Tas ! style=\\"width:70px\\" align=center States in favour ! style=\\"width:70px\\" align=center  Voters in favour !

While aspects of the model litigant obligations are found in policy documents,eg Appendix B to the Schedule to the Legal Directions 2005 (Cth) issued by the Commonwealth Attorney-General under the . the obligations have been held to be broader and more fundamental..

He was the author or editor of several important early books on jazz history. Smith began to collect early hot jazz records in the 1920s and worked with William Russell, Eugene Williams, John Hammond, Hugues Panassié and Charles Delaunay in the Hot Record Society from 1937, from which the jazz label HRS Records sprang. With Steve Smith he was editor of the jazz magazine Hot Record Society Rag.Ralph de Toledano: Frontiers of Jazz 1994. p. 56 With essays in journals such as the Symposium, Daily Worker and Esquire, Smith was among the early jazz critics in the 1930s. With Frederic Ramsey (1915–1995) he published the book Jazzmen, which appeared in 1939 and, with Wilder Hobson's American Jazz Music, was one of America's first jazz books, with articles on groups like the Austin High School Gangabstract of Charles Edward Smits's article on the Austin High Gang from RedHotJazz and interviews From early jazz musicians like Willie Cornish, Papa Jack Laine, Leon Roppolo and Nick LaRocca. Smith and Ramsey argued that then-popular swing was rooted stylistically in blues and traditional jazz.Lewis A. Erenberg: Swingin' the Dream: Big Band Jazz and the Rebirth of American Culture In the course of the research on the book, the interviewed musicians mentioned the name Bunk Johnson again and again; This led to the then-forgotten trumpeter of New Orleans Jazz being rediscovered by Bill Russell in 1942. With the 1942 Jazz Record Book, an attempt was made to generate a canon of important jazz records, which was later taken up by many other writers, including Marshall Stearns's The Story of Jazz, Joachim-Ernst Berendt/Günther Huesmann's jazz book , Barry Kernfeld's Encyclopedia of Jazz, and Allen Lowe's That Devilin' Tune.Ben Ratliff: Ultimate Box of Jazz?

Smith also wrote the accompaniment text for the LP edition of John Hammond's Concert Series, From Spirituals to Swing – Carnegie Hall Concerts, 1938/39 (Vanguard).

The station was on the original section of the line between Abercynon and Quakers Yard, which was to the left of the present-day line. The eponymous Incline was a steep gradient of 1 in 22, and trains required a stationary winding engine (installed by Brunel) to surmount it. The station was accessible only by a steep flight of steps leading to the bottom of a deep cutting in the incline. The station's life was brief and it closed after 12 years. The original line was eventually abandoned completely and replaced in 1864. After the station closed, it was left to decay until being largely destroyed by a violent cyclone on 27 October 1913, a storm, which caused considerable damage across the district, including destroying the spire of St. Mary's Church, Glyntaff. The site of the station is now overgrown with trees and is not easily noticeable. ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Former Taff Vale Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1846 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1858 ","title":"Incline Top railway station"},{"id":"54243431","text":"Tatiana Shumiakina (; born 4 October 1965) is a Russian chess player who holds the title of Woman Grandmaster (WGM, 1994). ==Chess career== In 1990 Tatiana Shumiakina won bronze medal in USSR Women's Chess Championship.

Wadi Bou Sellam descends from the southern slopes of Mount Megris; It is formed of five streams, Wadi Mahouan, Wadi Mohammed el Hannach, oued Ouricia, Wadi Goussimet and Wadi Fermatou, which meet north of Setif. The river then takes the name Oued Bou Sellam; It runs first south-south-west, passes three kilometers west of Setif, and crosses the chain in which it takes its source between djebel Tafat and Guergour. The Oued Bou Sellam receives the wadi Malah, taking its source to Aïn Arnat in the dam Aïn Zada. After crossing the Aïn Zada dam, it crosses the Khelil commune by the east and receives two new tributaries, Wadi Khelil, which flows from the left bank in Besbassa halfway between El Kherba and the Aïn Zada dam and the wadi Taissa shortly before on the right bank. Throughout this part of the course, the Bou Sellam watered the rich plain of Ameur, Ouled Mosli and Gherazla.

The opera was a joint commission between Music Theatre Wales, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Theater Magdeburg and Scottish Opera. As produced by Music Theatre Wales, the opera received its world premiere on 10 October 2014, in a production by Music Theatre Wales at the Linbury Studio Theatre, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (London). The German premiere at the Theater Magdeburg occurred on 2 April 2015. Scottish Opera first staged the work at the Theatre Royal Glasgow on 24 January 2017. The North American premiere was on 4 June 2017 at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. For all of these stagings, Michael McCarthy was the stage director, and the set design was by Simon Banham, both from Music Theatre Wales. This work, Glass' 26th opera, is the third opera collaboration between Glass and Hampton. Hampton has acknowledged that the initial idea for an opera based on The Trial originated with Glass. Glass has described the opera as one of his 'pocket operas', with respect to the size of the instrumental ensemble and the number of singers required, with all of the singers, except the baritone in the role of Josef K., performing multiple roles. Glass dedicated the score to Music Theatre Wales in commemoration of its 25th anniversary. He had approved of the company's earlier stagings of his operas, and offered them a reduction in his standard commission fee to reduce the financial burden on the organisation for this commission and production. ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 10 October 2014 (Conductor: Michael Rafferty) !Continental Europe premiere cast, 2 April 2015 (Conductor: Hermann Dukek) !North America premiere cast, 4 June 2017 (Conductor: Carolyn Kuan) - Josef K. baritone Johnny Hereford Johnny Hereford Theo Hoffman - Franz (Guard 1) tenor Michael Bennett Markus Liske Joshua Blue - Willem (Guard 2) baritone Nicholas Folwell Thomas Florio Robert Mellon - The Inspector bass Michael Druiett Paul Sketris Matthew Lau - Frau Grubach mezzo-soprano Rowan Hellier Sylvia Rena Ziegler Sofia Selowsky - Fräulein Bürstner soprano Amanda Forbes Julie Martin du Theil Susannah Biller - Magistrate baritone Gwion Thomas Roland Fenes Keith Phares - Berthold, a student tenor Paul Curievici Michael J Scott Brenton Ryan - Bailiff baritone Gwion Thomas Roland Fenes Robert Mellon - Clerk of the court baritone Nicholas Folwell Thomas Florio Robert Mellon - Washerwoman, the bailiff's wife mezzo- soprano Rowan Hellier Sylvia Rena Ziegler Sofia Selowsky - A flogger tenor Paul Curievici Michael J Scott Brenton Ryan - Uncle Albert bass Michael Druiett Paul Sketris Matthew Lau - Huld baritone Gwion Thomas Roland Fenes Keith Phares - Block tenor Michael Bennett Markus Liske Joshua Blue - Leni soprano Amanda Forbes Julie Martin du Theil Susannah Biller - Titorelli tenor Paul Curievici Michael J Scott Brenton Ryan - Priest baritone Nicholas Folwell Thomas Florio Robert Mellon - First executioner tenor Michael Bennett Markus Liske Joshua Blue - Second executioner baritone Nicholas Folwell Thomas Florio Robert Mellon - } ==Synopsis== Act 1 On his 30th birthday, a bank manager, Josef K., is arrested at his flat for an unidentified crime. Neither the guards, Franz and Willem, nor the police inspector offer any explanation, although all of K.'s neighbours seem to understand better than K. why they are present. Franz and Willem inappropriately look through Josef K.'s belongings, to the latter's annoyance. After observing Josef K.'s reaction to his arrest, the inspector allows K. to go to work. Later that same evening, K., apologises to his landlady, Frau Grubach, for the disturbance that morning resulting from his arrest. K. meets a fellow tenant, Fräulein Bürstner, and tells her of his arrest. She is drawn to his plight, and he abruptly kisses her. K. locates the court in an inconspicuous urban block. A washerwoman guides him in, where he learns that everyone there is waiting for him. K. protests the proceedings, and a sudden cry is heard, coming from the washerwoman, as a man presses himself on her. K. speaks in her defence and accuses the court of corruption. The magistrate warns K. that he is damaging his own case. K. returns to the court for a second hearing, to find that the court is not in session. The washerwoman tells K. that she is the wife of the bailiff. She offers herself to K. and says that she admired his protest, but that she meant her cry to interrupt him. K. examines the Magistrate's books and finds that they contain pornography. Whilst the washerwoman continues her advances toward K., the student Berthold appears and carries her off. The court usher then arrives and registers his disdain that the inhabitants of the court always carry her off. The usher posits the scenario that K. could punish Berthold for his behaviour. K. requires assistance to leave the courtroom. In his office, K. receives a visit from his uncle Albert, who berates his nephew for concealing his arrest. He then offers to bring K. to an expert barrister. K. reluctantly consents to the visit. Whilst leaving work, K. hears odd noises from another room. A flogger is whipping Franz and Willem, for their misbehaviour during their arrest of K.. When asked about the noises, K. replies that it's 'only a dog'. Act 2 K. and his uncle Albert visit the barrister Huld. Huld's maid, Leni, says that Huld is ailing. K. and Leni exchange glances. K. is surprised to hear that Huld knows all about his trial. Huld remarks on how interesting K.'s case is, and boasts of his standing in legal circles. The sound of a crashing plate in the next room causes K. to take momentary leave. Leni broke the plate deliberately to attract K.'s attention. Whilst seducing him, she suggests that he visit the painter Titorelli for assistance. Uncle Albert interrupts Leni and K. in flagrante, and berates K. for this behaviour, saying that K. has severely damaged his case by his flirtation with Huld's mistress. K. visits Titorelli in the artist's attic. Noisy neighbouring girls constantly interrupt Titorelli. Titorelli explains that he is acquainted with many judges. He asks K. whether he is innocent, and K. replies yes. K. then states his impression that once the court arrests someone, it is difficult to convince the court of his innocence. Titorelli replies that it is more than difficult, essentially impossible. He tells K. that his trial has three possible outcomes: genuine acquittal, apparent acquittal, or postponement.The original German term used by Kafka, Verschleppung, more accurately translates as 'protraction'. K.'s trial continues to proceed and is never 'postponed'. Kafka, Franz, The Trial (translated by Breon Mitchell). Schoken Books (New York City, USA), , 'Translator's Foreword', p. xxv (1998). The last two require continual vigilance, which depresses K.'s spirits. Titorelli sells K. a set of identical paintings as K. departs. K. takes his leave, into what he recognises as the corridor to the court. Titorelli explains that everything there belongs to the court. At Huld's establishment, Leni is with another of Huld's clients, the businessman Block. K. sees Leni together with Block, and is jealous. Block separately confides to K. that he has 5 other barristers besides Huld on his case, unknown to Huld. He is spending all his money on his case. Block asks for a secret from K. in return. K. says that he intends to dismiss Huld as his barrister. When Huld appears and K. indicates his dispensation of Huld's services, Huld is nonplussed. Huld indicates that he is aware of Block's situation. He humiliates Block before K., querying how Block would react at the knowledge that his trial hasn't even yet begun. K. is at the city's cathedral, where a priest calls out his name. The priest states his knowledge of K.'s situation, and explains that the verdict of the trial is 'not suddenly pronounced', but instead 'slowly evolves from the proceedings'. He then tells K. a parable of 'The Door of the Law'. K. loses all hope. On the eve of his 31st birthday, Franz and Willem retrieve Josef K. from his flat. K. does not resist the guards, and briefly sees Fräulein Bürstner as the guards take him away. They take out a knife, pass it between them over his head, and dispatch him, \\"like a dog\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * Music Theatre Wales archived page on The Trial * Music Theatre Wales introductor page on The Trial * Butler, Lotte, \\"Michael McCarthy on Philip Glass's The Trial: 'an intensely musical experience'\\".

As with similar orchids, plants in flower differ from those that are not. Those not in flower have a rosette of leaves lying flat on the ground. Plants in flower lack a rosette but have up to twenty tiny green, white, and brown flowers in summer. The flowering stem has up to six stem leaves. ==Description== Pterostylis multiflora is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of three to eight egg-shaped to heart- shaped leaves that lie flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Plants in flower have between three and twenty flowers long, crowded on a spike high. Between three and six stem leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The flowers are green and white near their bases and brownish nearer the tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The galea is erect near its base but then curves forward. The lateral sepals are erect, held closely against the galea with narrow tips about long that do not project above the galea. There is a small notch in the sinus between the bases of the lateral sepals. The labellum is about long, about wide and is not visible from outside the flower. Flowering occurs from January to March. ==Taxonomy and naming== This greenhood was first formally described in 2008 by David Jones who gave it the name Speculantha multiflora and published the description in Australian Orchid Research. In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Pterostylis multiflora. The specific epithet (multiflora) is a Latin word meaning \\"many-flowered\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The tall tiny greenhood grows in open forest with grasses or shrubs in north-eastern Victoria. ==References== multiflora Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 2008 ","title":"Pterostylis multiflora"},{"id":"54243763","text":"The 2017–18 season was Szombathelyi Haladás's 62nd competitive football season, 10th consecutive season in the OTP Bank Liga and 98th year in existence as a football club. == Players == As of 7 June 2017.

Having lost the popular vote he nevertheless became legislator-at-large of the 9th Legislative Yuan but was not re-elected in 2020. He is also an entrepreneur (citation needed) and the cofounder of TEDxTaipei. Hsu was serving as a Chinese Nationalist Party non-constituency member of the Legislative Yuan, and was assigned to the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statues Committee during the 1st session of the 9th Legislative Yuan. He served as a member of the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee in the 2nd session. He is an active advocate of issues regarding education, technology, innovation, sustainability, and marriage equality. ==Early life and education== Hsu was born in 1978 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. As a child, Hsu's parents ran food stalls in a night market. He graduated the National Chengchi University in 2000 with a B.A. in English. During this time, he also studied at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia as an exchange student. At 23, Hsu traveled across Central and South America, and is a fluent speaker of both English and Spanish. In 2013 Hsu won the THNK School of Creative Leadership scholarship. In 2015 Hsu was invited to enroll in the Singularity University Executive Program and completed the Exponential Technology course. == Career == After returning from his exchange program to Monash, Hsu served for a year as an editor to the English-language newspaper, Taiwan News . With his savings from this time, he began traveling across South America, visiting Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, Costa Rica, and Peru. Hsu arrived first in Guatemala, where he stayed for six weeks and began lessons in Spanish. During this time, Hsu worked as a tutor for Chinese and took on farm work sorting coffee beans. Hsu was also employed as a tour guide while in Costa Rica. He finally returned to Taiwan after half a year in South American to fulfill his military enlistment. After his service, Hsu was asked by his college roommate, a member of the Mac software sales division (a predecessor to the Apple App Store), to help establish a startup company in San Francisco. Apple acquired the company a year and a half later and Hsu returned to Taiwan at the age of 27. After returning to Taiwan, Hsu worked as a corporate trainer for NIKE. In 2008, Hsu and his friend organized a diverse set of speakers to form \\"The Big Question Conference\\", a forerunner to TEDxTaipei. == Founding TEDx Taipei == As partner to his college roommate's Mac software venture, Hsu developed a close working relationship with more than 6000 San Francisco based developers. Starting from 2008, Hsu began writing the TED headquarters in the United States to petition for the right to hold TED events in Taiwan. While he was not able to obtain TED authorization in 2008, Hsu founded the Big Questions Inc., a consultancy focused on social innovation and future sustainability, at this time. Hsu then collaborated with a partner to launch a series of forum discussions known as \\"The Big Question Conference\\". In 2009, the TED organization released their conference licensing rights as part of the TEDx project. Hsu applied successfully for the right to host TEDx conferences and Taipei became the first city in Asia to obtain the license. At its founding, the TEDx Taipei team consisted of only three full-time and two part-time employees. With help from the Taiwan Cultural & Creative Foundation, the fledgling organization established its base of operations in the Huashan 1914 Creative Park. In 2011 Hsu became the TEDx ambassador for all of Asia, speaking at TED and TEDx conferences across the world including TEDx Summit, TEDx Kyoto, TEDx Itaewon, TEDx Wanchai and others. Hsu's stated goal at this time was to bring Taiwan's stories to the global stage. Hsu also organized the Sharable Cities Initiative in 2014, a series of hack-a-thons, forums, and workshops dedicated to increasing transparency and promoting open data through crowdsourcing. == Political career ==  Advisory Committee  In the wake of the protests that erupted in March 2014 as part of the Sunflower Movement, Hsu became involved in public affairs in an effort to better represent Taiwan's students and young generation. He helped initiate the Advisory Committee of Innovation and Education and was invited to become a member by the Premier. As an advisor, Hsu offered policy suggestions to the Executive Yuan and participated government meetings. In 2016, he was elected by the Chinese Nationalist Party to serve as a non-constituency member of the Legislative Yuan.  Support of Marriage Equality  Hsu was one of the few legislators in support of LGBT rights within the KMT. An adamant believer in amending the civil code, Hsu has voiced his resolute opposition to introducing special laws for the protection of LGBT rights. Hsu has stated that not amending the civil code would be an act of open discrimination to the LGBT community. As a legislator, Hsu believed that Taiwan should act as a leader for LGBT rights in Asia and become the first nation in the region to secure LGBT equality. Seeking bipartisan support, Hsu put forward a bill that would \\"make LGBT equality the pride of Taiwan\\". During the National Legislative Yuan Forum, Hsu expressed his concern for the difficulties facing the LGBT community in Taiwan, noting the historical lack protection under the law. Current legislation excludes same-sex partners from the right to marriage, adoption, and decision-making during medical emergencies. Hsu has stated, \\"It is as if, for the LGBT community, the law is nothing more than a useless piece of paper, the current legislation offers them very little protection\\". Working across party lines, Hsu has proposed to amend the provisions regarding family, inheritance, and other articles relating to the protection of LGBT rights within the Civil Code.

He has represented England at under-21 level. He began his career at his hometown club Norwich City, before joining Manchester City in 2011, eventually signing his first professional contract in 2013. After spending the 2017–18 season on loan at boyhood club Norwich, enjoying a good run of performances throughout the entire Championship campaign, Gunn signed for Southampton in the summer of 2018, for a transfer fee of £13.5 million. ==Early life== Gunn was born in Norwich, Norfolk, to Norwich City's former goalkeeper and manager Bryan and artist Susan Gunn. His father is originally from Thurso, Caithness, in the far north of Scotland. Gunn attended Alpington Primary School and Framingham Earl High School. ==Club career== Manchester City Gunn began his career at his hometown club Norwich City, before moving to Manchester City in 2011, for which a tribunal decided Manchester City had to pay £250,000. He signed a three-year professional contract in June 2013. He was named on the substitutes bench on a number of occasions throughout the 2016–17 season, but did not play for Manchester City that season. For the 2017–18 season, Gunn was loaned back to Norwich of the EFL Championship. He made his first-team debut in Norwich's first match of the season, away to Fulham. He got his first professional football clean sheet on 16 August 2017, in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road. He would ultimately be the only player to be ever present for Norwich in the league during the season, also being ever present in the FA Cup and making three appearances in the EFL Cup. At the end of the season, Norwich fans voted him third in the Player of the Season vote behind James Maddison and Grant Hanley. Southampton Gunn joined Southampton in July 2018, signing a five-year deal with the club, for a fee estimated at £13.5 million. He made his debut for the club on 28 August 2018 in an EFL Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion, and his Premier League debut on 2 January 2019, making several vital saves and keeping a clean sheet and earning the man of the match award in a 0–0 draw against Chelsea.

Gunn received his first call up to the England national team in November 2017 for a friendly match against Brazil, after Jack Butland withdrew from the squad with an injury. In March 2018, Gunn was offered the opportunity by Scotland manager Alex McLeish to switch allegiances to Scotland, but decided to stay with the England national team, and was called up by Gareth Southgate to their training camp ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Career statistics== { class=  center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2EFL Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=1Manchester City 2017–18 Premier League 0000000000 - Norwich City (loan) 2017–18 Championship 4602030colspan=2—510 - rowspan=4Southampton 2018–19 Premier League 1202030colspan=2—170 - 2019–20 Premier League 1003000colspan=2—130 - 2020–21 Premier League 000000colspan=2—00 - !colspan=2Total !22!!0!!5!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!30!!0 - Stoke City (loan) 2020–21 Championship 000000colspan=2—00 - !colspan=3Career total !68!!0!!7!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!81!!0 } ==Honours== England U21 *Toulon Tournament: 2016 ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Southampton FC profile Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Norwich Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:English people of Scottish descent ","title":"Angus Gunn"},{"id":"54244223","text":"Grethe Lovsø Nielsen (10 March 1926 - 9 March 2017) was a Danish sprinter.

About fifty were built and the type became well known as an aerobatic aircraft, performing at many displays in the hands of pilots like Gerhard Fieseler. ==Design and development== In November 1925 test pilot Antonius Raab and engineer Katzenstein formed the Kassel-based company that bears their name. They had previously worked at Dietrich Flugzeugwerke, a company which ran into financial problems in 1925. Their first design, known initially as the KL.1 Schwalbe, was a development of the Dietrich-Gobiet DP.XI. Later, in a rationalisation of the company's naming system, it became the RK.1 Schwalbe. The Schwalbe was a single bay biplane with thick section, unequal span wooden wings which were built around twin spars and fabric covered. The wings had marked stagger and were braced between the spars with forward leaning, steel tube, N-form interplane struts. The lower wing was attached directly to the lower fuselage, from which the inner upper wing was braced with an outward leaning pair of parallel struts to the spars and held over the upper fuselage by a pair of inverted V-struts, one on each side, to the forward spar alone. The wings were straight-tapered in plan, with only slight sweep on the leading edge, out to rounded tips. They also tapered in thickness. The Schwalbe had ailerons on both wings, externally connected with vertical rods. The upper ailerons had large balances to serve both surfaces. The Schwalbe's rectangular section fuselage had a steel tube structure and was fabric covered. The first examples, designated KL.IA, were powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 11 seven cylinder radial engine, partially enclosed by a dural cowling which left the cylinders projecting for cooling. Its fuel tank was within the upper wing and the oil tank behind a firewall. Two later versions of the Schwalbe, designated KL.1B and KL.IC, were powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 12 nine cylinder radial. The forward open cockpit was under the wing but it was flown solo from the rear cockpit which was over the trailing edge of the lower wing and behind that of the upper wing, where there was a cut-out to increase the pilot's field of view. A large, almost triangular tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried generous, curved and balanced elevators. Its fin was small but the rudder large and balanced, reaching down to the keel and working in an elevator cut-out. The Schwalbe had fixed, conventional landing gear, with its mainwheels on a split axle sprung by rubber cords to V-struts from the lower fuselage and stabilized centrally by a transverse V-strut. There was a short, steel tailskid. ==Operational history== Piloted by Raab, the Schwalbe first flew on 16 January 1926. Numbers built are uncertain but have been estimated at forty-two or about fifty-eight. Engines apart, the unknown differences between the variants were small enough to allow several airframes to have been IAs, IBs and ICs over their lifetime. Several well known pilots used them as aerobatic aircraft, including Gerhard Fieseler who was regarded as the best and most innovative aerobatic pilot of his day. In September 1927 he claimed a world duration record for inverted flight in his Schwalbe KL.IC. at a Zurich meeting, then bettered it later in the month with a fifteen minute flight. He gave aerobatic demonstrations in his Schwalbe during 1927-8 at several other European meetings including Blackpool and Waalhaven. One Schwalbe was on display at the 1928 Berlin International Aero Show. ==Variants== Company catalogue advertising the KL.IA variant ;KL.IA: Original design with Siemens- Halske Sh 11 engine. ;KL.IB: More powerful Siemens-Halske Sh 12. ;KL.IC: Siemens-Halske Sh 12. ;Schwalbe II: Version of KL.IC built in Greece by AEKKEA-RAAB, which was established in 1935. ;Pintsch Schwalbe II: derivative by Pintsch ;Rheinische FR-2 Schwalbe :Derivative by Flugzeugbau Rheinische ==Specifications (KL. 1A) == Raab-Katzenstein RK 1a Schwalbe 3-view drawing from L'Air January 1, 1927 ==References== Category:Raab-Katzenstein aircraft Category:Aerobatic aircraft Category:1920s German civil trainer aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1926 ","title":"Raab-Katzenstein KL.1 Schwalbe"},{"id":"54244413","text":"Leila Farrukh gizi Shikhlinskaya (Azerbaijan Leyla Fәrrux qızı Şıxlinskaya, born June 12, 1947) is an Azerbaijani and Soviet actress, choreographer- teacher and professor.

Dominic Aduna Bingab Nitiwul (born November 4, 1977) is a Ghanaian politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for the Bimbilla constituency in the Northern Region of Ghana. He has also served in the Pan-African Parliament. Since February 2017, Nitiwul has held the office of Minister of Defence of Ghana. ==Education== Dominic Nitiwul studied in various educational institutions in Ghana, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Dominic completed his O level at St Charles Secondary and Seminary School in 1992. In Germany he earned certificates in conflict prevention (2003) and conflict management (2005) from the International Academy for Leadership. He obtained his Master of Business Administration in finance from the University of South Wales, and a Master of Laws in corporate finance from the University of Westminster. ==Parliamentarian== Nitiwul was elected to the parliament of Ghana in 2002 at the age of 25. In his victory speech, he alluded to the fact that he wanted to be graded on the level of peace he would bring to the constituency. This was due to the protracted tribal dispute between the Konkomba people and the Nanumba people. He has served on many committees in both the Ghanaian parliament and the Pan-African Parliament. These include: Finance Committee, Monetary and Financial Affairs Committee, Business Committee, Appointment Committee, Youth and Sports Committee, Roads and Transport Committee, and Education Committee. He was the Deputy Minority Leader of the Ghanaian Parliament from 2012 to 2016. 2016 Parliamentary election Nitiwul won the 2016 Parliamentary elections for his constituency by defeating the National Democratic Congress candidate Dr Joseph Mamboah Rockson. Prior to the elections Nitiwul had announced that he would win due to the fact that his opponent was not a native of the constituency and was not abreast with what was happening in the constituency; he also cited the numerous developmental projects he had undertaken. His opponent opined that Nitiwul had served for far too long and believed the constituents needed a new face. Developmental projects Nitiwul has embarked on developmental projects in Bamboi to better the lot of his constituents. He had 69 boreholes drilled in various communities in his constituencies, and got the Electricity Company of Ghana to extend electricity to 16 communities. He built two clinics, twelve roads projects, and classroom blocks. ==Minister of Defence== On 13 January 2017 Nitiwul was part of the first group of ministers designate nominated by President Nana Akuffo-Addo. His nomination was for the Ministry of Defence. This was done after his party, the New Patriotic Party, had won power in the 2016 Ghanaian general election. Nitiwul was approved for the ministry by members of the Ghanaian parliament, along with eight others. His oath of office was administered by President Akuffo-Addo on 27 January 2017. Galamsey fight Nitiwul has made the fight against illegal miners, known as galamseyers, one of his main objectives as Minister of Defence. Illegal operators mine for precious metals in various parts of Ghana with little or no regard for the environment. Several bodies of water in the country have dried up due to the environmental degradation caused by the mining, and drinking water has been polluted with harmful chemicals such as cyanide. Previous governments had tried and failed to curb the illegal mining due to a lack of concerted effort. Working with the military high command of the Ghana Armed Forces and the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, Nitiwul helped roll out measures to seize machinery, drive out the miners, and restore degraded lands in the country. Mob justice fight When Major Maxwell Mahama was lynched in May 2017, Nitiwul promised that a thorough investigation would be initiated to identify and arrest the culprits. Mahama had been mistaken for an armed robber and lynched by some inhabitants of Diaso. ==Cabinet Minister== In May, 2017, President Nana Akufo-Addo named Dominic Nitiwul as part of nineteen ministers who would form his cabinet. The names of the 19 ministers were submitted the Parliament of Ghana and announced by the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Prof. Mike Ocquaye. As a Cabinet minister, Nitiwul is part of the inner circle of the president and is to aid in key decision making activities in the country. ==Personal life== Nitiwul is married with five children. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:New Patriotic Party politicians Category:Parliament of Ghana Category:Pan-African Parliament Category:Ghanaian MPs 2005–2009 Category:Ghanaian MPs 2009–2013 Category:Ghanaian MPs 2013–2017 Category:Ghanaian MPs 2017– Category:Cabinet Ministers of Ghana Category:Ministers of Defence of Ghana ","title":"Dominic Nitiwul"},{"id":"54244435","text":"The canton of Saint-Lyé is an administrative division of the Aube department, northeastern France.

Born in Iesi, he spent most of his career in Naples and was one of the originators of the \\"salon opera\\" genre, the forerunner of chamber opera. ==Life and career== Balducci was born in Iesi to a once-prosperous family in the city. He was a distant cousin of the composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (their grandfathers were brothers). Balducci's father, a successful businessman, was kidnapped and killed on one of his travels shortly before Balducci was born. A business partner fraudulently took possession of most of his father's wealth leaving Balducci's mother and children in very straitened circumstances. Balducci studied music under the castrato singer Giovanni Ripa in Iesi and the composer in nearby Senigallia.Radiciotti, Giuseppe (1893). Teatro, musica e musicisti in Sinigaglia, p. 132.

Guida Matilde Capece Minutolo, the wife of Raimondo and mother of Paolina, Adelaide, and Clotilde for whom Balducci wrote his chamber operas By the age of 17 Balducci had formed his own opera troupe in which he also sang as the lead tenor. However, a year later he was forced to flee his native city after killing the nephew of the Papal Governor in a duel. On his arrival in Naples, he found employment as the music master to the three young daughters of Raimondo Capece Minutolo (1769–1827), a retired field marshal and member of an ancient Neapolitan noble family. Balducci would remain a member of the Capece Minutolo household for the rest of his life.Cardinali, Augusta Franco (19 January 2014). \\"Il duello, la scomunica, l'esilio\\".

Retrieved 7 June 2017 (subscription required for full access). Once he was settled in Naples, Balducci resumed his own music studies, this time with the composer Niccolò Zingarelli at the Collegio San Sebastiano. He made his debut as an opera composer with Il sospetto funesto, an opera semiseria which was produced at the Teatro del Fondo in March 1820. The critic for the Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie excoriated the hackneyed libretto based on a play which had been circulating throughout Italy, but reserved praise for Balducci's music. Four more operas followed, the last of which Tazia was performed at the Teatro San Carlo in 1826 with Caroline Ungher in the title role. According to Balducci's biographer Jeremy Commons, the performance was \\"sabotaged by a disaffected orchestra for unknown reasons\\", and Balducci basically retired from composing for the public theatre for the next twelve years.s.n. (16 March 1820). \\"Real Teatro del Fondo\\". Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie, p. 268 On the death of Raimondo Capece Minutolo in 1827, his widow Matilde (daughter of the former Viceroy of Mexico Bernardo de Galvez) named Balducci the guardian or tutore of her daughters Paolina, Adelaide, and Clotilde. He devoted much of his time to helping her in the administration the family's finances and the education of the three sisters. Between 1827 and 1839 Balducci composed five \\"salon operas\\" (forerunners of the modern chamber opera) which were performed by Paolina, Adelaide, and Clotilde and their friends in the family's house. Unusually for Italian operas of the day these works were composed for women's voices only. With the exception of his penultimate opera for the family, Scherzo, the musical accompaniment was scored for two pianos only. In 1838 Balducci returned to the public theatre for a final time with his opera Bianca Turenga which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo. Arias from the work were later published in Milan by Ricordi. The following year, Matilde Capece Minutolo died suddenly in Spain while attending to her properties there. After her death Balducci's responsibilities in the household increased dramatically, and he virtually ceased composing. He died in Málaga, Spain in 1845 while carrying out business affairs for the Capece Minutolo family.Fétis, François-Joseph (1873). \\"Balducci (M...)\\".

As early as 1646 he attended lectures at Wittenberg University and worked in the fields of history, mathematics and oriental languages. In 1649 he moved to the University of Leipzig, where he continued his language studies and devoted himself to the study of theology. In 1650 he returned to Wittenberg, and on the 29th of April 1651, became a doctor of philosophy. He was appointed adjunct professor of the Faculty of Philosophy on October 18, 1653, and, in 1656, professor of Mathematics as substitute of Reinhold Frankenberger. On 9 February 1658, Strauch married Martha Magarethe Sibylle Cranach (born 29 September 1634 in Wachsdorf). After Frankenberger's death, he took over as professor in 1664 as substitute for his brother Michael Strauch, who took over in 1565. Instead, Strauch took over the professorship for history and was subsequently able to devote himself to theological studies. In 1655 he received permission from the theological faculty to hold public lectures. Strauch became a theological licentiate in 1657, a doctor of theology on October 13, 1662, and in 1666 he was appointed as assessor of the theological faculty at Wittenberg University. Because of the disputes with Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, he followed a call as pastor of the Trinity Church and rector of the Gymnasium in Gdańsk. He was a polemic against calvinists, syncretists, and papists and criticized them from the pulpit and in writings. When, in 1673, he blamed the death of the king of Poland and did not comply with the Council's attempts to reach an agreement, he was dismissed on 28 December 1673. However, Strauch had gained respect for the common people who forced the Council of Danzig to reinstate him on 4 January 1674. However when he went to Greifswald in 1675, he was imprisoned in Küstrin. It was only when the Electorate of Saxony and the King of Poland asked the Elector of Brandenburg for his release, that he was released on 9 July 1678. Strauch returned to Gdansk after his release on July 20, 1678, and was reinstated by the Gdansk Council on September 8, 1678. Eventually the disputes with the Danzig clergy were settled.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.1 Most of the Central Asian economies have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this trend was visible well before 2008. The Kyrgyz economy was shaken by a series of shocks between 2010 and 2012. In April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed by a popular uprising, with former minister of foreign affairs Roza Otunbayeva assuring the interim presidency until the election of Almazbek Atambayev in November 2011. Food prices rose two years in a row and, in 2012, production at the major Kumtor gold mine fell by 60% after the site was perturbed by geological movements. According to the World Bank, 33.7% of the population was living in absolute poverty in 2010 and 36.8% a year later. In 2012, Kyrgyzstan's external debt (89%) was higher than that of its neighbours, after dropping to 71% in 2009. Turkmenistan had reduced its external debt to just 1.6% of GDP (down from 35% in 2002) and Uzbekistan's external debt was just 18.5% of GDP. Kazakhstan's external debt remained relatively stable at 66%, whereas Tajikistan's external debt had climbed to 51% (from 36% in 2008). GDP in Central Asia by economic sector, 2005 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 14.2 Although both exports and imports have grown impressively over the past decade, the five Central Asian republics remain vulnerable to economic shocks, owing to their reliance on exports of raw materials, a restricted circle of trading partners and a negligible manufacturing capacity. Kyrgyzstan has the added disadvantage of being considered resource-poor, although it does have gold reserves and ample water. Most of its electricity is generated by hydropower. Like the other four Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan is implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness, as it gradually moves from a state-controlled economy to a market economy. In particular, the government has been striving to modernise the industrial sector and foster the development of service industries to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture in the Kyrgyz economy dropped from 6.8% to 4.9% of GDP and the services sector expanded from 53.1% to 58.2% of GDP but the share of industry receded from 40.1% to 37.8% of GDP. Kyrgyzstan has the second- lowest GDP per capita in Central Asia after Tajikistan. GDP per capita rose from $2,449 to $3,213 (in purchasing power parity dollars) between 2009 and 2013. This compares with $23,214 in Kazakhstan, the Central Asian republic with the highest GDP per capita. Kyrgyzstan ranked 125th in the Human Development Index in 2013. The same year, the Earth Institute made an effort to measure the extent of happiness in 156 countries. Kazakhs (57th), Turkmens (59th) and Uzbeks (60th) were found to be happier than the Kyrgyz (89th) and, above all, the Tajiks (125th). Internet access varies widely from one country to another. In 2013, just one in four (23%) Kyrgyz had access to internet, compared to 54% of the population in Kazakhstan and 38% in Uzbekistan, the most populated Central Asian republic. This compares with 16% in Tajikistan and 10% in Turkmenistan. By 2017, Kyrgyzstan hopes to figure in the Top 30 of the World Bank's Doing Business ranking and no lower than 40th in the global ranking for economic freedom or 60th for global enabling trade. By combining a systematic fight against corruption with legal regulation of the informal economy, Kyrgyzstan hopes to figure among the Top 50 least corrupt countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index by 2017. == Higher education == Kyrgyzstan spends more on education than most of its neighbours: 5.53% of GDP in 2014, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This is close to the level in 2008 (5.91% of GDP) but lower than the peak in government education spending of 7.40% of GDP in 2012. Higher education spending has declined in recent years from 0.97% of GDP in 2008 and 0.89% of GDP in 2012 to just 0.26% of GDP in 2014. According to the government's Review of the Cost-Effectiveness of the Education System of Kyrgyzstan, there were 52 institutions offering higher education in 2011. Many universities are more interested in chasing revenue than providing quality education; they multiply the so-called ‘contract’ student groups who are admitted not on merit but rather for their ability to afford tuition fees, thereby saturating the labour market with skills it does not want. The professionalism of faculty is also low. In 2011, six out of ten faculty held only a bachelor's degree, 15% a master's, 20% a Candidate of Science degree, 1% a PhD and 5% a Doctor of Science (the highest degree level). The National Education Development Strategy (2012−2020) prioritises improving the quality of higher education. By 2020, the target is for all faculty to have a minimum master's qualification and for 40% to hold a Candidate of Science and 10% either a PhD or Doctor of Science degree. The quality assurance system is also to be revamped. In addition, the curriculum will be revised to align it with national priorities and strategies for the region's economic development. A teacher evaluation system will be introduced and there will be a review of existing funding mechanisms for higher education. == Science and technology == GDP per capita and GERD GDP ratio in Kyrgyzstan, 2010–2013 (average).

The insufficient rate of capital accumulation also hampers structural changes designed to boost innovation and technology- intensive industries. Every key economic sector is technologically dependent on other countries. In the energy sector, for instance, all technological equipment is imported from abroad and many of its assets are in foreign hands. In 2013 and 2014, three partly state-owned Russian companies invested in Kyrgyzstan's hydropower, oil and gas industries. In 2013, RusHydro began building the first of a series of hydroelectric dams that it will manage. In February 2014, Rosneft signed a framework agreement to buy 100% of Bishkek Oil and a 50% stake in the sole aviation fuel provider at the country's second- biggest airport, Osh International. The same year, Gazprom came closer to acquiring 100% of Kyrgyzgaz, which operates the country's natural gas network. In return for a symbolic investment of US$1, Gazprom undertook to assume US$40 million in debt and invest 20 billion rubles (circa US$551 million) in modernising Kyrgyz gas pipelines between 2014 and 2019. Gazprom already provides most of the country's aviation fuel and has a 70% share in the retail gasoline market. Kyrgyzstan needs to invest heavily in priority sectors like energy to improve its competitiveness and drive socio-economic development. However, the low level of investment in research and development, both in terms of finance and human resources, is a major handicap. In the 1990s, Kyrgyzstan lost many of the scientists it had trained during the Soviet era. Brain drain remains an acute problem and, to compound matters, many of those who remain are approaching retirement age. Although the number of researchers has remained relatively stable over the past decade, research makes little impact and tends to have little application in the economy. Research is concentrated in the Academy of Sciences, suggesting that universities urgently need to recover their status as research bodies. Moreover, society does not consider science a crucial driver of economic development or a prestigious career choice. Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001−2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3 The government's National Strategy for Sustainable Development (2013−2017) recognises the need to remove controls on industry in order to create jobs, increase exports and turn the country into a hub for finance, business, tourism and culture within Central Asia. With the exception of hazardous industries where government intervention is considered justified, restrictions on entrepreneurship and licensing will be lifted and the number of permits required will be halved. Inspections will be reduced to a minimum and the government will strive to interact more with the business community. The state reserves the right, however, to regulate matters relating to environmental protection and conservation of ecosystem services. In 2011, the government devoted just 10% of GDP to applied research, the bulk of funding going to experimental development (71%). The State Programme for the Development of Intellectual Property and Innovation (2012−2016) sets out to foster advanced technologies, in order to modernise the economy. This programme will be accompanied by measures to improve intellectual property protection and thereby enhance the country's reputation in relation to the rule of law. A system will be put in place to counter trafficking in counterfeit goods and efforts will be made to raise public awareness of the role and importance of intellectual property. During the first stage (2012−2013), specialists were trained in intellectual property rights and relevant laws were adopted. The government is also introducing measures to increase the number of bachelor's and master's degrees in science and engineering fields. == Research trends ==  Financial investment  Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4 Investment in research and development is low in all five Central Asian republics. In Kyrgyzstan, it has hovered around the 0.2% of GDP mark since 2001. In 2011, the country devoted 0.16% of GDP to research.  Human resources  Kyrgyzstan counted 412 researchers per million inhabitants (in head counts) in 2011, less than one-third the global average (1,083 in 2013). The great majority of researchers are employed by the public sector: 53% work in the government sector and 34% in the higher education sector. Most researchers are working in the field of natural sciences (27%) and engineering (26%), followed by the health sector (18%).  Gender issues  Like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan has maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.5 the Soviet Union. In 2011, 42% of Kyrgyz researchers were women. When broken down by field, women accounted for 47% of researchers in natural sciences, 30% of those in engineering, 44% of researchers in medical sciences, 50% of those in agriculture and 49% of those in social sciences and humanities. Among university graduates, women dominated natural sciences (61%) and health (77%) in 2013 but were in the minority in engineering (26%) and agriculture (28%). Of note is that the majority of PhDs in both science (63%) and engineering (54%) were awarded to women in 2012.

Kyrgyz scientists publish most in geosciences but output remains low. According to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Kyrgyz scientists published 46 articles in internationally catalogued journals in 2005 and 82 in 2014. This amounts to 15 articles per million inhabitants in 2014. The global average in 2013 was 176 per million and the average for sub- Saharan Africa was 20 per million. Kazakhstan published 36 articles per million inhabitants in 2014. Language may play a role in the low count in international journals, as the Thomson Reuters' database tends to favour articles written in English. Between 2008 and 2013, no Kyrgyz, Tajik or Turkmen patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office, compared to five for Kazakh inventors and three for Uzbek inventors. == International co-operation == Like the other four Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan is a member of several international bodies, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Kyrgyzstan and the other four republics are also members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the CAREC 2020 Strategy, a blueprint for furthering regional co- operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members’ competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.6 Kyrgyzstan joined the Eurasian Economic Union in 2014, shortly after it was founded by Kazakhstan, Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia is also a member. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it may encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations. Kyrgyzstan has been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage Central Asian countries to participate in research projects within Horizon 2020, the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions – universities, companies and research institutes – for funding of up to €10,000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre. Kyrgyzstan has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1998. == Sources  References == ","title":"Science and technology in Kyrgyzstan"},{"id":"54244699","text":"M-1 highway () is a Montenegrin roadway.

Produced by Heliconia H Group, It debuted on June 4, 2017 on Channel 7 and Channel 7 HD. ==Format== MasterChef Thailand is based on the BBC British version of MasterChef. Hon., Hon. , and Pongtawat Chalermkittichai were the original judges of the Thai version of MasterChef, with being the host. In the first round, the initial 100 competitors, selected from the auditions, prepare a signature dish for the judges to taste. They were given a limited amount of time to prep their dish, and then 5 minutes before the judges to complete the cooking and assembly of the dish, during which the judges ask about their background. The contestants who have 2 \\"yes\\" votes from the judges for this audition round will move on, earning them a MasterChef white apron, while others that failed, will asked to leave the competition. The contestants will then be trimmed down to about sixteen contestants by challenges. Typically, the first challenge is a skill test that focused on contestants' skills to do simple tasks such as dicing and slicing gingers. Judges can advance a chef to the next round or eliminate them at any time during the challenge by taking their apron. The second challenge is a cooking test in which the remaining contestants are asked to make a dish with a certain ingredient as the centerpiece, with judges advancing and eliminating contestants based on the looks and taste of the dish. Subsequently, the formal competition begins typically following a 4-event cycle that takes place over 2 episodes, with one chef eliminated after the second and fourth event. The events typically are: * Mystery Box: Contestants were given the same ingredients and must use only those ingredients to make a dish within an amount of time given. The winner of this event will be given an advantage in the next event. * Invention Test: The judges take the mystery box winner to the pantry, privately explain the theme of the elimination test, and tell of at least one advantage. The advantage is typically the choosing of the main ingredient for the invention test. Other advantages include, more shopping time, choosing a specific ingredient for each contestants, or immunity. The rest then asked to invent a dish based on the main ingredient. The top 2 contestants will be the team captain of the next team challenge. Then, the judges nominate at least three contestants for elimination, with one being eliminated and asked to \\"leave the MasterChef Kitchen\\", leaving their apron at their station. * Team Challenge: The contestants usually are taken to an off-site location where they will be split into 2 teams, red and blue, with the winne of the invention test choosing first. Then, the team are tasked to prepare and serve a meal to a number of diners in a limited amount of time. The team that has the most votes from the diners are the winners of the challenge, with the losing team having to compete in the pressure test when they're back at the MasterChef Kitchen. * Pressure Test: The losing team of the previous challenge are tasked to recreate the dish given by the judges in a fixed amount of time. Sometimes, not all of the losing team contestants will compete in this round in which someone receiving an exemption given by either the team captain or the judges. Each dish is judged based on the taste, the appearance, and sometimes, the accuracy of the dish. The contestant that performed the worst in the event will be eliminated from the competition. Other events that rarely happen during the competition include: * Reinstation challenge: The eliminated contestants competed in a special mystery box challenge and pressure test. The contestant that wins both rounds will be reinstated back in the competition. * Tag-team challenge: A variation of the team challenge. The contestants are divided into either pairs or teams. They are usually asked to recreate a dish given by the judges. The contestants in the team must switch every time the judges asked them to switch. (typically every 15 minutes) The winning team of the challenge will be the team captains in the team challenge, with the losing team being up for elimination. (in season 1) This cycle continues until there's 2-4 chefs remaining. The winner will receive ฿1,000,000, their own MasterChef cookbook, and the MasterChef trophy. ==Hosts and judges== {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Judges ! colspan=\\"4\\" Season - ! style=\\"width:30px;\\"1 ! style=\\"width:30px;\\"2 ! style=\\"width:30px;\\"3 ! style=\\"width:30px;\\"All-Stars -  M.L. colspan=\\"4\\" style = \\"background:lightgreen; text-align:center;\\"✔ -  M.L. colspan=\\"4\\" style = \\"background:lightgreen; text-align:center;\\"✔ -  Pongtawat Chalermkittichai (Chef Ian) colspan=\\"4\\" style = \\"background:lightgreen; text-align:center;\\"✔ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Hosts ! colspan=\\"4\\" Season - ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 !

They are to above sea level, extending north-south and east- west. Between six and seven million years ago, a fresh water lake existed there in a forested area with mostly broad leaved deciduous tree species, dominated by sequoia and oak. The Turkish botany professor Baki Kasaplıgil (1918-1992) from Çankırı who was professor at the Biology Department, Mills College, Oakland, California from 1956 to 1992, made fossil collecting trips to the area around Kızılcahamam - Çerkeş road in 1964 and 1968. In the 1964 trip he collected fossil leaves of Glyptostrobus, Sequoia, Zelkova, Fagus, Carpinus, Ulmus, Quercus, Tilia and Acer. In the 1968 trip, he collected 400 plant parts such as leaves, seeds, fruits, twigs and branches. He also collected 50 fossils of frog and fish skeletons and larvae and insects. In 1969, Dr. Wayne Fry from University of Berkeley made plant fossil collections in Güvem. Prof. Daniel I.

It concerns two foreign monks and their amazing feats. ==Plot== Pu Songling narrates a story told to him by a monk named Ti Kong (): Two monks claiming to be from the West arrive in Qingzhou, where they are received personally by two servants of the local Prefect and hosted at a nearby monastery. However, a high-ranking monk named Lingpei () gives the foreign monk poor treatment, despite the veneration Lingpei's servants have for them. Given the enigmatic and legendary nature of the West, the foreign monks, referred to as arhats, are asked to demonstrate their supernatural powers. Readily obliging, the first monk flings a miniature pagoda from his sleeves towards a crevice in the temple ceiling, and \\"Buddhist relics inside the pagoda (begin) to emit a glow that (illuminates) the entire room\\". The second monk can extend his left arm to some six or seven chi and shrink his right hand to virtual nothingness, and vice versa. ==Literary significance== \\"The Foreign Monks\\" is one of the few Strange Tales entries that revolve around monks; others include \\"This Transformation\\" and \\"The Monk's Medicine\\". Pu likely encountered many monks in real-life and this provided inspiration for such works.

The composer wrote to the librettist Klein that \\"Moise will probably be my last work. It must worthily crown my career!\\".

Und es kam tatsächlich vor, dass jemand, der sich gut auskannte mit der Klassischen Musik, plötzlich sagte: Oh, das Stück von Schubert kenne ich noch gar nicht.\\" a word smith and compelling teller of tales, a drinker and a noted bohemian who never really seemed comfortable if he had a permanent residence and who walked everywhere in his home city, Berlin, because he was passionately suspicious of public transport. More than that, he became notable in Germany for resisting the inhumanity of the Nazi regime. During the war he got hold of a printing press which he installed in the cellar of a house vacated by a friend who had sought refuge from the bombing by moving to the Thuringian countryside after her husband was killed in the war. Under the wartime conditions of the time, people who did not officially exist had no access to food rations. By producing high quality forged identity documents and food coupons Oskar Huth enabled many people who, officially, did not exist (often because they were Jewish), to eat. == Life == Oskar Huth was born in Berlin. His father was an organ builder and piano maker, who taught his trade to his son who evidently inherited the necessary craft skills. Interaction with his father's customers provided access to the world of books and stimulating conversation beyond the conventional proletarian class constraints of his background, and he would grow up to become an unconventional man. A few weeks before his fifteenth birthday the Nazis took power in Germany. He considered joining the Hitler Youth but, as he later recalled an interview with a Gestapo officer about his Jewish friends \\"opened his eyes\\". \\"For this lot\\", as he later put it, \\"I was not going to join in the war\\", a decision to which he later held firm. He completed his school leaving exams and studied in Berlin between 1936 and 1939 various skills associated with graphic artistry including printing technology and lithography. War broke out in September 1939 and he received conscription papers requiring him to join the army. However, by applying what German language sources describe as a Švejk tactic he managed to have his call-up deferred for a year on account of alleged Motor skill deficiency (\\"motorischer Störungen\\"). It is not clear from sources whether in the end his military call-up was deferred for one year or two. In any event, during that time he lived his life in the local bars, becoming increasingly aware of the way that when his Jewish friends disappeared to concentration camps they seemed never to come back. In November 1941 he received his call-up papers again and disappeared from Berlin, while taking steps to have it known that he was one of the many Berliners who had been killed in an air raid. However, he soon returned to the city and set about building for himself a life and an identity that involved \\"going underground\\", which in the context of the time and place not registering his place of residence with the local town hall. He spent a difficult winter, moving from place to place and sometimes spending the night with friends, before finding a more permanent solution in March 1942. Huth's friend, the fashion designer Käte Kausel, lived with her family in an apartment at Dillenburger Straße 58f in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. After her husband was killed at the front she determined to leave Berlin with her son and move to Zeulenroda. She was happy for Huth to make use of her otherwise empty apartment, which was sufficiently substantial to incorporate a large cellar. He did not exactly conceal himself in the cellar, and for many purposes \\"hid in plain sight\\", but the neighbourhood was one in which people knew each other and the default assumption was that if you saw someone regularly in the street they must be legal. Everyone knew which were the active Nazis who might make trouble for a person suspected of illegally using the cellar at Mrs.Kausel's house. These he managed to avoid. It turned out that there was more to his plan than simply keeping a low profile. Later in March 1942 he obtained a manual printing press which, using a handcart, he transported from Kreuzberg to Käte Kausel's cellar in Wilmersdorf, where he set it up. He used the press to create himself a fictitious identity as \\"Oskar Haupt\\", creating both an official (seeming) identity document and a certificate of military unfitness. The quality was excellent: even the usual watermarks were correctly incorporated. According to the documents Oskar Haupt was employed as a scientific draftsman at the Botanical Institute in Königin-Luise-Straße (\\"Queen Luise Street\\"). Wartime \\"Butter coupons\\" produced by Oskar Huth Having perfected his technique he quickly branched out, specialising in official documents, notably military identity cards and food coupons for butter (\\"Reisebuttermarken \\"). Most food ration coupons were marked with the identity of the retailer who would exchange them, but the butter coupons were not assigned to any particular retailer, which may have reflected the relative volatility of butter supplies. In any event, it meant that the butter coupons were untraceable and could be used and traded for other ration coupons on behalf of people who were living illegally (unregistered) and therefore received no ration coupons from the authorities. Quality was characteristically excellent: butter coupons incorporated watermarks as a protective device to prevent forgery. Oskar Huth's butter coupons incorporated the same water marks. It was estimated that more than 60 people, mostly Jewish, who were hidden in the cavity directly under the rafter in the or cellars of people's homes, were able to survive because of the coupons produced by Oskar Huth in Käte Kausel's cellar. One beneficiary of Oskar Huth's printing work was the artists Heinz Trökes whom he provided with an official exemption from army service.Über Mut im Untergrund, Ilse-Margaret Vogel, Lukas Verlag Berlin 2014, p181 Two others were the aristocratic plotters Ludwig and Kunrat von Hammerstein-Equord who were obliged to \\"disappear underground\\" after the failed attempt to kill the leader in July 1944. Huth's insights into the workings of the Nazi bureaucratic mentality were in evidence when he planned and created a new identity for Ludwig von Hammerstein, taking care to ensure that the false identity provided should state that he was born into an expatriate German family in South America. The idea was to reduce the risk that the authorities might be induced by inadvertent nonconformist actions to investigate the identity more closely. Foreign born Germans might be expected not to have grown up with precisely the same social ground rules as German born Germans. The Hammerstein brothers both survived the war and lived to a good age. War ended and the Nazi regime collapsed in May 1945. Oskar Huth the raconteur had some new tales to tell in the bars, and his wartime exploits became widely known. There are stories that he was offered all sorts of jobs, including one as Berlin senator for culture. It is not clear where such stories originated. In any event, Huth himself defined his new job as \\"Freischaffende Kunsttrinker\\" (loosely: \\"Freelance Artist-drinker\\"). He was never a man who valued material wealth, but he survived happily as a pub pianist. His cultural and social circle now included a younger generation - and some might argue a more distinguished cast - of bohemian artists and writers such as Günter Grass, Günter Bruno Fuchs and Robert Wolfgang Schnell. == Celebrations == Oskar Huth continued his easy going alcohol fueled lifestyle till his death in the summer of 1991. He wore his minor celebrity lightly but was nevertheless celebrated by members of the artistic community. The writer Peter O. Chotjewitz presented a portrayal of Huth in his story \\"Ein Mann namens Nagel\\" (literally: \\"A man called Nail\\").This short story is included in the compilation, \\"Die Insel. Erzählungen auf dem Bärenauge\\". Rowohlt, Reinbek 1968 (Berlin-Roman) In his novel Dog Years, Günter Grass created a recognisable character called \\"Hütchen\\" (literally: \\"Little Hat\\")), a piano maker and forger by profession. In his novel Geisterbahn (\\"Phantom Railway\\"), Robert Wolfgang Schnell includes a character called \\"Bubi Paffrath\\" based on Huth. It has been suggested that Günter Bruno Fuchs, Rolf Haufs and Reinhard Lettau all wrote poems inspired by Huth's character. Huth also gets a mention in the autobiography of Kurt von Hammerstein. Jutta Hercher: Die Butterverschwörung. Der Überlebenslauf des Oskar Huth. Radio-Feature, transmitted by WDR 3 on 5 November 2011 (no longer accessible online). From a younger generation, the writer Friedrich Christian Delius wrote in his biographical novel Mein Jahr als Mörder (\\"My Year as a Murderer\\") about Huth, and about his own inability, when opportunity presented itself, to speak to him.Friedrich Christian Delius: Mein Jahr als Mörder. Berlin 2004, . == After death == After he died Huth's mortal remains were placed in a \\"Grave of honour\\" (\\"Ehrengrab\\") in the Cemetery at the Halle Gate at Mehringdamm, close to his old haunts. He is honoured in Berlin's Memorial to Dead Heroes which opened in 2008. There has, since then, been at least one major exhibition celebrating his life.Bei dieser Firma mache ich nicht mit!, auf: Community Impulse, Browse Gallery / Mühlenhaupt Museum Berlin ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Berlin Category:German resistance members Category:German people of World War II Category:Forgers ","title":"Oskar Huth"},{"id":"54245002","text":"Institutionum arithmeticarum libri quatuor, 1619 Johann Lantz or Lanz (1564 – 20 September 1638) was a German mathematician and jesuit. == Biografia == Born in Tettnang on the Lake of Konstanz in 1564, he was admitted as novice in Landsberg in 1589.

While there, he met Captain (later Admiral of the Fleet) Henry Keppel, whose wife-to-be lived in a villa near the Fortescues; Keppel permitted the young Fortescue aboard his ship, the frigate Forte, a visit he would remember fondly in his memoirs, Looking Back. He also recalled the Empress of Austria's visit to the island in 1859, aboard HMY Victoria and Albert. Throughout the 1860s, Lord Fortescue was a sympathiser of the Italian movement and hosted its celebrities in his Devonshire home. In 1865, the young Fortescue started school in Brighton under one Mrs Walker; despite its strong reputation as a feeder preparatory school for Eton and Harrow, he chose not to pursue those routes further: \\"owning, I suppose, to my thorough dislike of the whole process of education, I made up my mind to go into the Navy\\".Fortescue, Looking Back, chap. 1. == Naval and royal service == Fortscue joined the Royal Navy in 1869, nominated by his mother's cousin, Captain Beauchamp Seymour, and trained at Britannia as a cadet, remembering that \\"there is not period of my life that I look back upon with less pleasure than I do to the time I spent on Britannia\\", owing to its \\"overdone\\" schooling and poor food. He graduated first class the following year and was made a midshipman.

In 2001, he moved to the Justice Department as Associate Deputy Attorney General and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. On June 9, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Wray to be the 33rd Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. Wray was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on September 11, 2003. Wray was Assistant Attorney General from 2003 to 2005, working under Deputy Attorney General James Comey. While heading the Criminal Division, Wray oversaw prominent fraud investigations, including Enron. In a May 30, 2013 Washingtonian.com article, Garrett M. Graff revealed that Wray was one of the senior Justice Dept officials who nearly resigned in 2004, alongside then FBI Director Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General James Comey, due to illegal surveillance techniques the Bush administration had put in place under the Terrorist Surveillance Program. In March 2005, Wray announced that he would resign from his post. His last day at the Justice Department was on May 17, 2005. In 2005, Wray received the Edmund J.

Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (2017–present)  Attorney General Sessions. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Wray announce charges against Chinese government hackers, December 20, 2018 On June 7, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Wray to be the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, replacing James Comey, who was dismissed by Trump on May 9, 2017. Trump interviewed Wray for the vacant FBI Director job on May 30, 2017, according to then Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Wray's Senate confirmation hearing commenced on July 12, 2017. Among other testimony, when asked if he believed that the investigation into Russian 2016 election interference and possible links to Trump's campaign is a \\"witch hunt,\\" he stated that he did not. On July 20, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously recommended to confirm Wray as the next Director of the FBI. Wray was officially confirmed by the Senate with bipartisan support on August 1, 2017; the vote was 92–5. He was sworn in by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a private ceremony on August 2, 2017. Wray was formally sworn in on September 28, 2017, in a ceremony that was not attended by President Trump, marking the first time an FBI director has been sworn in without the President who nominated him present at the ceremony. On February 13, 2018, in a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing focused on Chinese espionage in the United States, Senator Marco Rubio [R-FL] asked Wray about the risk posed from Chinese students in advanced science and mathematics programs. In response, Wray stated \\"nontraditional collectors\\" (which he elaborated to include professors, scientists, and students) are \\"exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have\\" and consequently he viewed the risk \\"as not just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat\\". Sequence commences at video timestamp 01:15:38. Representatives Judy Chu [D-CA], Ted Lieu [D-CA], and Grace Meng [D-NY] released statements criticizing Wray's response as \\"irresponsible generalizations\\" implying that all Chinese students and scholars were spies. A coalition of Asian American advocacy groups wrote an open letter to Wray asking for a dialogue \\"to discuss how well-intentioned public policies might nonetheless lead to troubling issues of potential bias, racial profiling, and wrongful prosecution.\\" In a follow-up interview with NBC, Wray stood by his earlier remarks, elaborating that \\"To be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin. But when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.\\" On December 9, 2019, Wray was interviewed by ABC News following the release of the DoJ inspector general's report on the origins of the Russia investigation. In the interview, when asked about characterizations of the FBI and its agents as the \\"deep state\\", Wray responded: \\"I think that's the kind of label that's a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage. So that's not a term I would ever use to describe our work force and I think it's an affront to them.\\" He said he did not believe the Trump campaign was unfairly targeted by the FBI probe. He also denied that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential elections, stating \\"We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election\\" and \\"as far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.\\" This led Trump to criticize Wray the following day, claiming that Wray would \\"never be able to fix the FBI.\\" In January 2020, Senator Chris Murphy wrote to Wray, urging the FBI to \\"investigate the allegations\\" that Saudi Arabia \\"illegally compromised and stole personal data\\" from Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, as part of a possible effort to \\"influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia\\". In May 2020, Wray ordered an internal review into possible misconduct in the FBI's investigation of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn. On June 4, 2020, Wray stated that \\"anarchists\\" like Antifa are \\"exploiting\\" George Floyd protests \\"to pursue violent, extremist agendas\\". In July 2020, Wray called People's Republic of China the \\"greatest long-term threat\\" to the United States. He said that \\"the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China.\\" Wray cited the Anthem medical data breach that exposed the personal information of more than 78 million people and the 2017 Equifax data breach that impacted more than 145 million Americans. Wray argued China was trying to become the world’s only superpower, supplanting the United States. == Personal life == Wray married Helen Garrison Howell, a Yale classmate, in 1989. They have a son, Trip, and a daughter, Caroline, and live in Georgia. Wray earned $9.2 million working as an attorney for the law firm King & Spalding, significantly more than his salary as FBI Director. According to a calculation from the Wall Street Journal, Wray's net worth in 2017 was estimated to be $23 million to $42 million. ==See also== *Foreign electoral intervention == References  External links == * FBI Director biography * Department of Justice biography * - Category:1966 births Category:20th- century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:Assistant United States Attorneys Category:Directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Category:Federalist Society members Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans Category:George W.

Gerardine was the first-born child of Henry and Louisa Bate; their younger child, Camilla, was emotionally close to her elder sister throughout their lives. The sisters' aunt, Louisa Murphy Bate's oldest sister, was the literary and art critic Anna Brownell Jameson. After Henry Bate was bankrupted, the childless Jameson assumed responsibility for Gerardine's education and took her traveling through Europe. In 1840, Jameson wrote to her friend Ottilie von Goethe about her favorite niece, saying that she was \\"growing a great tall, wild girl, and requires good discipline\\". In 1846-1847, Jameson and Gerardine traveled in France and Italy with the eloping Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Near the end of this trip, early in 1847, Geddie met her future husband, Scottish artist Robert Turnbull Macpherson, in Rome. Jameson did not approve of Geddie's growing affection for Robert Macpherson: in part because he had converted to Roman Catholicism, in part because of his flamboyance and Italophilic adoption of some Roman customs. Jameson wrote, \\"Gerardine does not go on to my satisfaction\\". Delayed by revolution in Rome in 1848 and hindered by poor finances and initial parental disfavor, Gerardine and Robert finally were married at Ealing on 4 September 1849. She and Robert had four children who survived to adulthood: William (nicknamed \\"Willy\\" by the family), Frank (\\"Francesco\\"), Ada (\\"Aida\\"), and Percy. Jameson eventually made peace with the marriage and visited the couple in Rome in 1855 and in 1857. Though an artistically successful photographer, Robert was often in poor health. Gerardine supplemented the family finances through creating engraved illustrations, including for Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art (1848) and Jameson's second edition of Legends of the Madonna (1857). She also illustrated her husband's Vatican Sculptures (1863) and helped with his photography business, particularly in developing prints from the glass negative plates. Robert died in November 1872, leaving his widow and children nearly destitute. She made ends meet through reporting as a newspaper correspondent during the Roman Summer (when regular correspondents sought to leave the malarial Italian capital city), teaching English, and working as an amanuensis. She also wrote the first biography of Anna Brownell Jameson, published after Gerardine's death as Memoirs of the Life of Anna Jameson (1878); the Macphersons' friend, the novelist Margaret Oliphant, wrote the preface to this biography. It remained the principal life of Jameson until Clara Thomas's 1967 publication of Winter Studies and summer Rambles in Canada. == Death == Careworn and in ill health, Gerardine Macpherson died in Rome on 24 May 1878. == References == Category:1878 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Writers from London Category:English biographers Category:English illustrators Category:19th-century English writers Category:English women writers Category:1830 births Category:Women biographers ","title":"Gerardine Macpherson"},{"id":"54245572","text":"Science and technology in Tajikistan examines government efforts to develop a national innovation system and the impact of these policies. == Socio-economic context == GDP growth trends in Central Asia, 2000−2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.1 Tajikistan has the fastest- growing population in Central Asia (2.42% in 2014) and ranks lowest among the Central Asian republics on the Human Development Index (133rd in 2013). It also has the lowest GDP per capita in the region, although this rose from $1,788 to $2,512 (in current purchasing power parity dollars) between 2008 and 2013. Tajikistan has recorded strong growth in recent years, thanks to various economic reforms, including the development of new sectors such as hydropower and tourism and effective measures to promote macro-economic stability. The country has considerable assets: in addition to freshwater and diverse mineral resources, including gold, it has relatively large expanses of undeveloped land suitable for agriculture and environmentally friendly crops, a relatively inexpensive labour force and occupies a strategic geographical position, thanks to its border with China, making it a place of transit for merchandise and transportation networks. Although both exports and imports have grown impressively over the past decade, Tajikistan remains vulnerable to economic shocks, owing to its reliance on exports of raw materials, a restricted circle of trading partners and a negligible manufacturing capacity. The economy has encountered fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years. Aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports and the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. GDP in Central Asia by economic sector, 2005 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 14.2 Like the other four Central Asian republics, Tajikistan is implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness, as it gradually moves from a state-controlled economy to a market economy. In particular, the government has been striving to modernize the industrial sector and foster the development of service industries to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, however, the share of agriculture in the Tajik economy actually grew rom 24% to 27% of GDP. Although the services sector expanded from 45% to 51% of GDP, the share of industry receded from 31% to 22% of GDP. Within industry, the share of manufacturing halved to 11% of GDP. In addition to widespread poverty, the country faces other challenges: the need to develop the rule of law; the high cost of combating drug trafficking and terrorism on its border; low Internet penetration (16% of the population in 2013) and a small domestic market. The government sector is not structured to meet the demands of a market economy and development plans and strategies are neither interconnected nor vertically integrated. Potential partners in the private sector and civil society are insufficiently implicated in the development process. To compound matters, the modest allocation of financial resources is frequently inadequate to reach the goals set forth in national strategic documents. The country is also plagued by inadequate statistics. These factors affect the implementation of the National Development Strategy for 2005−2015, which was designed by President Emomalii Rahmon to help the country meet the Millennium Development Goals. == Education == In education, the National Development Strategy for 2005−2015 focuses on an institutional and economic reform of the education system and on boosting the education sector's potential to provide services. Key problems to overcome include widespread malnutrition and illness among children, leading to absenteeism; poorly qualified teaching staff; lowly paid teachers, which affects morale and encourages corruption; a shortage of up-to-date textbooks; ineffective evaluation methods; and inadequate curricula at all levels of education for meeting the demands of the modern world, including an absence of science-based curricula at some levels. According to projections, the number of secondary school pupils could rise by 40% between 2005 and 2015. A recent survey revealed a lack of 600,000 places for schoolchildren, no heating or running water in one-quarter of schools and no toilets in 35%. Internet access is rare, even in schools equipped with computers, owing to frequent electricity cuts and a shortage of trained staff. In recent years, the gender gap in school attendance has increased for pupils in grades 9−11 particularly, in favour of boys. Tajikistan has been increasing its investment in education since 2003. In 2014, the government invested 5.23% of GDP in education, up from 4.10% of GDP in 2008 and 2.77% of GDP in 2003. The share of GDP devoted to higher education has also progressed from 0.15% of GDP in 2003 to 0.49% of GDP in 2008 and 0.52% of GDP in 2014. Government spending on education nevertheless remains well beneath 1991 levels (8.9% of GDP) when Tajikistan was still part of the Soviet Union. In order to compensate for the funding shortfall and satisfy urgent needs, the education system is becoming increasingly dependent on ‘unofficial payments’ and international aid. Moreover, administrative barriers hamper the establishment of effective public−private partnerships, limiting private sector participation at pre- school and vocational and university levels, in particular. It seems unlikely that Tajikistan will reach the target ensconced in its National Development Strategy of privatizing 30% of these institutions by 2015. Other targets to 2015 include providing all pupils with adequate textbooks, involving local communities more in problem-solving, decentralizing education funding, retraining 25% of teachers annually and founding at least 450 new schools, all of which are to be equipped with heating, water and sanitation, along with the renovated schools. At least 50% of schools are also to be given access to the internet. == Policy issues in science and technology ==  Research relevance  Tajikistan can still count on a fairly strong core of human resources in science but the meagre resources available for research and development are spread too thinly across a wide range of areas. In addition, research is disconnected from problem-solving and market needs. Research institutions also have weak linkages to educational institutions, making it hard to share facilities such as laboratories. The poor distribution of information and communication technologies also hampers international scientific co-operation and information-sharing. Conscious of these problems, the government intends to reform the science sector. In 2015, there were plans to conduct an inventory and analysis of research topics at scientific institutions in order to enhance their relevance. Targeted programmes are to be adopted for basic and applied research in critical areas for scientific and economic development, and at least 50% of scientific projects will have some practical application. Scientists are being encouraged to apply for competitive grants proposed by the government and international organizations and foundations, and contract research will be gradually introduced for high-priority research in all the sciences. Related scientific facilities will be renovated and equipped, including with internet access. A scientific information database is also being set up. Tajikistan hosted its first forum of inventors in October 2014 in Dushanbe, entitled From Invention to Innovation. Run by the National Centre for Patents and Information of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, in partnership with international organizations, the forum discussed the private sector's needs and fostered international ties.  Gender issues  Although policies are in place to give women equal rights and opportunities, these policies are underfunded and poorly understood by public employees at all levels of government. There is also little co-operation among the state, civil society and the business world when it comes to implementing the national gender policy. As a result, women often find themselves excluded from public life and decision-making processes, even though they are increasingly a household breadwinner.As part of current administrative reform within the National Development Strategy, gender considerations are to be taken into account in the drafting of future budgets. Existing legislation will be amended to support gender equality objectives and ensure equal access for men and women to secondary and higher education, loans, information, consulting services and, in the case of entrepreneurs, to venture capital and other resources. The policy will also focus on eliminating gender stereotypes in the public consciousness and preventing violence against women.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.5 Domestic spending on research and development increased by 157% between 2007 and 2013 (to PPP$20.9 million, in constant 2005 PPP$) but this barely pushed up Tajikistan's research intensity, which rose only from 0.07% to 0.12% of GDP over the same period. It is harder to improve the ratio of research spending to GDP when economic growth is strong: Tajikistan's economy grew by more than 6% a year for most of the period between 2007 and 2013.  Human resources  Tajikistan counted 262 researchers (in head counts) per million inhabitants in 2013, compared to a world average of 1,083 per million inhabitants (in full-time equivalents). Researchers were fairly evenly spread among the different fields of science but gravitated most towards natural sciences (24% of all researchers) and agricultural sciences (22%). Researchers were either employed by the government (70%) or by the higher education sector (30%), suggesting that industrial research is non-existent. Among university graduates, Tajikistan had a similar ratio of PhD graduates in science (3.9 per million population) in 2012 to Kazakhstan (4.4 per million).

Tajik scientists published 32 articles in internationally calatogued journals in 2005 and 46 in 2014. This corresponds to five articles per million inhabitants in 2014. For the purposes of comparison, the global average in 2013 was 176 per million and the average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 per million. Kazakhstan published 36 articles per million inhabitants in 2014. Language may play a role in the low count of Central Asian articles in international journals, as the Thomson Reuters' database tends to favour articles written in English. Between 2008 and 2014, the three main partners of Tajik scientists were based in Pakistan (99 co-authored articles), the Russian Federation (58), United States of America (44), Germany (26) and United Kingdom (20), according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science.

Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.6 Like the other four Central Asian republics, Tajikistan is a member of several international bodies, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Tajikistan and the other four republics are also members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the CAREC 2020 Strategy, a blueprint for furthering regional co- operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members’ competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Tajikistan has been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage Central Asian countries to participate in research projects within Horizon 2020, the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions – universities, companies and research institutes – for funding of up to €10,000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.

These settlers succeeded in draining the swamps of Boukhalfa to cultivate the land and practice the viticulture there. However decimated by fevers, many will be those, who as soon as the repayment of their debts will resell their lot. By 1886 there were only four families of Alsace-Lorraine left in Boukhalfa. On December 14, 1888, the repopulation of the hamlet of Boukhalfa had made it possible to increase its population to 48 French families for a total population of 125 inhabitants. Around 1890, the hamlet of Boukhalfa had a very small territory and a small number of French settlers, which slowed down the continuation of its expansion. The hamlet of Boukhalfa in March 1889 included a fort and a garrison, and where the French colonists from all the environs of Tizi Ouzou found there a safe shelter in case of danger coming from Mount Sidi Belloua.

Debris from the aircraft was found in the Andaman Sea, 118 nautical miles (218 km) off Dawei by Myanmar Navy ships. It is the deadliest aviation accident in Myanmar's history. == Aircraft == The aircraft involved was a Shaanxi Y-8F-200 of the Myanmar Air Force, serial number 5820. It had been delivered in March 2016 and had flown for over 800 hours at the time of the crash. == Passengers and crew ==  Crew  The aircraft's captain was Lt-Col Nyein Chan and the co-pilots were Lt-Col Soe Thu Win and Maj Thant Zin Htay. The aircraft had 14 crew members.  Passengers  108 military staff members and their families, including 15 children, were on board when the plane lost communication with Dawei airbase. Six officers and 29 other military personnel were on board. == Disappearance == The aircraft had departed from Myeik for Yangon at 13:06 local time (06:36 UTC). At 13:35, communication was lost with the aircraft when it was west of Dawei (). The aircraft was flying at at the time. A search and rescue operation was launched in the Andaman Sea. An unidentified spokesman said that weather was not thought to be a factor in the aircraft's disappearance. No mayday call had been received from the aircraft.  Search  Nine Myanmar Navy ships, and three military aircraft and helicopters were sent to assist in the search. On 7 June, debris from the aircraft was reported to have been found off Dawei by a Myanmar Navy ship. On 8 June, it was reported that 29 bodies had been found. The wreckage was scattered over a wide area, indicating that the aircraft might have disintegrated in flight at altitude. Storms in the area hindered the search. By 9 June, hopes of finding survivors were fading. It was later reported that there were no survivors. Instead, bodies and debris have been found scattered in the Andaman Sea, and some washed ashore. This was the deadliest aviation accident to occur in Myanmar, surpassing the crash of a Fokker F27 Friendship 500 in 1987, which killed 49 people. On 15 June, a fishing boat helping with the search found the tail of the aircraft off Myinkhwar Aww Bay. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered on 18 June. == Investigation and cause == Investigators found the pilot had lost control after entering thick storm cloud. Ice had formed on the wings and sudden crosswinds had led the plane to stall, state media say. Although it was monsoon season in Myanmar (also called Burma), there were no reports of bad weather at the time. Communication with the flight was lost half an hour into the short, routine trip. \\"The accident occurred due to loss of control after experiencing adverse weather that caused the plane to stall... resulting in a nosedive,\\" state media said. After studying black box data, investigators decided the crash was \\"not from any act of sabotage, explosion or engine failure\\". The plane was flying from Myeik to Yangon and the debris was found in the sea off the coastal town of Dawei. It remains unclear why the pilot flew into the storm, given that weather radar normally allows such clouds to be avoided. == References == Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by ice Category:2017 in Myanmar Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2017 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Myanmar Category:June 2017 events in Asia Category:Military of Myanmar ","title":"2017 Myanmar Air Force Shaanxi Y-8 crash"},{"id":"54245752","text":"Kelsey Neumann (born May 7, 1991) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL). == Career == Neumann briefly played collegiate women's ice hockey for Clarkson University and SUNY Plattsburgh in the NCAA.

He is Director at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology and head of the department Genes – Circuits – Behavior. Herwig Baier's research aims to understand how animal brains convert sensory inputs into behavioral responses. Herwig Baier, March 2017 Herwig Baier studied biology at the University of Konstanz. In 1990, he joined Friedrich Bonhoeffer's laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, where he obtained his diploma (1990) and PhD degree (1995). For his post-doctoral training, he moved to the University of California, San Diego, to work with William (Bill) Harris. In 1997, Baier was offered a faculty position by the University of California, San Francisco, where he remained as Full Professor until 2012. In 2011, the Max Planck Society recruited him as Director at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried (Germany). ==Scientific focus== The overarching theme of Baier’s scientific contributions to neuroscience has been the elucidation of molecular, cellular, synaptic and circuit mechanisms of nervous system function and animal behavior. The following questions are of particular interest: # What are the specific functions of neuronal cell types in perception and behavior? # How is circuit organization and composition related to behavioral function? # How are neural circuits modulated and integrated into wider networks to orchestrate complex, flexible behavior? # How do neurons become different during development? How are their processes guided to their targets, and how do they form specific synaptic connections? Herwig Baier's work led to a number of scientific discoveries: * Establishing zebrafish for neuroscience: Since the early 1990s, Baier pioneered the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio), as an experimental model for neuroscience and behavioral genetics, taking advantage of the optical transparency of these animals at larval stages and their genetic modifiability. This work led to the first large-scale behavioral screens in search of genes that wire the visual system for behavior. (Baier et al., Development 1996; Neuhauss et al., Journal of Neuroscience 1999; Muto et al., PloS Genetics 2005) * Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of retinotopic and visual feature maps: Baier contributed to the identification of gradient-based axon guidance mechanisms during development of the visual system. His group also discovered the role of Slit-Robo signaling in the precise targeting of layers in the optic tectum by ingrowing retinal axons. (Baier and Bonhoeffer, Science 1992; Gosse et al., Nature 2008; Xiao et al., Cell 2011) * Cell fate decisions in the developing visual system: Baier discovered the role of interkinetic nuclear migration in apportioning cell fates in the retina. (Del Bene et al., Cell 2008) * Remote optical control of behavior: Baier's group was the first to use optogenetic techniques for circuit analysis in zebrafish. By targeting the expression of fluorescent indicators and optogenetic effectors, such as Channelrhodopsin (ChR2), Halorhodopsin (NpHR) or the light-activated glutamate receptor (LiGluR), to specific brain areas and shining light at single neurons, he and his collaborators showed that an animal's behavior can be reversibly and specifically altered on millisecond timescales. (Szobota et al., Neuron 2007; Arrenberg et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2009; Wyart et al., Nature 2009) * Two-photon optogenetics with 3D resolution in the intact brain of a behaving animal: In 2017, Baier’s team introduced an optical technique that enables precise remote control of neural activity, called two- photon holographic optogenetics. By inserting a spatial light modulator into the optical path of a two-photon microscope, the technique allows to photostimulate an arbitrary population of single neurons in the zebrafish brain while observing the resulting behavior. This method is instrumental for the functional annotation of neural circuits. (Dal Maschio et al., Neuron 2017) ==Recognition== Baier received the Otto Hahn Medal of the Max Planck Society (1995) for his PhD work and a Feodor Lynen Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (1995). As a faculty member at UCSF, he received the David and Lucile Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering (1999), the Sloan Fellowship in Neuroscience (2000), the Klingenstein Award (2001) and the Byers Award for Basic Science Research (2006). He is an Honorary Professor of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO). ==Industry activities== In 2001, Herwig Baier co-founded, with Bill Harris and Paul Goldsmith, Daniolabs Ltd (Cambridge, UK), a biotech company with a focus on zebrafish drug screening for the discovery new treatments of ophthalmic, neurological and gastrointestinal diseases. Baier serves as a scientific consultant to biotech companies. ==External links== * Homepage of the department Genes – Circuits – Behavior ==References== Category:German biologists Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:University of California, San Francisco faculty ","title":"Herwig Baier"},{"id":"54245882","text":"Rečani (, officially: Речани - Зајаско, Rechani - Zajasko; ) is a village in the municipality of Kičevo, North Macedonia.

Its sources sprout from a great number of points, almost all on the flanks of the immense plateau of the Beni Slimane, plateau between Médéa and Sour El Ghozlane. The three main rivers that contribute to the formation of Oued Isser are: The first, on the side of Medea: Wadi Malah, also formed by three other small rivers: Wad Ladrech, whose source is in the Ouled Trif, on the side of Medea; The Wadi El Hammam, which originates in the Ouled Malel, occupies the center; Oued Meleh, which originates in Si Mohamed Ghoglath; The second river is called Oued El Meleh or Oued Yaggou; Its main source is in Ouled Mouby, in Ain Nar. This river is placed between the preceding and the following; And the third Oued Zegkrouat; The main source near Sour El Ghozlane, in Bouid-Saël, in the Ouled Ferah.

The submarine was launched on December 12, 1982, commissioned on December 7, 1983. Because of the economic crisis, the government didn't authorize the reparations of the submarine and was decommissioned on June 29, 2012. ==History== Siroco was ordered by a ministerial order and on a proposal of the Office of the Chief of the Navy Staff in 1974 along with other Agosta class submarine, Galerna (S-71). The construction of the ships took place on Cartagena, Spain. On June 13, 1985, the submarine was in Cartagena's waters in a practice exercises and the only ship near was a Spanish destroyer Almirante Valdés. The two ships collided at 8.52 am. This event alarmed the destroyer who ordered to be prepared to fight. On June 2, 2010 the S-72 was quoted in some Spanish press and radio, for photos taken of a merchant with suspect military equipment off the coast of Syria. It was a NATO Active Endeavor mission held in early March of that year. In May 2012, the cuts by the central government over the economic crisis made it impossible to invest at least €25 million in a contract with the shipyard of Navantia in Cartagena that had been postponed during the last two years and finale, the ship was decommissioned.La Armada da de baja el 'Siroco' y centra sus esfuerzos en los submarinos S-80 After the decommission, the Spanish Navy tried to sell the submarine to other navies like the Turkish or Thai Navy.

On 17 October 1865, the foundation stone of the new church was laid. The main church building was built from 1865 to 1866, and its steeple was built from 1870 to 1872. The church was consecrated on 31 January 1867 by Ashurst Gilbert, the Bishop of Chichester. It is made from red brick with Bath stone dressings, and has a polychrome, clay tile roof. There were later additions to the church: a baptistry was added in 1892; a chapel was added to the south in 1903; and church room was built in 1954. The church was originally dedicated as the Church of the Holy Saviour. In 1971, the neighbouring St Peter's Church was demolished and the two parishes were combined, but it remained St Saviour's Church. On 17 May 1971, the church was designated a grade II* listed building. Present day St Saviour's Church is in the parish of St. Saviour and St. Peter, Eastbourne in the Archdeaconry of Hastings of the Diocese of Chichester. The church was built as a Tractarian place of worship, and the parish currently stands in the Traditional Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As the parish is against the ordination of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Chichester (currently Martin Warner), and is a member of both Forward in Faith and The Society. ==List of vicars== There have been ten Vicars of St Saviour's Church: * 1867–1897: Henry Robert Whelpton * 1897–1927: Henry Urling Whelpton * 1928–1944: Claude Williams * 1944–1961: Joseph Guy Heatherington * 1962–1976: Owen Whiting * 1976–1991: Derek William Allen * 1992–2004: Derek Mottershead * 2005–2015: Jeffery Thomas Gunn * 2016–2017: Christopher Yates * 2018-date: Mark McAulay SSC ==ReferencesExternal links== * Parish website * A Church Near You entry Eastbourne Eastbourne Eastbourne Eastbourne Eastbourne Category:Churches in Eastbourne ","title":"St Saviour's Church, Eastbourne"},{"id":"54246240","text":"Pierre de Bousquet de Florian is the head of the French National Centre for Counter Terrorism, an agency charged with monitoring and preventing terrorism in France.

He received his high school diploma at the Goethe-Schule in Bochum in 1968. In 1970, after two semesters of studying civil engineering at the Ruhr-University Bochum, he changed to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. During the first two semesters at the Kunstakademie he studied with Professor Karin Rissa and from then on with Professor Erwin Heerich. He successfully completed his study of painting in 1976. Keining continues to live and work in Düsseldorf till today. Keining’s first exhibition was in 1979 in the Westfälischer Kunstverein, Münster, Germany, where he presented large watercolour paintings (about 70 cm x 90 cm) with motifs from architecture, in which the interplay of light and shadow in deserted spaces was of particular significance. In 1984 he presented watercolour paintings at exhibitions in the Kunstverein Kassel, Germany, and at the Galerie Luise Krohn in Badenweiler, Germany. These watercolour paintings using imagery from architecture are barely discernable due to being flooded by light. Then, between 1984 and 1985 the figure became the focus of Keining’s artistic interest. In 1986, architecture again became the central theme of Keining’s painting. By this time, Keining was working at a larger studio. He created works in which the three-dimensional quality of the architecture is reduced to a flat depiction reminiscent of ground-plans, but also works that are characterized by perspective fragments of architecture. Here his preferred material was no longer watercolour, but oil-based paint, which was still applied on paper until 1990 when he began to use canvas. On large formats (225 cm x 175 cm) the subject of ground-plans was varied in so far as line elements of the pictures define partitions of flat areas. Two extensive work groups differ from each other in colours: a blue-green and an earthy red. On the occasion of an international work-meeting Keining started to reduce the ground-plans to stripes. These pictures were part of a major exhibition together with Erwin Heerich at the Heidelberger Kunstverein (Art association of Heidelberg, Germany). Stefan Berg, director of Kunstmuseum Bonn commented: “The stripe pictures shimmer subtly between abstract flatness and three dimensionality”[1]. As Keining began looking for further abstract elements for pictures, script (letters) and text elements in particular played an important role. For the first time, names of brands and names of models of American car manufacturers appeared in his paintings. This was stimulated by a study visit to New York City. In 1999 Keining created a work of 90 pieces (Lukas colorplates): The relatively small paintings show all colour nuances of the well known producer of artist's paints; the producer’s specific names and numbers of the colours are integrated in the pictures thereby underscoring the use of text. An extensive group of paintings (2002) is based on fragments of texts of Marquis de Sade. By smudging the freshly applied oil-paint Keining distorted the text to such a degree that it was almost illegible – thus giving the observers freedom to imagine their own sexual fantasies. In 2003, Keining received a commission for paintings to be applied directly on the plaster walls of rooms in the Mariakirchen moated castle near Arnstorf, Germany. Since oil does not adhere permanently to plaster, a new technique was necessary. In order to distort the contours Keining used a spray gun and synthetic resins. He created eight wall paintings (about 200 cm x 150 cm) with a distinct ornamental structure. Due to his positive experiences with this material and technique Keining began to work with a spray gun and synthetic resin on canvas also. Until then Keining’s work had been characterized by the well-thought-out processing of specific subject areas (series, work groups). From this point on, however, he created instead individual pictures that combined in different ways elements such as flowers, animals, ornaments, but also comics and advertisements from the 1950s. Again and again script appeared as an element of the pictures. Keining used several slides projected one after another onto the canvas for the composition of the pictures. Some portions of the pictures are characterized by sprayed paint, others by brushed paint. The overlay of the portions leads to the impression of two or more visual levels in the pictures; e.g., the sharp silhouette of painted script stands out in front of a sprayed blurred ornament in the background. As the sprayed application of paint already blurs the contours more or less, the overlay of portions of the pictures increases the blur. This approach elicits great ambiguity undermining definitive interpretations. The art historian Daniel Spanke about Keinings works: “But this diversity of possibilities of paintings, which Keining has worked for during the years, is by no means a juxtaposition of arbitrary, seemingly incompatible styles, but is based on a development that went through different styles of painting and pictures, in order to trace the essence of the picture. Thereby the interest of the observer is directed to an important fundamental question of human culture: How is the world transformed to a picture and what happens during this transformation.”[2] == Exhibitions (selection) == * 2019: ScoOP,Stadtmuseum Hattingen, Germany * 2017: HORST KEINING, IKOB International Art Centre East Belgium, Belgium * 2016: Kaviar & Roter Tee, Martin Leyer-Pritzkow Düsseldorf * 2016: Zugewinn, Museum Moyland Castle, Bedburg-Haus, with Katharina Sieverding a.o.

He studied at Leuven University, graduating Master of Arts before the age of 20, and on 12 June 1579 he was appointed to a benefice of the chaplaincy of St Margaret in Mechelen. In 1585 he was appointed to teach dialectics and metaphysics in Lily College, Leuven, while pursuing further studies in the Faculty of Medicine. In 1591 he graduated licentiate in medicine and was appointed to the university's academic council. He audited the lectures of Adriaan van Roomen.G. van Doorslaer, \\"Storms, Jean\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 24 (Brussels, 1929), 94–99.

Here, a group of adivasis agreed to desist from paying taxes to jagirdars until the Maharana addressed the problems with the jagirdari system. == Beginnings of the Movement == The immediate inspiration for the movement was Motilal Tejawat's exposure to the Bijolia movement. Pamphlets associated with the Bijolia movement were circulating throughout Mewar around 1920. Tejawat distributed copies of these pamphlets in Jharol thikana, whose jagirdar was known to oppress adivasis and followed up by calling a series of meeting in adivasi villages in the area, leading to formation of a committee that sought to articulate the grievances and demands of the adivasi peasantry. In May 1921, Tejawat was able to utilize a large gathering of adivasi peasants at the annual peasant fair Matri Mundiya near Chittor to spread his message and mobilize his followers on the issues of begar and unfair taxation. After the fair, a large number of protesting peasants marched to Udaipur to seek an audience with the Maharana who agreed to meet them and conceded some, but not all demands. Three important issues on which the Maharana granted no concession were: the use of forests by adivasis, begar, and the rounding up of adivasis for the royal shikhar (hunt). == Support of Reformist Press == The reformist newspaper 'Navin Rajasthan' strongly supported the Eki Movement. The newspaper condemned the violence against the movement in the states of Idar and Sirohi, and Vijay Singh Pathik wrote a series of articles highlighting the conditions of the adivasis that gave rise to the movement. Navin Rajasthan sent Ram Narain Chaudhary to study the situation. The newspapers 'Lokvani' and 'Praja Sevak' also published articles on the conditions of the peasants associated with the Eki Movement. == Support of the Indian National Congress == The intense press coverage of the movement drew the attention of national leaders of the Indian National Congress. == Violent suppression of movement == On March 7, 1922, several thousand agitators gathered in the village of Palchitaria in Idar State (the village was renamed Dadhvav and now lies in Vijaynagar taluka, Sabarkantha district in present-day Gujarat). Troops of the Mewar Bhil Corps under the command of Major H.G. Sutton opened fire on the crowds. While Major Sutton described the engagement as a 'skirmish' in which 22 persons were killed, local oral tradition claims that between 1,000 and 1,500 were killed. Tejawat himself managed to escape the carnage, and the movement continued for another two months. The events at Dadhvav received little coverage in the then- contemporary press, and is often an ignored chapter in later historical accounts. While some claim that this oversight is because \\"those killed were poor, illiterate tribals\\", at least one historian attributes the oversight to the fact that \\"Motilal Tejawat's movement did not conform to Gandhain precepts...[and]...publicity about the massacre did not at the moment accord with the overall political agenda of the nationalist leadership.\\" On May 8, 1922, the villages of Bhula and Balohiya were besieged by police who fired shots on the Bhil residents and set fire to houses. According to one journalistic account of the event, 1,800 Bhils were killed and 640 houses were burnt or destroyed. By the end of May 1922, the movement had \\"all but collapsed.\\" ==References== Category:Social movements in India ","title":"Eki Movement"},{"id":"54246332","text":"Southern Army was a home service formation of the British Army during the First World War, responsible for the defence of South-East England, including both sides of the Thames Estuary.

He is an aristocratic Victorian man. == Background == Dorian is the grandson of the late Lord Kelso. His mother, Lady Margaret Devereux, was portrayed as a beautiful and rich woman. Her grandfather had a strong dislike for Kelso and, therefore, bequeathed the entire Selby property to Margaret. Dorian’s father, a subaltern in a foot regiment, was killed by a Belgian brute a few months after his marriage to Lady Margaret, who died soon after. Ivan Albright, The Picture of Dorian Gray, 1943–44 == Plot == The novel's plot varies among the published versions. The summary below deals with the longest version, the 1891 novel. However, certain episodes describe in particular Dorian's encounter with (and subsequent murder of) James Vane. This does not appear in the version originally submitted by Wilde for publishing. The Picture of Dorian Gray begins on a summer day in Victorian England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting a portrait of Dorian Gray, a handsome young man, who is Basil's ultimate muse. While posing for the painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his hedonistic worldview and begins to think that pursuits of pleasure are the only things in life worth pursuing. This prompts Dorian to wish that his painted image would age instead of himself. Under the hedonistic influence of Lord Henry, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs Shakespeare in a dingy working-class theatre. Dorian approaches and courts her and soon proposes marriage. The enamored Sibyl calls him \\"Prince Charming\\" and swoons with elation at the prospect of true love. However, her protective brother James warns that if \\"Prince Charming\\" harms her, he will murder him. Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform, but she is too enamored with Dorian to act and performs poorly. This causes both Basil and Lord Henry to think that Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling her that acting was her beauty and without that, she no longer interests him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty. Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian resolves to reconcile with Sibyl, but he is too late as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has committed suicide by swallowing prussic acid. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed, lust and good looks will serve him well. He locks the portrait up, and over the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice possible, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him. The narrative does not reveal the title of the French novel, but, at trial, Wilde said that the novel referred to in Dorian Gray was À rebours (Against Nature, 1884) by Joris-Karl Huysmans, but then denied that the book is the one to which he referred. One night, before leaving for Paris, Basil visits Dorian's house to ask him about various rumors regarding his vulgar self-indulgence. Dorian does not deny his debauchery and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature that he affixes to all his portraits. Basil is horrified and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate on Basil and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body. Alan later takes his own life as a result of the shameful collaboration. To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but he had no leads to pursue; the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, \\"Prince Charming\\". In the opium den, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as \\"Prince Charming\\", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself eighteen years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing him. She confirms the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years. James runs after Dorian, but he has left. James then begins to stalk Dorian, causing him to fear for his life. However, during a shooting party, one of its members accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will live righteously from then on. His new probity begins with a resolution not to break the heart of the naïve Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his new-found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture, but when he looks, he sees only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true motives for moral reformation were, in fact, immoral, due to their being merely a means to a selfish end. Deciding that only full confession will absolve him of his wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes – the picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil and stabs the picture. The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard the cry calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an unknown old man, stabbed in the heart, his face and figure withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse as Dorian by the rings on its fingers; beside him is the picture of Dorian Gray, restored to its original beauty. ==Depictions on screen== * Dorian Grays Portræt (1910) *: Directed by Axel Strøm *: Starring Valdemar Psilander as Dorian Gray * The Picture of Dorian Gray (1913) *: Directed by Phillips Smalley *: Starring Wallace Reid as Dorian Gray; Lois Weber, and Smalley.

Among her New England ancestors were the schoolmaster Ezekiel Cheever, Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor Thomas Dudley, and colonist Zaccheus Gould. The family moved to Chelsea when she was a girl. ==Literary career== Gould published several collections of her own verse, including Stray Pebbles from the Shores of Thought (1892) and One's Self I Sing, and Other Poems (1904). She wrote lyrics for a number of songs, including \\"Columbia—America\\", which became the anthem of the Massachusetts chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Gould greatly admired the poetry of Walt Whitman, and in 1889, she published a collection of extracts from his poetry, Gems from Walt Whitman. It also included a poem she wrote in honor of Whitman and an essay, \\"Walt Whitman Among the Soldiers\\". It was the first time that Whitman had allowed anyone but his editor William Rossetti to publish such selections and he regretted it afterwards (as he had previously with Rossetti), feeling that his poetry did not lend itself to fragmentary extracts. The novelist William Dean Howells, however, wrote that Gould's book \\"shows [Whitman] in his supreme moments\\" with passages likely to offend contemporary middle-class taste \\"wisely left out\\". Several critics felt that Gould's edition was useful for its potential to draw new readers to Whitman — which was indeed one of Gould's primary reasons for issuing the collection. An unusual feature of the book was that it was wider than it was tall (7 x 5.5. inches) in order to accommodate Whitman's long poetic lines without breaking them. In 1900, Gould published a study of Anne Gilchrist, Whitman's friend and fellow writer. Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman presents an idealized view of Gilchrist and her relationship with Whitman, but it was carefully researched and one of the first books to provide a substantive account of Gilchrist's critical abilities and her importance in Whitman's life. Gould published frequently on education. She wrote on a wide range of subjects, including schooling in China, education for the deaf, the Turkish high school Robert College, the German educator Friedrich Froebel, the Indian education reformer Pundita Ramabai, the American schoolmaster Ezekiel Cheever, and the early teaching experiences of John Adams and Daniel Webster. Publications for which she wrote included the New York Critic, New England Magazine, and Century Magazine. She also lectured extensively on women's education, women's suffrage, and other subjects, including the lives of Abigail Adams, Mary Somerville, and Caroline Herschel. Gould was active in civic and reformist organizations, including the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, the Massachusetts Society of Good Citizenship, the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women, and the Woman's Board of Foreign Missions. A small collection of her papers, including correspondence and a scrapbook, is held by the Peabody Essex Museum. ==Books and pamphlets== * Ezekiel Cheever, Schoolmaster, 1872 * Gems from Walt Whitman, 1889 * Stray Pebbles from the Shores of Thought, 1892 * How I Became a Woman Suffragist, ca. 1893 * Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman, 1900 * One's Self I Sing, and Other Poems, 1904 * A Pioneer Doctor: A Story of the Seventies, 1904 * John Adams and Daniel Webster as Schoolmasters, 1904 * The Brownings and America, 1904 == References External links== *Stray Pebbles from the Shores of Thought at Project Gutenberg Category:1848 births Category:1906 deaths Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American poets Category:American women poets Category:American women essayists Category:American essayists Category:American education writers Category:People from Manchester-by-the- Sea, Massachusetts Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"Elizabeth Porter Gould"},{"id":"54246458","text":"Praxis nova et expeditissima mensurandi geometrice, 1688 Stanisław Solski (Kalisz, September 21, 1622 – Kraków, 9 August, 1701) was a Polish Jesuit mathematician and architect.

The winner of the regular season series is awarded a four-foot wrench. The trophy is awarded based on points earned for wins (3 points each) and draws (1 point each) during the regular USL season and for U.S. Open Cup fixtures, should the teams meet during the tournament. In case of a tie in both points and goal differential, the team with the higher number of away goals scored will determine the winner. Finally, in case of a tie on points, goal differential and away goals, the trophy will be given to the team with the highest final placement in the USLC rankings. ==History== The Oklahoma City Energy formed in late 2013, and FC Tulsa, previously known as \\"Tulsa Roughnecks FC\\", formed in mid-2014. Both clubs began their series ahead of the 2015 USL season. The Energy's formation came through local businessman, Bob Funk, Jr., who pursued a bid for a club in the USLC (then known as the United Soccer League) in early 2013. Funk was awarded a franchise on July 2, 2013 with an intended launch date in 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season the Energy FC announced an affiliation agreement with Major League Soccer side, Sporting Kansas City. Former Kansas City goalkeeper, Jimmy Nielsen, was named head coach. In March 2014, OKC Pro Soccer owner and founder of Oklahoma City's Fields & Futures program Tim McLaughlin joined the club as an ownership partner, bringing a secured lease to Taft Stadium, where Energy FC began play in 2015. The club's 2014 home schedule was played at Pribil Stadium on the campus of Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School. The origins of FC Tulsa date back to 1978, when the original Tulsa Roughnecks formed. The original Roughnecks formed as a relocation of Team Hawaii ahead of the 1978 North American Soccer League season. The original Roughnecks won Soccer Bowl '83 against the Toronto Blizzard. The second iteration of the Roughnecks came in 1993, which joined the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), the body that evolved into the operator of today's USLC, the United Soccer League. The best season results for this version of the Roughnecks came in 1993 and 1994 where they reached the divisional finals in the playoffs. The club folded following the 1999–2000 USISL I-League season. ==Winners by year== {  - ! Year ! Winner ! TUL Points ! OKC Points !

She was one of the five women evaluated in Freud's Studies on Hysteria, which led to his psychoanalytic theories. Her father, Baron Heinrich von Sulzer-Wart had inherited his title from her grandfather, Johann Heinrich von Sulzer-Wart, who had been awarded a peerage for service to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. On 28 December 1870, she married Swiss watchmaker and industrialist Heinrich Moser, who had made a fortune by developing high-quality watches to sell on the Russian market. H. Moser & Co. then expanded to include a factory in Switzerland and Heinrich founded a railway company in Schaffhausen, furthering his wealth. The marriage caused scandal because Fanny was 23 and Heinrich 65, though both were from the upper echelons of society. The five older children from her husband's first marriage were fully grown, as their father had waited twenty years before his remarriage, but they rejected Moser. She had two children with Heinrich: , born 27 May 1872 and Luise, the author Mentona, born 19 October 1874, just four days before her father's death. The older children accused Moser of killing her husband and despite no evidence of foul play determined by two autopsies, suspicion continued. Moser had a mental breakdown and began seeing therapists in 1889. She acquired a castle, Schloss Au where she entertained lavishly, but was known for her eccentricities, continuing treatment for almost a decade. Late in life, she became infatuated with a much younger man, lost part of her fortune and cut off relationships with her daughters. When she died, she left millions to her daughters, though she had been convinced she was living in poverty. Moser was buried at the cemetery of Kilchberg, Zürich. == References == Category:1848 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People from Winterthur Category:Swiss nobility Category:Psychiatric assessment Category:Swiss women ","title":"Fanny Moser (baroness)"},{"id":"54246557","text":"Bryan Yeubrey (born 18 August 1960) is a PR consultant and agent for sportspeople, musicians and writers. == Career == As a FIFA licensed players' agent, he has represented international footballers including Essam El-Hadary and Hossam Ghaly.

It is mostly known for their chumbox ads. The company was founded in 2007. It provides advertisements such as \\"Around the Web\\" and \\"Recommended For You\\" boxes at the bottom of many online news articles. ==History== Taboola was founded in 2007 by Adam Singolda. The company was founded in Israel and initially provided a recommendation engine for video content. The company headquarters were later moved to New York City. Taboola raised $1.5 million in funding in November 2007. This was followed by $4.5 million in November 2008, and $9 million in August 2011. Additionally, Taboola raised $15 million in February 2013. By 2019, Taboola was used to provide 450 billion recommendations on a monthly basis, due to adoption by major news websites, like the IBM-owned The Weather Company. In 2014, Taboola acquired a California-based programmatic advertising company called Perfect Market. In February 2015, Taboola raised $117 million in a Series E funding round. In May of that year, Taboola announced an additional funding from Baidu for an undisclosed amount. In July 2016, Taboola acquired ConvertMedia, a recommendation engine for video content. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. In January 2017, Taboola acquired a website personalization firm called Commerce Sciences, for an undisclosed sum. Commerce Sciences' technology may re-work a website's layout, based on whether a user is more likely to click on a banner ad, newsletter, or video. In October 2019, Taboola announced its intention to merge with its rival, Outbrain, subject to regulatory approval. The aim of this merger was for the two companies to reach a bigger audience in order to be more competitive against the advertising activities of companies like Google and Facebook. In September 2020, Taboola and Outbrain ceased merger discussions and carry on as independent organisations. In July 2020, Taboola changed from revenue guarantee to revenue share model which resulted in major clients such as Fox News and UK's News Corp leaving, which compromised the ability of Taboola to obtain new financing that was part of the original merger agreement. The combined valuation of the called off merger would have been $2 billion. == Corporate affairs ==  Leadership  Taboola is managed by CEO and Founder Adam Singolda. Other key executives are: * Eldad Maniv, President, COO * David Aber, CFO * Lior Golan, CTO Products / business model Taboola's Facebook-like scrollable feedTaboola creates the \\"Around The Web\\" and \\"Recommended For You\\" boxes at the bottom of many webpages. Additionally, it can recommend video content or user-generated content. Taboola is used by content publishers to encourage users to view more articles on the same site, or to gain revenues for referral traffic. Marketers and brands bid for views of their content. Then, an algorithm displays the advertiser's content to certain website users based on the content the user is viewing, the content's length and metadata, the user's history, and other factors. The most popular ad categories on Taboola are finance and fitness. Taboola also has tools for publishers to remove offensive content and vet ads before they are displayed. Taboola provides approximately 450 billion article recommendations each month. It is implemented on a website with a line of Javascript. The Taboola Choice feature, which was introduced in 2013, added the ability for users to filter out recommendations they do not want to see. An API for mobile apps was added that December. Taboola started working on extending more features to mobile devices, user-generated content, and apps in 2015. In 2017, the company added a Facebook-like scrollable feed of links to articles and videos. ==Reception== An article in Fortune said much of the content recommended by Taboola is \\"the worst of the Web.\\" Recommended articles include things like “The World’s Cutest Cat Pictures All On One Site” and “Top 15 Celebrities You Didn’t Know are Black”. According to Fortune, \\"Popular content isn’t always good content.\\" In May of 2013, Taboola founder Singolda said the ads help support a sustainable business model for journalism and the company vets ads before they are displayed. In 2016, Taboola was criticized for running an ad called \\"Meet the Women Making Rape Jokes That Are Actually Funny” alongside an article about teenage rape. Critics argue that services like Taboola are used for clickbait or fake news. An analysis conducted by ChangeAdvertising in September 2016 found 26 percent of sponsored links on services like Outbrain and Taboola were clickbait. The Taboola widget appeared on a fake news story claiming Muslim nurses were refusing to wash their hands before surgery at hospitals in the United Kingdom. A company spokesperson said Taboola attempts to balance promoting free speech by allowing articles promoting unpopular views, with the need to screen for fake news or other misleading websites. In May 2014, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) requested that Taboola make it more clear that its recommended links are sponsored by advertisers. At the time, the disclosure that links are sponsored was in small grey font in the upper-right-hand corner of the recommended articles box, which the BBB said was not prominent enough. Taboola argued it was not an advertiser and its disclosures were clear, but agreed to make the disclosure more prominent. In the following years, to tackle the brand safety issue for marketers, Taboola has made a series of investments: it has employed more than 40 people to monitor 30+ languages – committed to reviewing more than 1 million pieces of content on a monthly basis to ensure brand safety – and established strong partnerships with IAB, Moat, TAG, Integral Ad Science, and Double Verify to address the issue. ==See also== *Chum box, type of advert often used by Taboola ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:Contextual advertising Category:Online advertising methods Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Digital marketing companies of the United States Category:Israeli inventions Category:Israeli companies established in 2007 ","title":"Taboola"},{"id":"54246592","text":"Osilodrostat, sold under the brand name Isturisa, is a medication for the treatment of adults with Cushing's disease who either cannot undergo pituitary gland surgery or have undergone the surgery but still have the disease. It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects are adrenal insufficiency, headache, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention). Hypocortisolism (low cortisol levels), QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm condition) and elevations in adrenal hormone precursors (inactive substance converted into a hormone) and androgens (hormone that regulates male characteristics) may also occur in people taking osilodrostat. Osilodrostat was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020, and for medical use in the United States in March 2020. Osilodrostat is an orally active, nonsteroidal corticosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor which was developed by Novartis for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome and pituitary hypersecretion (a specific subtype of Cushing's syndrome). It specifically acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and at higher dosages of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). The drug was also under development for the treatment of heart failure, hypertension, and solid tumors, but development was discontinued for these indications.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800026342 ==History== In October 2014, an orphan designation was granted by the European Commission for osilodrostat for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Osilodrostat was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020, and for medical use in the United States in March 2020. Osilodrostat's safety and effectiveness for treating Cushing's disease among adults was evaluated in a study of 137 adult subjects (about three-quarters women) with a mean age of 41 years. The majority of subjects either had undergone pituitary surgery that did not cure Cushing's disease or were not surgical candidates. In the 24-week, single-arm, open-label period, all subjects received a starting dose of 2 milligrams (mg) of osilodrostat twice a day that could be increased every two weeks up to 30 mg twice a day. At the end of this 24-week period, about half of subjects had cortisol levels within normal limits. After this point, 71 subjects who did not need further dose increases and tolerated the drug for the last 12 weeks entered an eight-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study where they either received osilodrostat or a placebo (inactive treatment). At the end of this withdrawal period, 86% of subjects receiving osilodrostat maintained cortisol levels within normal limits compared to 30% of subjects taking the placebo. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved osilodrostat based on the evidence from one clinical trial (NCT02180217) of 137 subjects with Cushing's disease. The trial was conducted at 66 sites across 19 countries (United States, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Columbia, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey). There was one trial of 48 weeks duration that assessed the benefits and side effects of osilodrostat. The trial enrolled subjects with Cushing's disease for whom pituitary gland surgery was not an option or did not work. The trial was divided in four periods. Subjects received osilodrostat two times a day in all four periods. After the first two periods (24 weeks), the benefit of osilodrostat was assessed by the percentage of subjects who had 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels within normal limits. In the third period (which lasted eight weeks), half of the subjects who had normal urinary free cortisol levels after 24 weeks of treatment continued taking osilodrostat and the other half was switched to placebo. Neither the subjects nor the healthcare providers know which treatment was given during this period. The benefit of osilodrostat was assessed on the percentage of subjects who had normal cortisol levels at the end of this period versus the subjects who received placebo. The FDA granted osilodrostat an orphan drug designation and granted the approval of Isturisa to Novartis. ==See also== * Levoketoconazole ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * * Category:11β-Hydroxylase inhibitors Category:Aldosterone synthase inhibitors Category:Antiglucocorticoids Category:Fluoroarenes Category:Imidazoles Category:Nitriles Category:Novartis brands Category:Orphan drugs Category:Pyrroles ","title":"Osilodrostat"},{"id":"54246597","text":"Oda Nielsen Oda Laurenze Helmine Nielsen née Larsen (1851–1936) was a highly acclaimed Danish actress who performed both in private theatres in Copenhagen and at the Royal Danish Theatre. Inspired by French actresses, she played the roles of attractive young women, for example in the title roles of Frøken Nitouche and Victorien Sardou's Dora. She later took on roles where she sang, imitating the French singer Yvette Guilbert. This increased her popularity not only in Scandinavia but also in the United States where she performed for Danish audiences. One of her favourite roles in later life was Grevinde Danner (Countess Danner) in Sven Leopold's Hos Grevinden. ==Biography== Born on 7 August 1851 in Liepāja, Latvia, Oda Laurenze Helmine Larsen was the daughter of the ship owner Jens Larsen (1820–85) and Caresia Møller (1822–74). In 1871, she married the telegraphy executive Jens Petersen (1843–80) and in 1884, the actor Martinius Nielsen (1859-1928). Nielsen's début was in May 1870 at the Casino Theatre, Copenhagen, when she acted anomynously in Erik Bogh's Vaudeville play Et enfoldigt Pigebarn. Despite her lack of any previous stage experience, she proved a great success, thanks to her natural grace and her good singing voice. After a few more roles at the Casino, in 1871 she married an executive from the Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab whom she accompanied to Paris where he was stationed until his death in 1880. Now familiar with the theatrical repertoire in Paris, she returned to the Casino in 1881, playing the title role in Victorien Sardou's Dora, arousing comparisons with the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Such was her success that she was also invited to act at the Royal Danish Theatre but she actually preferred appearing at the Casino and later at the Dagmar Theatre. Here, in 1884, she was enormously successful in the operetta Frøken Nitouche, appearing 500 times. That year she married the actor Martin Nielsen, joining him in performances of plays by Adam Oehlenschläger, Ludvig Holberg and Henrik Ibsen at the Royal Theatre over the next six years. Her husband then took over the management of the Casino Theatre and merged it with the Dagmar, benefiting from the support of his wife. Her popularity continued to increase, especially when she imitated the French singer Yvette Guilbert in works such as Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne. In 1906, she went to the United States on a singing tour, performing for Danish audiences. In later life, one of her most successful roles was Grevinde Danner in Svend Leopold's Hos Grevinden which she continued to perform in the provinces until she was almost 80. In 1910, she was awarded the Ingenio et arti and in 1920 the Danish Medal of Merit. Oda Nielsen died in Skodsborg on 11 September 1936 and is buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery. == External links == * ==References== Category:Danish female singers Category:1851 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Actresses from Copenhagen Category:Actors from Liepāja Category:19th-century Danish singers Category:Recipients of the Medal of Merit (Denmark) Category:Recipients of Ingenio et Arti Category:19th- century Danish actresses Category:Danish stage actresses Category:20th-century Danish actresses Category:19th-century women singers ","title":"Oda Nielsen"},{"id":"54246606","text":"Abimbola \\"Bim\\" Afolami (born 11 February 1986) is a British Conservative Party politician.

Bidwell (November 8, 1858 - March 16, 1948) was a pioneering bicycle salesman and manufacturer. Active in politics as a Republican, from July 14, 1897 to April 3, 1902, he was Collector of the Port of New York. ==Biography== Bicycle salesman George Rogers Bidwell was born in Buffalo, New York on November 8, 1858. His father Charles S. Bidwell was a prominent Buffalo shipbuilder, and his grandfather Benjamin Bidwell, also a shipwright, had constructed several ships for Matthew C. Perry's fleet during the War of 1812. Bidwell was educated in the public schools of Buffalo before beginning his career in bicycle sales and manufacturing. Bidwell saw his first bicycle at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and soon bought one for himself. After becoming a proficient bike rider and mechanic, Bidwell later inquired to Albert Augustus Pope, a prominent bicycle manufacturer, about becoming a salesman. Pope told Bidwell about his new Columbia bicycles, one of which Bidwell promptly ordered so he could study its design and workings. After being brought into Pope's organization, Bidwell proved to be a successful salesman, and Pope promoted him to superintendent of agencies, responsible for supervising the retail locations and franchises that sold the Pope company's products. In 1880, Bidwell became one of the charter members of the newly-formed League of American Wheelmen. In 1881, Bidwell acceded to Pope's request that he move to New York City to take a sales position at E. I. Horsman's sporting goods store, which Pope hoped would result in increased sales.Epperson, p. 68 At a conference of the League of American Wheelmen, Bidwell saw a modern safety bicycle, a Rover designed by John Kemp Starley.Epperson, p. 84 Bidwell saw immediately that the safety would replace the Penny-farthing or \\"ordinary\\" bicycle with a high front wheel that was then the industry standard, and recommended that Pope start production of safeties, but Pope refused.Epperson, p. 84 Bidwell then left Pope to start his own corporation, the George R. Bidwell Company, which made safeties and conducted research and development on bicycle design and function.Epperson, p. 84 In 1890, Bidwell's research and development let him to become the first American bicycle maker to use pneumatic tires. He lost a lawsuit that accused him of patent infringement for using pneumatic tires, but won an 1892 appeal of the original ruling against him. Bidwell lost so much money fighting the lawsuit that he needed to acquire outside investors, which he was unable to find. His company went into receivership, and he ceased making pneumatic tires, but kept the company operating until his appointment as Collector. Political career As a member of the League of American Wheelmen, Bidwell had lobbied for laws protecting cyclists. In 1894, Bidwell became secretary of the New York County Republican Committee, and served for two years. Afterwards, Bidwell took over Republican operations in New York City's Nineteenth Assembly District. In 1897, Bidwell was appointed as Collector of the Port of New York by President William McKinley. Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, customs duties (tariffs) and excise taxes were the primary sources of US federal government revenue,Buenker, John D. 1981. \\"The Ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.\\" The Cato Journal. 1:1. and as the largest port in the United States at the time (by 1910, the port was the busiest in the world), the Port of New York was therefore the single most important source of federal government income. These factors led the office of Collector of the Port of New York to be described as \\"the prize plum of Federal patronage not only in this State but perhaps in the country, outside of positions in the Cabinet.\\" In 1901, new President Theodore Roosevelt decided to replace Bidwell with New York State Senator Nevada N. Stranahan, against the wishes of Senator Thomas C. Platt. Bidwell's term in office officially ended when Stranahan was confirmed in April 1902. ==Later life== After a career in bicycle manufacturing, Bidwell later turned his interests to the automobile and established a factory in Pottstown, Pennsylvania for making truck engines. During World War I, Bidwell converted his Pottstown factory to the manufacture of artillery shells. Bidwell died in Brightwaters, New York on March 16, 1948. ==Legacy== Bidwell's papers are part of the collections of the Hofstra University Library. ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1948 deaths Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:Politicians from Buffalo, New York Category:Businesspeople from Buffalo, New York Category:Collectors of the Port of New York Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States ","title":"George R.

Both creatures were jointly designed by Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida over a period of 18 months. Their designs draw inspiration from Norse mythology and are based on the shapes \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\". Known as the Life and Destruction Pokémon, respectively, Xerneas and Yveltal are powerful creatures said to have shaped the history of the Pokémon world. Xerneas and Yveltal appeared in many other games and media since their debut. ==Concept and characteristics== The development of Pokémon X and Y began in 2010, and the games were released worldwide on October 12, 2013. The titles X and Y, representing the x-axis and y-axis—also reflecting different forms of thinking—were chosen early in development. At the request of game director Junichi Masuda, the shapes \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" were used as the framework for the boxart legendary Pokémon: Xernas and Yveltal. Following tradition that began with Red and Green, Ken Sugimori was tasked with designing these two legendary Pokémon. Normally, Sugimori designs the legendary Pokémon by himself; however, he suffered from artist's block and required assistance from designer Atsuko Nishida to create Xerneas and Yveltal. Finalization of their designs took about 18 months, 3 times longer than normal. Xerneas is a large stag-like Pokémon adorned with glowing antlers, and Yveltal is a large y-shaped avian Pokémon with some draconian traits. Part of a Legendary trio, the designs of Xerneas and Yveltal are rooted in Norse Mythology. Xerneas traces to the Eikþyrnir, a stag that stands atop Valhalla, while Yveltal is inspired by the Hræsvelgr, a giant eagle able to make the wind blow by flapping its wings. Xerneas and Yveltal represent eternity and destruction, respectively. Xerneas can grant eternal life while Yveltal can absorb life energy. Xerneas donned the newly introduced Fairy-type and a new ability called Fairy Aura, which raises the power of all Fairy-type attacks in-battle. Yveltal is a dual Dark- and Flying-type with the unique ability Dark Aura which has the same effect as Xerneas' ability but for Dark-type attacks. Additionally, both Pokémon have unique attacks: Geomancy for Xerneas and Oblivion Wing for Yveltal. ==Appearances== In video games Within the main series games, Xerneas and Yveltal were at first only available in X and Y, respectively, but were made once again available for capture without an in-game event when Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were released in 2017. They serve a pivotal role in X and Ys story, providing the energy necessary for Team Flare to power their super weapon. They must be caught for the story to progress and can only be encountered once. From May 11 to 17, 2016, a shiny Xerneas was distributed via Wi-Fi to players using X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. An identical distribution of a shiny Yveltal took place the following week from May 20 to 28. Yveltal appears as one of the antagonists in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon, turning numerous characters to stone while under control of the primary antagonist \\"Dark Matter\\". During the story's climax, Yveltal is turned to stone by Dark Matter before being saved by the player character. After Dark Matter is defeated, Xerneas appears from the \\"Tree of Life\\" and enables to player to evolve any party member. Xerneas and Yveltal also appear in multiple other spinoff titles, including Pokémon Art Academy, Pokémon Rumble World, Pokémon Battle Trozei, Pokémon Shuffle, and Pokémon Picross. Yveltal is featured in the 2015 fighting game Pokkén Tournament as an assist character that can temporarily stop the player's opponent from using their Synergy Gauge. The 2016 mobile strategy game Pokémon Duel features both as EX-level figures. Additionally, Xerneas appears as an assist character and trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and as a spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Other media Both Xerneas and Yveltal appeared in the seventeenth Pokémon movie: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction and its manga adaptation. They also made minor appearances in the Pokémon: XY anime, and Yveltal further appeared briefly in Pokémon Generations. The two legendary Pokémon reprise their role from X and Y in the Pokémon Adventures manga during the X & Y chapter. They also made minor appearances in the Let's Play the Pokémon Card Game XY! manga. Furthermore, both appear on multiple cards in the Pokémon Trading Card Game. ==Promotion and reception== Xerneas and Yveltal were revealed on January 8, 2013, as part of the announcement of Pokémon X and Y during a Pokémon Direct broadcast. Three limited-edition Nintendo 3DS XL bundles were designed for Xerneas and Yveltal, a blue and red one featuring both Pokémon and a gold one featuring Xerneas, Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie. Pre-orders of X and Y in Japan were bundled with miniature figurines of the two legendary Pokémon. In 2014, three limited edition Nintendo 3DS XL systems featuring Xerneas and Yveltal were distributed at football matches played by Yokohama F. Marinos, Urawa Red Diamonds, and FC Tokyo. In an IGN poll with more than 8 million participants, Yveltal ranked as the second-most popular of the then 69 known new Pokémon in X and Y and Xerneas ranked fourth. A later publication by IGN in May 2019 ranked Xerneas as the tenth-best Legendary Pokémon, citing its influence on the competitive metagame and its \\"beautiful yet intimidating presence\\". In an official poll in Japan, Yveltal ranked twenty-sixth and Xerneas thirty-seventh out of the then-721 Pokémon. Screen Rant placed Xerneas as the eleventh-best Legendary Pokémon while Yveltal did not make the top 16. Ben Skipper of the International Business Times praised the designs of the two creatures, calling Xerneas \\"one of the strongest legendary designs produced to date\\" and complimented the freshness of Yveltal. Within the competitive metagame of Pokémon, Xerneas became a staple of championship teams. Its Fairy-typing, signature ability, and signature move Geomancy made it a dominating force that reshaped the competitive field. Starting with the 2016 Pokémon World Championships, Xerneas made regular appearances on top-placing teams. Even teams with dedicated counters to Xerneas could fall due to its overwhelming power. By 2019, Incineroar surpassed Xerneas as the most-used Pokémon. In stark contrast, Yveltal saw only one top team placement in 2016. ==FootnotesReferencesExternal links== *Xerneas on Bulbapedia *Yveltal on Bulbapedia *Xerneas on Pokemon.com *Yveltal on Pokemon.com Category:Pokémon species Category:Video game characters introduced in 2013 Category:Video game mascots Category:Animated duos ","title":"Xerneas and Yveltal"},{"id":"54246896","text":"The stem cell secretome (also referred to as the stromal cell secretome) is a collective term for the paracrine soluble factors produced by stem cells and utilized for their inter-cell communication. In addition to inter-cell communication, the paracrine factors are also responsible for tissue development, homeostasis and (re-)generation. The Stem Cell Secretome consists of extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, microvesicles, membrane particles, peptides and small proteins (cytokines). The paracrine activity of stem cells, i.e. the stem cell secretome, has been found to be the predominant mechanism by which stem cell-based therapies mediate their effects in degenerative, auto-immune and/or inflammatory diseases. Though not only stem cells possess a secretome which influences their cellular environment, their secretome currently appears to be the most relevant for therapeutic use . == Research == Stem Cell therapies, here referred to as therapies employing non- hematopoietic, mesenchymal stem cells, have a wide range of potential therapeutic benefits for different diseases, most of which are currently investigated in clinical trials. The therapeutic properties of stem cells are mainly attributed to their secretome, which has been shown to modulate several biological processes in vitro and in vivo, such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, immunomodulation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and stimulation of tissue adjacent cells. This is contrary to the historic hypothesis that stem cell migration and transdifferentiation is the primary mechanism of effect of stem cell injection therapies. The most commonly used type of stem cells for therapeutic use are human (autologous) Mesenchymal Stem Cells, hMSCs. hMSCs’ secretome is one the most widely researched secretome profile. The secretomes of other cell types, for example dendritic cells, are also being investigated for therapeutic use. Studies of hMSCs aimed for examining their regenerative capacities for putative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases have demonstrated that hMSCs are able to secrete important neuroregulatory molecules, such as: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1) both in vitro and in vivo. All of these molecules have been shown to have beneficial effects towards the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. With regard to orthopaedic conditions such as arthritis, the paracrine factors of stem cell-based therapies appeared to be responsible for the majority of regenerative effects. Extracellular vesicles have a prominent role in the development of joints and in the regulation of the intra-articular homeostasis. In the case of arthritis, this homeostasis is disrupted due to different reasons. Hypothetically, one reason may be related to the accumulation of senescent cells and their associated secretory phenotype. The secretome of (mesenchymal) Stem Cells has positive effects on reestablishing the intra-articular homeostasis and stimulating regeneration by different growth factors, cytokines and miRNA that are contained within the extracellular vesicles of the secretome. As a consequence, efforts have been made to synthesize specific stem cell secretomes efficiently, in vitro. In general, stem cells become activated and produce higher amounts of secretome in response to external stress (for example, by damaged tissues in vivo). As such, the main preconditioning mechanism to induce secretome (extracellular vesicles) production are stress-inducing methods, most prominently anoxia and hypoxia, but also pharmacological, physical or cytokine-related methods that force the cells to produce secretome in vitro. This approach is also known as cell-free stem cell therapy. It has been hypothesized that future therapies aiming at generating a (specific) secretome with a defined profile, and optimized concentrations of paracrine factors will yield a better, more reliable and controlled outcome as compared to previous approaches that rely solely on injecting (mesenchymal) stem cells into the body and hope that their paracrine (or trans differentiation) capacity will have beneficial effects in the body. However, the controlled therapeutic use of the stem cell secretome demands high-quality standardization of isolation and analysis techniques to yield reproducible secretome preparations. Various pharmaceutical companies and clinical institutions have started to develop protocols for the in vitro extraction of specific secretome profiles from autologous mesenchymal stem cells, as well as for the clinical use of secretome as a novel therapeutic for numerous diseases, either as a private pay procedure or within clinical trials. Even though these treatments are in compliance with the regulatory framework in Europe under certain conditions as of May 2017, there is yet no evidence for their proven efficacy in human clinical trials, besides singular case reports. Therefore, at the moment, the clinical use of stem cell secretome is experimental, and it is mainly based on in-vitro and animal data. One potential application of autologous stem cell secretome has been in veterinary medicine, as commercialized by a Russian company, T-Helper Cell Technologies in 2017 under the name Reparin-Helper. == References == Category:Omics Category:Stem cell research ","title":"Stem cell secretome"},{"id":"54246898","text":"Mamudovci (, ) is a village in the municipality of Kičevo, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 401 inhabitants.

It is distributed to subscribers by e-mail. Each e-mail has the PDF of the newspaper attached, as well as a small collection of recent games. The editor and proprietor of Chess Today is Grandmaster Alexander Baburin. Each edition contains at least one tactical puzzle, an annotated game, and world chess news. Other elements of the publication include 'On This Day', endgame analysis and chess reviews. Chess Today has also conducted and printed interviews with at least four former World Chess Champions. == Editors and contributors == In addition to proprietor and current editor Grandmaster Alexander Baburin, for much of the life of Chess Today Graham Brown was both web designer and editor and Ralph Marconi was the second editor. Some editorial work was also done by Tim Harding in the early years. A number of Masters and Grandmasters have contributed either entire editions or contributions to editions of Chess Today including Grandmasters Mikhail Golubev and Ruslan Scherbakov, and International Masters Vladimir Barsky, Nikolai Vlassov and Maxim Notkin. Grandmaster Karsten Müller also contributed endgame analysis to some of the early issues. == Technical format == Chess today is sent to subscribers by e-mail. Every issue of Chess Today includes three files in different formats. The PDF file contains the entire (printable) newspaper which varies in length but is generally 3–5 A4 pages in a two-column format. The games in each issue come in a CBV (Chessbase Format) file and are duplicated in a PGN file. == Milestone editions == {  left\\" -  Edition Date -  Issue No. 1 Tuesday 7 November 2000 -  Issue No. 1000 Monday 4 August 2003 -  Issue No. 2000 Sunday, 30 April 2006 -  Issue No. 3000 Saturday 24 January 2009 -  Issue No. 4000 Friday, 21 October 2011 -  Issue No. 5000 Thursday, 17 July 2014 -  Issue No. 6000 Wednesday 12 April 2017 } == Circulation == Although Chess Today began with a relatively small readership (only 650 readers [including 40 Grandmasters] by the 1000th issue) its readership has continued to grow and it has for a number of years remained one of the main paid-for sources of chess news on the web often referred to as a source of material and point of reference by other authors. For example, many of the 'Move by Move' series of books (particularly those authored by Cyrus Lakdawala) cite 'Chess Today' in their bibliographies as an electronic resource. Originally planned to cost $15 every 4 months the price has effectively increased slightly from €19 for 4 months in 2001 to the current €15 for 3 months. == Origins == Chess Today was created by Alexander Baburin. He has related that he had the idea to create and run a daily Internet-only chess newspaper in the middle of 2000 while flying to Copenhagen. He has stated that he identified a gap in the market for paid-for daily chess news intended to inform, educate and entertain. == Content == Chess today contains a mix of different articles, each edition includes a selection from the following:  Test Yourself!/Tactical Quiz  This generally takes examples of recent tournament and match games and sets the reader the challenge of trying to find the tactical win available.  On This Day  This section is present in most editions. It includes facts about well known chess players who were born or died on this date in previous years. It also notes other significant chess events that occurred on the same date in previous years.  World Chess News  This includes news stories not only about chess tournaments and matches, but also the goings-on in FIDE and other chess organisations.  Annotated game  This section is present in every edition and includes detailed annotations on a recent game between strong players (generally Grandmasters).  Chess reviews  This section generally includes reviews of recently published chess books. Reviews have in the past been contributed by Sam Collins, Don Aldrich and Andy Ansel but there are reviews from other players too.  Endgame kaleidoscope  This is a speciality of Chess Today and usually involves Grandmaster Baburin investigating a topical or recent endgame or endgames in great detail, also making use of endgame tablebases (sometimes using ‘FinalGen’) and modern chess engines.  Web watch  This section offers readers updates on changes in the lay of the land in terms of the presence of chess on the Internet.  Beware: blunder!  This section gives examples of relatively or very strong players making mistakes and allows readers to find improvements and understand the reason for the blunder.  Interviews  Occasionally Chess Today includes interviews with Grandmasters and with other important individuals from the chess world. Some of the most notable interviews have been with Grandmasters Glek, Anand (five-time World Chess Champion), Svidler, Smyslov (former World Chess Champion), Spassky (former World Chess Champion) and Ponomariov (former FIDE World Chess Champion). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Chess periodicals Category:Chess in Ireland Category:European news websites ","title":"Chess Today"},{"id":"54246915","text":"The Longfellow Historic District is a nationally-recognized historic district located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.

Two-step M-estimation is different from usual M-estimation problem because asymptotic distribution of the second-step estimator generally depends on the first-step estimator. Accounting for this change in asymptotic distribution is important for valid inference. ==Description== The class of two-step M-estimators includes Heckman's sample selection estimator,Heckman, J.J., The Common Structure of Statistical Models of Truncation, Sample Selection, and Limited Dependent Variables and a Simple Estimator for Such Models, Annals of Economic and Social Measurement, 5,475-492. weighted non-linear least squares, and ordinary least squares with generated regressors.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. To fix ideas, let \\\\\\\\{W_{i}\\\\\\\\}^n_{i=1} \\\\subseteq R^d be an i.i.d. sample. \\\\Theta and \\\\Gamma are subsets of Euclidean spaces R^p and R^q , respectively. Given a function m(;;;): R^d \\\\times \\\\Theta \\\\times \\\\Gamma\\\\rightarrow R , two-step M-estimator \\\\hat\\\\theta is defined as: :\\\\hat \\\\theta:=\\\\arg\\\\max_{\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta}\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i}m\\\\bigl(W_{i},\\\\theta,\\\\hat\\\\gamma\\\\bigr) where \\\\hat\\\\gamma is an M-estimate of a nuisance parameter that needs to be calculated in the first step. Consistency of two-step M-estimators can be verified by checking consistency conditions for usual M-estimators, although some modification might be necessary. In practice, the important condition to check is the identification condition. If \\\\hat\\\\gamma\\\\rightarrow\\\\gamma^*, where \\\\gamma^* is a non-random vector, then the identification condition is that E[m(W_{1},\\\\theta,\\\\gamma^*)] has a unique maximizer over \\\\Theta. Asymptotic distribution Under regularity conditions, two-step M-estimators have asymptotic normality. An important point to note is that the asymptotic variance of a two-step M-estimator is generally not the same as that of the usual M-estimator in which the first step estimation is not necessary.Newey, K.W. and D. McFadden, Large Sample Estimation and Hypothesis Testing, in R. Engel and D. McFadden, eds., Handbook of Econometrics, Vol.4, Amsterdam: North-Holland. This fact is intuitive because \\\\hat\\\\gamma is a random object and its variability should influence the estimation of \\\\Theta. However, there exists a special case in which the asymptotic variance of two-step M-estimator takes the form as if there were no first-step estimation procedure. Such special case occurs if: :E \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\theta\\\\partial\\\\gamma}m(W_{1},\\\\theta_{0},\\\\gamma^*)=0 where \\\\theta_{0} is the true value of \\\\theta and \\\\gamma^* is the probability limit of \\\\hat\\\\gamma. To interpret this condition, first note that under regularity conditions, E \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\theta}m(W_{1},\\\\theta_{0},\\\\gamma^*)=0 since \\\\theta_{0} is the maximizer of E [ m(W_{1},\\\\theta, \\\\gamma^*)]. So the condition above implies that small perturbation in γ has no impact on the first-order condition. Thus, in large sample, variability of \\\\hat\\\\gamma does not affect the argmax of the objective function, which explains invariant property of asymptotic variance. Of course, this result is valid only as the sample size tends to infinity, so the finite-sample property could be quite different. == Involving MLE == When the first step is a Maximum Likelihood Estimator, under some assumptions, two-step M-estimator is more asymptotically efficient (i.e. has smaller asymptotic variance) than M-estimator with known first-step parameter. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator follows from the general result on two-step M-estimators.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. Let {Vi,Wi,Zi} be a random sample and the second-step M-estimator \\\\widehat{\\\\theta} is the following: :\\\\widehat{\\\\theta} := \\\\underset{\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\max}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m(v_i,w_i,z_i: \\\\theta,\\\\widehat{\\\\gamma}) where \\\\widehat{\\\\gamma } is the parameter estimated by maximum likelihood in the first step. For the MLE, :\\\\widehat{\\\\gamma } := \\\\underset{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Gamma}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\max}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\log f(v_{it} : z_{i} , \\\\gamma) where f is the conditional density of V given Z. Now, suppose that given Z, V is conditionally independent of W. This assumption is called conditional independence assumption or selection on observables.Heckman, J.J., and R. Robb, 1985, Alternative Methods for Evaluating the Impact of Interventions: An Overview, Journal of Econometrics, 30, 239-267. Intuitively, this condition means that Z is a good predictor of V so that once conditioned on Z, V has no systematic dependence on W. Under the conditional independence assumption, the asymptotic variance of the two-step estimator is: :\\\\mathrm E [ abla_\\\\theta s(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0)]^{-1} \\\\mathrm E[g(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0) g(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0)] \\\\mathrm E[ abla_\\\\theta s(\\\\theta_0,\\\\gamma_0)]^{-1} where :\\\\begin{align} g(\\\\theta,\\\\gamma) &:= s(\\\\theta,\\\\gamma)-\\\\mathrm E[ s(\\\\theta , \\\\gamma) abla_\\\\gamma d(\\\\gamma)^{\\\\mathrm T} ] \\\\mathrm E[ abla_\\\\gamma d(\\\\gamma) abla_\\\\gamma d(\\\\gamma)^{\\\\mathrm T} ]^{-1} d(\\\\gamma) \\\\\\\\\\\\ s(\\\\theta,\\\\gamma) &:= abla_\\\\theta m(V, W, Z: \\\\theta, \\\\gamma) \\\\\\\\\\\\ d(\\\\gamma) &:= abla_\\\\gamma \\\\log f (V : Z, \\\\gamma) \\\\end{align} and represents partial derivative with respect to a row vector. In the case where is known, the asymptotic variance is :\\\\mathrm E[ abla_\\\\theta s(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0)]^{-1} \\\\mathrm E[s(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0 )s(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0 )^{\\\\mathrm T}] \\\\mathrm E[ abla_\\\\theta s(\\\\theta_0, \\\\gamma_0)]^{-1} and therefore, unless \\\\mathrm E[ s(\\\\theta, \\\\gamma) abla_\\\\gamma d(\\\\gamma)^{\\\\mathrm T} ]=0, the two-step M-estimator is more efficient than the usual M-estimator. This fact suggests that even when is known a priori, there is an efficiency gain by estimating by MLE. An application of this result can be found, for example, in treatment effect estimation. == Examples == * Generated regressor * Heckman correction * Feasible generalized least squares * Two-step feasible generalized method of moments == See also == * Adaptive estimator == References == Category:M-estimators Category:Estimator Category:Robust regression Category:Robust statistics ","title":"Two-step M-estimator"},{"id":"54246931","text":"Edson Masunda (born 27 April 1985), better known by his stage name Flint Bedrock, is a Zimbabwean singer, songwriter and music producer.

At its peak, the channel's videos featured Martin, his wife Heather Martin—also known by her online alias MommyOFive—and their children. In 2017, following a series of videos showing the parents physically and emotionally abusing their children in the \\"prank\\" videos, the channel became the center of a public controversy, as outrage grew over their mistreatment of their children. Created in 2015, the channel achieved success earning up to 176 million video views and around 750,000 subscribers at its peak. However, after the aforementioned controversy, all videos on the channel were removed, and Mike and Heather stopped producing videos on the channel, aside from a formal public apology video. Mike and Heather took an Alford plea in September 2017 in regards to two counts per person of Maryland state child neglect charges and received supervised probation for five years. Mike and Heather ceased creating content on Mike's channel DaddyOFive as a result of court-ordered probation, but began producing similar content on the family's new channel called FamilyOFive, which was terminated by YouTube in July 2018 following renewed interest in the family. However, Mike and Heather have an official website, and a gaming channel on Twitch. Rose Hall, the biological mother to Mike's two children Emma and Cody, said that she had not seen Cody since July 2014, when she was duped into signing court papers. ==History== Creation of channel and rise in popularity The channel was created on August 13, 2015; the channel's about page stated, \\"we as a FAMILY DECIDED to make this YouTube channel just for fun.\\" The channel focused on Mike, Heather and their five children, whose names are Jake, Ryan, Emma, Cody, and Alex. Mike and Heather Martin do not have any biological children together. Jake, Ryan and Alex are Heather's children from a previous marriage. Cody and Emma are Mike and his ex- girlfriend Rose Hall's children. The channel accumulated around 750,000 subscribers and 176 million views, prior to Mike removing the videos from public viewing. The Guardian and New York Magazine reported the videos had been made private, while Time and The Washington Post reported that the videos had been deleted. Controversy and public response The family became the center of abuse claims following these prank videos which became gradually more extreme, with many videos involving Mike encouraging his eldest child, Jake, in a nepotistic way, to physically and mentally abuse his younger siblings, often to the point of severe injury. One such video involved Cody, the second youngest child, being thrown through a doorway by Jake and against a bookcase by Mike; he was left with what appeared to be injuries to his face. Another video involved Alex being instructed by Mike to slap Emma (who is Cody's biological sister) across the face for failing to perform a water bottle flip correctly; He was never reprimanded despite leaving Emma visibly hurt. American YouTube personality and news commentator Philip DeFranco released a series of videos covering the channel and sharing his distaste for the content they created, starting with \\"WOW... We Need To Talk About This...\\" on April 17, 2017. He primarily focused on a video involving invisible ink being spilt, with Cody and Alex being falsely accused of making the mess. In the video, Cody cries and pleads hysterically after being screamed and sworn at and accused of lying, with Alex also facing a similar treatment from Mike and Heather. DeFranco's first video covering the channel was uploaded on April 17, and is credited by many news outlets for shining a light on the channel's extreme content. Andrew Griffin of The Independent wrote, \\"[DeFranco's] video was viewed more than three million times and brought widespread condemnation of the DaddyOFive channel.\\" The video has led to debates about sharenting and children being minor celebrities on social media. Emma and Cody were removed from their custody and returned to their biological mother. The creators also issued a public apology for the videos and said they were \\"a loving, close- knit family.\\" Post-controversy status and plea agreement Mike's channel DaddyOFive released a video on July 7, 2017, showing text expressing that it is not a dead channel and asking viewers to subscribe to Heather's MommyOFive channel for new videos and updates. In July 2017, Mike's channel and Heather's channel had both around 730,000 subscribers and 4.7 million video views, and around 110,000 subscribers and 2.1 million video views, respectively. Later, they changed their channel name to FamilyOFive after receiving the silver play button for Heather. Prosecutors from the Frederick County Circuit Court filed criminal charges against Mike and Heather in August 2017, with them facing two counts of \\"neglect of a minor\\" apart. On September 11, 2017, Mike and Heather pleaded guilty by way of an Alford plea and were sentenced to five years of supervised probation. Second termination The FamilyOFive channel, a new outlet for Mike and Heather's videos created while they were on probation, re- instituted the questionable pattern of behavior regarding abuse of Jake, Ryan, Emma, Cody and Alex featured in the videos. The channel was subsequently terminated on July 18, 2018, for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines, according to several news sources, and YouTube now requires videos featuring children to comply with local child labor laws. Attempted comeback Despite their final termination, for a limited time, Mike and Heather continued to post videos on their official website behind a monthly $5 subscription fee, and continued streaming gaming videos on their Twitch channel. As of January 2019, Mike and Heather have deleted all of the videos on their website, stating \\"In order to move on with the healing process from the 2017 events, we have AGREED WILLINGLY to remove our videos, from even this site. For the sake and well being of our family Mike and I feel it is best that we take a long break from the public spotlight.\\" In November 2018, Jake, Ryan and Alex created a new YouTube channel called The Martin Boys. On January 8, 2019, Mike was accused of uploading a video in August 2018, which featured Cody. Despite breaking a major probation rule, Mike and Heather's supervised probation was reduced to probation before judgement. In June 2019, it was reported that Mike had started a SoundCloud channel, uploading his music as \\"Mikey M\\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:1982 births Category:2015 establishments in Maryland Category:2017 controversies Category:2018 disestablishments in Maryland Category:21st-century American criminals Category:American YouTubers Category:Child abuse in the United States Category:Child abuse incidents and cases Category:Gaming YouTubers Category:Internet-related controversies Category:Let's Players Category:Male YouTubers Category:Male bloggers Category:People from Maryland Category:YouTube vloggers Category:YouTube channels closed in 2018 Category:YouTube channels launched in 2015 Category:YouTube controversies Category:Scandals in Maryland Category:Entertainment scandals Category:Prank YouTubers ","title":"FamilyOFive"},{"id":"54246953","text":"In least squares estimation problems, sometimes one or more regressors specified in the model are not observable. One way to circumvent this issue is to estimate or generate regressors from observable data.Pagan, A., 1984, “Econometric Issues in the Analysis of Regressions with Generated Regressors”, International Economic Review, 25 (1), 221-247. This generated regressor method is also applicable to unobserved instrumental variables. Under some regularity conditions, consistency and asymptotic normality of least squares estimator is preserved, but asymptotic variance has a different form in general. Suppose the model of interest is the following: :y_{i}=g(x_{1i},x_{2i},\\\\beta)+u_{i} where g is a conditional mean function and its form is known up to finite-dimensional parameter β. Here x_{2i} is not observable, but we know that x_{2i}=h(w_{i},\\\\gamma) for some function h known up to parameter \\\\gamma, and a random sample y_{i}=g(x_{1i},x_{2i},\\\\beta)+u_{i} is available. Suppose we have a consistent estimator \\\\hat\\\\gamma of \\\\gamma that uses the observation w_{i}'s. Then, β can be estimated by (Non-Linear) Least Squares using \\\\hat{x_{2i}}=h(w_{i},\\\\hat\\\\gamma). Some examples of the above setup include Anderson et al. (1976Anderson, G. J., I. F. Pearce and P. K. Trivedi, \\"Output, Expected Demand and Unplanned Stocks,\\" in I. F. Pearce et al., eds., A Model of Output, Employment, Wages and Prices in the U.K., Cambridge University Press. and Barro (1977).Barro, R. J., 1977, \\"Unanticipated Money Growth and Unemployment in the United States,\\" American Economic Review, 67, 101-115. This problem falls into the framework of two- step M-estimator and thus consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator can be verified using the general theory of two-step M-estimator.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass As in general two-step M-estimator problem, asymptotic variance of a generated regressor estimator is usually different from that of the estimator with all regressors observed. Yet, in some special cases, the asymptotic variances of the two estimators are identical. To give one such example, consider the setting in which the regression function is linear in parameter and unobserved regressor is a scalar. Denoting the coefficient of unobserved regressor by \\\\delta if \\\\delta=0 and E[\\\\triangledown\\\\gamma h(W,\\\\gamma) U]=0 then the asymptotic variance is independent of whether observing the regressor. With minor modifications in the model, the above formulation is also applicable to Instrumental Variable estimation. Suppose the model of interest is linear in parameter. Error term is correlated with some of the regressors, and the model specifies some instrumental variables, which are not observable but have the representation z_{i}=h(w_{i},\\\\gamma). If a consistent estimator of \\\\gamma of \\\\hat\\\\gamma is available using \\\\hat z_{i}= h(w_{i},\\\\hat\\\\gamma) as instruments, the parameter of interest can be estimated by IV. Similar to the above case, consistency and asymptotic normality follows under mild conditions, and the asymptotic variance has a different form than observed IV case. Yet, there are cases in which the two estimators have the same asymptotic variance. One such case occurs if E[\\\\triangledown\\\\gamma h(W,\\\\gamma)]=0[4]In this special case, inference on the estimated parameter can be conducted with the usual IV standard error estimator. == References == Category:Least squares Category:M-estimators Category:Regression analysis Category:Simultaneous equation methods (econometrics) ","title":"Generated regressor"},{"id":"54246964","text":"Roman Vladimirovich Kurazhov (; born 28 July 1999) is a Russian football player.

Alternatively, one can be more flexible for the baseline hazard \\\\lambda^d_{0}(t) and impose more structure for \\\\lambda^d_{i}(t)=\\\\lambda^d_{0}(t)exp(-x_{i}'\\\\beta).

It has a twisted spindle-shaped trunk, a very rough grey bark, and reddish-brown twigs. The deciduous leaves consist of two large asymmetrical leaflets with an entire margin. The flowers occur in clusters of up to thirty at the end of the branches. It produces edible, highly appreciated fruits, which are often collected from the wild and used by local people. The vernacular name of this species in Brazil is jatobá do cerrado. == Taxonomy == Friedrich Gottlob Hayne, a German botanist, first scientifically described this species in 1830 as Hymenaea stigonocarpa, a name that had been used before by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, and was based on a specimen collected from a seasonally dry forest type, locally known as Caatinga, in the state of Piauí, north-eastern Brazil, during his 1817-1820 expedition. In 1870 however, George Bentham applied the name to specimens collected in the Cerrado of Central Brazil, and the name has since been used in association with specimens from the Cerrado. In addition he created the subspecies pubescens. João Barbosa Rodrigues, one of the most famous Brazilian botanists, in 1898 distinguished H. chapadensis, as well as H. correana, both of which were later considered synonyms of H. stigononcarpa subsp. pubescens. In 1925, Adolpho Ducke assigned the name Hymenaea velutina to specimens collected in north-eastern Brazil, which also became widely used for specimens from Caatinga. Recently, it has been established that the original material used to describe H. stigonocarpa belongs to the same species as the type of H. velutina. It has now been proposed to conserve the name H. velutina over H. stigonocarpa Hayne, and to continue applying H. stigonocarpa to the species from the Cerrado as used by Bentham. == Description == Hymenaea stigonocarpa has twenty four chromosomes (2n=24). It is a low to medium height deciduous tree of and a diameter of up to at breast height. It has a twisted trunk covered by a thick rough grey bark and reddish-brown twigs. Its leaves are alternately set, and consist of two leathery, kidney-shaped to ovate leaflets of long and wide, with quickly falling bracts (so-called stipules) at their base. The flowers of this species are the largest in the genus, and the petals are somewhat larger than the sepals. The five sepals are thick and are deflected when the flowers have opened. The five white petals are approximately long and wide and are set on the edge of a broad hypanthium. Ten free, white, long filaments are tipped by long anthers. In the middle of the hypanthium is a single, fleshy carpel on a short, long stalk, which is tipped by a long curved white style implanted at an angle, with a bud-shaped wet grainy stigma at the tip. Up to thirty flowers are set in inflorescences at the tip of the branches, subtended by bracts. The species depends on cross- pollination and is pollinated mainly by bats. Self-fertilised flowers are aborted after a week. The ripe fruit is light to dark brown with small and regularly spaced light glands, dry, indehiscent, leathery legume of long, wide and thick, with a rounded base, a slightly pointed tip, and a straight or wavy margin. The mesocarp and endocarp have been transformed into yellowish, soft, fibrous, slightly sweet flour-rich pulp with a characteristic smell. A prominent suture line surrounds the entire legume. Fruits are ripe between April and July in the Federal District, July to November in Mato Grosso do Sul and August in Minas Gerais. It contains one to six seeds. These seeds are redish-brown, oval, side-ways compressed, long and thick, with rounded tip and base, an irregular surface and some depressions. Overly ripe fruits emit an unpleasant smell. == Ecology == Tree with ripe fruitsThe nectar-rich flowers of Hymenaea stiginocarpa open at night and are pollinated by several bat species, among which are the mostly fruit-eating Platyrhinus lineatus and Carollia perspicilata and the nectar specialist Glossophaga soricina. Hawkmoths also frequent the flowers, but seem ineffective in pollinating them. Self-pollinated seeds do not fully mature. Although the flower’s own pollen grains grow tubes and fertilise ovules as successfully as pollen from a different specimen, after seven or eight days the self-pollinated fruits fall from the tree. The mechanism to abort self-pollinated fruits is not known, but cross-fertilised ovules grow faster from the start. By producing annually large amounts of fruits that are consumed by terrestrial fauna, the species also plays an important ecological role. It has been suggested that the agouti is responsible for most of the seed dispersal of H. stigonocarpa. Unlike many other species of the family Fabaceae, Hymenaea stiginocarpa is said to lack symbiontic soil bacteria, and therefore is unable to directly use the nitrate made by the bacteria from atmospheric nitrogen. == Distribution == Hymenaea stiginocarpa occurs in northern, central, and eastern Brazil and in Paraguay. == Uses == Jatobá do cerrado is an important tree for the people of the Brazilian Cerrado, and it represents a substantial economic value with its high quality wood, resin and edible fruits. These fruits can be used to produce flour and in the preparation of different types of food. With the increasing demand for the products of this plant, there is a need for commercial cultivation and for growing high quality seedlings. Jatobá fruit pulp contains about 5½% protein, and almost 50% high-fibre flour consisting of 40% non-soluble fibre and about 9% soluble fibre.

The resin from the stems of jatobá do cerrado is used to polish canoes, and to produce varnishes. Scholars showed a large variation in genetics between and within subpopulations that corresponds to variability in the weight of the fruit, and this provides perspective for breeding varieties with more favourable traits for human use. Seedlings can be grown in plastic bags with 50% shading, and do best in a mineral soil without organic compost and in a greenhouse. H. stigonocarpa grows best in a sunny spot and prefers well-drained soil. When established, the trees are somewhat resistant to drought. In general, it grows slowly. Jatobá do cerrado is sometimes planted as an ornamental. One study showed that extracts of H. stigonocarpa suppressed cell division in onions, and this may imply that it contains some cytotoxic substance. == References == stigonocarpa Category:Trees of Brazil Category:Plants described in 1830 ","title":"Hymenaea stigonocarpa"},{"id":"54247041","text":"The canton of La Région Limouxine (before 2015: canton of Limoux)Décret n° 2016-1319 du 5 octobre 2016 is an administrative division of the Aude department, southern France.

Her father was the Greek politician (1788–1848), a founder of the secret society Filiki Eteria. She was orphaned at an early age and was raised by her uncle, , who was involved in the uprising against King Otto of Greece. They were forced to flee to the mountains and lived in hiding. During her childhood, she studied French, painting, and the Classics. She returned to live with her relatives in Athens, studying mathematics at the Arsakeio and graduating at the age of 17. She then studied ancient Greek writers, French poets and prose writers. She married Ioannis Mazarakis in Kythnos in 1860. Her children were Konstantinos Mazarakis-Ainian (b. 1869), Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian (b. 1874), and Philippos Mazarakis-Ainian. Ainianos composed poetry for herself. Her experience living in the countryside provided context for her poetry, especially her poems about impoverished working women, nature, and beauty. She wrote in the Greek vernacular rather than Katharevousa and her style revealed a sense of realism, free of the age's pseudo-romanticism. Ainianos died in 1892.

The series revolves around Sunny (voiced by Lilla Crawford), a hairdresser who runs her own salon with the help of her talking dog Doodle (Rob Morrison), hair colourist Rox (Élan Luz Rivera), and receptionist Blair (Taylor Louderman). Sunny's best customers are Timmy (Kevin Duda), who is in charge of hosting events and shows in Sunny's hometown, and Cindy (Melissa van der Schyff), the unlucky town baker who has a constant bad hair day. The series is loosely based on the Random House picture book series The Fairytale Hairdresser by Abie Longstaff and illustrated by Lauren Beard. Each episode features an original song written by Peter Lurye. Forty episodes of Sunny Day are being produced by Silvergate in association with the Canadian animation company Pipeline Studios. On April 5, 2016, the show was renewed for a second season containing 20 episodes. The series premiered on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 21, 2017.

Sunny uses her creativity and knowledge of hair care to solve problems. The other salon employees are Sunny's talking dog Doodle, Rox the hair colourist, and Blair the receptionist. Sunny's best customers are Timmy, who hosts every town event in Friendly Falls, and Cindy, the unlucky local baker with constantly messy hair.

It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in 2017, making it their highest charting song to date. ==Background== The guitar riff for the song was first created by band guitarist Bill Kelliher while creating a collection of riffs when on tour in 2016. With most of the band's members alternating vocal duties on the band's song, vocals for \\"Show Yourself\\" were handled by drummer Brann Dailor. Dailor was initially hesitant to sing on the track, personally not liking the guitar riff, referring to it as \\"too easy\\", though he later changed his mind on it. Dailor reflected on the track's simplicity, stating: The song was released as the second single from their album Emperor of Sand, on February 3, 2017. The band performed the track live on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on April 3, 2017. ==Themes and composition== The song comes from the band's seventh studio album, Emperor of Sand, a concept album which explores heavy themes such as humanity's existence and limited mortality through the scenario of a person being diagnosed with cancer and going through chemotherapy. The song lyrically plays into the same concepts, with lines such as \\"You're not as safe as far as I can tell, and I can tell / Only you can save yourself / Soon this will all be a distant memory / Or could this dream be real at all?\\" While the band is known for music that is progressive rock and complicated in structure, the song is relatively straightforward, with Rolling Stone describing the track as \\"relatively stripped-down, melodic and direct. 'Show Yourself' erupts from a straight-ahead riff layered with spasms of wild guitar from Brent Hinds. The song features a guitar solo by Hinds as well. Stereogum noted that, while the band's first single, \\"Sultan's Curse\\" contained the atmosphere of their earlier work, \\"Show Yourself\\" instead sounded like the \\"grungy chug-brood more in line with the work that the band has been doing in recent years\\". Dailor summed up the song as \\"super-poppy” by Mastodon standards, while still dealing with the same themes of death and sadness\\". ==Music video== Contrary to the heavier, serious subject matter tackled by the song and its respective album, the song's music video is more light-hearted and campy in tone. The video features a down-on-his-luck, sad sack version of The Grim Reaper who, feeling pressure from an angry boss and wife at home, is tasked with killing the members of the band. The Reaper then begins his mission, but ends up killing only look-alikes of the band - impaling \\"Hinds\\" with a broken guitar neck, locking \\"Dailor\\" in a tanning bed, hitting \\"Sanders\\" with a copy machine, and throwing a toaster in \\"Kelliher\\"'s bath - leading to the Reaper getting \\"fired\\". It is only after his firing that the Reaper ends up killing the band. The video ends with him getting his job and wife back, and earning a brand new hearse, for his efforts. ==Reception== The band's live performance of the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! was specifically praised by Consequence of Sound, describing the performance as \\" Mastodon aren’t your typical metal band, and they proved that with their performance on last night’s Jimmy Kimmel Live...Atlanta’s favorite progressive rockers delivered a smashing performance of their Emperor of Sand single \\"Show Yourself\\", scoring major points for their accessible brand of insanity\\" and concluding that \\"It's performances like this one that could well convince an unfamiliar late night crowd to give metal a solid shot.\\" Loudwire similarly praised Dailor's \\"crisp, clean delivery\\" of his vocals and Hinds' wailing guitar solo in the performance. ==Personnel== * Brann Dailor − vocals, drums * Troy Sanders − vocals, bass * Brent Hinds − lead guitar * Bill Kelliher − rhythm guitar == Charts == {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center;\\" - !

It takes over target browsers and turns them into zombies. == Discovery == Check Point claims to have discovered Fireball malware in 2017 but Microsoft claims that it has been tracking the malware since 2015. == Authorship == The malware has been tracked to a Chinese company called Rafotech. They are a digital marketing agency based in Beijing. They have been bundling it with legitimate software that they provide to users. Some of the programs that Rafotech bundled the Fireball software are Deal WiFi, Mustang Browser, SoSoDesk and FVP Image Viewer. Rafotech claims to have 300 million users (similar to the estimated number of infections) worldwide but denies that it uses these fake search engines. Security researchers dispute this claim, noting that Rafotech may have also purchased additional distribution means from other threat actors. Their fake search engines are popular with 14 of them ranked among the top 10,000 websites and some reaching the top 1,000. == Inner workings == Malware has the ability of running any code on victim computers, such as downloading an arbitrary file and hijacking and manipulating infected user's web traffic in order to generate advertisement revenue. It installs plugins and additional configurations to boost its advertisements, and has potential to turn into a distributor for any additional malware. Malware is spread mostly via bundling. It is installed on a victim's machine alongside a wanted program, often without the user's consent. Digital marketing agency Rafotech has been indicated as producer of the software. The same company has been accused to host fake search engines, which redirect the queries to yahoo.com or google.com. The fake search engines include tracking pixels used to collect private information from users. Fireball manipulates the infected browsers and turn their default search engines and home pages into the above-mentioned fake search engines, which enable the software to spy on users of the infected browsers. The Fireball malware does not conform to usual characteristics of bundled software. Check Point asserts, “The malware and the fake search engines don’t carry indicators connecting them to Rafotech, they cannot be uninstalled by an ordinary user and they conceal their true nature.” Furthermore, Fireball “displays great sophistication and quality evasion techniques, including anti-detection capabilities, multilayer structure and a flexible C&C.;” Another deception is the use of legitimate-seeming Digital certificates. Rafotech's fake search engines and the malware itself doesn't carry any identifying marks. The program has the capability to run arbitrary code, download applications and harvest more sensitive information, such as banking and medical details. Cyber criminals could leverage the source code to create new types of malware. == Infections == It is estimated that 250 million computers are infected worldwide. Check Point researches also claim that this malware might have infected computers on 20% of corporate networks, making it a high volume internet threat. According to this source, the highest infection rates were discovered in Indonesia, India and Brazil. It is speculated that the related browser hijackers operations form possibly the largest infection operation in history. Table 1 The top countries that have been infected with the Fireball malware {  Country % infected Number of infections (in millions) Hit Rate - India 10.1% 25.3 43% - Brazil 9.6% 24.1 38% - Mexico 6.4% 16.1 N/A - Indonesia 5.2% 13.1 60% - US 2.2% 5.5 10.7% } There is some dispute to these numbers according to Microsoft, it has been tracking the malware since 2015. Its results are based on the Fireball infections that have been cleaned by Windows Defender and the Malicious Software Removal Tool. Based on the collected data the total infections are 40 million. Check Point researchers used the number of visits to malware-carrying search pages not the device itself. == References == Category:Malware Category:Types of malware ","title":"Fireball (software)"},{"id":"54247205","text":"Richard Muhumuza Gafabusa (born 3 August 1977) is a Ugandan environmentalist, administrative lawyer and politician.

It was the Borough of West Chester's second public park, created in 1905. It is maintained by the West Chester Department of Parks and Recreation. ==Geography== Everhart Park has an area of 10.2 acres and is located on the western side of West Chester, bordering East Bradford Township. It is bounded by Brandywine Street to the east, Union Street to the south, Bradford Avenue to the west, and Miner Street to the north. Blackhorse Run, a tributary of Brandywine Creek, has its source in the park. Everhart Park is at an elevation of 400 feet. ==History== Everhart Park was part of the property of notable resident William Everhart, who named the park Everhart Grove. It was used for political rallies in the 1840s and 1850s as well as community gatherings. During the Civil War, the West Chester Volunteer Regiment trained at the park, and veterans used the site for physical fitness after the war. Dr. Isaiah Everhart donated the park to the borough in 1905. As part of a beautification project due to destruction of the land, the gazebo was built in 1908. The following year, a pond was constructed and rare trees were planted. The pond was eventually drained in 1943 and wetlands were formed. In 1989, the Friends of Everhart Park was formed after a utility pipeline was proposed that would have eliminated nearly 20 ancient hardwood trees. ==Amenities== Everhart Park features an activity building, basketball court, and footbridge for recreation. For outdoor eating, there is a gazebo, grill, and picnic tables. Restrooms and a water fountain are available in the park. The park contains a playground, which includes swing sets, an infinity loop climber, a dragon challenge climber, a see-saw snake, a double chute slide, and a fire engine composite play structure. ==Events== A number of events take place in the park. There are art camps and a summer camp from June to August. An Easter Egg hunt, with more than 13,000 plastic eggs hidden, is held on Easter and attracts hundreds of children. The May Day Festival for the Arts is held annually on the first Sunday in May. The Turks Head Music Festival is held annually on the third Sunday in July. Shakespeare in the Park and a plant sale are also held often in Everhart Park. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Everhart Park, Downtown West Chester *Turks Head Music Festival Category:Parks in Chester County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Everhart Park"},{"id":"54247283","text":"Dr Peter Jones FRCP (born 1937) is a British consultant paediatrician, known for his work in the fields of haemophilia and HIV/AIDS.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. ==History== Holland was first settled by Dutch immigrants, led by Rev. Albertus Christiaan Van Raalte, in 1847. That summer, the immigrants built their first church, a log structure. By 1854, the growth of the settlement necessitated the construction of a new church, and work on this building began. Construction was supervised by Jacobus Schrader, a millwright. (note: large pdf file) Substantial renovations were made to the church over the years. A pipe organ was installed in 1890. An annex, originally constructed to house the church library and classrooms, was added in 1900. A heating system and partial basement were put in place later. In 1947, a full basement was installed, and the church interior was entirely remodeled. The annex and the basement were remodeled in 1988. The congregation has remained in this church through the present day. Early schisms split the church, particularly in 1884, after Van Raalte's death, when the majority of congregants voted to change denominations. However, in 2012, Pillar Church voted to become a dual- affiliation congregation, thus restoring what was split in 1884. ==Description== The Pillar Church is an elegant white clapboard Greek Revival structure with a low pitched roof. The front facade has temple front, with a portico containing six massive Doric columns topped by a classical entablature. A three-part tower, 60 feet in height, with an octagonal belfry, projects from the roof. A clapboard annex, constructed in 1900, projects from the rear of the building. The current interior has a floor plan with a rectangular sanctuary with a center aisle, two side aisles and plain wooden pews.

He was the prototype of adventurer and mercenary. ==Early life== Johann von Mayr was a natural son of Count von Stella, a royal Spanish councilor in Vienna. His mother was from the bourgeois class and married the owner of a billiard parlor named Mayr soon after.Artikel „Mayer, Johann von“ von Bernhard von Poten in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 21 (1885), S. 108–109, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, URL: https://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Mayer,_Johann_von&oldid;=2501828 (Version vom 7.

Eventually his propensity for trouble and his debauchery led the city of Vienna to expel him,Friedrich Kapp, George Bancroft, The Life of F. W. Von Steuben ... with an Introduction by G. Bancroft, 1859, pp. 52–55. and, in, 1732, he traveled to Hungary. There, he supported himself through his violin, and his music so intrigued the commandant of Temesvar, the General von Engelshofen, that he took Mayr in. ==Military career== At about twenty years of age, at last he decided to become a soldier and entered the officially into the Duke of Lorraine's regiment, in which he ultimately became a sergeant. The life of soldiers – at no time a restrained one – also led him to excesses in the enjoyment, drinking and love, which at last followed a serious life-threatening illness.Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums Österreich 1868 18, p. 132– There he fell into a melancholy during which he stabbed himself with a bread-knife. In the then war of Austria with the Turks, Mayr fought several battles and received several wounds from 1736 to 1739. After the death of the Emperor Charles VI, during the War of Austrian Succession, he also fought in the Battle of Mollwitz, and then at the Siege of Prague, after which he was taken prisoner by the French on 26 November 1741. Mayr bought himself out the French captivity and returned to the imperial service. General-Field Marshal Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff took him into his entourage as lieutenant and adjutant, as Mayr proved to be useful and skilled. He remained in this service, until trouble with his colonel, the Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, caused him to leave. He wanted to go into Prussian service, but his patron, General Seckendorff, advised him to go to Saxony instead, and gave him recommendations to Dresden, where Mayr went in 1744. Saxon service The Saxon court gave him a commission, and in 1745 he fought in the Battle of Kesselsdorf as a dragoon. Subsequently, he went to the Netherlands as Count Károly József Batthyány's adjutant. In this position, Mayr distinguished himself on several occasions, such as in the siege of Bergen op Zoom, which was overwhelmed on 16 September 1747. In that year he was also appointed Rittmeister (captain of cavalry) in the Saxon army. At this time, several regiments had been disbanded in Saxony, and many officers were placed on half-pay; Mayr recognized the limitations of service in Saxony. He was one of the younger and newer officers and advancement would be hard to acquire. He remained in the service of Field Marshal Count Batthyany until the conclusion of the Peace of Aachen in 1748. Bethanny appreciated Mayer's skills, and Mayr was close to an appointment as a colonel in the Dutch Guard but intrigues thwarted this project. Mayr lingered for a while in Holland, then went to Aachen, and finally returned to Dresden in 1750, where he was appointed colonel in the Saxon-Polish Army. In 1754, he quarreled with the colonel Georg Friedrich Vitzthum von Eckstädt, who was acting as adjutant to the Elector of Saxony. The two men dueled, and the colonel was mortally wounded. Mayr had to flee, and at first went to Silesia, with the decision to enter foreign services. From Silesia, Mayr went to Warsaw, where his duel history was investigated, and he was cleared. Subsequently, Mayr tried to enter Russian service. He went first to Potsdam and Königsberg to Mitau in Courland, but while there, he found a letter from King Frederick II of Prussia, who had been drawn to him, knew of his qualities, and invited him to Potsdam. After an interview with the king, Frederick found the proper niche for him; Mayr served as a wing adjutant in Frederick's service, in which he remained until his death. Prussian Service As a lieutenant colonel, the King charged Mayr with the development of light troops specifically modeled on the Pandours of the Austrian military. Mayr established Freiberg in Saxony as the headquarters for his Freibataillon. Such formations were, at the time, comparable to what the privateer was in a navy. They operated outside the normal channels of military organization, and were considerably freer from much of the military's monotony and, in Prussia, extraordinary, discipline. Freibatallions generally attracted the young, the reckless, and often, those who had the least to lose. The battalion was built partly from Saxon unemployed soldiery, which was considerable. On 28 May 1756, Mayr was able to searched houses for Saxon deserters in Freiberg, and within a month his unit was mostly formed. Mayr became famous mainly for his razzias from the Prussian-occupied Saxony to Franconia in May through June 1757. Although he had only 1500 men of foot, 300 hussars and five guns, he caused considerable havoc. His route led him through Pilsen, Vilseck, the Imperial city of Nuremberg to the Bavarian Fürth, which was plundered, and on to Fränkische Schweiz. He gathered great numbers of hostages and wagonloads of provisions, weapons, and armaments. The battalion distinguished itself in preliminary maneuvers to the Battle of Rossbach; he took Weißenfels in the first days of November, and forced the defenders to flee; a few days later, he and his company took their share of the spoils in the Battle of Rossbach, on 5 November, when he first covered the weaponry of the army, then engaged in the battle on the left wing, and finally followed the fugitive French and the Army of the Holy Roman Empire to Erfurt. Subsequently, while Frederick marched his army to Leuthen, Mayr covered the road into the Erzgebirge and destroyed all the imperial provisions in Leitmeritz. ==Last campaign and death== In the spring of 1758 he made a successful advance, burning the imperial magazine and plundering an armory in Suhl, in which he captured 2200 guns. His expedition to Plauen in the middle of February 1758, the capture of Hof on 12 April, and the capture of Bamberg on 31 May, by fewer than 2000 men, generated fear, despondency and horror. During the summer and autumn 1758, Mayr was entrusted with several particularly dangerous assignments in Saxony. When General Georg Wilhelm von Driesen was commanded to return to Franconia on another occasion, Mayr led his avant-garde, remained in summer and autumn in Saxony, and was often entrusted with special commissions, especially when defending Dresden. In November, he distinguished himself with special bravery in the defense of Dresden against Count Leopold Joseph von Daun and was promoted to Generalmajor. After Daun had lifted his camp before Dresden on 16 November 1758, and had retreated, Mayr followed him as far the Bohemian frontier. At the beginning of December 1758, he moved his corps into the winter quarters at Plauen. He died in January 1759 in Plauen of a pneumonia and, although a Catholic and Jesuit-educated, was buried with military honors in front of the altar of the cemetery church of Plauen.Karl Friedrich Pauli,Leben grosser Helden des gegenwärtigen Kriege Christoph Peter Francken, 1759, pp. 181–182. The later general inspector of the American continental army Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben served as his adjutant of Mayr, Prussian Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm René de l’Homme de Courbière was a young captain in the Freibataillon. Among the many eulogies written for him, this one written by the bibliophile Praetorius (a nom de plume) strikingly frames the fear he struck into the towns he raided: > Here, Wanderer, lies the horror of his times, Johann von Mayr, a freeman of > mercenaries. > He died a hero in battle and fight; > His steady shot and blow never failed; > Fear and quiet human beings fled him. > Here, death became his first conqueror; > He died too late and too early; > Now go and proclaim: We are all sinners.Gespräch im Reiche der Todten, > zwischen dem Königl.

In his last years, he had become quite chubby, which annoyed him, so he undertook physical exercises and constantly smoked the worst tobacco. During his lifetime he never learned who had been his father. This and his stepfather's profession, bad examples and natural superficiality led him to missteps in his youth. ==Notes and citations== Notes Citations Category:1716 births Category:1759 deaths Category:Prussian generals Category:Mercenaries ","title":"Johann von Mayr"},{"id":"54247649","text":"The Accidental Prime Minister is a 2019 Indian biographical drama film directed by Vijay Ratnakar Gutte and written by Mayank Tewari, based on the 2014 memoir of the same name by Sanjaya Baru.

Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party promoted the trailer through their official Twitter account. Reacting to this, a Congress spokesperson alleged that the film was \\"political propaganda\\". Upon the release of the trailer, the Congress party's Maharashtra youth wing in a letter to the producers of the films raised objections to the “incorrect presentation of the facts” and demanded a special screening of the film. They later withdrew the letter, intending to not publicize the film. On 2 January 2019, lead actor Anupam Kher tweeted that people were reporting that the film's trailer was unseen as a top search result while being directly searched for on YouTube. The newspaper India Today conducted their own search, and confirmed Kher's allegations, noting that only after the following day was the trailer returned to its position as a top search result. This led to speculation that the trailer had initially been removed intentionally as part of an anti-propaganda campaign. On 8 January 2019, a local court in Bihar ordered FIR against Anupam Kher and thirteen other associated with the film for defaming political leaders. == References  External links == * * * Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:2019 films Category:Cultural depictions of Prime Ministers of India Category:Films based on Indian novels Category:Hindi-language films Category:Indian biographical films Category:Indian films based on actual events Category:Indian films Category:Indian political films Category:Cultural depictions of Manmohan Singh Category:Cultural depictions of Narendra Modi Category:2010s biographical films Category:2010s political films ","title":"The Accidental Prime Minister (film)"},{"id":"54247650","text":"Aidan Nolan (born 1993) is an Irish hurler who plays as a midfielder or half- forward for the Wexford senior team and Half Way House Bunclody. ==Honours== ;Wexford * Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (1): 2019 * Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship (3): 2013, 2014 ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:HWH Bunclody hurlers Category:Wexford inter- county hurlers ","title":"Aidan Nolan"},{"id":"54247680","text":"Jordan Lee Raymond Williams (born 13 December 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays for Stockport County, as a winger. ==Career== Born in Warrington, Williams spent his early career in non-league football with Burscough, Northwich Victoria and Barrow, before signing for League One club Rochdale in June 2017.

It merges popular styles of dress, from clothing and shoes, to headwear and accessories, with efforts to implement social and political change. Fashion activism can be used as a form of protest, whether expressing dissent or support. The field of fashion activism spans practices across the boundaries of fashion commodities and the fashion system, to activate members of the public to take action in contested issues. That is, the activism includes awareness raising and civic mobilization, as well as behavior change and pushes for systemic impact. The term 'fashion activism' has been actively used by designer Céline Semaan. The New York based founder of the design and tech lab Slow Factory has used key items in her collections as means of fashion activism; a 'Dignity Key' necklace with which people can show support for displaced Middle Eastern refugees, a 'Banned' scarf showing the universal impact of President Trump's Muslim ban, and a '1st Amendment Flight Jacket' collaboration with ACLU, featuring the First Amendment text written in Arabic, standing up to the rise in islamophobia in the United States and hate crimes against American Muslims. Other examples of fashion activism range from apparel with peace sign symbols that were popularized in the mid-1900s, to the 'Make America Great Again' hats sported by Donald Trump supporters throughout and following the 2016 presidential campaign. == Fashion Design Items That Influenced Socio-Political Events ==  The Mini Skirt  The mini skirt made its debut in 1964 and quickly became a bastion of youth culture and defianceBourne, L.

Mary Quant, the London-based designer responsible for the skirt, sought to reflect an era that was “arrogant, aggressive, and sexy.”Parks, C. (2015, March 23).

Retrieved July 14, 2017, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/23/mini-skirt-evolution_n_6894040.html Accordingly, the mini skirt was a popular choice for independent and progressive women in the 1960s. During the violent protests and events of May 1968 in France, the mini skirt became a symbol of female revolution and defiance. Andre Courrèges popularized the hemline in France. While the nostalgia of the 1970s saw a return to more conventional hemlines, the mini skirt persists as a symbol of women’s rights and sexual liberation to this day.  The Slogan T-Shirt  The slogan T-shirt has been favored by activists since its inception. Fueled by the DIY ethos of the punk era, Vivienne Westwood’s subversive t-shirt designs brought the slogan aesthetic into the mainstream in the 1970s. In 1979, designer Katharine Hamnett launched a label and line of shirts driven by the concept of ‘right livelihood;’ the shirt slogans were based on the central messages of Buddhism. The T-shirts were “designed to be seminal, to make people think, and then hopefully act,” Hamnett said in an interview.Interview with Ethical Designer Katharine Hamnett. (2013, November 21). Retrieved July 14, 2017, from http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/351665-katharine-hamnett-interview/ In recent years, slogan tees have become a staple in popular culture, from runways to stadiums. British designer Daniel W. Fletcher organized an anti- Brexit sit-in with protesters wearing “stay” shirts and hoodies. Many prominent designers and labels such as Dior, Public School, Everlane, and Slow Factory have produced slogans supporting women’s rights, gay rights, immigrants, refugees, and conservation efforts.  The Keffiyeh  The Keffiyeh is a traditional black and white scarf worn around the head or neck. According to design critic Hala Malak, the Keffiyeh dates back to pre-Islamic Sumer. High priests would wear turbans and fishing nets when praying for prosperous fishing seasons; the integration of these two textiles eventually led to the classic fishnet pattern the Keffiyeh is known for. Following the 1936 Arab Revolt, the Keffiyeh became a symbol of political uprising and rebellion. It was not until the rise of Arafat in the 1960s that the scarf came to symbolize Palestinian solidarity. The scarf has appeared among many leftist groups and anti-war organizations. The scarf was appropriated as a fashion accessory in a 2007 Balenciaga show. The Keffiyeh is a fashion staple in the west, although few are aware of its rich political history.Kim, K.

It is closely related to biofumigation and soil solarization, or the use of solar power to control nematodes, bacteria, fungi and other pests that damage crops. In solarization, the soil is mulched and covered with a tarp to trap solar radiation and heat the soil to a temperature that kills pests. Biosolarization adds the use of organic amendments or compost to the soil before it is covered with plastic, which speeds up the solarization process by decreasing the soil treatment time through increased microbial activity. Research conducted in Spain on the use of biosolarization in strawberry fruit production has shown it to be a sustainable and cost effective option. The practice of biosolarization is being used among small agricultural operations in California.\\"Advances in Biosolarization Technology to Improve Soil Health and Organic Control of Soilborne Pests\\".

The option for more widespread use of biosolarization is being studied by researchers at the Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety at the University of California at Davis in order to validate the effectiveness of biosolarization in commercial agriculture in California, where it has the potential to greatly reduce the use of conventional fumigants. Biosolarization can also use as organic waste management practice. Recent studies showed the potential of food industrial residues as soil amendments that can improve the efficiency of biosolarization. ==References== Category:Soil science Category:Soil contamination Category:Biocides ","title":"Biosolarization"},{"id":"54247866","text":"Norman Noel Lynas (b 1955) was Dean of Ossory from 1991 to 2010.

In a racing career which lasted from July 1989 until September 1990 she recorded two wins and four places from seven starts. She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old, winning one race and finishing second in the May Hill Stakes and improved when moved up to middle distances in the following year. She wa placed in both the Lingfield Oaks Trial and The Oaks before recording her biggest win in the Irish Oaks. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and produced several winners including the Cumberland Lodge Stakes winner Riyadian and the Totesport Trophy winner Essex. Her last recorded foal was born in 2006. ==Background== Knight's Baroness was a bay mare bred in England by her owner Fahd Salman's Newgate Stud Ltd. Like many of Salman's horses, she was trained throughout her racing career by Paul Cole at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire. Knight's Baroness was from the first crop of foals sired by Rainbow Quest whose wins included th Coronation Cup and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in the 1985. He went on to become a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Quest for Fame, Saumarez, Sunshack, Spectrum, Nedawi and Millenary. Her dam Knight's Beauty was a successful racemare in North America, winning 12 times from 76 starts between by 1979 and 1983. She was a great-granddaughter of the American broodmare Grass Shack, whose other descendants have included Charismatic and Deputy Minister. ==Racing career== 1989: two-year-old season Knight's Baroness began her racing career at Wolverhampton Racecourse (then a turf track) when she contested a maiden race over seven furlongs on 3 July 1989. Starting at odds of 8/1 in a ten-runner field she finished strongly and finished second, beaten a neck by the John Gosden-trained favourite Star Child. A month later she contested a similar event at Yarmouth Racecourse and started the 4/1 third choice in a four-runner field. Ridden for the first time by Richard Quinn who partnered her in all her subsequent races she led from the start, went clear of her rivals in the closing stages and won by four lengths despite being eased down in the final strides. The filly was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse in October. After taking the early lead and breaking clear approaching the last quarter mile she was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten into second by the Henry Cecil-trained Rafha (later to win the Prix de Diane). 1990: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut, Knight's Baroness faced Rafha again in the Oaks Trial Stakes over one and a half miles at Lingfield Park (then a turf track) on 12 May and started the 7/2 second favourite behind her old rival. She took the lead three furlongs out and after being overtaken by Rafha she rallied strongly but was beaten a neck into second place. In The Oaks on 9 June the filly started a 16/1 one outsider in an eight-runner field with Salsabil starting favourite ahead of In The Groove and Kartajana. Knight's Baroness tracked the leaders and stayed on kept on well without being able to accelerate, finishing third behind Salsabil and the 50/1 outsider Game Plan. On 14 July Knight's Baroness was sent to Ireland and started the 13/8 favourite for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles on good-to-firm ground at the Curragh. The best fancied of her nine opponents were Pharian (winner of the Cheshire Oaks and Lancashire Oaks), the Italian challenger Atoll (Premio Regina Elena, Oaks d'Italia) and the Dermot Weld- trained Crockadore. The 50/1 outsider Assertion set the pace from Atoll with Quinn settling the favourite just behind the leaders. Atoll went to the front in the straight but Knight's Baroness produced a sustained run to wear down the Italian filly, took the lead in the final strides and won by a neck. Knight's Baroness was moved up in distance to contest the Group Two Park Hill Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Doncaster on 12 September in which she carried a five-pound weight penalty as a result of her Irish Oaks success. After tracking the leaders, she was unable to make any significant progress in the straight and finished fourth behind Madame Dubois, Applecross and Whitehaven. ==Breeding record== After her retirement from racing Knight's Baroness became a broodmare for her owner's Newgate Stud. Following Salman's death she was put up for auction at Tattersalls in December 2002 and was bought for 320,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson. Knight's Baroness produced at least eleven foals and five winners between 1992 and 2004. *Riyadian, a chestnut colt, foaled in 1992, sired by Polish Precedent.

The road connects U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and SR 27 at Wiscasset and SR 17/SR 32 in the town of Whitefield. Throughout its whole route, SR 218 parallels the Sheepscot River. ==Route description== SR 218 begins along Federal Street in Wiscasset, the county seat of Lincoln County. From Main Street (US 1/SR 27), it heads north past many houses, a cemetery, school, and a museum. After staying near the west side of the Sheepscot River through downtown Wiscasset, the river bends away from the road and the road starts to climb a small bluff near a stream. It enters the town of Alna and continues north through a mix of wooded areas and houses. At the settlement known as Alna Center, SR 218 passes the town hall and fire department. In this area, the road also passes various small farms. As the road approaches an east-west segment of the Sheepscot River, the road first descends from the ridge on which it traveled through Alna but then travels along the rolling bluffs lining the south side of the river. After passing under a power line corridor, the road enters the town of Whitefield. SR 218 strays further from the river at this point first passing a sand quarry but then returns to closely following it on top of a bluff. It descends a hill where at the bottom, reaches an intersection with SR 194. SR 194 and SR 218 form a short concurrency to head north and cross the Sheepscot River near the town center of Whitefield. Shortly after the bridge, SR 194 heads off towards the east along Head Tide Road. SR 218 continues north on East River Road on the east side of the river passing some small farms along the way. At North Whitefield, the road reaches an intersection with SR 126\\\\. SR 218 heads west along SR 126 and climbs a small hill. Near the top of this hill, SR 218 breaks off of SR 126 and heads north along Mills Road. It first passes a general store/gas station then heads through an area containing houses, clearings, and woods. After passing a few farms, the road enters the community of Coopers Mills. At Rockland Road (SR 17/SR 32), SR 218 ends but the road continues north as Somerville Road. ==Major junctionsReferencesExternal links== *Floodgap Roadgap's RoadsAroundME: Maine State Route 218 218 Category:Transportation in Lincoln County, Maine ","title":"Maine State Route 218"},{"id":"54247907","text":"Mesostygarctus is a genus of tardigrades, in the family Stygarctidae.

The character, an intergalactic villain similar to the Star Wars character Darth Vader, was created by American filmmaker Todd Durham for his 1984 science fiction film Hyperspace. British video distributor Mike Lee adopted Lord Buckethead to stand in the 1987 UK general election and again in the 1992 general election. The character went unused until comedian Jonathan Harvey stood as Lord Buckethead in the 2017 general election; his televised appearance standing next to prime minister Theresa May went viral, drawing media coverage and an online following. After the 2017 election, Durham asserted his ownership of the character and displaced Harvey. With Durham's authorisation, Lord Buckethead returned in 2019, now played by David Hughes; he appeared at People's Vote rallies calling for a second Brexit referendum, and stood in the 2019 general election representing the Monster Raving Loony Party. Harvey also stood, using a new character, Count Binface. ==History==  1980s origins  Lord Buckethead was created by American filmmaker Todd Durham for his 1984 film Hyperspace, a low-budget parody of science fiction films such as Star Wars. In the film, Lord Buckethead, a galactic villain similar to Star Wars character Darth Vader, was played by Robert Bloodworth. In the UK, Hyperspace was released as Gremloids by the video distributor VIPCO, owned by Mike Lee. In the 1987 UK general election, Lee stood as Lord Buckethead, representing the Gremloids Party, against Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher in her constitution in Finchley, London. He campaigned to demolish Birmingham to make way for a spaceport. He received 131 votes. In the 1992 general election, he stood against Conservative prime minister John Major, winning 107 votes (0.1%).  2017 return  In 2017, comedian Jonathan Harvey stood as Lord Buckethead against Theresa May in Maidenhead in the 2017 general election. Harvey decided to use Lord Buckethead after watching Gremloids and discovering that the character had been used in earlier elections. He received 249 (0.4%) votes, the highest yet for the character. Lord Buckethead's televised appearance standing next to May went viral, earning him appearances on the HBO talk show Last Week Tonight and at Glastonbury Festival. In a tongue-in-cheek article, The Guardian gave Lord Buckethead a \\"Best Policy\\" award for a manifesto pledge to bring back Ceefax. A few days after the election, Lord Buckethead appeared on the American talk show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, campaigning to lead the Brexit negotiations. Harvey created a Twitter account for the character, drawing hundreds of thousands of followers. The Guardian wrote that Lord Buckethead was part of a British tradition of frivolous political candidates such as the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. Lord Buckethead made a surprise appearance at Glastonbury Festival in June 2017, introducing the band Sleaford Mods. The same year, he released a Christmas single, \\"A Bucketful of Happiness\\", accompanied by a music video.  Copyright dispute  After the 2017 election, Durham contacted Harvey and asserted his ownership of the Lord Buckethead character. According to Harvey, Durham instructed him to give him the password to the Twitter account; Harvey acquiesced as he could not afford a legal challenge. Durham said he welcomed authorised applications to stand as the character in future British elections: \\"My Lord Buckethead character has always been the voice of the people, so my feeling is to let the people be his voice.\\" The Twitter account became active again in 2019. That year, Lord Buckethead, now played by David Hughes, appeared at People's Vote rallies calling for a second Brexit referendum. In April, Buckethead crowdfunded £15,000 to stand against Nigel Farage for South East England MEP in the May 2019 European Parliament Elections. The bid was abandoned for fear it could take votes away from parties campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU. Durham said the money was returned. For the general election in December 2019, Buckethead represented the Monster Raving Looney Party, standing against prime minister Boris Johnson in his constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Harvey also stood in that constituency, using a new character, Count Binface. ==Platform== Lord Buckethead's manifesto in the 2017 election promised \\"strong, not entirely stable leadership\\", a reference to the Conservatives' \\"strong and stable\\" slogan. The following promises were included: *The abolition of the House of Lords, with the exception of Lord Buckethead *Nuclear weapons: \\"A firm public commitment to build the 100-billion-pound renewal of Britain's Trident weapons system, followed by an equally firm commitment, privately, not to build it. They're secret submarines, so no one will ever know. It's a win-win.\\" *Free bicycles for all to \\"combat obesity, traffic congestion, and bike theft\\". *Reducing the voting age to 16 and restricting voting beyond the age of 80 *Instead of Theresa May's commitment to bring back grammar schools, Buckethead would build \\"gamma\\" schools founded on three principles: \\"One, better funding for teachers, to attract bright graduates. Two, increased facilities for children, especially playing fields. Three, if any child misbehaves three times, they are blasted into deep space, with the parents provided with a lovely fruit basket, by way of consolation or celebration, depending on the child. Discipline is key\\". *A referendum on whether or not to have another Brexit referendum. *Legalise the hunting of fox hunters *Nationalise pop singer Adele *Exile of right-wing columnist Katie Hopkins to the \\"Phantom Zone\\". *Regeneration of Nicholson's Shopping Centre, Maidenhead. *The cessation of arms sales to Saudi Arabia so that Britain can purchase laser weaponry from Lord Buckethead. ==Electoral historySee also== *List of frivolous political parties ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Lord Buckethead with John Major, 1992 Category:Anonymity pseudonyms Category:English politicians Category:British political candidates Category:Film characters introduced in 1984 Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes Category:Fictional lords and ladies Category:Science fiction film characters Category:British political satire ","title":"Lord Buckethead"},{"id":"54248001","text":"Brian Harvey (1916-2005)National Archives was Dean of Ossory from 1970 to 1991.Crockford's Clerical Directory 2002-2003 p 334:London, Church House, 2002 He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and ordained in 1941.

Centered around the Federal Hill Green, it developed as a fashionable residential area, and features a large number of fine Italianate and Victorian houses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. ==Description and history== The city of Bristol was settled in the 1720s as part of Farmington, from which it was formally separated in 1785. A separate parish had been established in 1744 at the top of Federal Hill, a prominent rise northeast of the present downtown. What is now the Federal Hill Green was part of the original town green, and is where Bristol's first church and school were located. Changes in transportation routes in the 19th century reduced this center's economic importance, and most civic functions were eventually established elsewhere. It remained a focus of religious activities (there are four churches in the district), and became a fashionable location for wealthy businesspeople to build homes. This began in the 1840s, and reached its height in the last four decades of the 19th century. The historic district is roughly bounded on the west by a railroad right-of-way which skirts around the base of the hill, and on the south by High Street. To the east and north it is bounded by areas filled with construction after the 1920s. There are more than 250 primary buildings (houses, churches, schools, and a few commercial buildings) in the district, and a number of period outbuildings, mainly garages and barns or carriage houses. The architectural styles seen the most are the Italianate of the 1850s-1870s, and the Queen Anne Victorian. Probably the most opulent house in the district is the Beleden House, a Beaux Arts mansion built in 1908-10 for a local merchant and banker, which is individually listed on the National Register for its architecture. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Georgian architecture in Connecticut Category:Victorian architecture in Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Historic districts in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Bristol, Connecticut ","title":"Federal Hill Historic District (Bristol, Connecticut)"},{"id":"54248223","text":"Dr. Minnita Daniel-Cox, an African-American soprano, founded the Dunbar Music Archive.

She was hired as an engineering technician for the Eisenhower Tunnel construction project in Colorado in 1970, but was barred from performing her work inside the tunnel due to the prevailing superstition that women who went underground in tunnels or mines brought bad luck, endangering the male workers. In 1972 she filed a $100,000 class action lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Highways for sexual discrimination. The state settled the case out of court and she was allowed to enter the tunnel, although she dressed inconspicuously. She became a symbol for equal rights in the workplace. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. ==Early life and education== Janet Petra Bonnema was born in Denver, Colorado, to Peter and Helen Bonnema. She had two sisters. Although she desired to study math and science, her guidance counselors at South High School discouraged her from pursuing these traditionally male-oriented subjects. She was similarly advised against majoring in engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, and instead graduated with a bachelor's degree in history in 1960. During her university years, she captained the university ski team. ==Early career== After graduation, Bonnema began working as an engineering aide at Boeing Aircraft in Seattle. She left after two and a half years, seeing men who were less qualified than she receiving higher salaries and promotions. She spent the rest of the 1960s hitchhiking around the world, returning to Denver in 1970 having exhausted her savings. Eisenhower Tunnel In November 1970 Bonnema applied to the Colorado Department of Highways (CDOT) for a position as an engineering technician for the Eisenhower Tunnel project (then named the Straight Creek Tunnel project). She met the qualification criteria, passed the tests, and her application was accepted as being filed by a \\"Mr. Jamet Bonnema\\", as the state employer misspelled the name and was under the impression they were hiring a man. When Bonnema called to accept the job but question the salary being offered, she was told that \\"no women are allowed in the tunnel\\". Bonnema maintained that she could do the work, and two months later the department created a special engineering technician position for her that was office-based. While Bonnema was tasked with \\"recording measurements, collecting rock samples, and producing technical drawings\\" based on data found within the tunnels, her supervisors barred her from entering the tunnel itself due to her gender. A prevailing superstition, stemming from Welsh miners who came to work in Colorado in the mid-nineteenth century, held that women who descended underground into mines or tunnels would bring bad luck, putting the male workers in danger. This superstition applied to female workers, journalists, and visitors alike. In July 1972, capping a year-long investigation, the United States Department of Transportation concluded that barring female workers from the tunnel amounted to sexual discrimination. When Bonnema's supervisors still refused to allow her entry, Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action lawsuit against the CDOT, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Before the case was heard, Colorado voters ratified the Equal Rights Amendment and the state opted to settle Bonnema's case out of court for $6,750. Bonnema was escorted into the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972. Sixty-six workers temporarily walked off the job in protest, but only one quit permanently. On her second visit to the tunnel on November 14, Bonnema donned coveralls and a hard hat to disguise her identity. This time she and other workers were asked to perform measurements at the top of the tunnel, where Bonnema worked inside a concrete pipe; no one walked out on this visit. Bonnema continued to dress in coveralls during her subsequent forays into the tunnel so as not to attract attention. ==Later career== Following the completion of the Eisenhower Tunnel, Bonnema pursued graduate studies at the University of Colorado Denver, earning her M.S. in civil engineering. In 1990 she moved to Okeechobee, Florida, where she worked as a civil engineer for the South Florida Water Management District until her retirement in 2001. She died of cancer on May 9, 2008, age 69, in Okeechobee. ==Awards and honors== Bonnema was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. In April 2011 Colorado State Senator Nancy Spence paid tribute to Bonnema in a speech on the senate floor. ==Personal life== Bonnema challenged gender stereotypes in her private life as well. She enjoyed skiing, motorcycling, rock climbing, parachuting, piloting, and traveling. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:1938 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American civil engineers Category:American women engineers Category:20th-century American engineers Category:21st-century American engineers Category:Engineers from Colorado Category:Engineers from Florida Category:American women's rights activists Category:University of Colorado Boulder alumni Category:University of Colorado Denver alumni Category:People from Denver Category:People from Okeechobee, Florida Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:20th-century women engineers Category:21st-century women engineers ","title":"Janet Bonnema"},{"id":"54248262","text":"Hussam al-Din Awak is a former officer in the Syrian Armed Forces who reportedly became a Free Syrian Army commander upon the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. After claiming in 2015 that Turkey had cooperated with ISIL, Awak was denounced by Syrian opposition figures as fraud and liar. In 2016, Awak joined the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alongside his unit, the Free Officers Union. He eventually resigned from the SDF and the Syrian Democratic Council in December 2017. == Biography ==  Service in the Syrian Armed Forces  Hussam Awak is from Deir ez-Zor Governorate and served in the Syrian Arab Air Force and Air Force Intelligence Directorate before 2005. His rank at that time, however, is strongly disputed; he has widely been described as former brigadier general by various news agencies, but his opponents have claimed that Hussam has given this rank to himself, and that he had never risen to a particularly high position in the Syrian Armed Forces. According to Dam Press, he was major by 2004. The circumstances of his resignation from the Syrian military are equally controversial. Hussam has been considered a defector by some, whereas others allege that he was fired \\"for indecent behaviour\\" in 2005, and later presented himself as opposition figure out of opportunism. His opponents claim that he was linked to prostitution, smuggling and corruption during his time in the military. After leaving the military, Awak moved from Syria to the United Arab Emirates, where he found new work.  Syrian Civil War   Free Officers Union  Hussam surfaced as Syrian opposition member in December 2011, claiming to serve as commander in the Free Officers Union, which in turn had by then become a Free Syrian Army member. In his position as the Free Officers Union's head of intelligence, he operated in Syria, the Gulf states and Egypt in an attempt to gain international support for his group and their aims. He reportedly attempted to become the leader of the military exiles among the Syrian opposition, but this was thwarted by Riad al-Asaad. Hussam gave numerous interviews in 2012, in which he was also critical of US support to some rebel militias in Syria, saying that \\"the American intelligence — the CIA — should be more selective in choosing opposition figures, and (should not) choose just anyone. They should choose reliable persons.\\" He also accused the Syrian Intelligence agencies and the Lebanese Tawhid Party of being responsible for the abduction of Shibli al- Aysami. When 13 Lebanese pilgrims were abducted by rebels in May 2012, Awak claimed to have contacted the leader of the kidnappers and to try to get the pilgrims released. Hussam also condemned the abduction of 21 Filipino UN soldiers in early March 2013 by the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade. In late 2015, Hussam said in an interview with the Sputnik news agency that he had evidence that Turkey bought oil from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Thereafter, numerous pro-opposition sources and rebel leaders claimed that Awak was a fraud who supported Russia and was not connected to the Free Syrian Army in any way. In another interview with Russia Today, he claimed that numerous FSA members had deserted to ISIL, while his own group had to retreat from the region around al-Bab as result of attacks by Islamic State militants. Hussam also expressed his hope that Russia and all Syrians, both government and opposition, \\"can work hand-in-hand when it comes to counter terrorism and extremism in the region.\\"  Syrian Democratic Forces  One year later, Hussam announced that he had defected from the FSA to the Syrian Democratic Forces, along with the Free Officers Union which reportedly had over one hundred members at the time. He said that the reason for his defection was that the FSA had reduced itself to the proxy of foreign powers, particularly Turkey. Furthermore, he blamed the FSA for terrorist actions against civilians. From then on, he served as SDF brigadier general, and praised the \\"YPG and YPJ [as] the sun that shone on the region with their outgoing mentality and their good behavior\\", while also saying that he supports the federalization of Syria. The first SDF operation in which Hussam became involved was the campaign to capture Raqqa from ISIL. In May 2017, he led the negotiations with Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa to get them to join the Raqqa campaign. After promising the unit's leadership \\"that its role [in post- conquest Raqqa] will be essential\\", the group agreed to return to the frontlines. Hussam also attended a meeting in Mansura between local tribal sheikhs and representatives of the Raqqa Civil Council as well as the Syrian Democratic Council in August, during which he said that the Assad government \\"had no place\\" in Raqqa anymore.  Split with the SDF  Hussam announced his resignation from the SDF and Syrian Democratic Council on his Facebook page on 20 December 2017 without providing any reasons. He later stated that the resignation stemmed from various disagreements with the rest of the SDF leadership about issues such as the Turkish military operation in Afrin, taxes, prosecution of corrupt individuals, and cooperation with Russia and the United States. In early March 2018, Hussam and his wife disappeared in Jazira Region while visiting a person close to Humaydi Daham al-Hadi, leader of the Syrian Shammar. His family consequently accused the Shammar Sheikh of having enforcedly disappeared the former officer near al-Yaarubiyah, with his nephew asking Îlham Ehmed, co-chairperson of the Syrian Democratic Council, for help. It was later revealed, however, that he and his wife had been arrested by YPG intelligence agents who also confiscated their possessions. According to Hussam, the arrest had been organized due to his resignation from the SDF, while a pro-Syrian opposition news site argued that he had tried to flee to Iraqi Kurdistan. He later claimed that PKK members intervened on his behalf, though they did not return the confiscated money and goods as promised. He was then put under house arrest, though freed thanks to the help of foreign supporters, including Kurdish friends and United Nations officials. After being freed, he further distanced himself from the YPG. In an interview he gave in August 2018, Hussam declared that he soon expected a popular uprising against the YPG due to the latter repressing all local opposition. == Personal life == Hussam is married to a Libyan woman who was reportedly a former member of Muammar Gaddafi's Amazonian Guard according to a pro-Syrian opposition news site. His opponents claim that he has four other wives as well, but that these are separated from him. ==See also== *List of Syrian defectors ==References== Category:Defectors to the Free Syrian Army Category:Syrian Air Force personnel Category:Living people Category:Syrian Democratic Forces Category:People of the Syrian Civil War Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Hussam Awak"},{"id":"54248263","text":"Statistics of the American Indoor Soccer Association in season 1989–90. ==Overview== Before the season, Atlanta was added, Ft.

The idea was published and patented in 1968 by Werner Grimm from Hanau, Germany. Ordinary Atomic spectroscopy can be used to determine the surface of a material, but not its layered structure. In contrast, GDOES gradually ablates the layers of the sample, revealing the deeper structure. GDOES spectroscopy can be used for the quantitative and qualitative determination of elements and is therefore a method of analytical chemistry. ==Process== The metallic samples are used as a cathode in a direct current plasma. From the surface, the sample is removed in layers by sputtering with argon ions. The removed atoms pass into the plasma by diffusion. Photons are emitted with excited waves and have characteristic wavelengths which are recorded by means of a downstream spectrometer and subsequently quantified. When using a high-frequency alternating voltage for plasma generation and the corresponding construction of the glow discharge source, non-metallic samples can also be examined. Various instruments are used as sensors. Photomultipliers can detect the slightest traces and also high concentrations of the sensor-specific element. By means of charge-coupled device, a complete element spectrum can be measured with the appropriate layer thickness. ==Applications== Glow discharge spectroscopy is an established method for the characterization of steels and varnishes. Recent developments relate to the analysis of porous electrodes from lithium-ion batteries. ==Further reading== * R.Kenneth Marcus, José Broekaert: Glow Discharge Plasmas in Analytical Spectroscopy Wiley, * Thomas Nelis, Richard Payling,: Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy - A Practical Guide ==ReferencesExternal links== *Glow Discharges *GDOES Theory with excellent illustrations *[https://www.spectruma.us Category:Emission spectroscopy ","title":"Glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy"},{"id":"54248284","text":"Line 1 of the Changchun Subway () is a rapid transit line running from north to south Changchun.

The president gives the New Year speech from the Kremlin, a few minutes before the Kremlin Clock chimes at midnight. The speech sums up the main events of the year and discusses prospects for the coming one. The tradition is observed by most Russians, regardless of political views. The speech is broadcast in each of the 11 time zones in the country. Because of that, the video of the speech is already available on the internet to audiences in western Russia during the afternoon of 31 December. The tradition dates back to 1941, when the Soviet government broadcast a speech about the state of the country during World War II. Gorbachev gave a speech in 1990 saying the 1990s would be \\"a decade of the drawing of the United States and the Soviet Union closer together\\". Boris Yeltsin generally avoided talk of politics during his new year speeches, preferring to talk about family values and the holiday spirit, though he did use his 1996 speech to promote economic reforms. Yeltsin famously resigned during his New Year speech on 31 December 1999. In 2013 two different speeches were broadcast: the first one was only broadcast in the Far East, while a new broadcast for the rest of the country mentioned the December 2013 Volgograd bombings. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Speeches by heads of state Category:Annual events in Russia Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"New Year Address by the President of Russia"},{"id":"54248327","text":"Jacqueline Brandford Ayer (May 2, 1930 – May 20, 2012) was an American author, illustrator, fashion and textile designer, and recipient of a Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators. She founded the fashion brand Design-Thai, worked in India producing textiles and wrote and illustrated children's books including Nu Dang and His Kite, A Wish for Little Sister and A Paper Flower Tree. == Career == Jacqueline Ayer was born in New York City to Jamaican parents. Her father Edward Brandford was a graphic artist who founded The Brandford Modeling Agency, the first licensed African-American agency in the United States. Her mother, Thelma Brandford, was a sample cutter and shop steward for the ILGWU (International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union). Ayer grew up in the \\"Coops\\", an East Bronx cooperative built for garment workers. She went to the High School of Music & Art in New York and then Syracuse University, followed by the Académie de la Grande Chaumière (drawing), the École Paul Colin (graphics) and the École des Beaux-Arts (painting) in Paris. While she was in France in the early 1950s, Ayer worked as a fashion illustrator, sketching the models as they walked down the runway at the Paris collections. From there she was introduced to Christian Dior and Michel de Brunhoff, the editor of Vogue Paris, who helped to support her and develop her work. Catalog published to accompany Jacqueline Ayer: Drawing on Thailand, on show at House of Illustration from June 16 to October 22, 2017. In 1950, she was featured alongside Man Ray in the \\"Fantsastische Gebete\\" segment of the film Dadascope (released 1961) by Hans Richter. She played the black chess queen; Man Ray's muse (later wife) Juliet Browner played the white queen. She moved back to New York in 1953 and began working for the department store Bonwit Teller as a fashion illustrator; among her colleagues there was the young Andy Warhol. She returned to Paris on holiday in 1956, where she met fellow American Frederic Ayer. They got married and traveled by boat and train across Asia, before renting a house in Bangkok, where their first daughter Margot was born. Their second daughter Elizabeth was born two-and-a-half years later. Inspired by her surroundings in Thailand, Ayer began to work on a series of children's books based on her illustrations of day-to-day life in Bangkok. She was offered a publishing deal by Harcourt Brace in New York, and went on to publish eight children's books (four as author and illustrator, four as illustrator), including Nu Dang and His Kite,(2015).

Jim Thompson suggested modernising traditional Thai patterns and printing them on his silks. On Thompson's recommendation, Ayer was hired as the designer for the new company, which she decided to name Design-Thai. The printed textiles, which included silks and cottons, were popular with both Europeans and Americans. Ayer designed both fabrics and clothing patterns. Design-Thai was able to expand, opening a large shop in Bangkok branching into ready-to-wear clothing. Paywalled. Also reprinted at (Citation for her role in Design-Thai and for the Rockefeller involvement.) In 1966–67, Design-Thai had over 400 employees and, during Ayer's tenure, its wares were sold by shops including Harrod's. In the 1970s Ayer worked for the Indian government, helping to develop traditional crafts and cottage industries across the country. She also had a stint in New York designing bed linen, which was sold in top department stores including Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus. But she was mainly based in London, where she designed soft furnishings for brands including The Conran Shop and Ralph Lauren, as well as publishing a book on the history of Oriental costumes. In later life, Ayer continued to draw and paint, and many of her final works were large-scale watercolours featuring flowers and her personal belongings. The Paper-Flower Tree and Nu Dang and His Kite were republished in June and July respectively in 2017 by New York-based publishers Enchanted Lion Books, in conjunction with an exhibition on Jacqueline Ayer's illustration and fashion design at The House of Illustration in London, June 17 to October 22, 2017.

Its western terminus is at SR 11 in Ashland and its eastern terminus is at SR 163 in Presque Isle after sharing a concurrency. SR 227 roughly parallels SR 163 over its entire length. However, SR 163 takes a more direct route between Ashland and Presque Isle while SR 227 takes a more arc-like shape to the north, generally paralleling the Aroostook River. ==Route description== SR 227 begins at the intersection of Main Street, Station Street, and Sheridan Road in Ashland. Main Street to the south and Station Street to the west carry SR 11\\\\. With SR 227 heading east along Exchange Street, it first passes a diner and a bar, then a church, but it heads past mostly houses. Exiting the center of the town, the road heads up a small hill, passes an electrical substation, then heads through rolling hills and curves to the northeast traveling on Frenchville Road. Though most of the area consists of woods and houses, some farms line the road through the remainder of Ashland. Nearing the town line, SR 227 passes through Frenchville, consisting of more densely-spaced houses and a church and its cemetery. When the road crosses into the town of Castle Hill, it begins to head in a more easterly direction. The road make a long descent into a valley crossing Welts Brook at the bottom. It then climbs Castle Hill and reaches the settlement of the same name at the top. A church is visible along the road but the settlement is mostly made up of houses that line the road. Before exiting Castle Hill, the road descends from the ridge passing a cemetery and additional houses. It exits Castle Hill and then enters Mapleton. At the settlement of State Road, SR 227 crosses a rail trail (formerly Bangor and Aroostook Railroad) and bends to the northeast after a stretch of traveling east. It then curves to the southeast and passes several large farms and churches. Houses continue to line the road as well. Continuing southeast, it enters the city of Presque Isle and passes to the north of Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle. The road turns further to the southeast and enters an industrialized area of the city. After passing Skyway Street, an access road to the industrial companies around the airport, SR 227 intersects with SR 163, the Parsons Road Connector. SR 227 east is cosigned with SR 163 west along Parsons Street towards downtown Presque Isle. The opposing directions of the routes result in a wrong-way concurrency. The SR 227 designation ends at the intersection of Parsons Street, State Street, and Industrial Drive. Eastbound State Street (which formerly carried SR 163 east before it was rerouted around downtown) connects to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) downtown, while SR 163 west turns onto Mechanic Street towards Mapleton. ==History== SR 227 has maintained its original alignment since its designation in 1939. Originally, it ran alone on Parsons Street and terminated at SR 163 as it does today. At that time, SR 163 ran west-to-east along Industrial Drive and onto State Street to connect with US 1, with which it was cosigned in downtown Presque Isle. In 1994, the Parsons Road Connector was built connecting SR 227 to US 1 at Maysville Street north of downtown. SR 163 was removed from State Street and rerouted up Parsons Street, onto the connector, and onto Maysville Street to divert traffic from the west away from downtown. The eastern terminus of SR 227 was not moved, however, resulting in a wrong- way concurrency between SR 163 and SR 227, the latter of which now terminates at unnumbered State Street. ==Major junctionsReferencesExternal links== *Floodgap Roadgap's RoadsAroundME: Maine State Route 227 227 Category:Transportation in Aroostook County, Maine ","title":"Maine State Route 227"},{"id":"54248459","text":"Arhopala athada, the vinous oakblue is a species of butterfly belonging to the lycaenid family described by Otto Staudinger in 1889.\\"Arhopala Boisduval, 1832\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. ==History== The section along Eighth Street has been the center of Holland's commercial shopping district since the founding of the city in 1847. However, a disastrous forest fire in 1871 destroyed much of the town, including the entire commercial district in the center of the city. Reconstruction was hindered by the economic Panic of 1873, but much of the downtown had been rebuilt by 1875. However, this first wave of rebuilding was primarily composed of two-story false-front frame structures, none of which remain within the district. The first brick buildings constructed were probably the two-storefront wide VanDerVeen Hardware Building at 36 West Eighth and the original section of the City Hotel, on the site of the Hotel Warm Friend. Holland's population grew immensely in the later part of the 19th century, increasing from 2400 in 1871 to 7790 by 1900. Railroads and shipping infrastructure was built, and the industrial base of the city grew, and the commercial area followed suit. Beginning in the 1880s and continuing through the 1920s, a building boom resulted in the former wooden buildings in downtown being replaced with brick structures. ==Description== The Holland Downtown Historic District contains 59 contributing and 24 non-contributing structures. Most of the buildings are two- and three-story commercial structures, built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and having brick, stone, or terra cotta facades. The buildings stand directly on the line of the sidewalk. The largest buildings stand in the center of the district at the corner of Eight Street and Central: the former Steketee's store at 4 East Eighth and the six-story, former Hotel Warm Friend at 5 East Eighth. The oldest buildings in the district are Italianate in design, with the buildings at 24 East and 36 West Eight Street being the only examples. Other buildings span Late Victorian architectural styles, and include Renaissance Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque structures. Some of the significant structures in the district include: *Holland City State Bank (190 River Avenue, at Eighth): This massive three-story Richardsonian Romanesque bank is constructed of rock-face blocks of Waverly stone, and has a distinctive pyramid-roof corner tower that provides a landmark for the downtown. *Knickerbocker (Holland) Theater Building (86 East Eighth): This 20th century commercial building has a high, stepped-pediment facade with a classical cornice and a pediment. *First National (now First of America) Bank (1 West Eighth): This is the only Classical Revival building in the district. It is clad with limestone, and has an Ionic portico in antis. *Steketee's Department Store (44 East Eighth): This six-story building has a facade that is nearly all window, with terra cotta bands marking the divisions between floors. The roofline undulates, with raised areas containing colored Art Deco terra-cotta ornamentation. * Hotel Warm Friend (5 East Eighth): The largest building in the district is a six- story structure made from red brick with limestone trim. The building is nine bays wide, and has a Dutch gable in the center of its facade. Completed in 1925, the building occupies the site of earlier hotels - the City Hotel and the Hotel Holland - which date back to 1871 ==Gallery== File:Holland Downtown Historic District A.JPG Eighth Street at College, looking west File:Holland Downtown Historic District C.JPG Eighth Street east of Central, looking east (south side) File:Holland Downtown Historic District D.JPG Eighth Street east of Central, looking east (north side) File:Holland, MI Downtown.jpgEighth Street at River, looking east ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"Holland Downtown Historic District"},{"id":"54248511","text":"A synestia is a hypothesized rapidly spinning doughnut-shaped mass of vaporized rock. In computer simulations of giant impacts of rotating objects, a synestia can form if the total angular momentum is greater than the co- rotational limit. Beyond the co-rotational limit, the velocity at the equator of a body would exceed the orbital velocity. In a synestia, this results in an inner region rotating at a single rate with a loosely connected torus orbiting beyond it. Synestias also have differences in the mantles, both thermally and in their composition, from previous terrestrial evolution models due partially to a lower interior pressure.Lock, Simon J. 2018. The Formation, Structure and Evolution of Terrestrial Planets. Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University, Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. == Composition == A synestia is composed of three primary components: the innermost area called the corotating region, a middle area called the transition region, and the area farthest out, known as the disk-like region. The corotating region rotates as a solid body. It is characterized by hot vapor and high entropy levels, as well as higher angular velocities. The transition region is generally a continuous change between the corotating region and ring-like region. Here, in most simulations, the angular velocity and temperature follow a smooth gradient, both decreasing with radius. The temperature gradient is created by the mixture of hot vapor from the inner regions with colder condensed material from farther out. Given time this equilibrates into solely a vapor. This transitions into the disk-like region whose appearance can vary dramatically with different initial conditions for angular momentum, mass, and entropy. == Giant-Impact Hypothesis == According to studies, synestia was an early-stage process for the formation of the Earth and Moon within the giant-impact hypothesis. In this model, a synestia formed following a collision with an object of high energy and high angular momentum. The synestia's surface temperatures are constrained by the boiling point of rock, around ). As the resulting synestia cooled by radiating heat to space, magma droplets formed in its outer layers and then rained inward over a period of tens of years, causing the synestia to contract. Mass remaining outside the Roche limit of the inner region accreted to form moonlets, and subsequently combined to form our moon. The Earth re- formed later, once the synestia had cooled sufficiently to fall within the co- rotational limit. By this model, the Moon's having formed within a cloud of vapor that originated from the Earth is why its isotopic ratios are similar to those of the Earth. The later formation of the Earth (after the synestia cooled) accounts for its having accreted more volatile elements than the Moon. ==Notes and referencesExternal links== * TED talk about synestia by Sarah T.

He has recorded albums for Capitol Records (1969) with the group Rig, as well as solo albums for Columbia Records (1972) and for Bill Graham Productions (1971). In addition, his original songs have been recorded by artists including Jim Post, Ronnie Montrose, and Reilly & Maloney. ==Early life== Kardt was born in Ridgewood, Queens, New York, in 1943, and he grew up in Brooklyn and Queens, where he attended public schools and later, Queens College, City University of New York. Because Kardt's religious parents discouraged his “worldly” interest in music, he left home at age nineteen. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree with a major in music in 1967. After attending college, he abandoned classical pursuits in favor of popular music, inspired by the rock bands of the 1960s. ==Career== Early career While still in college Kardt joined his first rock band, a quartet, The Frozen Flowers, who performed locally in Queens at a storefront nightclub in Jackson Heights. They released one single, “Are You in Love,” written by band member Bob Zaidman (an acetate of the song can be heard on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48XFpokc8M8). After the breakup of the Frozen Flowers, Kardt performed briefly as a founding member of The Fugs in the mid-1960s. Meanwhile, Kardt began to pursue songwriting, at first with collaborator Matt Fried, and then on his own. He focused on developing a rock ensemble as a vehicle for his new songs. He took up the guitar and worked at developing rudimentary skills, leaving aside his early attempts as a pianist. Kardt had no formal training on either instrument. Band collaboration In 1967 Kardt formed a power trio, Black Betty, in which he was the bassist and lead vocalist. Additional members included Jack McNichol on guitar. Black Betty performed in Manhattan for a year, occasionally at trendy night spots, including Steve Paul's Scene and the Village Gate where they opened for acts such as the Siegel-Schwall Band and Steve Winwood. The group attracted the attention of record company entrepreneur Jac Holzman, whose Elektra Records label was still based in New York. Holzman agreed to record Black Betty if the band found a replacement for McNichol. Kardt refused and the deal fell through. This would be the first of several incidents where Kardt's self- described “stubborn independence” clashed with record industry “pressure.” Ironically, McNichol would quit Black Betty shortly thereafter to join a Top 40 cover band. The following year Kardt formed the quartet Rig, which also included guitarist Artie Richards, bassist Don Kerr, and drummer Rick Schlosser. After playing the New York club scene for 2 years, the group recorded a first album for Capitol Records, under the auspices of new manager, Bill Graham, on March 25, 26, 28, and 29, 1970 in New York City. The album, produced by Elliot Mazer and Adam Mitchell, appeared in 1970. (cite BY) The group played often at the Fillmore East and then toured nationally for a year booked through Herb Spar's Millard Agency, opening for acts such as The Who, Alice Cooper, Delaney & Bonnie and The New Riders of the Purple Sage. At the end of 1970, Rig broke up and Kendell relocated to northern California with co-manager Mark Spector in order to be closer to Graham's San Francisco operation. In 1971, Kardt recorded a solo album scheduled for release on Capitol called \\"Buddy Bolden,\\" which featured musicians such as Jerry Garcia, Ronnie Montrose, Spencer Dryden and Pamela Polland. Unfortunately, the album was shelved after an A&R; shakeup at Capitol. In 1972, Clive Davis signed Kardt to Columbia Records, where he recorded an unnamed album featuring the Memphis Horns and arrangements by Bill Pursell. That album was also shelved before completion in 1973. Solo artist On his own now, Kardt slowly achieved recognition through the 1970s as a songwriter and performer in the Chicago folk music scene, where his songs like “Buzzy and Jimmy,” “Dance, Gypsy Dance,” “Bicycle Wheel”, “Silver Engine and “Walk on the Water” became repertoire staples for singers such as Jim Post, Reilly & Maloney, and others. Kardt continued to write and perform his compositions nationally as a solo artist until 1984. At that time he retired from performing and writing to devote himself to his family and other projects. Now living in rural New Hampshire, he married Carla Richardson. Post retirement He joined three local amateur musicians, Watson Reid, Robin Reid, and Liza Hill to form a trio called Heartsong. This project was dedicated to performing well-known standards from the American songbook for local audiences. In 1985 the Reids relocated and Kardt re-formed the group as a quintet on a more professional footing. The permanent members included Terry landis, Carol Raynsford and David Lord. Kardt created a number of elaborate vocal arrangements for five singers who were now accompanied in concert by a bassist, drummer and pianist. Kardt played lead guitar. The group released one CD in 1987 before disbanding. By 1987 Kardt had enlisted as accompanist and music director for a children's dance instruction program in the Cheshire County schools, called New Hampshire Dance Institute. As part of his responsibilities he wrote various numbers for their year-end showcase performances. In 1990, his final year with the program, he created lyrics and music for a full-scale musical entitled Let Your Light Shine, which was based on the life and work of inventor Thomas A. Edison. In the summer of 1990, feeling that he had exhausted his creative possibilities in southern New Hampshire, Kardt decided to move on to greener - and warmer, pastures. After much consideration, he chose the city of Nashville, Tennessee as his new home. He had no immediate plans except to put his keyboard skills to good use to earn his living. After several false starts, peripherally connected to ‘country’ music, he happened upon a job as accompanist for the Nashville City Ballet Company. Although he had no experience whatever with either classical dance or its attendant musical repertoire he discovered that his improvisational talent served him well until he was able to acquire the requisite background. In short, what he thought would be a temporary expedient became the start of a new career, which would serve as his primary source of income for the next 19 years. After 2 years in Nashville he decided to relocate once more, which eventually found him in northern New Jersey, where he still resides. He continued to work with major ballet companies and dance studios in New York and New Jersey until his retirement in 2009. These include: *American Ballet Theatre *New York University Tisch School of Dance *David Howard Studios *Broadway Dance Center *Northern Westchester Arts Center *New Jersey Ballet Princeton Ballet ==Contemporary projects== Once Kardt had established himself with gainful employment in the NYC metro area he turned his attention to various creative projects that have occupied him to the present time. Poetry: Beginning in 1998, he began to attend and perform at a series of ‘alternative’ readings by local poets in New York's Lower East Side literary scene. For these venues he created an extensive body of work, about 200 poems, a few of which were published. These are available on his website at kendellkardt.com Website: Around 2005, Kardt created his website, kendellkardt.com, to serve as a repository for his creative output. Its primary content was to be an archive of recorded performances, some live, some from studio recordings, made between 1969 and 1984. This was eventually expanded to include other material as well. Memoir: Among these is an extended memoir detailing his life and career in a sometimes whimsical literary format with comments from his imaginary alter ego, Bernard Rudolph. The memoir concludes in January 2006 and is followed by a long epilogue, completed in 2014. Other items on the website include a short story for children, titled The Pearl, a series of ‘Christmas’ pages containing his recording of Johann Sebastian Bach's keyboard pieces and assorted other works, a photo gallery, video and audio recordings of his live performances since 2009, as well as a complete catalog of lyrics to all his original songs with notes and annotations. In 2017, Kardt published The Pearl, with illustrations by Czech artist, Pavla Hovorkova, available on Amazon. com. ==Voluntary work== Since 2008 Kardt has worked as a volunteer teacher of English as a Second Language at the public library in Lodi, NJ, his hometown. In 2012 Kardt was given the Tutor of the Year award by the Pascack Valley Assn. of Literacy Volunteers. Among his students is Margaret Krautschneider, a Polish exchange student, who has completed her first book in English, published in Poland in 2017. Kendell and Margaret were married in May,2019. Beginning in 1980, Kardt, in anticipation of his retirement from performing, began to supplement his income with work as a church musician. He gradually adapted his piano skills to the organ. Over many years, until 2015, he served as organist in a number of churches in New Hampshire, Tennessee, and New Jersey. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:American male composers Category:American male guitarists Category:American male pianists Category:American male poets Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American male writers Category:American music arrangers Category:Capitol Records artists Category:Queens College, City University of New York alumni Category:21st-century American pianists Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Kendell Kardt"},{"id":"54248528","text":"Ho•n•to•u•so/Su•ki•ra•i (ホ・ン・ト・ウ・ソ／ス・キ・ラ・イ / Truth and Lies/Love and Hate) is soloist misono's first single released under the pseudonym \\"Me\\" and also her first bringing in her new era.

The last one suggests that \\"the entire [Hungarian] army was destroyed, but thirty men\\" [\\"nisi 30 viros\\"]. Historian Károly Szabó argued this figure is a result of a subsequent insertion. The battle is marginally also mentioned by the Annales Sancti Quintini Viromandensis. ==Background== The 16th-century humanist historian and philologist Johannes Aventinus' Annalium Boiorum libri septem (1523) contains more details about the circumstances of the battle. His work is mostly based on manuscripts written at the time of the battle, but since lost. Aventinus mentioned the event in two paragraphs. At first, he wrote: \\"The Hungarians demand tax payment from Arnulf, who refuses it. After that they invade the Bavarians. Arnulf surrounds and slaughters them\\". In the second paragraph, Aventinus has more detailed the events: The Hungarian campaign in the East Frankish realms, Burgundy and West Francia from 913 Aventinus' narrative confirmed that Conrad was obliged to pay tribute to the Hungarians, as well as his predecessor Louis the Child, together with the Swabian, Frankish, Bavarian and Saxonian dukes, after the Battle of Rednitz in June 910. According to the chronicler, paying the regular tax was the \\"price of peace\\". After the western border was pacified, the Hungarians used the Eastern provinces of the Kingdom of Germany as puffer zone and transfer area to execute their long-range military campaigns to far West. Bavaria allowed Hungarians into their realm to continue their journey and the Bavarian–Hungarian relations were described as neutral during this time. Following the disastrous Battle of Pressburg (907), Arnulf strengthened his power through confiscation of church lands and the secularization of numerous monastery estates to raise funds to finance a re- organized defense, which earned him the nickname \\"the Bad\\" by medieval chroniclers. Despite \\"peace\\" which was guaranteed by regular tax payments, he was faced with constant raids from the Hungarians, when they entered the border or returned to the Pannonian Basin after a distant campaign. However the energetic and combative Arnulf already defeated a small Hungarian raiding contingent at Pocking near the Rott river on 11 August 909, after they withdrew from a campaign where they burnt the two churches of Freising. In 910, he also beat another minor Hungarian unit at Neuching, which returned from the victorius Battle of Lechfeld and other plundering attacks. Historian István Bóna described the battle as a \\"destruction of a gang of robbers\\" who arbitrarily broke the conditions of peace. Other historians, who argue in favour of the lack of central organization of military campaigns, consider the Hungarian plunder attack in Bavaria after returning their war from West, which resulted Battle of the Inn, was merely a private action by a tribal chieftain or a small unit. Historian Levente Igaz argues the Bavarian was able to achieve success against the Hungarians only if they returned from a prosperous remote campaign with their booty, prisoners, and livestock which slowed down their marching. It is possible that after years of peace and stabilization, Arnulf felt strong enough to create new favorable conditions for his forced alliance with the Hungarians. After his disobedient behavior, the Hungarians launched a punitive expedition against his duchy, provoking a war. His conscious strategy was confirmed by the report of the Annales Alamannici, which wrote Arnulf concluded an alliance with his relatives, Swabian counts Erchanger and Burchard, and an influential lord Udalrich against the Hungarians. Aventinus' work also suggests that Arnulf used the Hungarians' \\"own military method\\" when ordered they soldiers to hide and imitating retreat, confirming a military cultural exchange at the Bavarian–Hungarian border. ==Reconstruction== Igaz argues the German allied forces attacked the Hungarians' camp near Altötting or Asbach, beyond the valley of Inn. As there is no report of any Hungarian military expeditions in the next year (914), several historians condisered Arnulf's attack as \\"the first truly significant defeat\\" to the Hungarians since their series of invasions against Western Europe, which preceded the defeats at Riade (933) and Lechfeld (955). However, as Igaz points out, there were other examples when a small Hungarian unit was stalked and massacred, for instance, as Ekkehard preserved, when drunk and tired Hungarian invaders were perished by local at the village of Friccowe. ==ReferencesSources== * * Inn Inn Category:913 Inn ","title":"Battle of the Inn"},{"id":"54248570","text":"The 2017 Città di Caltanissetta was a professional tennis tournament played on clay courts.

To estimate parameters of a conditional moment model, the statistician can derive an expectation function (defining \\"moment conditions\\") and use the generalized method of moments (GMM). However, there are infinitely many moment conditions that can be generated from a single model; optimal instruments provide the most efficient moment conditions. As an example, consider the nonlinear regression model :y = f(x, \\\\theta) + u :E[u\\\\mid x]=0 where is a scalar (one- dimensional) random variable, is a random vector with dimension , and is a -dimensional parameter. The conditional moment restriction E[u\\\\mid x]=0 is consistent with infinitely many moment conditions. For example: :E[ux] = E[u x^2] = E[u x^3] = \\\\dots = 0 More generally, for any vector-valued function of , it will be the case that :E[z(x) (y - f(x, \\\\theta))] = 0. That is, defines a finite set of orthogonality conditions. A natural question to ask, then, is whether an asymptotically efficient set of conditions is available, in the sense that no other set of conditions achieves lower asymptotic variance. Both econometricians and statisticians have extensively studied this subject. The answer to this question is generally that this finite set exists and have been proven for a wide range of estimators. Takeshi Amemiya was one of the first to work on this problem and show the optimal number of instruments for nonlinear simultaneous equation models with homoskedastic and serially uncorrelated errors. The form of the optimal instruments was characterized by Lars Peter Hansen, and results for nonparametric estimation of optimal instruments are provided by Newey. A result for nearest neighbor estimators was provided by Robinson. == In linear regression == The technique of optimal instruments can be used to show that, in a conditional moment linear regression model with iid data, the optimal GMM estimator is generalized least squares. Consider the model :y = x^\\\\mathrm T \\\\theta + u :E[u \\\\mid x] = 0 where is a scalar random variable, is a -dimensional random vector, and is a -dimensional parameter vector. As above, the moment conditions are :E[z(x) (y - x^\\\\mathrm T \\\\theta)] = 0 where is an instrument set of dimension (). The task is to choose to minimize the asymptotic variance of the resulting GMM estimator. If the data are iid, the asymptotic variance of the GMM estimator is :(E[x z^\\\\mathrm T]^\\\\mathrm T E[\\\\sigma^2(x) z z^\\\\mathrm T]^{-1} E[z x^\\\\mathrm T])^{-1} where \\\\sigma^2(x) \\\\equiv E[u^2 \\\\mid x]. The optimal instruments are given by :z^*(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sigma^2(x)} which produces the asymptotic variance matrix :\\\\left( E \\\\left[ \\\\frac{x x^\\\\mathrm T}{\\\\sigma^2(x)} \\\\right] \\\\right)^{-1}. These are the optimal instruments because for any other , the matrix :\\\\left( E \\\\left[ \\\\frac{x x^\\\\mathrm T}{\\\\sigma^2(x)} \\\\right] \\\\right)^{-1} - (E[x z^\\\\mathrm T]^\\\\mathrm T E[\\\\sigma^2(x) z z^\\\\mathrm T]^{-1} E[z x^\\\\mathrm T])^{-1} is positive semidefinite. Given iid data (y_1, x_1), \\\\dots, (y_N, x_N), the GMM estimator corresponding to z^*(x) is :\\\\widetilde\\\\theta = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{x_i x_i^\\\\mathrm T}{\\\\sigma^2(x_i)} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{x_i y_i}{\\\\sigma^2(x_i)} which is the generalized least squares estimator.

His contributions, and the contributions of his partner and successor, Edmund Hartnack, were part of the early development of the microscope as a scientific tool on the European continent. == Birth and education == Georges Oberhaeuser was born in Ansbach, Bavaria, in 1798 to Michael Adam Oberhäuser (1755–1814), a master turner. The boy attended a university-preparatory school in Ansbach and then was apprenticed to a University of Würzburg machinist surnamed du Mouceau. After his apprenticeship, he emigrated to France, and in 1816 joined the workshop of Henri Gambey (1787–1847).Most references on Oberhaeuser's life and work are in German. Reviews and discussions of microscope technology were often restricted in geographic scope during his lifetime. The small drum microscope of Oberhaeuser. this example about 1855. == Microscope and optics workshop == Oberhaeuser's first commercial venture was during partnership with Bouquet und Achille Trécourt in 1822. Oberhaeuser produced one of his most successful early microscope designs for the student market. As research in cell biology and botany broadened, students needed a capable microscope more affordable than the complex expensive models available. The small drum microscope was the combination of a sturdy stand, based on earlier designs by Fraunhofer and Martin. Oberhaeuser often followed the lead of Giovanni Battista Amici in development of his optical designs, including his adoption of the short 7 inch body tube and Amici's early objective designs. The compound microscope was just being introduced to serious scientific use as the introduction of achromatic objective lenses made it superior to the simple microscope for research use. Several contemporary publications written for working research scientists and students compared the available microscopes as of their publication dates. Oberhaeuser's objective lenses were consistently judged to be very good. He adopted the system used by Amici of several lenses in fixed sequence where each lens served a purpose in correcting aberrations caused by the overall system. The lenses were not independently usable objectives. Several competitors continued to use the system described by J. J. Lister in his famous paper; stacked independent objectives. The path pioneered by Amici and Oberhaeuser proved more flexible and ultimately became the most common design used in higher magnification objectives. A modern comparison of a Dutch museum collection supports the contemporary evaluations. The later Oberhaeuser objectives show very good resolution even by modern standards. The iconic form of the Horseshoe foot design. This one by Oberhaeuser's successor Edmund Hartnack. Oberhaeuser continued to develop stands to suit the requirements of researchers and introduced the pattern which was to shape the image of the microscope for over a century in 1854; the Oberhaeuser horseshoe foot stand. == Retirement and a successor. Edmund Hartnack == Oberhaeuser appointed his nephew Edmund Hartnack a partner in the workshop in 1854 and technical director in 1860. Oberhaeuser eventually withdrew from the day-to-day business of the firm, naming Hartnack as his successor in 1864. By the late 1850s Oberhaeuser and Hartnack had already redesigned their objectives, again following the lead of Amici, to give larger usable apertures and higher resolution. The new series, including their water immersion objectives, would set the standard for excellence for several years.

Alongside Henry Jennings, James Carnegie, and Samuel Liddell, they took a pair of French vessels in early 1716 in the Bay of Hounds. They also had to chase down Benjamin Hornigold, who'd made off with one of the French ships shortly afterwards. This caused a dispute with French officials in the area, who protested that the English ships were effectively pirates. In Jamaica Ashworth's quartermaster Joseph Eels was arrested, and on the testimony of Eels and others – given in exchange for a promise of avoiding prosecution - the Mary was seized by the authorities in Jamaica in 1716 on suspicion of piracy. His brother Jasper and his partner Daniel Axtell were also arrested, having acted as fences for Ashworth's stolen goods. The ill-equipped local government declared that they had uncertain authority to deal with the situation: \\"what to do with these men, we know not as yett, not having a Commission … nor Admiral, Vice Admiral or a deputy\\". When a general amnesty was offered in 1718 to pirates who gave up their ways, Ashworth, Jennings, Hornigold, and over 200 others accepted. Ashworth next spent time ferrying ships and goods back and forth from South Carolina to Jamaica; lucky timing had him narrowly avoid an encounter with Blackbeard. Late that year, Ashworth accepted another privateering commission against the Spanish and French. He was still attacking ships on flimsy pretenses: a former pirate operating a sloop out of New Providence testified that Ashworth \\"pretended to take him for a Spaniard\\" because his ship Endeavour had formerly been a Spanish sloop. Ashworth was still privateering as of 1719 but there are few records of his activities beyond that point, though his brother Jasper Ashworth settled near Port Royal, married, and became a regional official. ==See also== *Woodes Rogers - Governor of the Bahamas who offered the 1718 general pardon to surrendering pirates. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:British pirates Category:18th- century pirates Category:British privateers Category:Caribbean pirates ","title":"Leigh Ashworth"},{"id":"54248751","text":"Guido Andreozzi and Andrés Molteni were the defending champions but only Andreozzi chose to defend his title, partnering Sergio Galdós.

This is in contrast to flow sampling, where the relationship of interest deals with duration or survival analysis. In stock sampling, rather than focusing on transitions within a certain time interval, we only have observations at a certain point in time. This can lead to both left and right censoring. Imposing the same model on data that have been generated under the two different sampling regimes can lead to research reaching fundamentally different conclusions if the joint distribution across the flow and stock samples differ sufficiently. Stock sampling essentially leads to a sample selection problem. This selection issue is akin to the truncated regression model where we face selection on the basis of a binary response variable, but the problem has been referred to as length-biased sampling in this specific context. Consider, for example, the figure below that plots some duration data. If a researcher would revert to stock sampling and only sample and survey individuals at the survey dates (i.e. the survey data, 12 months after the survey date, etc.), there is a high likelihood the short duration spells will be omitted from the sample, as some durations shorter than 12 months are necessarily omitted from the sample: Source: Cameron A. C. and P. K. Trivedi (2005): Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York. A number of methods to adjust for these sampling issues have been proposed. One can appropriately adjust the maximum likelihood estimation for censored flow data for the sample selection, or use nonparametric estimation methods for censored flow data for the sample selection, or use nonparametric estimation methods for censored data. == References == Category:Sampling (statistics) Category:Design of experiments Category:Actuarial science Category:Single-equation methods (econometrics) Category:Regression models Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics) Category:Medical statistics Category:Clinical trials Category:Epidemiology ","title":"Stock sampling"},{"id":"54248808","text":"Kap Verd Band or Kab Verd Band (Portuguese: Banda de Cabo Verde, English: Cape Verdean Bands) is a music history book published in 2006 by Cape Verdean journalist and investigator Carlos Filipe Gonçalves.

The nanoCLAMP scaffold is based on an IgG-like, thermostable carbohydrate binding module family 32 (CBM32) from a Clostridium perfringens hyaluronidase (Mu toxin). The shape of nanoCLAMPs approximates a cylinder of approximately 4 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, roughly the same size as a nanobody (). nanoCLAMPs to specific targets are generated by varying the amino acid sequences and sometimes the length of three solvent exposed, adjacent loops that connect the beta strands making up the beta-sandwich fold, conferring binding affinity and specificity for the target. ==Properties== nanoCLAMPs are the first antibody mimetics described to be polyol-responsive, meaning they release their targets upon exposure to a non-chaotropic salt and a polyol, such as propylene glycol. This property has been shown to be useful for purifying functional proteins and protein complexes by affinity purification. nanoCLAMPs are easily produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli, with typical yields in the range of 50 to 300 mg/L culture. Because nanoCLAMPs are devoid of cysteines, an engineered C-terminal cysteine can be used for site- directed conjugation of entities like fluorophores or resins using thiol- chemistry. ==Development and applications== nanoCLAMPs were developed in the laboratories of Nectagen, Inc. nanoCLAMP phage display libraries were constructed that variabilized 16 surface exposed amino acids in three loops with function diversities of approximately 109 variants. These libraries have been screened for binders to target proteins and peptides, typically yielding between 1 and 30 unique binders to the target. Purified nanoCLAMPs containing a single C-terminal cysteine can be easily conjugated to halo-acetyl activated agarose resins under native or denaturing conditions, and the resulting thioether bond renders the resins leach-proof. Targets can be purified to apparent homeogeneity in a single-step. The polyol-responsive nature of the resins allows the targets to be eluted with 0.75 M ammonium sulfate and 40% propylene glycol at pH 7.9, conditions which have been shown to preserve native structure and protein complexes. nanoCLAMPs have been produced that target green fluorescent protein (GFP), mCherry, SUMO (SMT3), NusA, avidin, NeutrAvidin, maltose-binding protein (MBP), thioredoxin 1, beta-galactosidase, SlyD, and others. Typical binding capacities of resins range from 1 to 4 mg/ml resin. Because nanoCLAMPs readily refold, nanoCLAMP resins can be regenerated multiple times using guanidinium chloride to clean the resin. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Nectagen, Inc., the developer Category:Antibody mimetics ","title":"NanoCLAMP"},{"id":"54248901","text":"Austroaeschna pinheyi is a species of Australian dragonfly in the family Telephlebiidae, known as an inland darner.

The game was released on July 12, 2017 on Microsoft Windows via Steam. Ports of the game were released on August 15, 2017 on macOS, December 12, 2017 for Linux and Nintendo Switch, and on April 30, 2019 for PlayStation 4. The game has been described as a spiritual successor to McMillen's Super Meat Boy. == Gameplay and synopsis == Gameplay screenshot of The End Is Nigh. The End Is Nigh is a platforming adventure game where the player controls Ash, a small black blob. The game's intro shows Ash live streaming a retro-styled version of the game with the same name, allowing the player to play through it. Upon the player's death, the game-within-a-game crashes, and Ash tries to salvage the cartridge by taking it out of the console and blowing on it, with no success. The next day, Ash writes a letter explaining his current situation and the state of the world, stating that there was an apocalypse, with himself being the only survivor. With his favorite game cartridge broken, Ash sets out into the world to make a friend, and re-populate the world. The game is divided into 600+ single-screen interconnected levels, forming 12+ chapters. The objective of the game is to clear the platforming challenges of each screen and proceed to the next, exploring the world and collecting items along the way. Collectable items include tumors, which unlock bonus levels and are used as lives in later chapters, and video game cartridges, which unlock retro levels. == Endings == In the \\"Acceptance\\" ending, Ash finds his friend, which is stuck to a large glowing orb. The orb starts to explode and Ash has to escape. When the explosion goes off, Ash accepts his fate and dies happily. In the \\"Nevermore\\" ending, Ash becomes a part of the world, joining the mother to live forever. It is also possible to beat The End is Nigh game cartridge in the intro. == Development and release == The End Is Nigh began development as the product of a game jam in December 2016. After a year of developing a platforming shooter game titled Øuroboros, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel decided to refocus the concept, as not much progress had been made on the game. While developing Øuroboros, McMillen and Glaiel would take small breaks to prototype other ideas, and in December 2016 both committed to do a full game jam to explore these concepts. Within the first week, they had developed a platformer with open-world and adventure game elements. McMillen described it as feeling \\"a bit like VVVVVV meets 1001 Spikes with a Spelunky control setup and it felt perfect.\\" McMillen and Glaiel continued to work on the game in secret for the next few months, and it was officially revealed and announced on June 7, 2017, only about a month before its planned release date. McMillen announced the game shortly before its release due to wanting to avoid the game becoming vaporware, as had been the case for some of his previously announced titles like Mew-Genics and Super Meat Boy: Forever (until it was taken over by another team and due for release in 2020). On the completed game, McMillen stated that The End Is Nigh is the largest game, level-wise, that he's worked on, and embodies aspects of every game that he's created. The game features voice acting by Rich Evans of RedLetterMedia and the game's music was composed by Ridiculon. McMillen later stated that he felt The End Is Nigh was a cathartic experience for him. Prior to its development, he had been working on The Binding of Issac: Rebirth and its expansions for several years, and had found the development to be an onus on his time, as well as having poor experiences with other developers. He had been considering leaving the game development market, which influenced some of the direction that The End Is Nigh took. He used the theme of perseverance as a core element of the game, helping him to resolve his own personal concerns, and as a result, McMillen felt The End is Nigh was his best work. == Reception == The game received generally favorable reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Patrick Klepek of Vice praised the game's challenging nature and its emphasis on exploration, while Zero Punctuation's Ben Croshaw noted that \\"I don't get a sense that there'll be any reward for putting myself through the trials\\", though later praised the game's design. == References  External links == * Category:2017 video games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Platform games Category:Indie video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Game jam video games Category:Adventure games ","title":"The End Is Nigh (video game)"},{"id":"54248932","text":"The 1921 Villanova Wildcats football team represented the Villanova University during the 1921 college football season.

She is the author of two novels, The Doctor and The Quick, and a collection of oral history from a central European city entitled Rue Centrale. In 2017 she published Pale Rider, an account of the 1918 flu pandemic, published by Jonathan Cape who acquired the global rights in an auction in 2015. Spinney indicates that the global pandemic was the biggest disaster of the 20th century, exceeding the death tolls of both World War I (17 million) and World War II (60 million dead). Its full scope has only been recognized in the 21st century as researchers have examined old records, determining that 1 in 3 people became ill and between 1 in 10 and 1 in 5 died. At the time illiteracy was common, germ theory relatively new, antibiotics had not been discovered, and long-distance communication was often limited. The first clearly identified and documented case was Albert Gitchell, a U.S. Army cook who reported in sick at Camp Funston in Kansas on 4 March 1918. Three distinct waves of disease outbreak occurred worldwide: in spring 1918, in late summer and autumn, and from later winter 1918 to early 1919. Between the first and second waves, the virus mutated and became more deadly in humans. The death toll in countries like China and India was particularly poorly documented. Spinney vividly describes conditions from all over the globe, from Rio de Janeiro to Russia. Spinney's most recent book-length work is an english translation of Swiss writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz's novel Derborence. In 2019 she spent two months as a journalist-in-residence at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany.

On September 28, 2017, NBC renewed the series for a second season, which aired from June 14 to July 12, 2018. On December 21, 2018, NBC canceled the series after two seasons. In 2018, Netflix acquired exclusive distribution of Marlon in many regions around the world, including the United Kingdom. Outside of the US, Marlon is advertised as a \\"Netflix Original\\". ==Premise== Despite their inability to coexist, divorced couple Marlon Wayne and his ex-wife Ashley try to stay friends for the sake of their two children, Marley and Zack. The premise of the show is loosely based on star Marlon Wayans' own life.\\"NBC-WNBC, NBC-WVIT, 9:00 p.m. Marlon\\". Record-Journal (Meriden, Connecticut). August 23, 2017. ==Cast and characters== *Marlon Wayans as Marlon Wayne – A loving but often inappropriate divorced father of two, Marlon often acts the most childish of the house and is therefore the more youth-relatable parent. The typical clingy ex, Marlon is always doing things out of the ordinary. Deep down he loves his family, he just has an odd way of showing it. *Essence Atkins as Ashley Wayne – Always keeping things calm in the house, Ashley is usually the peacemaker in the family and has to get things back to normal after Marlon hypes things up. Ashley is trying to move on from the divorce but things are complicated. *Notlim Taylor as Marley Wayne – Marley is the calm one in the family. She is very intelligent and responsible, and rarely ever gets in trouble. She's a quick-thinker and a role-model. *Amir O'Neil as Zack Wayne – Zack is the troublesome kid in the family and always makes a mess in the house. He doesn't really care about feelings or emotions because he is usually busy being silly and air-headed. *Bresha Webb as Yvette – Ashley's best friend who is often busy trying to find the right guy. Yvette is a God-loving woman with a packed past, of which Marlon always tries his best to make fun. She has a petty feud with him and they're always going back and forth. *Diallo Riddle as Stevie Noggle – Stevie took it upon himself to shack up in Marlon's apartment, much to Marlon's annoyance. Despite being well-educated, he is perpetually unemployed. He considers himself Marlon's best friend, and even though Marlon disagrees with this, Stevie is arguably his only friend. Stevie has an unrequited crush on Yvette, that the latter will sometimes use to her advantage such as getting free stuff or using Stevie to make other men jealous. Needless to say, it always backfires on the both of them. ==Episodes== Season 1 (2017) Season 2 (2018) ==Reception== Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 50% approval rating with an average rating of 5.3/10 based on 10 reviews.

From 1863 to 1866, he studied under Arnold Böcklin, Ferdinand Pauwels and Alexander Michelis at the Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School. After a brief return to Hamburg in 1869, prompted by his father's illness, he went to Berlin for further studies then, in 1871, went back to Hamburg, where he took up permanent residence. After his father's death he closed the shop and devoted himself entirely to painting. He quickly found the themes for his works; mainly oil paintings or watercolors. He portrayed the German forest, the landscape of the Lower Elbe and the old harbor neighborhood of Hamburg and was constantly on the road with a sketch pad or easel. In 1869 the ' had been his first customer, and continued to buy his works throughout the 1870s. He was represented in all the major exhibitions, including Hamburg and Hanover, and later in Berlin, Dresden and Munich. He also exhibited in Vienna and London. In later years, he became increasingly interested in portrait painting. Study trips took him to Norway.

He is best known for his literary activities, as an acquaintance of Pliny the Younger and a patron of the poet Martial. He was appointed suffect consul in the nundinium of July to August 97 with Sextus Hermentidius Campanus as his colleague.Fausto Zevi, \\"I consoli del 97 d. Cr. in due framenti gia' editi dei Fasti Ostienses\\", Listy filologické / Folia philologica, 96 (1973), pp. 125–137 Martial dedicated three of the books of his epigrams to Apollinaris: the fourth, seventh, and eleventh.Martial IV.86, VII.26, XI.15 == Life == The family origins of Apollinaris lie in Vercellae in Northwestern Italy. Thanks to the ingenuous identification of Apollinaris with the subject of a headless inscription found in Asia Minor by Werner Eck, we know most of the earliest steps of his cursus honorum.Eck, \\"Epigraphische Untersuchungen zu Konsuln und Senatoren des 1.-3. Jh. N. Chr.\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 37 (1980), p. 56 n. 86 Apollinaris' first recorded republican magistracy was quaestor, which was followed by plebeian tribune, and praetor. Then he was appointed one of the nine curatores viarum, or curator of the public roads, in Italy. This was followed by two terms of service as legatus or military commander, first of the Legio XVI Flavia Firma, then of Legio VI Ferrata which was stationed in Syria. Eck suspects his command of Legio VI was during the governorship of Publius Valerius Patruinus (AD 87-91), for Patruinus was the father of Apollinaris' wife, Valeria Vetilla. After concluding his command of Legio VI Ferrata, Apollinaris returned to Rome to serve as prefect of the aerarium militare for three years. At this point we know of his career from other sources. It has been long known that Apollinaris was governor of Lycia et Pamphylia from 93 to 96.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 321-325 An inscription recovered from Xanthos by A. Ballard records his name and the other members of his family, who are assumed to have been living in Lycia with him.Balland, Fouilles de Xanthos, VII: Inscriptions d'époque impériale du Létôon, (Paris, 1981), p. 103; cited in L'Année épigraphique, 1981, 826 After his return from Lycia, Apollinaris returned to Rome. It is at this time that we have one of our earliest glimpses of him. In a letter to Quadratus (Epistulae, IX.13), Pliny recalls his prosecution after the assassination of Domitian of the delator or informer Publicius Certus. One of the five senators who had spoken against this prosecution was Apollinaris; Pliny's description of him as \\"consul designate\\" firmly places it in this period. Despite Apollinaris' speech, Pliny was able to convince the senate to approve the prosecution. Although the emperor Nerva failed to act on the motion to prosecute, Certus was passed over in consideration for a consulship, and in any event fell ill and died soon afterwards. Our next glimpse of Apollinaris is from one of Martial's poems (10.12), addressed to him after stepping down as consul.So Rouurd P. Nanta dates this poem. (Poetry for Patrons: Literary Communication in the Age of Domitian (Brill, 2002), pp. 160f) Apparently the disagreement over Publicius Certus was not sharp enough to poison the friendship between Apollinaris and Pliny, for around the time of his consulate Pliny wrote to him in support of Sextius Erucius' candidacy for plebeian tribune.Pliny, Epistulae, II.9 Unfortunately, this is the last time we can assign a date to any mention of his activities. Pliny addressed one more letter to Apollinaris. Apparently Pliny wrote to him about taking a vacation on his estate in Tuscany, and Apollinaris replied to this news with alarm for Pliny's health. The existing letter is a reply to explain his estate is located in a desirable region of Etruria, and includes an extensive description of Pliny's villa at Tifernum (the modern Città di Castello).Pliny, Epistulae, V.6 In this letter, Pliny makes a pointed allusion to the location of his three rural estates, since we know through one of Martial's poems Apollinaris owned villas in several more fashionable locations that include Tusculum, Algidus, Praeneste, and Antium.Martial X.30 == Family == Apollinaris' family is better documented than those of most of his contemporaries. We know the name of his wife, Valeria Vetilla, the daughter of Publius Valerius Patruinus, suffect consul in the year 82. Two of their children are attested by inscriptions on a series of statues found in Xanthos; a third is surmised by Ronald Syme: Together they had at least three children: * Domitius Patruinus, whose daughter Domitia Vetilla married Lucius Roscius Paculus, suffect consul in 136. * Domitius Seneca, who married Claudia Decmina; their son Domitius Seneca was governor of Lycia et Pamphylia c. 136 * Domitia Vettilla, a daughter or possibly grand-daughter;Syme, \\"People in Pliny\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 58 (1968), p. 147 she was the second wife of Lucius Neratius Marcellus, suffect consul in 95 and ordinary consul in 129. Their marriage allied the family with the more powerful gens Neratia. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Roman governors of Lycia et Pamphylia Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Apollinaris, Lucius Domitius ","title":"Lucius Domitius Apollinaris"},{"id":"54249098","text":"Tommy Vlahopoulos (born December 12, 1979) is an American film producer.

Endocrowns are formed from a monoblock containing the coronal portion invaded in the apical projection that fills the pulp chamber space, and possibly the root canal entrances; they have the advantage of removing lower amounts of sound tissue compared to other techniques, and with much lower chair time needed. They are luted to the tooth structure by an adhesive material. The ceramic can be milled using computer- aided techniques or molded under pressure. Endocrowns can be an alternative to conventional crown restorations. == History and classical approach == It was Bindl and Mörmann who named this restorative procedure “endocrown” in 1999 defining it as a total porcelain crown fixed to a depulped posterior tooth, which is anchored to the internal portion of the pulp chamber and to the cavity margins, thus obtaining macromechanical retention (provided by the pulpal walls) for restoring endodontically treated teeth. The classical approach is to build up the tooth with a post and core, which have physical properties close to those of natural dentin, utilizing adhesive procedures and placement of full-coverage crowns with a sufficient ferrule, but it was found that excessive amount of teeth removal may cause fracture to the teeth. The literature suggests that endocrowns may perform similarly or better than the conventional treatments using intraradicular posts, direct composite resin or inlay/onlay restorations. == Indications and contraindications == Endocrowns are especially indicated in cases of molar teeth with short, or fragile roots. They may also be used in situations of excessive loss of coronal dental tissue. Reinforced, acid etchable dental ceramics have been the materials of choice for the fabrication of endocrowns, because they guarantee the mechanical strength needed to withstand the forces exerted on the tooth, as well as the bond strength of the restoration to the cavity walls. Using endocrowns for premolars is contraindicated as the tooth is more likely to be subjected to lateral forces during mastication than molars because of the steep cuspal incline. Therefore, premolars are prone to fracture after restoration. == Clinical trials and research == A systemic review and meta- analysis showed a success rate of endocrowns varying from 94 to 100%. Analysis in posterior and anterior teeth demonstrated that endocrowns had higher fracture strength than conventional treatments. Another study showed that an endodontic crown preparation appeared acceptable for molar crowns but inadequate for premolar crowns. The longest duration of survival is for molar endocrowns is a 5-year clinical follow-up period, with success rate of 87.1%. Root fracture is a very possible finding in premolar and anterior teeth. ==References== Category:Restorative dentistry Category:Prosthodontology ","title":"Endodontic crown"},{"id":"54249413","text":"Ezzat El Alaili () (born 15 September 1934 in Cairo) is an Egyptian actor who has starred in multiple films.

He attended Garden City High School. == Racing career == He drove the Bob Ford G/Stock Ford Fairlane in 1963, with engine preparation by Ernie MacEwan (who worked at the Ford Experimental Vehicle Garage). There was synergy between Nash, MacEwan, and the Fairlane, including the addition of ladder bars and a new intake manifold, and Nash achieved significant success, moving up to C/Gas. His success got him a ride in the 1964 factory 289 Mercury Comet, one of only fifteen 289-powered Comets built that year. It was dubbed The Cyclone when the car moved up to B/FX (B/Factory Experimental). After turning in a number of wins, Nash moved up again, to A/FX, a precursor to Funny Car.McClurg, Bob. \\"50 Years of Funny Cars: Part 2\\" in Drag Racer, November 2016, pp. 35–50. It was for A/FX Nash built the Bronco Buster, based on a 1966 Ford Bronco. The 289 was kept mostly stock, but it propelled the truck to passes in the high 8s; with a supercharger, later in 1966, Nash turned in passes in the 8.30 second range with speeds around , and only difficulties with keeping the truck running in a straight line prevented even lower e.t.s Nash and Bronco Buster were popular on the match racing circuit, until NHRA banned aluminum chassis (in favor of steel) and Jeep and pickup bodies, following the success of Gene Conway in the hemi Jeep Destroyer,McClurg, Bob. \\"50 Years of Funny Cars: Part 2\\" in Drag Racer, November 2016, p.40 caption. in 1967. == After racing == When Nash retired from drag racing, he opened Doug Nash Equipment & Engineering. At the beginning he developed engine prototypes for major U.S. carmakers. Later, he designed and manufactured a series of four- and five-speed racing transmissions, known for straight-cut spur gears and crash shifts, and for which he is now best known. These were so successful, he was approached by Chevrolet to provide his \\"4+3\\" transmission—a four-speed manual with automatic overdrive on the top with three gears—on the 1984 through 1988 Corvettes. He also had an interest in antique toy trains. == Family == Nash was married to Lesli Diane.

A. Rea Taylor, A. Ashton & Tabletop Games July 1986. These rules simulates modern warfare between forces of up to Corps or Army Level in any future war on the Central Front in Europe. The basic elements (units) in the game are tank and mechanised infantry platoons, infantry companies, and artillery batteries. All aspects of modern warfare are covered including helicopters, air power, NBC, logistics and electronics. A Divisional Level assault can easily be played on a standard 8' x 6' table, whilst a heliborne assault on a vital bridge can be played on a 2' x 2' table. Thus allowing several campaign battles to take place in one evening. ==Overview== Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton originally intended that Corps Commander would be the start of a family of rules, each covering a period and location, as can be seen by the quote from the Rules. Operational Manoeuvre Group was the first of the Corps Commander / Korps Commander publications. Bruce Rea Taylor died three years after the publication of these rules (1989), at the age of 40. I was unable to find any evidence Andy Ashton made any plans to continue this project. Bruce Rea Taylor gives a special mention to the Wallasey Wargames Club in the Introduction of the Korps Commander Rules. he used wargaming clubs as a method to play test his rules system. The primary significance of these rules was it was one of the first game systems which used a scale of 1-2 base(s) per company. The reason why a scale of 1 base per company was not used was to allow for small formations, such as 1-2 SP-AA weapons allocated to a HQ and to ensure the record keeping for the standard company sized formations was not too difficult. However, apart from this, the rules attempted to use a 1 Base = 1 company scale, which allowed players to command one, or more, divisions. Compared with the most common rules used in this period, this was unusual. In practice the detail and complexity of the rules precluded any possibility of playing a corps level game within a reasonable time frame. Most games would typically field 50 bases, or elements, per side. This represents a force of 25 companies per side. A game of this size which consisted of 12 game-turns, or one game day duration, could be completed within a 4-8 hour period. ==History== Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton published Corps Commander in July 1986. This used the same game system as Korps Commander and can be considered the first of the Corps/Korps Commander system publications. In October 1986 \\"Digest #3, Engineering Equipment Data, Engineering Lists, Engineering Scenarios\\" was published, this contained additional material for Corps Commander. In June 1988 \\"Corps Commander: By Air & Sea\\" was published, containing yet more supporting material for Corps Commander. The final publication in this family was in August 1988 when \\"Korps Commander\\" was published. While Bruce Rea Taylor published a number of additional books after August 1988, they were all dated after his death on the 3rd of March 1989. No additional Corp/Korps Commander books were published after August 1988. These post August 1988 publications are listed here: * Digest #4, Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules, Apr 1989 (For Challenger II) * Digest #5, Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules, June 1989 (For Challenger II) There is strong evidence Bruce Rea Taylor built on his earlier rules, Challenger and Firefly, when developing the Corp/Korps Commander Rules. This is especially evident in the equipment specification. ==Development== Corps Commander was published in July 1986. Shortly after this an errata sheet was published which was printed on the inside cover of the rules. Digest #3, published in Oct 1986, and contained some additional supporting information, but no changes to the rules. The Air & Sea supplement, printed in June 1988, contained a large number of additional rules, as well as some minor changes to the base rules. The publishing of Korps Commander, in August 1988, contained a large number of changes to the rules. A number of these were as a result of the period, such as the game scale, however a number represents corrections to the original Corps Commander rules. A number of unusual tactics were available to players of the original Corps Commander rules, which Korps Commander eliminated. In additional to this a number of other changes were implemented which improved the accuracy of the rules. These included; *Rocket artillery could affect more than a single element. * A single forward observer could not bring down an unlimited number of fire support missions in a single game-turn. * The fire effects of a fire combat could affect future fire combats in the same phase, thus an element could, in a limited manner, react to fire before subsequent fire was directed against it. * Elements in concentrated mode could not take advantage of fortification. * MMG indirect fire was added. * Addition of battalion level command, especially for fire support purposes. * Troops mounted in soft transports could no longer conduct close combat more effectively than if dismounted. * The Lorry was added, this was a truck not designed for troops to fight from or around. It represent a large vehicle which was difficult to dismount from and unwise to fight from. * Some additional rules around orders, such as attack, defend, manoeuvre and retreat. * Addition moral modifiers were added to make it harder for element to fight until they were eliminated. * Building fortifications took a lot longer. * Reconnaissance missions could be intercepted by enemy CAP. * Observation missions used standard observation rules to locate targets. It is likely that these changes were intended to be added to corps commander in a possible future publication, however this never occurred. A set of training videos have been posted on utube which incorporate these changes to the original corps commander rules. ==Scale== Ground Scale (1/300 scale) : Each centimetre represents 100 metres (1:10000) Game-Turn Scale : Each daylight Turn represents 1 hour of actual time. Each night Turn represents 2 hour of actual time. Base/Stand Scale - Each base represents a company, part of a company or a platoon. A Base can have a maximum of 9 Strength points. (If there are more than 9 vehicles or Gun's in a Company, the Company is split into two bases, each of which are similar in strength. This system allows a base to also represent a platoon, such as a support platoon attached to a Headquarters company.) * Vehicle Scale : Each AFV Strength point represents 1 AFV. * Artillery Scale : Each Artillery Strength point represents 1 weapon. * Infantry Scale : Each Infantry Strength Point represents approximately 10 combat troops, or 1 heavy weapon. * Aircraft Scale : Each Aircraft Strength Points represents 1 aircraft. Base Size (1/300 scale) - A Base which has 1 to 5 strength points has a size of 20mm by 30mm. A Base with more than 5 strength points has a size of 30mm by 30mm. For comparison purposes the later Korps Commander used a Ground scale of 5 cm = 1 km (1:5000) and a Daylight Game Turn = 1/2 hour. Lightning War - Red Storm uses a base size of 30 cm x 30 cm, a ground scale of 1 cm = 100, (1:10000), a Daylight Game Turn = 2 hours. Panzer Korps, while designed for 15mm/20mm, uses a Ground Scale of 1 cm = 50m (1:5000) for 1/300 scale. ==Significance== The primary significance of these rules is the use of a 1 Company = 1-2 Base(s) scale. In 1986/1988 this was unusual. Examples of other similar scaled rules are, Great Battles of WWII Vol. 1 (1995), Panzer Korps (2004). and Lightning War - Red Storm (2001-2008). * 1973: Wargame Rules Armour & Infantry 1925 to 1950 v1 Squad / Vehicle * 1974: Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare 1950 to 1985 v1 Squad / Vehicle * 1975: Wargame Rules Armour & Infantry 1925 to 1950 v2 Squad / Vehicle * 1978: Cambrai to Sinai Squad / Vehicle * 1978: Combat Commander 1973-1983 v1 Squad / Vehicle * 1979: Combat Commander 1973-1983 v2 Squad / Vehicle * 1979: Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare 1950 to 1985 v2 Squad / Vehicle * 1980: Combat Commander 1973-1983 v3 Squad / Vehicle * 1983: Challenger Squad / Vehicle * 1983: Combined Arms - Rules for WWII inf-Arm Actions Squad / Vehicle * 1986: Corps Commander Coy / Platoon * * 1987: Firefly Squad / Vehicle * 1988: Korps Commander Coy / Platoon * * 1988: Combined Arms - Modern Miniature Wargaming Platoon * The most common scale in the late 80's was 1 Vehicle = 1 Base, later rules used scales of 1 Platoon = 1 Base. The primary issue with the increase of the scale was related to the combat specifications of a base. When a base represents a common vehicle or gun, its speed and combat capabilities are based on the figure itself. When a base represents a mix of vehicles or guns, its speed and combat capabilities may differ from the figure on the base. Example : A Base which contains 5 x Pz I and 2 x Pz II compared with another base which contains 5 x Pz I and 2 x Pz III. Both would be represented by a Pz I, but would differ in combat capabilities. Players may be required to keep track of the combat capabilities of individual bases by the use of separate written records, or a value printed on the base. In this case the use of a Board-Game system may be preferable. Corps/Korps Commander resolved this issue by giving each a Base a value, representing the number of common vehicles or guns. When there were different vehicles or guns in a company, the company would be represented by more than 1 base. Each Base would contain the same vehicle/guns and its value would be the number of vehicle/gun in each base. ==See also== *Miniature wargaming ==References== Category:Miniature wargames Category:Scale modeling Category:Playscale miniaturism ","title":"Corps Commander"},{"id":"54249539","text":"Network is a play by Lee Hall, adapted from the 1976 film of the same name which had an Academy Award-winning screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky and was directed by Sidney Lumet. == Production history == Bryan Cranston as Howard Beale during the play in the National Theatre production.

Nogueira (2017), p.4 His family was linked, on his father side, to Manuel Inácio Martins Pamplona Corte Real, the 1st Count of Subserra. Medic A proficient scholar in medicine, the young Ramos completed his preparatory studies in Praia, before joining the Escola Médico-Cirúgica de Lisboa (\\"Lisbon Medical-Surgical School\\") where he became a surgeon, obtaining recognition and praise for his competency. In 1891, as a 5th year student, Alexandre Ramos was the first to diagnose a case of paroxysmal hemoglobinuria in Portugal, a rare form of Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which he later studied as part of his licentiate thesis (oriented by Professor José Curry da Câmara Cabral, that was published in 1895). Following his studies, he concentrated on treating the sick, in addition to studying plague, in order prevent its spread, where his exhaustive studies put his life at risk. Eventually, Ramos became a doctor in the municipal hospital of Praia da Vitoria. During an outbreak of the infectious bubonic plague (spreading from house-to-house on the island), he worked with colleague António Joaquim de Sousa Júnior to treat patients and discovered solutions to reduce the propagation of the infection. For his work, professors Fernand Widal and Francisco Pulido Valente, recognized him for his work as a clinical scientist and helping in the treatment of the sick. Politician At 35 years of age, Alexandre Ramos entered the political arena, leading the Partido Regenerador in Praia da Vitória, and then island-wide, where he obtained several electoral majorities. He, later, switched parties joining the Partido Progressista following the fall of the monarchy (5 October 1910), assuming the leadership of the Partido da União Republicana of Manuel de Brito Camacho, where he was able to juggle both a professional and political career. For his work, he was made Knight in the Order of St. James of the Sword (on 22 July 1901), and appointed sub-legate for health in Praia da Vitória, where he continued to serve the community in a modest, humble clinic. Along with Manuel António Lino and Maria Teodora Pimetal, Ramos was awarded for his dedication and zeal in the fight against the plague, until 31 December 1909.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.304 For a few months in 1925, he was appointed as the Civil Governor of the Autonomous District of Angra do Heroísmo. Later life Alexandre Ramos married Hermínia (or Armínia) Amélia Moniz da Maia, and had five children. He died of a heart attack on 4 February 1933, at home, along Rua de São João in Angra do Heroísmo. Accounts indicate that his last words were: :...if you believe in resurrection of man, there you will find us. A medic who believed in service and charity, rarely interested in the privilege of class and society, he died a pauper.

It was screened at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2001 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival. ==Plot== In an unspecified Eastern European country, soldiers round up the inhabitants of a village. Ten year old Zioig (Javor Loznica) is separated from his mother Ankica (Gina McKee). While being transported in a truck, Ziog's father (Mikulás Kren) tells his son that he is a man now and that grown men don't cry. The soldiers kill the men but Zioig manages to escape. Meanwhile in the capital city, a former Interior Ministry official and Communist party member named Ludovic (Sam Neill) works at a zoo. He receives a letter from his estranged daughter Anna in Paris who wants to reconcile with her father. With the city under siege, Ludovic volunteers to help the Indian veterinary (Om Puri) to look after the animals until they can safely evacuate them. Due to scarce supplies, they are forced to put the animals on rations. Elsewhere, the orphaned Zioig is picked up by a truck carrying United Nations peacekeepers. During the journey, he jumps out of the truck while the peacekeepers are asleep and steals two boxes of supplies. Back in the capital city, Ludovic encounters the militia leader Dragov (Ulrich Thomsen) at a checkpoint. Despite lacking identity papers, Dragov lets him through because they are of the same race. Ludovic moves into the zoo and helps the veterinary to look after the animals. Ludovic develops an attachment to a female gibbon named \\"Luisa.\\" While visiting the wolves' pen, Ludovic encounters the orphaned Zioig and tells the boy to leave. Amidst the fighting, Ludovic befriends the Vet while drinking. The Vet tells Ludovic that good men do the right thing in bad times. The following morning, Dragov and his militia visit the zoo and arrests the Vet because he is of a different race. When Ludovic protests, Dragov replies that they will let him go if he is innocent. Ludovic is forced to look after the animals alone. The following morning, Ludovic buries a dead man he finds strung up outside. Later, Zioig returns and forces his way into Ludovic's cabin with a gun. When the boy faints, Ludovic takes pity on him and tends to the boy's leg wound with antibiotics. After feeding Zioig, Ludovic tells him that he has to leave the next day because his presence would endanger him. Zioig complies but later returns with a woman, who identifies herself as Zioig’s mother Ankica. Taking pity on them, Ludovic decides to allow Zioig and his mother to stay. After a blood-stained Zioig returns with cigarettes taken from a man he purportedly found dead, Ankica confides in Ludovic that she is losing touch with her son. While at the zoo’s butchery, Ankica recounts her experiences in a prison camp where she was raped by a guard who used to be her neighbor. Ankica also begs Ludovic to be kind to her son in order to help him. While Ludovic spends time with Zioig, Ankica reads through Ludovic's diaries. When Dragov and his militia return to seize the farm animals for food, Ludovic hides Ankica inside a barn. While Dragov and one of his men Slavko (Srdjan Simeonovich) search the barn, Ludovic distracts them by giving them a lion cub as a mascot. After the militiamen leave, Ankica kisses Ludovic out of gratitude. Ludovic comforts the distraught Zioig, who is troubled by the suffering zoo animals. When Ludovic discovers that Ankica has been reading through his diaries, he angrily orders them to leave. Zioig storms out in a fit of rage. Ludovic and Ankica eventually discover that her son has gunned down the militiaman Slavko. Ankica searches for her son but he avoids her. Returning to the cabin, Ankica and Ludovic reconcile and develop feelings for each other. The following morning, Ludovic feeds the body of the militiaman to a lion. That night, the zoo's monkey house is hit by artillery. Ludovic tries to rescue the monkeys but they succumb to the flames, smoke, and trauma. After some argument, Ankica convinces Ludovic to leave the zoo with her and her son. Later, Ludovic and Ankica comfort Zioig as he mourns over a wolf killed during the bombardment. Mother and son reconcile while Ludovic imparts fatherly advice to Zioig that grown men do cry. The following morning, Ludovic farewells the animals and prepares to leave the zoo with Zioig and Ankica. However, Ankica is killed by one of Dragov’s snipers. Ludovic tends to her while Dragov and his militia drive away from the city. As UN peacekeepers enter the city and evacuate the animals, Ludovic and Zioig bury Ankica. They then depart the zoo with the orphaned wolf cub. ==Cast== *Sam Neill as Ludovic *Gina McKee as Ankica *Ulrich Thomsen as Dragov *Om Puri as the Vet *Marek Vašut as Yeltsov *Javor Loznica as Zioig *Srdjan Simeonovich as Slavko *Arnost Proschek as Dusan *Mikulás Kren as Father *Tomás Valík as Soldier 1 *Stanislav Hybler as Soldier 2 *Hana Pastejríková as Woman at Window *Drahomíra Fialková as Neighbor Woman *Ilja Racek as Stanislaw *Rudolf Jelínek as Zoo Official *Ivo Niederle as Zoo Worker 1 *Milan Krouzil as Zoo Worker 2 *Jan Bernasek as Zoo Worker 3 *Josef Nedorost as Zoo Worker 4 *Jakob Schwarz as UN Driver *Noel le Bon as UN Mate *Colin Stuart as UN Soldier *Roman Fara as Dargov's Sharpshooter *Filip Truhlar as Newspaper boy *Susan Caskie as TV Reporter 1 *Rianne Kooiman as TV Reporter 2 ==Production== The Zookeeper was filmed at several locations in the Czech Republic including Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav, Doksany, the town of Milovice in the Nymburk District, and Prague. ==Critical reception== The Variety reviewer Robert Koehler praised Ralph Ziman and Matthew Bishop's for exploring Sam Neill's character Ludovic. Koehler also praised Neill's portrayal of Ludvoic, whom he described as a \\"man who has emotionally shut down but can’t stop the world from marching back in.\\" Despite commending Piotr Kukla's lensing and Ziman's juxtaposition of explosions in the zoo scenes, Koehler criticized Nikolaj Egelund's score as a poor imitation of Lisa Gerrard's signature vocal music.

Since the presidency of Gerald Ford it has remained one of the few constant features in the office, throughout several renovations. ==Features== The clock features \\"Mahogany crotch and Satinwood veneers\\", a \\"double lunette inlay\\", and a movement likely made by James Doull of Charlestown, Massachusetts. According to a memo prepared for First Lady Betty Ford in 1975, the previous First Lady Patricia Nixon \\"... was partially gifted (and partially purchased) the 'wonderful collection of very beautiful and rather feminine American furniture' by the Seymours from Boston's Vernon Stoneman in 1972.\\" Since installation in the Oval Office, it has been at the room's northeast corner (between the visiting guests' door from the Personal Secretary's office and the portal to the West Colonnade). Immigrants from England, the Seymours (father and son) are considered master cabinetmakers in the federal style. They perfected their craft in New England during \\"one of the most pivotal chapters in American history\\" to create \\"truly iconic pieces of American furniture\\". Its commercial value has been estimated at $100,000. An almost identical Seymour clock of the same period and materials is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == Historical appearances == Prior to the Seymour clock, another had preceded it in the Oval Office's northeast corner during the Lyndon B. Johnson and early Richard Nixon administrations, from 1965 – 1969. All 85 clocks in the White House (including the 12 longcase clocks), were maintained and wound by John Muffler the White House's chief electrician and longest-serving employee. The chimes on all White House clocks have all been disabled since an order by Harry S. Truman, due to the difficulty of keeping them all synchronized. Jimmy Carter said that, during the last stages of the Iran hostage crisis negotiations when he spent forty- eight hours continuously in the Oval Office, \\"No matter who was with me, we watched the big grandfather clock by the door.\\" Due to its location, the clock has appeared in the background of many photographs of successive American Presidents receiving world leaders and during meetings in the Oval Office: File:President Ford meets with Kissinger, Weyand, and Martin - NARA - 186794.jpgGerald Ford and Henry Kissinger (1975) File:Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski meet in the Oval Office with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese... - NARA - 183220.tifJimmy Carter and Deng Xiaoping (1979) File:Reagan’s meeting with Oleg Gordievsky in the Oval Office (11).jpgRonald Reagan and Oleg Gordievsky (1987) File:Bush-library-tamu-oval- office-985.jpgGeorge H.

The clock was mentioned specifically by the former FBI director James Comey, in his written statement to Congress, published the day before his testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding his being dismissed by President Donald Trump. This very specific and repeated mention of the clock raised increased interest in the clock's own history and caused a minor sensation on social media. ==See also== Similar Seymour clock in the Metropolitan Museum of Art * Resolute desk == References == The prior longcase clock in the Oval Office, behind Lynda Bird Johnson and Lyndon Johnson (1967) ==External links== * Treasures of the White House: Seymour tall case clock – White House Historical Association Category:Clocks in the United States Category:Furnishings of the White House Category:Longcase clocks Category:Individual clocks ","title":"Oval Office grandfather clock"},{"id":"54249613","text":"During the 1936–37 season Hibernian, a football club based in Edinburgh, came seventeenth out of 20 clubs in the Scottish First Division. ==Scottish First Division== { !

Numerous notable establishments around the world also held memorials.

Monuments held at the cities of Iran and country's embassies around the world with lit candles and leaving flowers and holding silences to remember the victims of the attacks. A huge number of people lit candles in City Theater of Tehran and a state funeral was held on 9 June 2017 at the parliament building, where one of the attacks took place, and later at University of Tehran. ==Background== Two terrorist attacks were simultaneously carried out on 7 June 2017 by seven terrorists belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) against the Iranian Parliament building and the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, both in Tehran, Iran, leaving 17 civilians dead and 43 wounded.

The three crew members and two passengers on board successfully evacuated after an emergency landing at Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, New York. After the evacuation, the DC-10 was consumed by fire. After an extensive investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board was unable to determine what caused the fire. Nevertheless, the Federal Aviation Administration made recommendations to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. ==Aircraft== The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10F, registered as N68055; it first flew in 1975, and after service with another operator joined the FedEx fleet in 1980. ==Crew== There were three crew members and two passengers on Flight 1406. The Captain was a 47-year-old male, with 12,344 flight hours, the First Officer was a 41-year- old male, with 6,535 flight hours and the Flight Engineer was a 45-year-old male, with 3,704 flight hours. Also on board were two FedEx employees sitting in jumpseats. ==Flight== Flight 1406 departed from Memphis International Airport at 3:42am, en route to Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) of 7:42am. At 5:42am, Flight 1406 was cruising at above the state of New York when the Cabin Smoke Fire Alarm sounded in the cockpit. Smoke detectors for several zones of the aircraft's main deck cargo compartment alerted the pilots of suspected smoke, prompting the crew members and passengers to don their smoke masks. Aircraft systems began to fail and the crew also noticed that smoke was entering the cockpit. The crew informed Boston Air Traffic Control (ATC) about the fire situation; ATC suggested that Flight 1406 could make an emergency landing at Albany County Airport, ahead, or to land at Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, behind. The crew decided to land at Stewart. At 5:49am the aircraft was on approach to Stewart International Airport, where airport fire services prepared for the DC-10 to land on Runway 27. The aircraft successfully landed at the airport at 5:54am and turned onto a taxiway, where it came to a stop for the fire services to engage. The crew and the employees tried to evacuate the aircraft, but the doors and cockpit windows could not be opened because the fuselage was still pressurized. The captain then de- pressurized the aircraft and all occupants then exited safely; the flight crew through a cockpit window and the passengers through one of the forward fuselage cabin doors. The fire crews found the cargo prevented them from accessing the source of the smoke from inside the cabin and forty minutes after the aircraft landed the fire burned through the fuselage skin; the fire was extinguished four hours after the aircraft landed. All five people on board survived, though two members of the flight crew received minor injuries. ==Investigation== Because the fire damage was extensive, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation was unable to find a source of ignition. On 22 July 1998, the NTSB released its report, concluding, \\"the probable cause of this accident was an in-flight cargo fire of undetermined origin\\". == References == Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in New York (state) Category:Aircraft fires Category:Accidents and incidents involving cargo aircraft Category:Airliner accidents and incidents with an unknown cause Category:Accidents and incidents involving the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Category:September 1996 events in the United States Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1996 Category:1996 in New York (state) Category:New Windsor, New York Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by in-flight fires ","title":"FedEx Flight 1406"},{"id":"54249844","text":"Eugene G.

Being only 18 at the time, it was no surprise local power-house FC Dinamo Tbilisi brought him at the end of the season.Davit Volkovi at Soccerway Initially, he played mostly for the second team which was competing in second level, the Pirveli Liga. By the end of his second year at reserves team, he was incorporated to the first team in the second half of the 2014–15 season. He started the 2015–16 Umaglesi Liga as part of the main team and made 3 appearances as contribution for Dinamo Tbilisi winning their 16th national title, however the challenge for a spot in the starting eleven was huge with Dinamo having numerous experienced national team strikers, so during winter-break, Volkovi accepted a loan to FC Chikhura Sachkhere where he will play the second half of the season and score 4 goals in 8 appearances helping them finish 4th and qualify to the UEFA Europa League. Instead of spending most time sitting in the glorious Dinamo Tbilisi bench waiting to be the substitute of some glorious Georgian football star striker, Volkovi enjoyed being helpful and leading the attack in other teams where he would have more space, so for the restructured 2016 Umaglesi Liga he accepted being loaned to FC Sioni Bolnisi, a club that in the past had good results in the league. However, Sioni ended relegated, but Volkovi by scoring 6 goals in 14 games ended as 4th best league topscorer. Serbia At the end of the season he returned to Dinamo Tbilisi, and in February 2017 he accepted a permanent move abroad, to Serbia, to second-tier side FK Zemun. Zemun was by then in the winter-break of the 2016–17 Serbian First League season with good perspectives of archiving ppromootion to Serbian SuperLiga. It took Volkovi some time to debut, and it was in the last round, and he debuted by scoring a goal and with Zemun finishing second and achieving promotion to the 2017–18 Serbian SuperLiga.Davit Volkovi at srbijafudbal.com Return to Georgia After spending half a season at the bench in Serbian second tier, Volkovi was hungry of scoring goals. He had already demonstrated that when in the last round Zemun gave him a chance and he scored in his only league appearance. Zemun got the promotion, but with the uncertainty if he will receive a first team starter status or risk continuing on the bench, in summer 2017, Volkovi decided to return to Georgia and signed with top league side FC Saburtalo Tbilisi. He was a starter in the goalless first-round game against FC Kolkheti-1913 Poti but already in the second round Volkovi confirmed his goal- scoring skills and made a hattrick in a 6–0 victory against FC Locomotive Tbilisi. Gabala On 11 January 2019, Volkovi signed for Gabala from Saburtalo Tbilisi on a one-year contract. Zira On 21 December 2019, Zira FK announced the singing of Volkovi on an 18-month contract starting 1 January 2020. ==Career statistics== Club {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" + Club statistics - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - valign=\\"center\\"Gagra 2012–13 Pirveli Liga 231041colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–2711 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Dinamo Tbilisi 2013–14 rowspan=\\"4\\"Umaglesi Liga 0000colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–00 - 2014–15 1022colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–32 - 2015–16 301000colspan=\\"2\\"–40 - 2016 000000colspan=\\"2\\"–00 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !4!!0!!3!!2!!0!!0!!-!!-!!7!!2 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Dinamo Tbilisi II (loan) 2013–14 rowspan=\\"2\\"Pirveli Liga 101colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–101 - 2014–15 136colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–136 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !23!!7!!-!!-!!-!!-!!-!!-!!23!!7 - valign=\\"center\\"Chikhura Sachkhere (loan) 2015–16 Umaglesi Liga 8400colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–84 - valign=\\"center\\"Sioni Bolnisi (loan) 2016 Umaglesi Liga 14610colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–156 - valign=\\"center\\"Zemun 2016–17 Serbian First League 1100colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–11 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Saburtalo Tbilisi 2017 rowspan=\\"2\\"Erovnuli Liga 171000colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–1710 - 2018 28800colspan=\\"2\\"–colspan=\\"2\\"–288 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !45!!18!!0!!0!!-!!-!!-!!-!!45!!18 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"Gabala 2018–19 rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"Azerbaijan Premier League 1323100colspan=\\"2\\"–163 - 2019–20 1452220colspan=\\"2\\"–187 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !27!!7!!5!!3!!2!!0!!-!!-!!34!!10 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !145!!52!!13!!6!!2!!0!!-!!-!!160!!59 } ==Honours== ;Dinamo Tbilisi *Georgian Cup: 2015 *Georgian Super Cup: 2015 ;Gabala * Azerbaijan Cup: 2018–19 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Erovnuli Liga · Official website · *FC Dinamo Tbilisi · Official website *FC Saburtalo · Official website · *FootballDatabase.eu * *Gabala FK · Official website · * *Sports.ru * *Zerozero.pt *sportall.ge · *sportall.ge Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Tbilisi Category:Footballers from Georgia (country) Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Gagra players Category:FC Dinamo Tbilisi players Category:FC Chikhura Sachkhere players Category:FC Sioni Bolnisi players Category:FC Saburtalo Tbilisi players Category:Erovnuli Liga players Category:Expatriate footballers from Georgia (country) Category:FK Zemun players Category:Serbian First League players Category:Expatriate footballers in Serbia Category:Azerbaijan Premier League players Category:Gabala FC players ","title":"Davit Volkovi"},{"id":"54249911","text":"Jeremiah 26 is the twenty-sixth chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.Halley, Henry H.

The railway was previously called Oneonta Street Railway (1888-1897), Oneonta & Otego Valley Railroad (1897-1900), Oneonta, Cooperstown & Richfield Springs Railway (1900-1906), Oneonta & Mohawk Valley Railway (1906-1908), Otsego & Herkimer Railroad (1908-1916), Southern New York Power & Railway Co. (1916-1924), and Southern New York Railroad (1924-1970). The line was laid north from Oneonta. It reached Laurens in July 1901, Cooperstown in September 1901, Richfield Springs in the summer of 1902, and Mohawk by 1906. A car barn, powerhouse, and dispatcher office were built in Hartwick. There was also a substation to power the line by the station in Schuyler Lake. By the 1920s, ridership numbers were falling. While the SNY still carried 61,403 passengers in 1928, the figure fell to 14,118 in 1931. In 1933, the SNY ended rail passenger service to concentrate on rail freight and the bus operations started in 1926. In 1939, the SNY was sold to the H.E. Salzberg Company. Full operations continued for a year, but service to Cooperstown was ended in 1940 and in 1941, permission was granted to abandon the line from West Oneonta to Jordanville. The 1.5 mile stretch from Oneonta to West Oneonta was retained and freight service was offered with diesel locomotives. In January 1970, the SNY requested to close the remaining operation after the state Department of Transportation announced that a new connection road between the proposed Interstate 88 and state Route 23 would cut the line. Freight service ended on May 7, 1970, and the ICC approved the abandonment on March 26, 1971. The tracks were lifted in July 1971. ==History== April 19, 1901 - The Village Trustees of Cooperstown unanimously voted to allow the line to enter the village via Chestnut Street to Main Street, on the condition that no car carrying freight run on village streets except from the southern village boundary to the CACV Railroad. ==References== Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads ","title":"Southern New York Railway"},{"id":"54250043","text":"Lakeside Park is an unincorporated community in Wayne Township, Kosciusko County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== Lakeside Park is located at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kosciusko County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"Lakeside Park, Kosciusko County, Indiana"},{"id":"54250054","text":"Malabika Pramanik is a Canadian mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia.

The rail line began construction in 1887 and was a continuation of the Minneapolis and Pacific Railway line to the Dakotas that would supply grain to Twin Cities flour mills. The line begins in Glenwood and splits with the Detroit Lakes Subdivision before going through many small towns and reaching the junction with the Morris Subdivision near Nashua. Then the line continues westward into North Dakota meeting the Veblen Subdivision at Veblen Junction. At Hankinson, the route meets the DMVW Dakota Subdivision and turns north, eventually reaching the western terminus at Enderlin. There has been no passenger service on the line since the last train of the Winnipeger went through on March 25, 1967. Freight traffic mainly involves grain and some crude oil as well as a few manifests. The route typically sees around 8 trains per day as of June 2017.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a white flower with prominent dark green stripes and a sharply pointed, brown-tipped dorsal sepal. Similar greenhoods growing on the Australian mainland were formerly known as Pterostylis alata but are now given the name Pterostylis striata. ==Description== Pterostylis alata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of dark green, wrinkled leaves, long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide borne on a spike high. The flowers are white with dark green stripes. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a narrow point long and is brownish near the tip. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have erect, thread-like tips long and a broad V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide, brown and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from May to August but mainly in June and July. ==Taxonomy and naming== The striped greenhood was first formally described in 1806 by Jacques Labillardière who gave it the name Disperis alata. (Disperis is a genus of orchid mainly from Africa and Madagascar.) Labillardière published the description in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen from a plant he collected \\"in Van-Diemen's Land\\". In 1871 Heinrich Reichenbach changed the name to Pterostylis alata. The specific epithet (alata) is a Latin word meaning \\"winged\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Pterostylis alata grows in open forest and coastal scrub in Tasmania. Pterostylis alata does not grow on the mainland of Australia and plants formerly placed in this species are now recognised as Pterostylis striata. ==References== alata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Plants described in 1806 ","title":"Pterostylis alata"},{"id":"54250152","text":"Monique Mund-Dopchie (born in Ronse, Belgium, on 21 August 1943) is a Belgian classicist.

Rice, West Virginia: The State and its People (Parson, West Virginia: McClain Printing Co, 1972) p. 201Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography p. 195 ==Early life and education== Born in Newport, Washington County, Ohio on November 14, 1814 to Ebenezer Battelle (1778 - 1876) and his wife Mary (Molly) Greene Battelle (1778 - 1871), Gordon Battelle had both older and younger brothers and sisters. He attended the Marietta Collegiate Institute (now Marietta College) in his Ohio county's seat, where he met fellow student Francis Pierpont, who became his lifelong friend. Battelle then continued his education (for Christian ministry) at Allegheny College at Meadville, Pennsylvania, graduating with the highest rank in his class and receiving a B.A. degree in 1840. Allegheny College later awarded him a master's degree in 1843, and Ohio University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 1861. Battele married Maria Louise Tucker (1818 - 1899) from Vermont some time after his graduation. They had several children, not all of whom reached adulthood: Mary S. (b. 1844), John Gordon Battelle (b. 1845), Ellen V. Battelle Dietrick (1847-1895), Julia E. (b. 1849), Fannie (b.1851), James Waldo Battelle (1853 - 1854), Emma (b. 1855) and Cora Battelle Fenton (b. 1859).U.s. Federal Census for Ward 5, Wheeling, Ohio County, Virginia family 3121 ==Career and Ministry== The young graduate moved across the Ohio River and taught at the newly established Asbury Academy in Parkersburg in what was then the Commonwealth of Virginia (although sponsored by the East Ohio Conference of the Methodist Church). Battelle received his preaching license in 1842 and was ordained as a Methodist deacon in 1847 and minister in 1849. By that time Battelle had become the principal of the Northwestern Virginia Academy at Clarksburg, a position he held until 1851, when he resigned to concentrate on his ministry (at a church in Charleston). The Clarksburg academy was also technically new, but had the same board of Trustees as the Randolph Academy chartered there in 1787. Battelle led the Charleston congregation for two years before accepting another position in Clarksburg. In 1855, he accepted an appointment as presiding elder of the church's Clarksburg District. He also served as a delegate to the Methodist Episcopal Church general conferences in 1856, 1859 and 1860. In 1859, he accepted a call to serve a congregation in Wheeling and became involved in the growing division between slaveholding Virginians who proposed to secede from the Union. Battelle wrote articles in the Wheeling Intelligencer against disunion, as well as against slavery. ==American Civil War== After the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 approved secession despite the opposition of many delegates from the Commonwealth's northwest corner, the Wheeling Convention established the Restored Government of Virginia, and Rev. Battelle's old schoolmate Francis Pierpont became its Governor. Battelle continued to write and publish about the difficulties in establishing a new state. In October 1861, Gov. Pierpont appointed Rev. Battelle as an official visitor to Federal military camps to investigate reports of poor conditions, particularly concerning medical supplies and a shortage of doctors and nurses. His reports on conditions at Philippi, Elkwater, and Cheat Mountain helped alleviate those conditions. Beginning November 1, 1861, Rev. Battelle also served as chaplain of the 1st West Virginia Infantry.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia 1904 indicates he died in January, 1861 although Pennsylvania clergy directory indicates a later date. Findagrave gives the August 7 date used, although the inscription on the very large monument is illegible Battelle was also among the many Methodist ministers elected in October 1861 to serve as delegates to the West Virginia Constitutional Convention. Beginning on November 26, 1861, he represented Ohio County and served on the Committee on Education. He advocated establishing a system of free public schools in the new state (which was adopted), but his two proposals forbidding bringing slaves into the new state and gradually abolishing slavery within it were tabled. Partly as a result, however, of his published\\"An Address to the Constitutional Convention and the People of West Virginia\\" Congress refused to admit West Virginia as a new state until its people adopted a resolution against slavery (the Waitman Willey amendment) in March 1863.Rice p. 201 ==Death and legacy== However, that occurred after Battelle's unexpected death. During a trip to investigate sanitary conditions in the military camps around Washington, D.C., Rev. Battelle died of typhoid fever on July 5, 1862. His remains were returned to Newport, Ohio for burial. His grandson Gordon Battelle founded Battelle Memorial Institute. Battelle Township in Monongalia County, West Virginia was named in his honor. ==References== Category:1814 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Allegheny College alumni Category:American abolitionists Category:American Methodist clergy Category:19th-century Methodist ministers Category:Activists from Ohio Category:People of Virginia in the American Civil War Category:People from Washington County, Ohio Category:People from Ohio County, West Virginia Category:Union Army chaplains Category:United States Army chaplains Category:Educators from Ohio Category:Christian abolitionists ","title":"Gordon Battelle (minister)"},{"id":"54250190","text":"Musquabuck Park is an unincorporated community in Van Buren Township, Kosciusko County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== Musquabuck Park is located on the shores of Dewart Lake, at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kosciusko County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"Musquabuck Park, Indiana"},{"id":"54250221","text":"DeFries Landing is an unincorporated community in Van Buren Township, Kosciusko County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== DeFries Landing is located on the shores of Dewart Lake, at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kosciusko County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"DeFries Landing, Indiana"},{"id":"54250254","text":"Renée Camu (born 12 March 1936) is a French rower.

In 1943, General George Patton established a top secret tank training camp, called Camp Bouse in the area. ==Brief history== The area where Bouse is located was first inhabited by the ancient Native-American tribe known as the Hohokam. Hohokam is a Pima (O'odham) word used by archaeologists to identify a group of people who lived in the Sonoran Desert of North America. Following the expansion of the New Mexico Territory in 1853, as a result of the Gadsden Purchase, several proposals for a division of the territory and the organization of a separate Territory of Arizona in the southern half of the territory were advanced as early as 1856.America's Library In 1889, Thomas Bouse, a native of Missouri, arrived in the region in search of gold. He laid claim to various mines, one of which was called the \\"Old Dutchman Mine\\" and he also homesteaded various acres of land. In 1904, the Arizona & California Railroad laid tracks from Wickenburg to California. Bouse decided to make a profit from his investments and sold the right of way to the railroad company. Eventually he sold his well and some of his mining claims.Honoring the Past In 1906, John Brayton established the Brayton Mercantile Company on the Eastern side of the train depot and railroad tracks. Bryton was the owner of the Brayton Commercial Company which were established in the towns of Wickenburg and Salome. The early settlers called the area Brayton, however when they proposed naming their small town Brayton, the application sent to the government was returned with the small town being named Bouse instead of the proposed name. Bouse did not prosper much until 1943, when the United States was involved in World War II. ==Camp Bouse== Camp Bouse historical marker. During World War II, the US Army established Camp Bouse in the town, a top secret tank training camp, under the command of General George S. Patton. The soldiers who trained in the camp were not allowed to discuss anything in regard to their training with outsiders. The 526th Armored Infantry Battalion, the 554th Ordnance Heavy Maintenance Company, the 9th Tank Group and the 701st., 736th and 740th Tank Battalions trained in Camp Bouse.
