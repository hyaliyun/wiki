Winther, 1978 The Golden Horde is a two-player combat board game that was published by Excalibre Games in 1978. ==Description== The Golden Horde is a strategy game designed by Dennis O'Leary and R.J. Hlavnicka, with artwork by R.P. Winther, that simulates the Mongol conquests of Asia and Europe in the first half of the 13th century. One player represents the Mongol Hordes and the other player represents their twelve main opponents (Poles, Hungarians, Russians, Bulgars, Georgians, Alans, Kumans, people of Hsi-Hsia, Chinese, Kara-Khitans, people of the Khwarizmian Empire and people of Sung), called \\"the Allies\\".https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7372/golden-horde The game components are: * 210 die-cut counters * a 22\\" x 12\\" two-color paper map covering an area from Scandinavia to Vietnam * cover sheet * four-page rulebook * errata sheet * ziplock bag for storage Gameplay also requires a six-sided die, which is not included. ==Gameplay== The Mongols attempt to conquer as many Allied homelands as possible. Once all units belonging to a homeland have been destroyed, the homeland is considered conquered, and the homeland cannot generate any more replacements. ===Combat and movement=== There are two numbers on each counter, representing combat strength and movement. Allied counters can be stacked two high, and Mongols three high. Unlike many war games, counters are not surrounded by Zones of Control where opposing units must stop and combat is compulsory. Instead, all attacks are optional, and counters can move by opposing counters without stopping. Terrain has an effect on combat: Mountains give the defenders double strength, and rivers reduce the attacker's strength by half. There is a separate combat results table for city sieges. Although the Mongols seem outnumbered, only the Poles and Hungarians can move outside their respective regions, while all other Allies are limited to their home regions. The Mongol player can also use the Mongol leader counter and four war machine counters to increase attack odds. ===Victory conditions=== If at any time the number of conquered homelands outnumbers the remaining Mongol units, then the Mongol player wins. If the Allied player destroys all Mongol units before this happens, the Allied player wins. ==Reception== In the September 1980 edition of Dragon (issue #41), Bryan Beecher thought the map, although fairly accurate, was bland, and he also thought the terrain was not varied enough. However, he concluded that \\"The Golden Horde is a fast-moving, easy-to-learn, fun game.

In 1828, Britain annexed Assam following the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826.Tezenlo Thong, \\"A Clash of Worldviews: The Impact of Modern Western Notion of Progress on Naga Culture, 1832-1947,\\" Journal of Race, Religion and Ethnicity, No. 2, 5 (2011): 1-37 In the 1830s, the British sent expeditionary forces, and in 1845, the colonial power succeeded in concluding a non-aggression pact with Naga chiefs, who formerly had attacked bordering areas in Assam. But the Naga repeatedly violated the agreement, continuing to raid in Assam.Upadhyay, R. Naga Insurgency - A confusion of war or peace (Paper No. 1256, 17 February 2005, South Asia Analysis) After the 1830s, British attempts to annex the region to India were met with sustained and effective guerrilla resistance from Naga groups, particularly the Angami Nagas. The British dispatched military expeditions and succeeded in building a military post in 1851 and establishing some bases in the region. In 1878 the Angamis mounted raids on British camps. The British responded with brutality, burning several Naga villages and killing Naga non-combatants to crush their resistance. Eventually, the region came under the occupation of the British. alt= During the First World War, two thousand Nagas contributed to the war effort on the European front. In the Second World War, their descendants remained loyal to the British and fought to halt the advance of Japanese forces.Drouyer, Isabel, Drouyer Ren√©, THE NAGAS: MEMORIES OF HEADHUNTERS, White Lotus, 2016, p.1 ==Christian missionaries== Protestant Christian missionaries from America in the nineteenth century were successful in converting many among the Nagas. It led to them dropping many customs and traditions and, along with the spread of English education, was part of the arrival of modernity in the Naga hills. The first missionary in the Naga hills is believed to be Rev. Miles Bronson in 1839, who stayed for a short period among Nocte Naga in Namsang under Tirap district of present day Arunachal Pradesh. In the 1870s, Dr. & Mrs. E. W. Clark worked among the Ao people. With the help of a Mr. Godhula, an Assamese Christian, they established the first church, a Baptist one, in Molungkimong (Dekha Haimong Village) in 1872. As the people adopted Christianity, they began to develop more of a \\"Naga\\" identity, a radical departure from their distinctions based on warring villages. Today, more than 95% of Naga people identify as Christians, mostly Baptist. ==Resistance and struggle for identity== The Naga hills have been an area of continued resistance as they had long been isolated from outside cultures. The development of a spirit of nationalism and sense of a common identity are relatively new concepts among the Naga people. According to their traditions, each village is an independent republic; initially, they wanted to be free from all outside domination. Modern education, together with Christian missions, contributed to the politicization of Naga ethnicity. In 1918, a group of educated Nagas formed Naga Club in 1918. The club wrote to the Simon Commission in 1929 demanding that \\"Nagas should not be included within the Reformed Scheme of India\\".Prongo, K. \\"Dawning Of Truth To Crown Indo-Naga Talks\\", ManipurOnline, 22 September 2002 On 14 August 1947, the day before India gained independence from British rule, the Nagas were the first ethnic group from the northeast to declare their territory an independent state, not belonging to the new nation. Angami Zapu Phizo led the initial movement with the Naga National Council (NNC). In the last days of the British Raj, he held talks trying to achieve a sovereign Naga nation. In June 1947, a 9-point agreement was signed which promised to bring the Nagas under a single political administrative unit and recognised the Nagas' right to self- determination after 10 years. Disputes arose over the interpretation of the agreement, and many in the NNC opposed it.Ramunny, Murkot. \\"The 'ceasefire with the Nagas'\\", The Hindu, 4 July 2001 Under Phizo, the NNC declared their independence from the British on 14 August 1947, a day before India. In May 1951, the NNC claimed that 99 per cent of the Naga people supported a referendum to secede from India, which was summarily rejected by the government in New Delhi. By 1952, the NNC, led a guerrilla movement. India responded by crushing it with their armed forces. Phizo escaped from the region through East Pakistan and went into exile to London. He continued to inspire the independence movement from there till his death in 1990.Mujtaba, Syed Ali. \\"Nagaland peace talks still elusive\\" , Global Politician, Retrieved on 18 June 2009 ==Statehood, factions and ceasefires== The State of Nagaland was formally recognised 1 December 1963, as the 16th State of the Indian Union. The State consists of eleven Administrative Districts, inhabited by 16 major ethnic groups along with other sub-groups. Each group is distinct in character in terms of customs, language and dress. This was followed by peace overtures. A major role was taken by the Nagaland Baptist Church Council (NBCC). In its third Convention held at Wokha from 31 January ‚Äì 2 February 1964 which was said to have been attended by 5,000 representatives from all ethnic groups of Nagaland, the NBCC made a historic resolution welcoming the proposed \\"Peace-Talk\\" and to request the Government to make available the services of Jayaprakash Narayan, Bimala Prasad Chaliha and Rev. Michael Scott with the object of the restoration of peace. With this, the Peace Mission was formed. The mission was led by Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican Churchman; Jayaprakash Narayan, a Gandhian and Sarvodaya leader; and B.P. Chaliha, the Chief Minister of Assam. ===Ceasefire agreement 1964=== The Peace Mission, supported by church leaders, headed by Rev. Longri Ao and the sponsorship of the State Government, resulted in an agreement for Cessation of Fire signed by the Governor Vishnu Sahay, on behalf of the Government of India and the Peace Mission, and Zashei Huire, Biseto Medom and L. Zhenito signed on behalf of the NNC underground government. Even though the agreement was officially declared on 6 September 1964 by organising public meetings and special prayer meetings all over Nagaland, the actual agreement was signed on 23 May 1964 at Sakraba Village in Phek district. The ceasefire declaration was followed by a series of peace talks primarily between the members of the peace mission, the Naga leaders and team of peace observers. Eventually, the level of talks was raised and the venue shifted to New Delhi culminating in six rounds of talks in 1966 to 1967 between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Naga leaders. ===Peace talks=== The first round was held on 18‚Äì19 February in New Delhi and the Naga delegation was led by Kughato Sukhai, their Prime Minister. The other members were Imkongmeren, Vice President, Issac Swu, Foreign Secretary, S. Angami, and Dallinamo. The final round of talks with Indira Gandhi was held in New Delhi on 3 October 1967. In all peace talks in New Delhi, the Naga delegation was led by Kughato Sukhai. However, no positive agreement could be reached as a result of these talks. ===Period of uncertainty=== There were charges and counter-charges between the Security forces and the Nagas for breach of the terms of the agreement. On 3 August 1968, \\"Gen\\" Kaito, a Naga leader, was assassinated in broad daylight in the heart of Kohima town. On 8 August 1972, the Chief Minister Hokishe Sema was ambushed by suspected Naga members near Kohima. The Chief Minister escaped without any bodily harm but his daughter was seriously injured. On 31 August 1972, the Government banned the three Naga bodies, 1) The Naga National Council, 2) the Naga Federal Government, and 3) the Federal Army. Secondly, the Government decided against a further extension of the ceasefire agreement. ===Renewed peace effort=== Though the peace mission was dissolved when Rev. Michael Scott left India in 1966. The cessation of ceasefire ended in 1972. The Nagaland Peace Council (NPC) was re- formed at the initiative of the Church leaders. Discussion for peace continued. The effort was stepped up with renewed vigour after President's Rule was promulgated in March 1975. In May 1975 the Liaison Committee of the NPC, consisting of Rev. Longri Ao, Kenneth Kerhuo, L. Lungalang, M. Aram, and Lungshim Shaiza, had requested Kevi Yalley to be a spokesperson for the Nagas. Next, the Naga leaders selected six of their representatives to hold discussions with the Government. This was closely followed by a series of five talks between the Naga representatives and the Government represented by the two advisers to the Governor, Z. Zopianga, and Ramunny. ===Shillong accord 1975=== These discussions finally resulted in the Shillong Accord signed on 11 November 1975, by the Governor of Nagaland L.P Singh representing the Government of India and the NNC leadership represented by Assa and Kevi Yalley. The NNC agreed to the unconditional acceptance of the Indian Constitution and surrender of arms. The immediate result was a large scale surrender of arms and personnel. Villages containing NNC members, persuaded them to cease their clandestine activities. Five districts of the State were almost cleared of the underground elements. For some time there was little insurgency inside Nagaland. The accord was condemned by many Nagas and marked the beginning of factionalism among the revolutionaries. The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was formed in the late 1970s by Thuingaleng Muivah, Isak Chishi Swu and S. S. Khaplang. The NSCN later splintered into two, when Khaplang started another group. Renewed violence occurred in the State from the middle of the 1980s. The fratricidal confrontations among the various Naga groups and the State authorities led to the loss of lives, disturbed public order and thwarted the economic development of the State. Fratricidal violence among revolutionary groups continued into the 1990s. In Manipur particularly, ethnic violence erupted between the Nagas and Kukis, with both sides suffering hundreds of casualties. On 23 January 1993, the Isaac-Muivah group of the NSCN (NSCN(IM)) was admitted to the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO). This was seen as a means to gain international attention to the Naga cause. ===Ceasefire agreement 1997=== After talks with the NSCN (IM), the Government of India heeded the wishes of the people and on 25 July 1997, the Prime Minister, I. K. Gujral, in a statement in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, announced a ceasefire with effect from 1 August 1997 for a period of three months. The ceasefire declaration was followed by setting up of a Cease-fire Monitoring Cell to enforce the Ground Rules as laid down by Government of India. The ceasefire was later extended further. However, according to the UNPO, in 2009 the NSCN considered the biggest impediment to peace to be the refusal of the government of India to officially extend the ceasefire to all Naga-inhabited areas outside of Nagaland.UNPO.org.

The author, Mark Pallen, proposes an explanation of how Janet Parker ‚Äì the last person to die from smallpox ‚Äì contracted the infection. This explanation, based on court transcripts and interviews with the barrister who defended the University, and the clinicians and scientists who were involved with the outbreak, contradicts the conclusions of the official government enquiry, The Shooter Report. In the autumn of 1978, Parker, a photographer employed by the University of Birmingham and based at its medical school, contracted smallpox and died from the infection. The strain of smallpox that killed her was being analysed in a laboratory below the second floor rooms where Parker worked. In his report, Shooter concluded that the virus had travelled up a service duct. Shooter's conclusion was contested in the legal case ‚Äì Robert Kenyon Cook versus the University of Birmingham ‚Äì by an expert witness, Professor Kevin McCarthy, who considered the \\"duct\\" hypothesis impossible given the small amounts of virus that were present in the laboratory. The magistrates found the university not guilty of charges made by the Health and Safety Executive, which left the question of how Parker had contracted the infection unanswered, although there was no doubt that the same strain of smallpox virus had been used in experiments in the laboratory. Nearly forty years later, in his book Pallen conjectures that if the virus did not \\"go\\" to Parker, she must have \\"gone\\" to the virus. It is possible that Parker gained unauthorised access to the Smallpox Laboratory, when offering staff photographic film at a discounted price or when seeking advice on photographic materials used in the laboratory experiments. A.M. Walker, reviewing the book for the Journal of Hospital Infection, notes that it is detailed and scholarly while being written for a lay audience. The first three of seven sections in the book provide the reader with historical background on the smallpox disease and its eradication. Walker describes the book as a \\"gripping story\\" and praises the author's \\"journalistic flair\\". Philip Mortimer, reviewing in the journal Epidemiology and Infection, describes Pallen's \\"interesting tale\\" as a \\"warning to scientists\\" that is accessible to the general reader and relevant to professionals. He notes that the book also describes two earlier laboratory escapes. ==References== Category:Smallpox Category:Virology Category:Non-fiction books ","title":"The Last Days of Smallpox"},{"id":"63869162","text":"Kyle Crutchmer (born May 5, 1993) is an American professional mixed martial artist and graduated collegiate wrestler. He currently competes in the welterweight division of Bellator MMA. As a folkstyle wrestler, he was a two- time NCAA All-American and two-time Big 12 champion. == Early life == Crutchmer was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is the son of Kevin and Tina Crutchmer and has three siblings, Brian, Justin and Kayla. He has a very strong relationship with his stepbrother Brian, whom he grew up with since he was a baby when his mother abandoned him. Since then, they attended high school and college together and even wrestled in the same team. In Union High School he was a two-sport varsity athlete, competing in football (since his sophomore year) and wrestling. He was a standout as a footballer, helping the Redskins to win three OSSAA team titles. == Wrestling career == === High School === Crutchmer started wrestling in sixth grade. While competing for Union High School, he won two 6A OSSAA individual titles, an NHSCA Junior National title and compiled an 198-30 record in folkstyle. He was also highly successful in freestyle, as he won the USAW Fargo Junior Nationals in 2012 and placed second and third at the FILA Age-group Nationals. === College === Originally, Crutchmer was going to commit to the Sooners, but he ended up choosing the Cowboys as John Smith convinced him to and also to wrestle with his brother. In his redshirt season (2012-2013), he compiled a 15-1 record in open tournaments at 174 pounds. As a freshman (2013-2014), he compiled a 20-8 record at three different weight classes throughout the season but did not compete at the Big 12's or the NCAA's. As a sophomore (2014-2015), he compiled a 21-7 record and won his first Big 12 title, helping the Cowboys to win the team title. At the NCAA's of that year, he went 4-2 to place fifth, earning All-American honors. As a junior (2015-2016), he compiled a 15-4 record, however, he suffered a season-ending injury at a dual match against the Sooners, leaving him unable to compete at the NCAA's or the Big 12's. As a senior (2016-2017), he compiled a 23-7 record and won his second Big 12 title at 174 pounds. At the NCAA championships, he compiled 5 wins and 2 losses to place seventh and earn All-American honors for the second time in his NCAA career. Overall, Crutchmer was a two-time All-American and two-time Big 12 champion with a record of 79 victories and 26 defeats as a collegiate wrestler. === Freestyle ===  2013  Fresh out of high school, Crutchmer made his senior freestyle debut at the 2013 US University National Championships in May. He won three straight matches but was subsequently thrown to the consolation bracket by Alex Meyer in a 29-point match. He was ultimately eliminated in his next bout by Gabe Dean, an eventual heavily accomplished wrestler.  2014  While he was still a freshman in college, Crutchmer competed at the 2014 US National University Championships. He won his first five bouts by technical fall and the last one before the best-of-three finals by points. At the best-of-three, he defeated his opponent two times to none, winning the championship at 80 kilograms.  2017  After a big break of three years, Crutchmer competed at the US Open. He won his first match by technical fall but subsequently lost to two-time NCAA champion Gabe Dean and got thrown to the consolation bracket.

UBE3B has an N-terminal IQ motif, which mediates calcium-independent calmodulin binding and a large C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. == Gene discovery == UBE3B gene was discovered in 1996 by the group of Margaret Lomax at the University of Michigan Medical School. Differential mRNA expression study, to reveal genes upregulated after acoustic trauma in the chick basal papilla, lead to identification of cDNA which exhibited 84% of identity of uncharacterized human cDNA. Interestingly, its expression dramatically increased in the regions of damaged chick inner ear upon noise-induced trauma. In 2003, human and mouse UBE3B gene was cloned and characterized by its discoverers. == Clinical significance == Inactivating mutations in UBE3B gene have been linked to Kaufman Oculocerebrofacial Syndrome (KOS), a severe developmental disorders. Most mutations are loss-of-function and lead to premature stop codon. However, some mutations are of single amino acid substitution type and these occur in the low complexity region, or in the catalytic HECT domain. == Mouse models of Ube3b deficiency and UBE3B/Ube3b targets == Deletion of murine ortholog Ube3b leads to severe developmental delay in mice. The conventional knockout of Ube3b leads to a growth retardation, decreased grip strength, and loss of vocalization associated with the metabolic disease with nucleotide metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle being the most affected. Such metabolic disturbances were also found in KOS patients. In this context, UBE3B ubiquitinated Œ±-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK). Forebrain-specific conditional Ube3b knockout mice showed impaired spatial learning, altered social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. Ube3b knockout neurons exhibited decreased dendritic branching, increased density and aberrant morphology of dendritic spines, altered synaptic physiology, and changes in hippocampal circuit activity. Dendritic and spine phenotype was regulated by Ube3b in a cell-autonomous manner. Murine Ube3b ubiquitinated the catalytic Œ≥-subunit of calcineurin, Ppp3cc, the overexpression of which phenocopied Ube3b loss with regard to dendrite branching and dendritic spine density. ==References== Category:Genes Category:Genetics Category:Enzymes ","title":"Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase E3B"},{"id":"63869232","text":"The 1904 Illinois gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 1904.

Lebanon's government works within the framework of Confessionalism (politics), with parliamentary seats and others government positions allocated by religious confession. Many members of government have been in power since the Lebanese Civil War, with a simple shuffling of positions every election cycle. Many blame this system for the country's continued corruption. Government officials reportedly often award contracts to friends and family leading to many of the country's problems like daily power cuts. Many working class Lebanese citizens rely on economic assistance from their party which stops them from speaking up against the system, despite widespread opposition. Corruption happens on every level of society and is not strictly limited to high level officials. As in many neighboring countries, using personal family and party connections to get favors like skipping a long queue, getting into a selective institution, or finding a job; known locally as wasta; is common practice and has become the social norm. Although many believe that using wasta is understandable for each individual case as institutions are often inefficient without it, it is also agreed upon that the social phenomenon deepens economic inequality. == Public reaction and opposition == Anti-corruption sentiment has been one of the driving forces behind many of the large scale lebanese protests in recent history. Notably the 2015‚Äì2016 Lebanese protests sparked by the closure of a waste dump without a plan which triggered a \\"garbage crisis\\" and the 2019‚Äì2020 Lebanese protests sparked by an increase in taxes Many anti-system parties run on an anti-corruption platforms, most notably Beirut Madinati, which ran during the 2016 Beirut municipal election.

The main house was originally built by Col. Woodson W. Hancock (1789 - 1883) in 1834 and was a 1¬Ω-story central-passage house. Around 1855 the house was enlarged by an addition that consisted of a 2-story, side passage plan style house. Woodson Wingfield Hancock was a renowned county leader in politics, the militia, and agriculture. Using the neighboring Otter Creek (now known as Otterdale Branch), Hancock engineered a system of irrigation in which he built a dike at the creek's furthest point downstream that was on his property. Every winter the dike would be closed and water would overflow into the low lying surrounding land. This would deposit a rich cover of silt on top of the farmland. In the spring the dike would be opened so the water could flow out just before plowing. This system of farming gave Col. Hancock exceptionally bountiful harvests. In 1884, shortly after Col. Hancock's death, the 560 acre farm was sold for $4,500 to Wallace Waltman and John Lewis Waltman, brothers from Laddsburg, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. They immediately set to work fixing up the farm and house. At this time, the farm's name was changed from Otterdale to Cedar Lane. John Lewis Waltman returned to Pennsylvania in 1887 and another Pennsylvanian, Willie Mead, took his place at Otterdale. In 1895, John Lewis returned to Otterdale and two years after, the Waltman brothers' widowed mother, along with her new husband and two daughters, also came to live at the farm in Chesterfield. At this point there were four families living on the property. Later the Otterdale parcel was split up as Wallace Waltman and Willie Mead built their own houses on the land. In 1903, both Waltman and Mead left for Montana to settle new homesteads. John Lewis Waltman's descendants continued to live at Otterdale until January 2, 1933 when it was destroyed by a fire. Many outbuildings were located on this farm including a separate one room kitchen, a detached office, tobacco barns, a stable, and a carriage house along with numerous other outbuildings. In the early 20th century a driveway that was lined with cedars led from Otterdale Road to the main house and in the back an alle√© passed \\"through an arbor, vegetable garden and orchard\\" on its way to the family cemtery. Otterdale burned down in 1933 and nothing remains of the property now except the abandoned cellar and a small cemetery. In the late 20th century a development was built on the property and about 12 new houses were built. ==References== Otterdale Otterdale ","title":"Otterdale"},{"id":"63869579","text":"Phil Coppess (born September 2, 1954 ) is an American former long-distance runner.

Born in √âvreux, Buisson worked in a shop there, then moved to Rouen and in 1898 to Paris, where he worked in a haberdashery. He joined the Federation of Employees (FEC) in 1901, and also joined the French Socialist Party. However, in 1905, when it merged into the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), he did not join, instead contesting local elections as an independent socialist. In 1908, Buisson was elected as assistant secretary of the FEC, becoming treasurer in 1910, and administrative secretary in 1914. It was affiliated to the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), and Buisson undertook much for the CGT, including co-ordinating the creation of the National Federation of Lighting Workers. During World War I, Buisson served in the infantry, then he returned to trade unionism, and in 1920 became general secretary of the FEC, which came with a seat on the administrative commission of the CGT. In 1921, he became vice president of the International Federation of Employees, Technicians and Managers. He remained with the CGT when the communists split away, and from 1925 served on the National Economic Council. In 1926, he married Suzanne L√©vy, a prominent figure in the SFIO, and subsequently he joined the party himself. In 1929, Buisson stood down as general secretary of the FEC to work full-time for the CGT, in charge of propaganda, serving until 1939, when the CGT was banned. He was active in the French Resistance, as was Suzanne. She was caught by the Gestapo and later killed, while George fled to London. There, he worked with Charles de Gaulle and became a delegate to the Government of Algiers. In August 1943, he was made a CGT delegate to the Consultative Assembly, the first person to speak at it, and its vice president. Following the liberation of France, he returned to Paris, and served again in the leadership of the CGT until his death in 1946. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1946 deaths Category:French Resistance members Category:French trade unionists Category:People from √âvreux ","title":"Georges Buisson"},{"id":"63869586","text":"Solomon is a 75-minute serenata for two solo voices, chorus and orchestra written in 1742 by the English composer William Boyce.

He received his doctorate in 1988, followed by his habilitation in 1996. In 1994 he was a visiting professor at the University of Hamburg. After the Bologna Process came into force he no longer aspired to a professorship.Sarah Mund, Prek√§re Arbeitsverh√§ltnisse auf dem Campus. K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger Ausgabe Dienstag, 11 October 2016, . Since 2005 he has been a member of the board of directors of the Walcker Foundation for Organ Science Research. Since 2011 he has been in charge of its business.http://www.walcker- stiftung.de/Wir_ueber_uns.html In 2008 Eberlein founded the Siebenquart publishing house, which specializes in scientific books about the musical instrument organ. Today he works as a publisher, freelance researcher and private lecturer at the University of Cologne. His research focuses on musical perception, the origin of tonality and the history of the pipe organ. Eberlein is descended as great-grandson of (1858-1923) of the Silesian pastoral family Eberlein. == Scientific contributions == Eberlein was initially engaged in the experimental study of musical perception. In the course of his experiments he came to the insight that pattern recognition plays an essential role in musical perception: Frequently recurring melodic turns and harmonic sequences are stored as harmonic-melodic interval patterns in the course of musical experience in adolescence and are henceforth recognized in newly sounding music. The recognition of patterns enables on the one hand the construction of expectations of continuation (e.g. in dissonances and sixth chords) and the closing effect of cadences, and on the other hand the perception of tones in octave intervals as harmonically equivalent.R. Eberlein, Die Entstehung der tonalen Klangsyntax, Peter Lang, Frankfurt/M. 1994, . Building on these insights, Eberlein described the formation of the typical harmonic sequences of tonal music in the course of music history and tried to justify each individual step of this development as part of a circular process: A musical practice of one kind or another forms the musicians' musical perception by learning the recurring musical patterns and thereby forming expectations of continuation. On the basis of the musical perception thus formed, rules of theory of composition are formulated. These rules can interact in a completely unforeseen way generations or even centuries later, and profoundly change the musical practice then in existence. These changes, in turn, bring about a change in musical perception and new rules of musical composition - and so on. This sphere of activity is influenced on the one hand by the and on the other hand by Geistesgeschichte, i.e. the intellectual currents and tendencies existing at a given time.R. Eberlein, Die Entstehung der tonalen Klangsyntax, Peter Lang, Frankfurt/M. 1994, . After the publication of his habilitation thesis Die Entstehung der tonalen Klangsyntax (The Origin of Tonal Sound Syntax) in 1994, Eberlein turned his attention to organ history. His scientific activity in this field is characterized by the attempt to bring together the many individual insights gained since about 1930 in countless research papers on individual organ builders and on the organ history of individual regions into an overall picture of organ history. In organ circles Eberlein became known especially through his encyclopedia of organ stop Orgelregister, ihre Namen und ihre Geschichte, which is considered a standard work, as well as through his Geschichte der Orgel, the first comprehensive German-language presentation of organ history from its beginnings to the present day, which has been published in book form since 1929.A summary has been published on the Internet, see http://www.walcker- stiftung.de/Orgelgeschichte.html From 2004 onwards, Eberlein was one of the first to draw the attention of the organ world in letters to the editor, lectures and numerous articles to the increasing population ageing of the organ public, the dwindling interest of the younger generations in the organ and the resulting consequences: discontinuation of concert series, lack of young organists, neglect of organs, decline of organ workshops. Eberlein postulates as a major cause of this development the steadily growing gap between the traditional repertoire of organists, which has remained unchanged for decades, and the musical preferences of broad sections of society, which have changed rapidly in recent decades. He therefore advocates adapting the organ repertoire to the changing musical tastes of our time.Numerous articles by Eberlein on this topic can be found on http://www.walcker- stiftung.de/Blog.html sowie http://www.walcker-stiftung.de/Downloads.html == Publications == === Books === * Theorien und Experimente zur Wahrnehmung musikalischer Kl√§nge.Theorien und Experimente zur Wahrnehmung musikalischer Kl√§nge on WorldCat * Kadenzwahrnehmung und Kadenzgeschichte ‚Äì ein Beitrag zu einer Grammatik der Musik.Kadenzwahrnehmung und Kadenzgeschichte : ein Beitrag zu einer Grammatik der Musik = cadence perception and the history of the cadence on WorldCat Peter Lang, Frankfurt. 1992. * Die Entstehung der tonalen Klangsyntax.Die Entstehung der tonalen Klangsyntax on WorldCat Peter Lang, Frankfurt. 1994. * Orgelregister, ihre Namen und ihre Geschichte.Orgelregister, ihre Namen und ihre Geschichte on WorldCat Siebenquart, Cologne 2008. * Meine orgelgeschichtliche Fundkiste.Meine orgelgeschichtliche Fundkiste ein Lesebuch f√ºr Orgelfreunde on WorldCat Daniel Kunert Dienstleistungen, Unterl√º√ü 2010. * Die Geschichte der Orgel.Die Geschichte der Orgel on WorldCat Siebenquart, Cologne 2011. === Essays === * Ars antiqua: Harmonik und Datierung.

Shubin was born on April 2, 1917, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Raised in the nearby suburb of Dormont, Shubin graduated from Dormont High School. In 1940, he graduated from Kenyon College, and then enlisted into the United States Army Air Corps under the Aviation Cadet Training Program in the spring of 1941.

At Guadalcanal, Shubin took part in bombing and strafing missions, along with B-17 escort missions targeting Japanese ships at Bougainville. On February 2, 1943, Shubin shot down his first Japanese plane. His next victory would not come until June 7. === Ace in a day === On June 16, 1943, Shubin's fighter group intercepted a large force of Japanese aircraft flying towards the Russell Islands. He was leading three other P-38s at 27,000 feet when he spotted 50 enemy planes 4,000 feet below them off Guadalcanal. Diving on a group of approximately 15 A6M Zeros at the rear of the formation, he and two other pilots all quickly shot one down. One Zero then pulled up in a climb directly in front of Shubin, and he destroyed it as well. One of the other P-38s was damaged and returned to the airfield. A second P-38 pilot shot down two more Zeros before his guns jammed. He returned home as well, with the third P-38 escorting him, leaving Shubin in the fight by himself with five remaining enemy planes. Shubin struck the first plane in the cockpit, causing it to fall from the sky. He then managed to fire a well- placed deflection shot on the second Zero, hitting it in the engine and causing it to dive as well. After several diving attempts on the last three Zeros, Shubin riddled the third plane along the entire length of the fuselage, causing it to crash. The two final Zeros were circling above Savo Island and Shubin attacked them from the rear. He missed the fourth Zero and it was able to fly away. The fifth Zero attacked Shubin head-on and they both missed each other. He managed to turn around and hit the fifth plane, causing it to crash. Shubin only listed two confirmed kills for himself that day with the other four he shot down listed as probables as he was unable to observe whether any of them actually crashed. However, an officer with the 35th Infantry Regiment had watched the dogfight through his binoculars at Guadalcanal, and confirmed three of the Zeros originally listed as probables. Additionally, his sixth probably may have been confirmed by ground troops as well. These confirmations meant Shubin had shot down five or six enemy planes in a period of 45 minutes, making him an ace in a day. For his actions that day, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. === Later war service === Shubin later shot down two more enemy planes on October 10, 1943, and another two on October 27, finishing the war as a double ace with 11 or 12 confirmed victories. He returned home in January 1944, along with his Australian wife, Oriole Coombes, whom he had named his P-38 Lightning after. Shubin had met her in 1942 after he was released in a hospital in Brisbane, Australia. In addition to his Distinguished Service Cross, Shubin was also awarded the Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and four Air Medals. He never returned to combat and instead trained new P-38 pilots at the end of the war. == Later career and death == Shubin stayed in the military after the war, transferring to the Air Force in 1947. He served at The Pentagon and at Okinawa, before he was assigned as the commanding officer of the 71st Bombardment Squadron based at Laon-Couvron Air Base in Aisne, France. On July 23, 1956, Lieutenant Colonel Murray J. Shubin died of a heart attack while on maneuvers near Lyons, France. He was buried at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. == References == Category:1917 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American World War II flying aces Category:Aviators from Pennsylvania Category:Kenyon College alumni Category:Military personnel from Pittsburgh Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:United States Air Force officers Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II ","title":"Murray J.

It is approximately 1.7 kilometers long and located in the Yvelines department between Villennes-sur-Seine and M√©dan on the left bank, and Triel- sur-Seine on the right bank. It is positioned downstream from the island of Herni√®re from which it is separated by a narrow channel. It is administratively shared between the municipalities of Villennes-sur-Seine, M√©dan and Triel-sur-Seine. The island is not connected to the river banks except by ferries. In 1880, the author Emile Zola had bought a little Norwegian style chalet adjacent to the island (today it is a museum), and frequently invited his artist friends C√©zanne, Manet, and Pissarro to find inspiration in the dappled island light. A stretch of the island known as ‚ÄúVillennes Beach‚Äù was a popular seasonal escape for Parisians who could reach it by boat trip downstream from Paris. The island‚Äôs susceptibility to flooding has always been its biggest setback for any residential or commercial development. The Seine Flood Control Plan (PPRI) prohibits any construction along the river. == Physiopolis == In 1928 a large part of the island was purchased by two Parisian doctor brothers , Andr√© and Gaston Durville who wished to explore and exploit their ideas about nature cures and naturism. They set up a health resort on the island which they called, ‚ÄúPhysiopolis‚Äù . The resort was originally a naturist one , but the Parisian authorities forced it to adopt minimal clothing by the mid 1930s . By 1930 it was attracting 2000 people on sunny weekends. It lasted until the 1950s and remains of its chalets can still be found on the island. == References == Category:River Seine Category:France stubs ","title":"Platais Island"},{"id":"63869720","text":"This article displays the rosters for the participating teams at the 1997 Tournament of the Americas played in Montevideo, Uruguay from August 21 to August 31, 1997. == Group A == === === *4 Gabriel Fern√°ndez *5 H√©ctor Campana *6 Luis Villar *7 Esteban de la Fuente *8 Lucas Victoriano *9 Marcelo Milanesio *10 Juan Espil *11 Diego Osella *12 Gabriel D√≠az *13 Jorge Racca *14 Patricio Simoni *15 Rub√©n Wolkowyski :*Head coach: Julio Lamas === === *4 Ra√∫l *5 Ratto *6 Caio *7 Ol√≠via *8 Josuel *9 Dem√©trius *10 Alexei *11 Bras√≠lia *12 Sandro Varej√£o *13 Vanderlei *14 Rog√©rio *15 Janj√£o :*Head coach: H√©lio Rubens Garcia === === *4 √Ångel Caballero *5 Yudi Abreu *6 Rabdel Echevarr√≠a *7 Ulises Goire *8 H√©ctor Pino *9 Roberto Herrera Garc√≠a *10 Leonardo P√©rez *11 Lazaro Borrell *12 Leopoldo V√°zquez *13 Eli√©cer Rojas *14 √Ångel N√∫√±ez *15 Ruperto Herrera Garc√≠a :*Head coach: Miguel Calder√≥n G√≥mez === === *4 √ìscar Castellanos *5 Antonio Reyes *6 Andr√©s Contreras *7 Florentino Ch√°vez *8 Enrique Gonz√°lez *9 Silvestre Barajas *10 Alberto Mart√≠nez *11 Luis L√≥pez *12 Javier Zavala *13 Erick Mart√≠nez *14 Miguel Acu√±a *15 Rodrigo P√©rez :*Head coach: Luis Fernando Wong === === *4 Camilo Acosta *5 Diego Losada *6 Luis Pierri *7 Freddy Navarrete *8 Nicol√°s Mazzarino *9 Adolfo Medrick *10 Marcelo Capalbo *11 √ìscar Moglia *12 Gustavo Szczygielski *13 Luis Silveira *14 Marcel Bouzout *15 Jesus Rost√°n :*Head coach: V√≠ctor Hugo Berardi == Group B == === === *4 Joey Vickery *5 Sherman Hamilton *6 Eli Pasquale *7 Steve Nash *8 William Njoku *9 Rowan Barrett *10 Peter Van Elswyk *11 Rob Wilson *12 Martin Keane *13 Pascal Fleury *14 Michael Meeks *15 Wayne Yearwood :*Head coach: / Steve Konchalski === === *4 Ricardo V√°squez *5 Eladio Almonte *6 Soterio Ram√≠rez *7 Mois√©s Michel *8 Henry Paulino *9 Jos√© Mercedes *10 Jos√© Molina *11 H√©ctor Gil *12 Franklin Western *13 Ocaris Lenderborg *14 Carlos Mart√≠nez *15 Juan Carlos Eusebio :*Head coach: Miguel Cruzeta === === *4 Jos√© Ortiz *5 Eddie Casiano *6 Orlando Santiago *7 Erick Rivera *8 Jerome Mincy *9 James Carter *10 Carlos Lanauze *11 Ram√≥n Rivas *12 Rolando Hourruitiner *13 √âdgar de Le√≥n *14 Luis Allende *15 Daniel Santiago :*Head coach: Carlos Morales === === *4 Rusty LaRue *5 Corey Beck *6 Jim Farmer *7 Jason Sasser *8 Erik Martin *9 Adrian Griffin *10 Reggie Jordan *11 Kermit Holmes *12 Evers Burns *13 Russ Millard *14 Travis Williams *15 McDonald :*Head coach: Morris McHone === === *4 V√≠ctor David D√≠az *5 Jos√© Hern√°ndez *6 Ernesto Mijares *7 Richard Lugo *8 Alex Quiroz *9 V√≠ctor Gonz√°lez *10 Armando Becker *11 Omar Walcott *12 Richard Medina *13 Gabriel Estaba *14 Iv√°n Olivares *15 Ludwing Iraz√°bal :*Head coach: Julio Toro == Bibliography == * == External links == *1997 Championship of the Americas for Men at fiba.basketball Category:FIBA AmeriCup squads ","title":"1997 Tournament of the Americas squads"},{"id":"63869736","text":"Greenwar is a 1994 role-playing game adventure published by Atlas Games for Cyberpunk 2020. ==Plot summary== Greenwar is an adventure in which the player characters are operatives attempting a hostile takeover of a shipping company.https://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=8295 ==Reviews== *Dragon #211 (Nov., 1994) ==References== Category:Cyberpunk (role-playing game) Category:Science fiction role-playing game adventures ","title":"Greenwar"},{"id":"63869740","text":"Mohammad Naji Abdulrahman Abo Ayed (, born 30 October 1993) is a Saudi Arabian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Pro League side Al-Fateh. ==Career== Mohammad Naji he started his career of Redhoa in Saudi Third Division.

The name refers to their appearance and the numbers refer to the milepoint (MP) from New York Penn Station. Originally built by Pennsylvania Railroad, they are owned and operated by Amtrak. They are slated for replacement as part of the Gateway Program, an infrastructure improvement program along the NEC. ==History== New York Tunnel Extension, 1912 The viaducts were built in 1907 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as part of its New York Tunnel Extension project, which included the Portal Bridge and the North River Tunnels. The bridges are east of the former Manhattan Transfer station. ==Junctions and interlockings== At this stretch of the Northeast Corridor, the rights-of-way of Amtrak, NJ Transit, PATH, and Conrail converge, run parallel, and re-align. Amtrak Bridge No. 7.80 carries two NEC tracks over four NJ Transit commuter rail tracks used by the Montclair-Boonton Line, the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch. Amtrak Bridge No. 7.96 carries the two NEC tracks over one track of PATH's Newark‚ÄìWorld Trade Center line and the single track Conrail (CRCX) Center Street Branch freight rail line.

It is generally used by NJ Transit's North Jersey Coast Line or Raritan Valley Line trains access to Hoboken Terminal on the Hudson Waterfront. ==Replacement and expansion to four tracks== The Sawtooth Bridges, considered a part of major bottleneck in the busiest section of the Northeast Corridor, are slated for replacement as part of the Gateway Program, an infrastructure improvement program along 10 miles of the rail line between Newark and New York. The plans call for expansion of the right-of-way to four tracks and would also include the construction of new bridges in the Kearny Meadows over Newark Turnpike and Belleville Turnpike. Initial stages of replacement of the nearby Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River began in 2019. In March 2020, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued an environmental assessment. Construction would involve the building of a new bridge (Sawtooth Bridge North), where service would be transferred during the demolition of existing Sawtooth Bridge south and building of its replacement. The project will also build new viaduct for NJ Transit Track 5. As of 2020, the projected year for completion was 2029. ==See also== * Kearny Junction * Bergen Tunnels * List of bridges, tunnels, and cuts in Hudson County, New Jersey * List of Northeast Corridor infrastructure * List of New Jersey railroad junctions == References == == External links == *Gateway Program *Amtrak Gateway Program Category:Amtrak bridges Category:Bridges completed in 1907 Category:NJ Transit bridges Category:Pennsylvania Railroad bridges Category:Railroad bridges in New Jersey Category:Bridges in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Kearny, New Jersey Category:Northeast Corridor ","title":"Sawtooth Bridges"},{"id":"63869879","text":"thumb Juan Carlos Jobet Eluchans is a Chilean politician and former member of Renovaci√≥n Nacional.

Clark was a classically trained pianist and cellist, who had worked as a music teacher in Adelaide, Australia for 5 years before moving to the US for his master's degree in cello performance at Cal State, Long Beach. The two easily became friends, and soon James engaged Clark to arrange songs for him, which evolved into playing together, vocal and cello. Clark came with James to a surprise gig he was offered at Vanessie, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and as soon as people heard them together, they realized they had something. James‚Äô five week gig became seven months for the two of them. Describing their style, Clark comments ‚ÄúEverything is so fused with everything, there are so many mashups of everything‚Äîlike this Steve Jobs opera [at the Santa Fe Opera] is EDM fused with classical. We fuse Bach with Elton John or Vivaldi with a Disney song; we're just trying to acknowledge our backgrounds in classical music, but play what we prefer, which is pop, rock and jazz.‚Äù Shortly, their popularity grew, and they were booked worldwide, and repeat resident artists, with about 50% of their work on several upscale cruise ship lines. \\"At this point,\\" says Clark, \\"I think about 40% of our audience is gay and the rest are just people who have come across us and enjoyed the music. We are both well-versed in the harmonic language of choral music. We tend to choose songs that are very melodic and lend themselves to a classical singing style.\\" \\"I think audiences sometimes expect that because I play cello, it's going to be sad, slow music, which isn't the case at all,\\" he adds. \\"A lot of pop bands have been incorporating cello on their recordings over the past ten years or so. The timbre and tone production is similar to the human voice.\\" In March 2020, during the Coronavirus Pandemic, the duo performed for a livestream by Seniorly, a series of Live Arts Performances tailored for seniors, especially those who are unable to enjoy performances in typical venues. They commented, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people suffering right now, and we feel it‚Äôs our calling as artists to entertain the public in times of crisis. Now is our chance to soothe and to help people escape from this unprecedented reality.‚Äù During this time Branden & James were also offering a series of their own livestreams, available on StageIt. These were made up of many of the offerings they had performed in their shows, as well as new material. In July the duo's new CD \\"Chasing Dreams\\" was released, to much acclaim. As Broadway World noted \\"BRANDEN & JAMES are bringing a soulful new sound to fans with the long-awaited release of their debut album, Chasing Dreams.\\" ==Discography== ===Singles=== * You Belong (2016) * Wicked Game (2017) * Silent Night (2018) * Shallow (2019) * Mad World (2020) ===Albums=== * Hallelujah EP (2018) * Chasing Dreams (2020) ==See also== Branden James == References == ==External links== * Category:American vocal groups Category:Vocal trios ","title":"Branden &amp; James"},{"id":"63869892","text":"Burrell Shields (September 6, 1929 ‚Äì January 15, 1997) was an American football halfback.

His music features themes such as anti-colonialism, socialism, feminism and imperialism. He has reported on Kurdish nationalism and recording the experiences of anti-ISIS fighters belonging to the YPG and YPJ militias during the Rojava‚ÄìIslamist conflict. His first book Serkeftin became one of the first major accounts by an English speaking journalist to gain access to the civil structures created by Kurdish militants in Rojava. Currently he is a contributor to RedFish Media and has created 10 short documentaries with them since 2018. == Biography == Marcel Cartier was born in Heildelberg, Germany on October 4, 1984. His mother is Finnish and his father is American. Much of his childhood was spent on military bases across the globe, traveling with his father while he worked for the US military. In his teenage years he was introduced to the music of Dead Prez and KRS-One, both of which influenced his own music later into his adult life. Cartier claims to have chosen hip-hop music as a career because he believes that this genre is easy for conveying political messages. Between 2002-2005 he was a member of the Communist Party USA and between 2009-2016 a member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Cartier's music often focuses on themes of Anti-Colonialism, Feminism, racism, Socialism, Palestinian statehood and Labor rights. Artists he has collaborated with include Akala, Lowkey, and Immortal Technique. For his music's contribution to the Palestinian solidarity movement he was awarded the honour of contributing to Lowkey's event 'Long Live Palestine' concert in 2011, organised by 'Sounds of Liberation' in Brooklyn, New York . Teaming up with the Palestinian solidarity group Existence is Resistance (EIR), he co-created the documentary Hip Hop is Bigger than the Occupation while taking part in an international delegation to Palestine alongside other hip-hop artists including Lowkey, Nana Dankwa, Mazzi, M1, and Dead Prez who happened to have been one of Cartier's teenage idols. Between 2014-2015 while working for RT he travelled to Iraq, Egypt, Cuba, North Korea, Turkey, Venezuela and Ukraine, during which he witnessed and reported on the War in Donbass. In 2015 he began working as a producer for Sputnik radio programs, a job he held until 2017. The German conservative daily newspaper FAZ has claimed that RedFish documentaries are being used as a propaganda outlet by Russia. == Journalism in Kurdistan == In Spring 2017 he witnessed the Syrian civil war while travelling with an international delegation to Syrian kurdistan, his journey facilitated by filmmaker Mehmet Aksoy who was killed by ISIS later that same year. While in Kurdistan he heavily interviewed and collected the experiences of anti-ISIS fighters belonging to the Women's Protection Units and People's Protection Units. Describing the environment in Rojava as ‚Äúa feeling, a spirit, the life and soul of a revolution‚Äù, he began centering much of his journalism and music around Kurdish issues. He recorded these experiences in his first book Serkeftin: A Narrative of the Rojava Revolution and published by Zero Books, the largest imprint of John Hunt Publishing. The Morning Star gave a positive review, while Publishers Weekly gave a mixed review describing the book as a \\"valuable and revealing account of the nascent institutions of Syria‚Äôs Kurdish warriors\\" but criticised it for its overuse of \\"uneven, utilitarian prose\\" and described him as having a \\"rose-coloured\\" outlook. Cartier later expanded his ideas on Kurdish nationalism within his second book, a self-published collection of essays which were originally published by TheRegion and titled Berxwedan: Writings on the Kurdish Freedom Movement. He was the U.S. West Asia Policy editor for TheRegion.org before the project's closure after the death of its lead editor. == Works == === Documentaries === * Exarchia: Resisting Gentrification * Oury Jalloh: Death in Cell #5 * Not In Our Hood: How People's Power Beat Amazon, Part 1 & 2 * Humanitarian Crisis In Hollywood * Battleground France: Who is Behind The Yellow Vests? * Freeing Santa's Slave * The New Battle For Nicaragua * Romaphobia: The Invisible Racism * War for Export: Germany‚Äôs Bloody Secret * The Forgotten Colony: Puerto Rico * Nazis & Nationalists: The Rise of Greece‚Äôs Far-Right * Hip Hop is Bigger than the Occupation (Co-creator, directed by Nana Dankwa, 2011) === Studio albums === *Act X: War on the Palaces (2019) *Revolutionary Minded Vol. 5 (2018) *Red Flag Revival (2017) *Invent the Future (2015) *United States of Hypocrisy (2015) *Invent the Future (2015) *Revolutionary Minded Vol. 4 (2014) *History Will Absolve Us (2012) *Revolutionary Minded Vol. 3 (2011) *Revolutionary Minded Vol. 2 (2009) *Revolutionary Minded Vol. 1 (2007) == References == Category:Living people Category:American hip hop musicians Category:American communists Category:American male journalists Category:1984 births ","title":"Marcel Cartier"},{"id":"63869959","text":"Sir Andrew Caradoc Hamilton, 10th Baronet (born 23 September 1953) is an English former first-class cricketer.

Carried by his vocation, he entered the Military College of the Nation, from where he graduated as an Infantry Second Lieutenant in December 1953. Later he completed his knowledge and training by taking courses in skydiving, meteorology, gravimetry, skiing and winter survival. He was chief of three Antarctic bases and accumulated 18,000 kilometers of Antarctic patrols. His activities include the exploration patrols that he carried out from the San Mart√≠n Base in 1958/9 and the Winter Terrestrial Expedition that he commanded in 1962 between the Esperanza and San Mart√≠n bases. His performance in these operations earned him in 1965 his designation as second Chief of Operation 90, the First Argentine Land Expedition to the South Pole. On November 30, 1971, he retired with the rank of Major and settled in Ushuaia, where he became one of the greatest promoters of Antarctic and Fuegian tourism. There he formed a commercial company that took international tourist contingents to Antarctica, whom I accompany annually until 1990. == Career path == === Exploration from the San Mart√≠n Base === In 1958, during the International Geophysical Year, Lieutenant Gir√≥ Tapper served as the commander of San Mart√≠n Base. The help of his team of 20 persons was indispensable for the Argentine Antarctic research efforts. During the overwintering period he conducted two important patrols with dog sleds. The first patrol took him 200 km to the south where he established a refuge called Nogal de Saldan (Saldon walnut). The second patrol crossed the Antarctic peninsula from Margarita Bay to the Weddell Sea. In 1959, the glacial conditions hindered the crew change and resupply of San Mart√≠n Base, leaving Tapper in charge of the station for one more year. This time he had a crew of six people and the base was in a state of emergency. Nevertheless, Tapper succeeded in leading two important patrols: a 600 km crossing on the frozen sea to the Henkes islands and the longest Argentine dog sled hike that reached to 72 o South, a return trip of no less than 800 kms === Esperanza - Antarctic Winter Antarctic Expedition === Esperanza Winter Antarctic Expedition In 1962, the then First Lieutenant Gir√≥ Tapper returned to Antarctica as the head of Esperanza Base. From Esperanza he conducted several land surveys which culminated with a patrol from the joint Army and Navy base ‚ÄúTeniente Matienzo‚Äù to the Antarctic Polar circle, all in all a trajectory of 457 kms. Later, during the coldest months with the least daylight, Tapper led the First Antarctic Overland Winter Expedition. The main mission of the Expedition was to connect Esperanza with San Mart√≠n base (in disuse since February 28, 1960). Its secondary mission was to acquire experience in severe winter, complete a scientific and technical program, prepare the personnel for an expedition to the South Pole and to test different equipment and techniques in extreme climatic conditions and complicated terrain. For this end, Tapper chose a route that crossed a mountainous area with glaciers, across the Antarctandes and along the Larsen Ice Shelf. The traverse covered more than 1800 km in track vehicles and 1500 km with eight-dogsleds. The trip lasted from June 14 to October 25, that is, more than four polar winter months. Gir√≥ Tapper wrote about the trip: ‚Äú... the cold surface of the sea, no more than 20 cm thick, covered the ocean waters‚Ä¶‚Äù Winds blowing at 220 km/h‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äútemperature at 43 o degrees below zero‚Ä¶ hours in darkness and complete silence‚Ä¶ in complete abandon...; between deep cracks and deadly open mouths hiding under the thin bridges of snow.‚Äù === Belgrano Base === In 1965, Captain Gir√≥ Tapper assumed the position as the head of Belgrano Base. Belgrano was the designated starting point for the ‚ÄúOperation 90‚Äù, the overland expedition to the South Pole that was supposed to take place in 1966/67, after acquiring the necessary knowledge, equipment and supplies. Tapper‚Äôs mission was to establish a secondary operational base to the south from the Filchner ice shelf and equip it with 50 tons of supplies. The base was meant to be manned with six persons carrying out scientific observations during the 1966 polar night. To this end, Tapper was in command of nine tracked vehicles, two packs of dogs and one plane with skates. Between January 19th and April 2nd, the vehicles made five trips, covering 4000 km in total. Traversing areas with dangerous crevasses, Tapper and his crew transported 110 tons of supplies to the location designated for the new base. The airplane flew 9000 km and the fourteen expeditioners, headed by Gir√≥ Tapper, transported nine tons of cargo for constructing the Advanced Science Base ‚ÄúAlf√©rez de Nav√≠o Sobral‚Äù (Navy Ensign Sobral) at 420 km from Belgrano Base. The station was occupied by its first crew of four men. Thus, in barely three months Gir√≥Tapper and his crew managed to complete the tasks designated for two years. This meant that the long- awaited approach to the South Pole could start ahead of time. === Operation 90 === Sno-Cat used in Operation 90 On October 2, 1965, the Chief of the Expedition, the then Colonel Jorge Edgard Leal, arrived with an airplane. Captain Gir√≥ Tapper became the second chief and the Scientific Director of the ‚ÄúOperation 90‚Äù. The march towards the South Pole started on October 26th. Gir√≥ drove a snow-cat ‚ÄúCordoba‚Äù. But in addition to his leadership obligations, he was also tasked with meteorological observations in a mobile station at three hour intervals throughout the journey, glaciological measurements of accumulation lines at every 10 km and gravimetric measurements at every 20 km. In addition, he had to film the activities of the expedition with a video camera , resulting in a colour documentary called ‚ÄúOperation 90‚Äù. The three snow-cats reached the South Geographic Pole on December 10, 1965, with the temperature at minus 30 degrees below zero. They raised the Argentine flag on an improvised flag pole made of an antenna mast. Today, this mast constitutes Historic Site and Monument No 1 of the Antarctic Treaty. The arrival at the South Pole was a success partly owing to prior exploratory experience, but so was the return: in barely 21 days, on December 31, the expeditioners returned to their starting point, having covered 2892 km in 66 days. === Later projects === Gir√≥ Tapper‚Äôs drive and ingenuity did not end at the South Pole. Before being relieved from his duties at Belgrano Base, he and another official organised a parachute jump 30 km from the base on January 12, 1966. They jumped together with three dogs, a collapsible sled, foodstuff and survival equipment ‚àí essentially a flying dog sled patrol which could be used for search and rescue missions. In just a few days before the jump, he had presented a project to conduct a Transpolar Scientific Expedition in 1969/70. This expedition would have connected the furthest extremes of the Antarctic continent via the Pole of Inaccessibility, thus crossing the least known areas of the continent. Had this project been approved, it would have been the toughest Antarctic expedition of all times. == References == # Adolfo Quevedo Paiva, Medio siglo del Ej√©rcito Argentino en nuestra Ant√°rtida 1951-2001 (Buenos Aires: Dunken, 2001). # Adolfo Quevedo Paiva, Historia de la Ant√°rtida (Buenos Aires, Argentinidad, 2012) Category:2004 deaths Category:1931 births Category:Explorers of Antarctica Category:People from C√≥rdoba, Argentina Category:Argentine explorers Category:20th-century Argentine military personnel ","title":"Gustavo Gir√≥ Tapper"},{"id":"63870057","text":"The Grey Knight is an adventure published by Chaosium in 1986 for the Arthurian fantasy role-playing game Pendragon. ==Plot summary== The Lady in Black arrives at Camelot's Easter jousting tournament and challenges anyone to fight to the death for King Arthur against her champion, the Grey Knight, over the matter of a shameful incident in Arthur's past. Sir Gawaine accepts the challenge, and the combat is set for six weeks hence. The adventurers, who are all Knights of the Round Table, are sent on a quest to find a special whetstone, one of the Thirteen Treasures of Britain, which will be the key to Gawaine's victory. ==Publication history== The Grey Knight, the first adventure published for Pendragon, was written by Larry DiTillio with art by Susan Seddon Boulet, direction by Greg Stafford, and editing and production by Charlie Krank, and was published by Chaosium in 1987 as a 56-page book. ==Reception== In the April 1987 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #88), Paul Cockburn thought The Grey Knight was \\"an excellent role-playing adventure. The balance between cameo role-playing, action encounters and player 'detective' work is just right... The few props are useful, and the artwork captures the romantic atmosphere.\\" He also complimented the layout, in which relevant notes were printed in the margin, saying, \\"The generous notes in the margin make running the adventure fairly easy.\\" Cockburn did note that \\"a clearer summary of the adventure for the GM would have been of more use.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"The Grey Knight is the most useful addition to Pendragon so far, and helps set the tone for the game.\\" In the September 1987 edition of Dragon (Issue #125), Ken Rolston gave this adventure high marks, calling it \\"A solid winner, best-in-show. This has first-class visuals, superb narrative values, an innovative layout that permits ease of reference with minimum interference with the narrative, and creditable showings in the staging and nice-bits categories.\\" Although Rolston admired the artwork and layout, he thought \\"The adventure itself is the real prize. The author, Larry DiTillio, is a master narrative technician, and he‚Äôs working with the rich resources of the Arthurian legend and the unique Pendragon game system, designed by Greg Stafford to support moral dilemmas and tests of character as well as hack-and-slash combat and fireball barbecues.\\" Rolston also complimented the usefulness of the margin notes, but did note that the statistics of the monsters were not given in the adventure ‚Äî the gamemaster has to refer to the main Pendragon rules for those -- and no staging tips for comobats were provided.

Launched in 1999, she has served her entire career maintaining navigational aids in Southeast Alaska. == Construction == Anthony Petit was built by Marinette Marine Corporation in Marinette, Wisconsin. She was the eighth of the fourteen Keeper-class vessels completed. The contract price for the entire class was $220 million, suggesting that the original cost of Anthony Petit was approximately $15.7 million. The ship was launched on January 30, 1999 into the Menominee River. Speakers at the christening ceremony included Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski, and Coast Guard Commandant Admiral James Loy. The hull is built of welded steel plate. The ship is long and has a beam of . Her draft is . Keeper-class ships, including Anthony Petit, use z-drives for propulsion instead of fixed propellers and rudders. The z-drives may be synchronized to point in the same direction when underway. The ship is steered by changing the direction of the thrust. For fine maneuvering or station keeping while working on a buoy, the two z-drives may be pointed in different directions. These are combined with a bow thruster to allow the ship to remain at the same spot in the sea, a capability known as dynamic positioning. The two z-drives are powered by two Caterpillar 3508 TA Diesel engines. Electrical power is provided by three Caterpillar 3406 generators. The ship has a 42-foot long boom crane capable of lifting 10 tons onto her buoy deck. This allows floating buoys to be hoisted aboard for maintenance. The buoy deck is 1,335 square feet in area. Anthony Petit, as all Keeper-class buoy tenders, has an ice-strengthened hull so that she may continue to service navigational aids in light ice conditions. There is an \\"ice-belt\\" of thicker steel at the ship's waterline to resist ice damage to the hull. The bow is shaped to ride up over the ice and crush it with the ship's weight. Her performance in ice conditions varies with the quality of the ice, the amount of power applied, and other factors. At full-throttle, the ship can maintain a speed of 2 knots in smooth ice thick, but various operational considerations argue against breaking ice this thick. Anthony Petit has one ship's boat, an long Cutterboat ATON ‚Äì Medium (CB-ATON-M). This boat was estimated to cost $210,000. The ship's namesake is U.S. Coast Guard Chief Boatswain's Mate Anthony Petit, the keeper of the Scotch Cap lighthouse on the west end of Unimak Island in the Aleutians. Petit and four other members of his crew were killed in a tsunami which destroyed the lighthouse on April 1, 1946. == Operational history == Buoy maintenance on Anthony Petit in 2018 After her launch and sea trials, Anthony Petit sailed down the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and through the Panama Canal to reach Ketchikan, Alaska, her homeport for her entire career. She arrived in January 2000. The ship is stationed at Coast Guard Base Ketchikan. She replaced USCGC Planetree at this station. Her primary mission is maintaining 274 fixed and floating aids to navigation in Southeast Alaska. The ship has also performed other Coast Guard missions. Anthony Petit participated in search and rescue activities as with the charter boat Fishin' Fool in 2002, fishing vessel Yvonne Denise in 2005, the ferry Lituya in 2009, and the fishing vessel Tsimshian Lady in 2017. Anthony Petit has trained extensively on oil spill containment. She has participated in several joint United States-Canada exercises to prepare for a possible spill in the Dixon Entrance area. She has deployed the vessel of opportunity skimming system (VOSS) several times in training. == References == Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard Category:1999 ships ","title":"USCGC Anthony Petit (WLM-558)"},{"id":"63870191","text":"Styphelia planifolia is a small shrub (growing from 0.35 to 2 m high) in the family Ericaceae native to Western Australia.

From 1994 to 1995, he was a research assistant in the Flow Cytometry Department of the Alabama Reference Lab in Montgomery, Alabama. From 1997 to 2000, Bright worked at the Emory University Department of Microbiology and Immunology and in the Vaccine Research Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1998 to 2002, Bright worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Influenza Branch, Immunology and Viral Pathogenesis Section, where he studied Influenza A virus subtype H5N1. From 2002 to 2003, Bright shifted to working at the pharmaceutical company, Altea Therapeutics (a subsidiary of Nitto Denko) in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was a senior research scientist in their Vaccine and Immunology Programs. In 2003, Bright rejoined the CDC as an immunologist/virologist in their Disease Control and Prevention, Influenza Division, Strain Surveillance Branch in Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked on their influenza antiviral drug program and focused on avian influenza. He held that position until 2006. From 2006 to 2008, Bright returned to working in the private sector of the biotechnology industry at Novavax in Maryland, where he was vice president of their global influenza programs as well as of their vaccine research and development. For his work there, he was an adviser to the WHO and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and became the recipient of the prestigious Charles C.

In February 2008, Bright worked at the non-profit PATH on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant funded project as the director in vaccine manufacturing capacity building in Viet Nam. He was also the scientific director of the influenza vaccine project as well as the global vaccine development program, a position he held until October 2010. In 2010, Bright joined the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) governmental agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). He was the program lead of BARDA International Programs, then in June 2011 became acting chief of the influenza antiviral drug advanced development program, a position he held until December 2011. From June 2011 to December 2015, he was both deputy director and acting director of BARDA's Influenza and Emerging Diseases Division, eventually serving as director of the division from December 2014 to November 2016. From February 2016 to November 2016, he was an incident commander in the ASPR/BARDA Zika Response. On November 15, 2016, after a competitive selection process, President Obama appointed Bright to the position of director of BARDA. Bright succeeded founding director Robin Robinson. In addition to his role as director of BARDA, Bright was also deputy assistant secretary for Preparedness and Response in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). On April 20, 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Bright was reassigned to the National Institutes of Health. An HHS spokesperson said Bright's new role will be to help \\"accelerate the development and deployment of novel point-of-care testing platforms\\". Bright characterized his transfer as a retaliatory demotion and asked the HHS Inspector General to investigate it. As of May 5, Bright had not reported to NIH to start his new assignment. === COVID-19 whistleblower complaint === On May 5, 2020, Bright filed a whistleblower complaint (\\"Complaint of Prohibited Personnel Practice and Other Prohibited Activity\\") against the HHS in the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that protects whistleblowers. The complaint included accompanying exhibits only some of which have become public,https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20200514/110749/HHRG-116-IF14-Transcript-20200514.pdf alleging that his early warnings about the coronavirus were ignored. In his complaint, Bright asked to be reinstated as director at BARDA, accusing the Trump administration of removing him from his position and demoting him to an NIH post in retaliation for his warnings about the virus and his opposition to off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that was promoted by President Donald Trump and his supporters as a potential miracle drug for COVID-19, but which increased mortality in subjects. Bright suggested that the administration prioritized \\"cronyism over science\\" and was pressured to let politics drive decisions rather than science. On May 8, 2020, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel determined that there were \\"reasonable grounds to believe\\" that the Trump administration's HHS had unlawfully retaliated against Bright, in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, \\"because he made protected disclosures in the best interest of the American public.\\" The office recommended that Bright be reinstated as head of BARDA while the investigation is undertaken. However, the recommendation was not binding on HHS, and Bright was not reinstated. In written testimony at a May 14, 2020 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee (issued the previous day), Bright warned that \\"the darkest winter in modern history\\" could come in 2020 if the country failed to undertake a vigorous response to fight the virus: \\"Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities.\\" Bright told the subcommittee that \\"Lives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost\\" as a result of the administration's failure to heed his earlier warnings. Bright is represented by attorney Debra Katz in connection with his whistleblower complaint. Trump dismissed Bright as a \\"disgruntled employee\\" in Twitter posts. On October 6, 2020, Bright resigned from the government. In an addendum to his whistleblower complaint, Bright stated that, following his demotion, he had been given \\"no meaningful work\\" since September 4; that NIH officials had rejected his proposals for a national COVID-19 testing strategy \\"because of political considerations\\"; and that officials had ignored his request that he join the $10 billion Operation Warp Speed initiative to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. == References == ==External links== * *Scientific Integrity in the COVID-19 Response.

His earliest contacts with the world of entertainment came through his younger brothers, Lauri Wylie, who was first active as an actor in the late 1890s, and G. B. Samuelson, who operated cinemas. About 1910, Julian Wylie became the business manager and agent of David Devant, a leading illusionist.Albert Edward Wilson, Pantomime pageant: a procession of harlequins, clowns, comedians (1946) p. 126: \\"Wylie was a Lancashire man and began as an accountant. His first association with the entertainment industry was when he became business manager to David Devant, the illusionist. After that he joined forces with James W. Tate...\\" Another story is that Wylie married a much older woman with a small son, she lent him one pound, and he established himself in London as an agent.

The two men were quite different, Tate mild and genial, getting on easily with everyone, Wylie suspicious and aggressive, with a deep sense of inferiority. A nervous personality, Wylie suffered from mood swings, from rage to cheerful optimism.

Through the skill of Wylie, the Drury Lane pantomime was briefly brought back to Drury Lane in 1929. By the end of his life he had produced over a hundred pantomimes and was known as \\"the King of pantomime\\", a title also given to others later. ==Death== Willesden Jewish Cemetery Wylie died suddenly on 6 December 1934 at 3:15 in the morning, aged 56.

In 1829 he surveyed and published \\"A new Parish Atlas of Ayrshire, Part 1, Cuninghame District\\" in Beith, North Ayrshire. ==The new Parish atlas of Ayrshire and other maps== Robert Aitken's map of Beith The 'proposal' for potential subscribers at the beginning of the work gives information of the layout of the atlas, together with the detail that: \\"Each map will contain the names of every House within the Parish - the whole Roads, Turnpike, Parochial, and Private - and the Rivers and Streams. Each Map will contain the names of the principal Heritors, and sundry Statistical and Historical Notices\\". Aitken was successful in his attempt to attract sufficient subscribers, 86 being listed; he had stated that he needed 100 in the 1827 'proposal'. The list of subscribers is impressive in its coverage of the artistocracy and significant land owners in Ayrshire suggesting a degree of co-operation indicating close contacts within the landowners of Ayrshire. The titled subscribers and those with high military ranks are listed separately. From 1829 he started to publish the present work in Beith with surveys of all 16 parishes, on a scale of 2 inches to 1 statute mile. The atlas is dedicated to Archibald William Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, 1st Earl of Winton (1812‚Äì1861), and contains a detailed distance table of towns within the county. The publication was a folio of 14 maps, surveyed by Robert Aitken and W. Ballantine of 14 Terrace, Leith Street, Edinburgh was the lithographer for all the parish maps. It is not recorded how many atlases were printed, however 86 subscribers are listed. One copy bears the unusual bookplate of a fellow contemporary land surveyor, Andrew Crawford of Dalry, a gentleman of some standing, who was the chairman of Dalry Burns club from 1828 to 1843.Dalry Burns Club He is not listed amongst the subscribers.

By 1827 Aitken had completed his survey of the Parish of Beith and the response was that it \\"had met with the approbation of Gentlemen of Scientific knowledge and taste;\\" who had encouraged him to cover the other Cuninghame parishes. He had plans for surveying Kyle and Carrick depended upon the success of the Cuninghame atlas but they never came to fruition.

The tank had supposedly been completely drained ten months earlier, but ignition occurred, causing a plume of combusting gas to rise. Two workers near the top felt the heat and rushed to the safety of scaffolding outside, while the other 40 workers died as the concrete cap on the tank rose in the air and then came crashing back down, crushing them to death. The incident was the worst industrial accident in Staten Island's history. It resulted in a moratorium on liquefied natural gas storage facilities in New York state. ==Background== At the time of the incident, Rossville, Bloomfield, and other Staten Island neighborhoods had numerous liquefied natural gas storage tanks. In 1970, Distrigas had announced plans to build nine gas tanks in Rossville, of which two were built. Opposition to such tanks developed slowly, but by 1971, many Staten Island residents were opposed to the construction of gas tanks. Gene and Edwina Cosgriff formed the group Bring Legal Action to Stop the Tanks (BLAST) to protest the tanks' construction after hearing about the theoretical negative effects of an oil spill within the nearby Arthur Kill waterway. Patrick A. Mercurio, BLAST's chairman, later said that according to scientists, \\"an explosion of a tank filled with gas would extend to an area eight miles by one mile‚Äîthe equivalent of a small nuclear explosion\\". The particular gas tank that exploded had a capacity of 660,000 barrels, and was tall with a diameter of . The tank was owned by Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline (TETCo) and had supposedly been drained in April 1972. However, the tank had a polyurethane lining, which enabled gas to be trapped inside the lining even after the liquid had been drained. At the time of the explosion, the men were sealing cracks in the plastic lining of the tank. The roof of the tank was designed to collapse in the event of an explosion. TETCo officials had been \\"fanatical about safety\\", and even on the day before the explosion, February 9, 1973, TETCo officials called Staten Island residents \\"hysterical\\" for raising concerns about the danger of storing gas near residential areas. ==Incident== The explosion occurred on February 10, 1973, at about 1:00 p.m. EST. Jose Lema and Joseph Pecora, two survivors of the explosion, said that just before the explosion occurred, the space had heated up and a low \\"woof\\" could be heard from the ceiling. Pecora tapped Lema on the shoulder and the two workers escaped out of the stairway. Lema reported a loud explosion after the two men had escaped through an opening in the dome, though Pecora did not remember any sound. Another worker, John Carroll, had been on the roof and ran down the embankment around the tank, escaping with minor injuries. Hundreds of first responders went to the site, including New York City Fire Department rescue companies 1 and 2, and found the bodies at about 1:00 a.m. EST on February 11. Rescuers developed a system to retrieve the corpses. Rescue and truck companies worked in shifts to recover the bodies, with one rescue company being assisted by several truck companies at any given time. Most of the bodies were retrieved quickly, with 28 victims having been extricated by February 12. The recovery process was stymied by the presence of debris on the site, including granite slabs from the roof of the tank. The last body was not retrieved until February 22. A few bodies were identified by artifacts such as \\"rings, watches, and bracelets\\". Some sources claimed that 43 workers were killed, possibly based on initial media reports that counted Lema, Pecora, and Carroll, though the final death toll was 40. ==Aftermath== The incident was the deadliest industrial accident in Staten Island's history. Investigators from the New York City Fire Department and from the United States Department of Labor found that natural gas pockets had been found both in the tank itself and in surrounding areas. Massachusetts Institute of Technology mechanical- engineering professor James A. Fay said that TETCo's storage of liquefied natural gas and naphtha, both volatile substances, was very dangerous. Experts from the gas industry disputed the fact that the explosion could have been caused by gas, saying \\"a construction accident\\" was the cause of the explosion. In response to TETCo's claim that the liner was not flammable, scientists at the United States Bureau of Mines built a model of the tank and set it on fire, observing that the model had burned in a similar manner to the real tank. After investigators suggested that the tank may have been sabotaged, two TETCo workers confessed to breaking the lining to extend the tenure of their jobs, and were fired. Politicians quickly took regulatory action. The New York City Council passed a bill imploring the New York City Department of City Planning to prohibit any gas storage tanks from being constructed. Mayor John Lindsay signed a bill on March 25 that prevented the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals from granting zoning variances for tanks, meaning that they could not be larger than . The explosion resulted in a moratorium on liquefied natural gas storage facilities in New York state. The construction of two under-construction tanks in Rossville was subsequently abandoned. The Public Service Electric and Gas Company attempted to store natural gas in the two tanks, but dropped these plans in 1984 due to opposition. The statewide ban was repealed in January 2015, except within New York City, where it remained active. Numerous lawsuits were filed by the estates of the victims, the first having been filed in December 1973. TETCo was charged with 40 counts of negligent homicide in 1974. Two years later, courts reached settlements of a combined $11 million in 33 civil lawsuits related to the explosion. The tank's site was cleared in 1993 and bought by NASCAR in 2004; since then, it has lain unused. ==References== Category:1973 in New York City Category:1973 disasters in the United States Category:1973 industrial disasters Category:Building fires in New York City Category:Construction accidents in the United States Category:Explosions in 1973 Category:Gas explosions in the United States Category:History of Staten Island Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United States ","title":"1973 Staten Island gas explosion"},{"id":"63870484","text":"This is a list of schools in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. ==High schools== There are three Diocesan and/or parish high schools under the auspices of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens.

In 1955, the modernised variant, called the S-4M, was introduced; it was put out of production in 1958. In total, 29,582 units were built. In former East Germany, the S-4 combine was built under licence by the IFA as the Fortschritt E 170 series (E 171, E 173, E 174, E 175, E 176, and E 177), from 1954 until 1967. Unlike the original S-4, which is powered by an otto engine, the Fortschritt E 170 series combines were all powered by a diesel engine, and some of them came with a chaff waggon rather than a straw waggon. The S-4 is the first self-propelled Soviet combine harvester, it succeeded the S-1, one of the early 1930s Soviet pulled combine harvesters. There is no evidence of existing S-2 and S-3 models, it is therefore likely that they were both cancelled during the development phase. When the S-4 was introduced in 1947, it was first built at the Krasnoyarsk combine harvester plant. The second generation of self-propelled Soviet combine harvesters, the SK-3, was introduced in 1958. In East Germany, the successor to the Fortschritt E 170 series was the Fortschritt E 512, an entirely new combine harvester, designed from scratch. A transition model, called the Fortschritt E 510, which was still based upon the 1947 S-4, had been developed, but was eventually not put into series production. == Technical description == The S-4 is a conventional straw-walker combine harvester, and has front-wheel drive. The front axle has a track width of approximately 2400 mm, the rear axle has a track width of approximately 910 mm. The engine torque is sent through a manual four-speed gearbox with an additional two-speed reduction gearbox, and from the gearbox output shaft to the front axle with a belt. The belt's length is fixed, thus not allowing continuous variable driving speed. The corn passes through the S-4 in longitudinal fashion. This means that it enters the combine in front, and gets pulled into the mid-mounted threshing drum; the straw exits the machine in back, after getting cleaned in the straw walkers, which are installed in the S-4's rear compartment. Both four metre, and a three-metre headers, hydraulically adjustable in height from 60...700 mm, were available for the S-4. The reel, cutter bar, header auger and corn conveyor are driven mechanically by belts and chains. The reel speed can be adjusted by swapping cogwheels in the header drivetrain, the S-4 does not have fine reel speed adjusting. The threshing drum has a width of 865 mm and a diameter of 550 mm. It is equipped with 8 rasp bars. It is driven by a belt, that is hydraulically adjustable in length (continuously variable transmission), in order to adjust the threshing drum speed. The speed is adjustable between 385 und 1350 min‚àí1. The concave's distance from the threshing drum can be adjusted with three turnbuckles. The S-4 has four straw walkers, and two adjustable sieves. The corn tank holds up to 1300 kg of corn. The original S-4 is powered by a 5.6 litre, 39 kW ZIS-120 otto engine. This engine has a very high fuel consumption of 18‚Äì20 litres per hour and was not well-suited for East Germany. East German Fortschritt E 170 series combines were instead fitted with the IFA EM 4-15-5 diesel engine, a swirl-chamber injected 6.024 dm3 four-cylinder unit, producing 40 kW at 1500/min. Its peak power is up to 44 kW. The engine is mounted in front, next to the driver's seat. == Fortschritt models == The Fortschritt models are almost exact copies of the S-4, however, there are some differences, that are reflected by the different types of Fortschritt E 170 series combine harvesters. As mentioned, the main difference between the S-4 and its Fortschritt versions is the engine; all Fortschritt combine harvesters have a GDR-made diesel engine, as well as other GDR-specific parts, such as the wheels. Also, the technical drawings had to be converted from the Soviet GOST standard to the German DIN standard. The following list summarises the Fortschritt models' key characteristics: *E 171: Like the base S-4, with a corn tank, and a chaff waggon. *E 173: Like the E 171, but smaller header with a cutting width of 3 m. *E 174: Improved 3 m header with a hydraulically adjustable reel, sack filler instead of corn tank; has a chaff waggon. *E 175: Like the E 174, but with a 1.8 m3 corn tank. *E 176: Like the E 175, but without a chaff waggon. *E 177: Like the E 176, but with a sack filler instead of a corn tank. The Fortschritt E 175 and E 177 soon became the standard models of the Fortschritt E 170 series, and are thus the models with the highest production figures. Fortschritt E 170 series combines were produced in Weimar (1954‚Äì1962) and then in Singwitz (1962‚Äì1967). The total Weimar production is 6,573 units. == References == C.

A collection of regular, and adjacent, street traders forms a street market. Where traders operate on their own, from a regular location, these are variously described as isolated pitches, scattered sites, or miscellaneous sites. Peripatetic traders are termed pedlars. ==History== The Brill in Somers Town circa 1858 Cheapside was the oldest known market in London, possibly established in the late ninth century during the reign of King Alfred. The large number of street markets in London is due to the 1327 granting of market rights to the City of London. This allowed the City to control the establishment of markets within a radius of six and two thirds miles [10.7 km] \\"being the distance a person could be expected to walk to market, sell his produce and return in a day\\". The City's market rights caused London's markets to develop differently from the rest of England in their own legislative framework. The City of London used these rights to prevent the establishment of private markets within the growing urban area outside of the City. Since shops were still a rarity and street trading fell outside the definition of a market, street traders would collect produce from the City's wholesale markets and wheel it to busy thoroughfares on carts from which they would then sell. This practice continued into the late twentieth century: > Albert died when George was 12 and he left school to earn a living. He was > charged with taking a horse-pulled cart to Covent Garden, load up with > produce, and drive it through crowded streets to Inverness Street Market, > where his brother Billy ran stalls. Traders were self-regulating. They paid no fees and were subject to no legislation or bylaws. ===London Labour and the London Poor=== Henry Mayhew‚Äôs 1851 survey of London lists 37 street markets comprising 3,137 stalls with an additional 9,000 street traders not fixed to a street market. ===Early regulation=== Fishmonger on Earlham Street Market circa 1877 In 1867, section six of the Metropolitan Streets Act effectively prohibited street trading: > No goods or other articles shall be allowed to rest on any footway or other > part of a street within the limits of this Act, or be otherwise allowed to > cause obstruction or inconvenience to the passage of the public, for a > longer time than may be absolutely necessary for loading or unloading such > goods or other articles. Following public meetings and press criticism, the act was amended within weeks. Section one of the Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act 1867 exempted traders: > The sixth section of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, prohibiting the > deposit of goods in the streets, shall not apply to costermongers, street > hawkers, or itinerant traders, so long as they carry on their business in > accordance with the regulations from time to time made by the Commissioner > of Police, with the approval of the Secretary of State. Whilst the legal threat to the livelihoods of traders had receded, street traders were now subject to regulation by the police. The police required that stalls were no more than wide deep and apart from each other. Where the police deemed a stall to be obstructing the public highway, they could be confiscated and traders would need to pay for the storage along with a fine. ===London County Council‚Äôs survey=== In 1893, the London County Council‚Äôs survey of London's markets listed 112 street markets. These markets comprised 5,292 stalls, 4,502 belonging to costermongers and the rest being maintained by shopkeepers. ===Beginning of licensing=== The London County Council (General Powers) Act 1927 replaced police regulation with a new licensing regime administered by metropolitan borough councils. ===Current management of markets=== Petticoat Lane Market in 2006 Despite reorganisations of London's local government and changes to the underlying legislation, the licensing regime has continued. As of 2020, street trading in London is regulated under the London Local Authorities Act 1990 (as amended) and/or the Food Act 1984 (Part III), depending on the local authority. Whilst the London Local Authorities Act allows the regulation of street trading on private roads and areas open to the public within 7 metres of any road or footway, most local authorities only regulate street trading on the public highway. In 2014 there were 43 street markets in central London (Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, and Wandsworth). In the early 21st Century, the City of London has taken a much more circumscribed interpretation of its market rights, limiting itself to wholesale markets. This has allowed a proliferation of farmers, niche, and street-food markets on private land in central London. There were 27 private markets in central London in 2014. Independent management of street markets Whilst most street markets are managed by local authorities, some are managed by volunteers or private companies: * Lower Marsh has been managed by a local business improvement district, WeAreWaterloo since 2012, * Venn Street is run by a community group, and * Swiss Cottage Wednesday farmers market has been managed by London Farmers‚Äô Markets since 1999. A number of other markets have been relaunched, and run, by volunteers before been taken back into local authority management: * Broadway Market was relaunched by the Broadway Market Traders and Residents Association in 2004 though management has now reverted to Hackney Council, * between 2010 and 2018 Chatsworth Market was managed by Chatsworth Road Resident and Traders Association, and * from 2013 to 2015 Queen's Crescent was run by the Queen's Crescent Community Association. ==Citations== Category:Bazaars Market Category:London society ","title":"Street markets in London"},{"id":"63870558","text":"The FIL Junior World Cup Luge on Natural Track is a competition series organized by the International Luge Federation (FIL) in natural track luge and was used to promote the international development of the sport as a replacement introduced to the Intercontinental Cup (IC Cup, later European Cup) by the FIL. ==History== Since winter 2014/15 it has been held annually from December to February. In four races, the overall winners in the disciplines single seater women , single seater men and double seater are determined for the junior and youth classes. Both men and women can compete in the double seater, but the participants are almost exclusively men. All athletes with a valid FIL license who are at least 15 years old and not yet 21 years old in the year in which the season ends, are eligible to participate. A maximum of six women in single-seaters, six men in single-seaters and three pairs of two-seaters can participate in a World Cup race per national association. The result of a World Cup race is determined by the sum of the times achieved in two rounds. In exceptional weather or track conditions, the race can also be decided in a single pass. The starting order in the first run is determined by the progress in the World Cup ranking. The World Cup leader starts last and the athletes with the fewest or no World Cup points start first. The overall result of the previous year is decisive in the first season race. The second round starts after the fallen classification of the first run, so the halftime leader starts last. Before each scoring round, at least one forerunner must be on the track. == Awarding of points and overall rating == For each World Cup race, World Cup points are awarded according to the FIL point scheme. The winner receives 100 points, the second place 85 points, the third place 70 points and the further ranks fewer and fewer points, up to place 39, for which two points are awarded. All athletes from 40th place receive a World Cup point.https://www.fil-luge.org/en/rules/rules-natural- track ==References== Category:Natural track luge competitions Category:World youth sports competitions ","title":"FIL Junior World Cup Luge on Natural Track"},{"id":"63870568","text":"Paishacha marriage (Hindi: ‡§™‡•à‡§∂‡§æ‡§ö ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π) has been defined in Manu Smriti in section IV - Eight types of marriage (Verse 3.34)Manusmriti with the Commentary of Medhatithi by Ganganatha Jha  1920  1,381,940 words  (https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of- medhatithi/d/doc199802.html) SuptƒÅ·πÉ mattƒÅ·πÉ pramattƒÅ·πÉ vƒÅ raho yatropagacchati  Sa pƒÅpi·π£·π≠ho vivƒÅhƒÅnƒÅ·πÉ pai≈õƒÅca≈õcƒÅ·π£·π≠amo'dhama·∏•  Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡§ó‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§§‡§ø‡•§ ‡§∏ ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡•à‡§∂‡§æ‡§ö‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§Æ‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ß‡§Æ‡§É‡•• When a man kidnap or takes away a woman and have Sexual intercourse with her during her sleep, or while she is drunken or intoxicated or unconscious or mentally challenged, it is called Paishacha marriage.

He served as the head of the Vilnius Gestapo (Secret State Police) in German-occupied Lithuania and personally killed Jacob Gens. == Biography == He became an SA (Sturmabteilung) of the original paramilitary wing of the NSDAP in 1931 (party number 1086615). In 1938, he joined the SS (SS number: 266047) and worked for the SDHA (Sicherheitsdiensthauptamt), the headquarters of the intelligence agency of the SS and NSDAP. As the Third Reich annexed Austria, he worked for the Kripo (KriminalPolizei) and the Staatspolizei (state police) in Vienna from 1938 to 1940. He was promoted to Kriminalkommissar of the Prussian zone in 1941. From February 1942 to October 1943, he was obersturmf√ºhrer and headed the Vilnius Gestapo as the Vilna Ghetto was in a \\"quiet\\" phase. He was commander of the Einsatzkommando 3 and took part in the Ponary massacre. He imposed the concept of \\"collective responsibility\\" where relatives of someone who escaped were executed. As such he ordered the murders of 32 relatives after the escape of several young Jewish partisans on 24 July 1943. At the end of July 1943, Neugebauer set up economic restrictions on the Jewish activities (e.g. no more night work, exclusion from trading from 4 August 1943). On 3 September, one testimony describes Neugebauer sparing the life of an HKP 52 worker. On 4 September 1943, he murdered Jacob Gens, the leader of the Judenrat (ghetto government), after he reported himself. Gens was accused by the Gestapo of prividing money to the FPO (United Partisan Organization). He ordered Bruno Kittel to liquidate the Vilna Ghetto on 22-23 September 1943 and was then transferred to the Kovno Ghetto. At the end of 1944, he was seconded to Budapest by the Darmstadt Gestapo as the Budapest Ghetto was being created and the Red Army was closing in since the beginning of the offensive on the town in 19 October 1944. He was awarded the War Merit Cross First Class with swords (Kriegsverdienstkreuz 1.Klasse mit Schwertern) for exceptional service \\"not in direct connection with combat\\".

She was the youngest of the seven children of Patrick and Margaret Moclair (n√©e Carew). Her father was evicted from his farm by the local unionist politician and landlord, Arthur Smith- Barry, in March 1888. As a local organiser during the Plan of Campaign, her father was arrested and jailed a number of times, finally having his farm and home restored to him in 1911. Moclair attended the Presentation convent, Cashel and later the Ursuline convent, Waterford. She entered University College Dublin to study medicine, graduating MB, BCh, BAO in 1921 and DPH in 1922. She could also speak Irish fluently, and was an accomplished mezzo- soprano singer, winning the Denis O'Sullivan medal at the 1921 Feis Ceoil, and often performed at events and concerts. ==Career== In 1922 Moclair was unanimously elected as the first woman assistant master of the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, having been nominated by Sir Andrew Horne having faced \\"some opposition from the more conservative Governors\\". Serving three consecutive annual terms from 1922 to 1925, in the last two she worked alongside Andrew Horne Jr, with dual posts of assistant master serving as residential posts. In the late 1920s, Moclair and Horne Jr held undergraduate posts in Vienna, and upon their return to Dublin, established a private practice. Moclair demonstrated compassion to mothers and newborn babies, remarking that \\"the midwife knows more than we do\\", working to instil confidence in new mothers. She developed a pioneering pre-marital course with the Catholic social services, as well as delivering health and hygiene courses in vocational schools around for young women and mothers. With Dorothy Price, Moclair testified before the Carrigan Commission, which was reviewing the existing Irish law on sexual offences in Ireland. In her role as a representative of the Irish Women Doctors' Committee, she stated that Irish teenagers and young women were more innocent and naive than their British contemporaries, and were ignorant of facts concerning sex and reproduction. Citing this ignorance, she called for better sexual health education to counter the widespread ignorance amongst young women and girls. With Price, Moclair testified to their personal knowledge of cases of 13-year-old girls becoming mothers due to lack of education. They argued that the secrecy and shame associated with sexual assault resulted in low rates of reporting and only young women who became pregnant would admit they had been raped or sexually assaulted. Moclair's testimony, along with that of many other women experts, was largely ignored by the committee, and the transcripts remained sealed in the National Archives until 1999. From the 1920s, Moclair served as president and chair of the Women's National Health Association, which was focusing on the elimination of tuberculosis and improving childhood health at the time. As a practising Catholic, she was a member of St. Joan's International Alliance, the Linen Guild which supported babies born in the National Maternity Hospital, Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Catholic Social Welfare Bureau and other voluntary Catholic organisations including in her local parish in St Andrew's, Westland Row, Dublin. From 1963 to 1966, Moclair was president of Peamount Hospital, Newcastle, County Dublin. She served as an examiner for the Central Midwives Board of Ireland. ==Family and death== Moclair married Andrew Horne Jr at St Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin on 23 November 1971. The couple had one son (1931‚Äì1946) and twin daughters, Margaret and Patricia. At first they lived and practised on Merrion Square, later moving to Cowper Drive, Rathmines. Moclair died at Dr Steevens' Hospital, Dublin, of renal failure on 23 November 1971. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from County Tipperary Category:20th-century Irish women Category:20th-century Irish medical doctors Category:Irish obstetricians ","title":"Delia Moclair"},{"id":"63870615","text":"The TG4 Composer of the Year Award is given annually as part of Gradam Ceoil TG4.

She specialized in the study of money in politics, United States presidential primaries, and comparative party systems, particularly those of Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. She was one of the first professors to teach government at Wellesley College, where she was a faculty member from 1925 until 1957, and helped to establish the Wellesley Department of Political Science in 1940. ==Education and early work== Overacker was born in Centreville, in the East Bay area around San Francisco, California. Her father owned a fruit growing business, but he later became a rancher, and the family moved to St. Helena, California, where Overacker attended high school. In 1911 she was admitted to Stanford University, which had opened the same year she was born. However, the school had limited women's attendance to only 500 at a time, and Overacker arrived in her first semester to discover that they had exceeded the cap and she was forced to return home. Enough women had dropped out by the start of the second semester that Overacker was able to attend, and she graduated successfully in 1915. She earned a BA in economics, with honors from Phi Beta Kappa. Overacker continued to study at Stanford with the political scientist Victor J. West, and she earned an MA in 1917 with a thesis entitled The Police Department of San Francisco. During WWI, Overacker worked as a clerk in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance within the United States Bureau of Efficiency. After the end of the war, she traveled around Europe with the YMCA to assist with administration there, before returning to Stanford in 1919. In 1920 she was offered a position as an instructor at Vassar College, which then had only one other political science instructor. Two years later she moved to the University of Chicago to obtain a PhD. There she studied with Charles Edward Merriam, and graduated in 1924. Her thesis focused on the study of American presidential primaries. According to Victoria Schuck, Overacker was one of only 19 women to complete a PhD in political science during the 1920s, out of about 200 political science degrees awarded during that period. ==Career== Overacker was offered a faculty position by the head of the political science department at the University of Indiana, but the position was vetoed by the university because the only available office would have to be shared with a man. Instead she obtained a position at Wilson College in Pennsylvania where she was an instructor in both government and economics for a year. In 1925 she moved to Wellesley College where she became an Assistant Professor in the History Department. Overacker was one of the first professors to teach political science at Wellesley, 15 years before a dedicated political science department was established there. Wellesley College has credited Overacker with playing a leading role in introducing a serious concentration on political science into the Wellesley history department, as well as in the subsequent founding of the political science department in 1940. Overacker helped to give the new political science department an early focus on practical topics like bureaucracy and government administration, in response to the academic disruptions caused by WWII. Together with her former PhD supervisor Charles Merriam, Overacker published the 1928 update and revision of Merriam's 1926 book on Primary Elections. When her former undergraduate advisor Victor J. West died in 1927, Overacker was invited to compile his lectures and notes into a book, which she published under the title Money in Elections in 1932. In 1945, Overacker was invited by Boston University to deliver the Gaspar G. Bacon lecture series; Victoria Schuck wrote that it was rare for a woman to be invited to deliver a named lecture series at that time. She chose to deliver lectures on the topic of campaign finance in America, and her lectures were compiled and published in the 1946 book Presidential Campaign Funds. Overacker also studied how the Great Depression affected the sources and quantities of funding for presidential campaigns, as well as research on the political activities of labor unions as campaign funding sources. Because of Overacker's early work on the topic of campaign finance, she was chosen by the Citizen's Research Foundation as one of the namesakes for their Overacker-Heard Campaign Finance Data Archive, later maintained by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1951, Overacker was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1952, Overacker published The Australian party system. The book aimed to increase American interest in the party politics of Australia, specifically the relationship between the Australian Labor Party, the parties of the center-right, and the Communist Party of Australia. As a scholar of the American presidential primary system, Overacker was particularly interested in the pre-selection process in Australian presidential politics, which she viewed as the closest foreign analogue to American presidential primary elections. The Australian party system was one of the first investigations of Australian politics available to American political scientists, even though Australia had several distinctive features such as the combination of a Westminster system with an American-style single constitutional document, together with compulsory voting. Overacker retired from Wellesley in 1957, 32 years after her first appointment there. After her retirement, she held several temporary academic positions. She was the John Hay Whitney Visiting Professor at Bethany College in West Virginia during the 1957‚Äì1958 school year, a Visiting Scholar for Phi Beta Kappa from 1958 to 1960, and a substitute professor during 1960‚Äì1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles when a professor there was named Chancellor of The University of California at Santa Cruz and had to leave to lay out the new Santa Cruz campus. In 1963, Overacker taught at the Inter-American University in Puerto Rico. Before Overacker's death in 1982, the American Political Science Association had been preparing a special symposium in her honor. Overacker's influence on the early development on the discipline of political science has been noted political scientists, journalists, and university presidents like Victoria Schuck, Elizabeth Drew, and Nannerl O. Keohane. ==Selected works== *Primary Elections, 2nd edition, with Charles Merriam (1928) *Money in Elections, expanded from notes by Victor J.

Attended by thousands of people, the gathering was the first of its kind in Bajaur in more than a decade. The protesters condemned the killing of Ahmad Shah, a 22-year-old student who had immigrated from Bajaur to Karachi to seek education and employment but had been abducted from Karachi on 15 February. Allegedly, he had been tortured and then extrajudicially killed by the Karachi police in a similar way to the killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud the previous month. Ahmad Shah's bullet-riddled body had been found on 17 February and the body had been transported from Karachi to Bajaur for burial at his ancestral graveyard. Ahmad Shah's family and other protesters at the gathering warned the Pakistani government that if those involved in the murder were not punished, they would march to Islamabad and stage a protest sit-in. The three-day Bajaur protest continued on 21 and 22 February. During his address at the gathering, Manzoor Pashteen resolved that PTM \\"would not keep silence over the murder of Pashtuns.\\" ==Quetta== From 9 to 11 March 2018, PTM organized a protest march from Dera Ismail Khan to Quetta, passing through Drazanda, Zhob, Killa Saifullah, and Khanozai. After reaching Quetta, a grand public gathering was organized on 11 March at Sadiq Shaheed Stadium, Quetta. Representatives of various political parties addressed the gathering. The speakers said: \\"We demand constitutionally sanctioned rights in the country for Pashtuns.\\" Manzoor Pashteen expressed his regret about the failure of Pakistan's law enforcement agencies despite the promise by the government to arrest Rao Anwar, who was involved in the alleged extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud. Pashteen said at the gathering: \\"We had set one month deadline to certain quarters to apprehend Rao Anwar which expired but no action has been taken by the government.\\" ==Wanna== On 23 March 2018 (Pakistan National Day), PTM organized a public gathering in Wanna, the capital city of South Waziristan. Arif Wazir, a local PTM leader, said during the gathering: \\"The tribal Pashtuns abandoned homes to enable the army to take action against terrorists, but now the tribals are only treated as strangers on military check posts and are not even allowed to own homes and properties.\\" Later in the day, Arif Wazir led the rally to the home of slain Naqeebullah Mehsud in Makin, South Waziristan. On 24 March, Arif was detained by the authorities under the Frontier Crimes Regulations for organizing the rally. Three other PTM activists were also arrested. PTM supporters protested against the arrests in front of press clubs in Peshawar, Quetta, Swat, Swabi, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Zhob, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Ziarat, Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and other cities. ==Peshawar== There was a grand gathering of PTM near Sarhad University in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on 8 April 2018. About 60,000 people came to the gathering to participate in the protest. Many of the protesters held photographs of their missing relatives, containing captions with names and the dates they disappeared. Pashteen proclaimed in his speech during the gathering: \\"We are against those who do wrong, whether it is ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), MI (Military Intelligence), good Taliban, bad Taliban, or peace committees, we are against them.\\" ==Lahore== PTM held a public gathering in the Punjab province of Pakistan on 22 April at the historical Mochi Gate, Lahore. Attended by over 8,000 people, the gathering was hosted by Lahore Left Front (LLF).

The objectives of this gathering was to inform Punjab people about Pushtuns ordeal in war-hit areas of country and uniting exploited masses of Punjab and Pushtuns - as well highlighting woes of ordinary Pushtun workers in Lahore. Just one day before gathering, Lahore district administration rejected permission to hold gathering and arrested its leading activists including Ali Wazir, Ismat Shahjahan, Bilawal Mandokhel, and Muzammil. This act of administration was sharply criticized by public as well as notable politicians of country like Maryam Nawaz, Pervaiz Rashid, and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Despite of all hurdles, Lahore public gathering was held as per plan. In this rally, PTM leaders asserted their demands and announced future rallies in Karachi & Swat. Two days after this successful gathering, Corps Commander Peshawar Lt General Nazir Ahmed declared that PTM demands are genuine and military is ready for talks.

Bagh-e-Jinnah was the initially planned venue but the authorities didn't permit it. Before the event, three separate criminal cases were registered against PTM at different police stations in Karachi for hate and anti-state speeches. PTM activists accused authorities of sabotaging their event by initiating a wave of mass arrests and detentions. One day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was barred from boarding his scheduled flight to Karachi from Islamabad International Airport. He was told that his ticket had been cancelled and was not allowed to board the plane. He and his friends then drove for five hours to Lahore, and bought another plane ticket to fly from Lahore Airport. However, their ticket was again cancelled and they were forced to take a road trip to reach Karachi. During the road trip, he was stopped and searched 23 times by the authorities, which made his journey over 40 hours. He reached the gathering venue in Karachi hours after his scheduled arrival time, and addressed the awaiting crowd. At the gathering, he denounced extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in Karachi and all across Pakistan, and also reiterated the main demands of PTM. ==Dera Ismail Khan== On 15 July 2018, a grand public gathering was organized by PTM at Haq Nawaz Park, Dera Ismail Khan in which thousands of people participated.

Dawn. 13 August 2018. He alleged that 70 years after the Babrra massacure, the Pashtuns are still being killed. He said: \\"Our struggle is based on justice, peace, and brotherhood. We will not accept the victimization of the Pashtuns.\\" He added that despite producing surplus electricity through Tarbela Dam and Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, the people of Swabi District and the adjacent areas still suffer from long hours of power outages. Pashteen demanded that the district should be given an uninterrupted power supply. He also spoke about the problems faced by tobacco growers in the district, and said: \\"Tobacco is produced in Swabi, but the federal government reaps its benefits.\\" He demanded that the incentives for the Gadoon Amazai Industrial Estate in Swabi should be restored, because it was established to provide an alternative livelihood source to the farmers cultivating opium poppy. During the campaign to inform people about the gathering in Swabi, one day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was denied entry into the mausoleum of Captain Karnal Sher Khan by Karnal Sher Khan's brother Anwar Sher Khan. Anwar said he denied Pashteen entry into the mausoleum out of respect for the Pakistan Army. ==Bannu== There was a grand gathering of PTM at Bannu Sports Complex in Bannu, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on 28 October 2018, which was attended by more than 60,000 people. It was one of the largest public gatherings in the history of Bannu. The attendees included relatives of alleged missing persons in recent times. PTM protested for the immediate recovery of Tahir Dawar, a police officer and Pashto poet who had been abducted from the capital Islamabad on 26 October and missing for two days. Noor Islam Dawar, a PTM activist, asked the protesters during his speech at the gathering: \\"Is this the reward for Tahir's honesty, bravery, and professionalism: to be kidnapped?\\" However, Tahir was never recovered alive and his dead body was later found by the locals in the Dur Baba District of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, eighteen days after disappearance. ==Cologne== On 5 January 2019, more than a thousand supporters of PTM gathered in Cologne, the largest city of Germany's most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia.Pashtuns‚Äô fight for justice gathers steam in Pakistan. The Siasat Daily. 20 January 2019. People from various countries of Europe came to participate in the public gathering. They reiterated the first demand of PTM, justice for Naqeebullah Mehsud, who had been killed extrajudicially in Karachi, Pakistan by SSP Rao Anwar almost a year before. The protesters demanded the government of Pakistan to not ban PTM leaders from traveling to various parts of Pakistan or other countries. The participants also protested against forced disappearances and target killings in Pakistan. ==Tank== On 13 January 2019, PTM held a public gathering in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to observe the first anniversary of the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud. Many landmine victims and family members of missing persons also attended the gathering. Manzoor Pashteen said at the gathering that PTM had been protesting for a year to seek justice for Naqeebullah and will keep protesting even if a hundred years passed to demand strict punishment for Rao Anwar and other criminals. Pashteen blamed the Pakistani state for ruining the Pashtun homeland and looting their resources under the pretext of war on terror. He expressed his resolve that the Pashtuns will continue to seek justice for themselves through peaceful means \\"even if it takes hundred years\\". ==Khaisor== On 20 January 2019, PTM organized a public gathering in Karachi to celebrate its first anniversary. Alamzaib Mahsud, a PTM activist instrumental in gathering data on missing persons and landmines victims in the Pashtun tribal districts, was detained by the police on 21 January for taking part in the demonstration in Karachi. The PTM chairman Manzoor Pashteen and another leader Mohsin Dawar, however, did not travel to Karachi for the anniversary due to a last minute change of plans and instead organized a public rally in the Khaisor village of North Waziristan on 20 January in protest against the Khaisor incident. The Khaisor incident had surfaced two days earlier, when 13-year-old Hayat Khan from Khaisor claimed in a video on 18 January that Pakistani security forces had arrested his brother Adil and father Jalat Khan, and that his family had been facing harassment due to frequent visits by two security personnel to his home. Hayat Khan was allegedly persuaded by a Pashtun Tahafuz Movement activist, Noor Islam Dawar, to record the video. In the video, which went viral on social media, Hayat said that his father and brother might not be freed, but he requested the security forces to stop the unwanted visits when he was the only male along with the women at his house. Hayat's mother also spoke publicly about the incident, and said: \\"The soldiers once told me to make beds for them because they would spend the night inside our house. I am now publicly speaking because I am sick of the humiliation and dishonor.\\" Hayat's mother was alleged to have signed an affidavit to deny her previous allegation which was verified by some tribal elders. Mohsin Dawar accused the Pakistani government of trying to force Hayat and his family to withdraw their claim against the security personnel. On 27 January, a six- member female delegation from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the former lawmakers Bushra Gohar and Jamila Gilani, visited Khaisor to interview the women of the village about the incident. The visiting women were particularly struck by the story of Noorani Bibi, an illiterate old woman from Khaisor who had recorded each time the security forces raided her house while no men were at home by drawing 25 lines on a sheet of paper. \\"Many women told us that if their husbands or other male relatives are involved or suspected of any wrongdoing, the security forces can detain and investigate them, but they should not barge into our houses,\\" Jamila said. \\"Women and children have been psychologically affected by the break-ins and harassment,\\" Bushra added. ==Bamyan== On 14 February 2019, a gathering was held by PTM supporters in Bamyan, the cultural center of the Hazarajat region in central Afghanistan. They gathered in front of the Buddhas of Bamyan, which had been destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 and became a symbol of oppression. Carrying banners of PTM leaders, the protesters condemned the alleged extrajudicial murder of Arman Loni, one of the leaders of PTM. They protested against the Pakistani government and military for allegedly oppressing the Pashtuns and Baloch. ==Wanna (second gathering)== On 15 March 2019, PTM held its second gathering of Wanna, South Waziristan. Ali Wazir, who represents South Waziristan in the National Assembly of Pakistan and is one of the leaders of PTM, said during the gathering: \\"The Pashtuns have suffered a lot from terrorism. We want peace for the future generations of the Pashtuns.\\" The participants chanted slogans against terrorism and demanded punishment for the assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Attaur Rehman, who had allegedly extrajudicially killed the PTM leader Arman Loni in the previous month in Loralai. On 16 March, the supporters of PTM organized a march from Wanna to Angur Ada, a town at the border between South Waziristan and the Barmal District of Afghanistan's Paktika Province. In Angur Ada, the participants condoled and protested for the eight Kabulkhel Wazir tribesmen who had been killed on the evening of 9 March in the Rakha village of Barmal District by an Afghan pro-government armed group supported by international military forces. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan took notice of the Barmal killings and found out that the search operation was originally against the Taliban but resulted in civilian casualties, including children. In response to the protest, the Afghan government announced to probe the killings through a commission. ==Peshawar (second gathering)== PTM scheduled a large gathering on 31 March 2019 in Peshawar near Sarhad University, with the purpose to commemorate the martyrdom (shahƒÅdat) of the late PTM leader Arman Loni and demand justice for him. Arman's sister, Wranga Loni, chose Peshawar as the site of the gathering because of the city's role as an important center of the Pashtuns. ==Miramshah== On 14 April 2019, PTM supporters gathered in Miramshah, the capital of North Waziristan. The gathering included many women and children demanding the recovery of their missing relatives. Manzoor Pashteen said during his speech at the gathering that despite Operation Zarb-e-Azb by the Pakistani military, targeted killings have increased in North Waziristan for the last one year. Pashteen added: \\"We want peace on this peaceful soil. The resources of the Pashtuns have been stolen and captured by others, and now it is time for them to stand up and get equal rights from this state.\\" The participants also demanded the government to stop the construction of Kurram Tangi Dam on the Kurram River in North Waziristan, citing that the dam would bring a large part of their area under water and displace a large number of people. ==Bannu (second gathering)== PTM's second gathering of Bannu was held at Mandan Park on 12 January 2020. During the gathering, Manzoor Pashteen announced the formation of a jirga (assembly of leaders) to appeal for unity among Pashtun leaders belonging to various Pakistani political parties. In response, leaders of various parties, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)'s Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman, Jamaat-e-Islami's Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, Awami National Party's Asfandyar Wali Khan, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party's Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and Qaumi Watan Party's Sikandar Sherpao expressed their willingness to cooperate with PTM for protection of the rights of Pashtuns. ==Loralai== On 9 February 2020, PTM held a protest gathering in Loralai in the northeast of Balochistan to mark the first death anniversary of Arman Loni, a PTM leader who was allegedly killed on 2 February 2019 during a police crackdown in Loralai. Just before the gathering, security forces arrested Wranga Loni, Sanna Ejaz, Arfa Siddiq, and other female PTM activists as they were on their way to the gathering site but later released them when political activists gathered outside the police station to protest for them. Therefore, the female activists were able to join the gathering on time. The protesters at the gathering demanded justice for Arman and also demanded the Pakistani government to immediately release Manzoor Pashteen, who had been arrested on 27 January 2020 on sedition charges. Pashteen's arrest drew widespread condemnation throughout the world, including by the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International. Mulla Behram and several other PTM activists were detained by the police as they were on their way back to their hometowns from the Loralai gathering. A few days after the gathering, citizen rights of the PTM activist Sardar Gulmarjan Kibzai, who helped organize the gathering, were revoked by the Deputy Commissioner of Loralai through a public notice. Also on 9 February, another protest rally was simultaneously held by PTM in the city of Karachi. Ghinwa Bhutto, the chairperson of the Pakistan Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto), also attended the Karachi rally and supported PTM's demands. ==Dera Ismail Khan (second gathering)== PTM's second protest gathering of Dera Ismail Khan was held on 16 February 2020. The protesters called for the immediate release of PTM's leader Manzoor Pashteen. ==Charsadda== On 1 March 2020, PTM held a public gathering at Municipal Park, Charsadda, during which Manzoor Pashteen welcomed the 2020 Afghan peace agreement which was signed on 29 February between the United States and the Taliban in Qatar. Talking about Ehsanullah Ehsan, the former spokesman of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan who escaped from the custody of Pakistani Agencies in early February 2020, Pashteen said \\"PTM would never forgive the killers of Pashtuns‚Äô children.\\" He asked: \\"What will the Pakistani state respond when the parents of the victims of 2014 Peshawar school massacre question them who was Ehsanullah Ehsan and why was he kept as a guest by the Pakistan army?\\" Pashteen thanked the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the previous President Hamid Karzai, and other leaders, political parties, and human rights activists in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other countries for demanding for Pashteen's release during his month-long detention. After the Charsadda gathering, the police arrested two PTM activists for allegedly disrespecting the flag of Pakistan during the gathering. ==References== public gatherings Category:Pashtun nationalism Category:Pashtun rights Category:2018 protests Category:2019 protests Category:2020 protests Category:Protest marches ","title":"PTM public gatherings"},{"id":"63870727","text":"James Malone Coleman (August 26, 1929 ‚Äì May 4, 2020) was second bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of West Tennessee. ==Early Life and Education== Coleman was born on August 26, 1929 in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Frederick L.

Cattle producers, feedlot operators, and merchant exporters can hedge future selling prices for cattle through trading live cattle futures, and such trading is a common part of a producer's price risk management program. Conversely, meat packers, and merchant importers can hedge future buying prices for cattle. Producers and buyers of live cattle can also enter into production and marketing contracts for delivering live cattle in cash or spot markets that include futures prices as part of a reference price formula. Businesses that purchase beef as an input could also hedge beef price risk by purchasing live cattle futures contracts. ==Contract Description== Live cattle futures and options are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which introduced live cattle futures contracts in 1964. Contract prices are quoted in U.S. centers per pound. Minimum tick size for the contract is $0.00025 per pound ($10 per contract). Trading on the contract are subject to price limits of $0.03 per pound above or below the previous day's contract settlement price. Contracts expire in February, April, June, August, October, and December and 9 contracts are available at any time in order of expiry. For example, On June 5th, 2020, contracts for June 2020, August 2020, October 2020, December 2020, February 2021, April 2021, June 2021, August 2021, October 2021 would be available for trading. For each contract, trading terminates at 12:00 Noon CT on the last business day of the delivery month, and deliveries may be made on any day of that month and the first eleven business days in the next calendar month, excluding that live graded deliveries may not be made prior to the ninth business day following the first Friday of the contract month and may not be made on Christmas Eve nor made on New Year‚Äôs Eve. The deliverable assets for the contracts are 40,000 pounds of 65% Choice, 35% Select, Yield Grade 3 live steers or live heifers, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) \\"Official United States Standards for Grades of Slaughter Cattle\\", or producing 65% Choice, 35% Select, Yield Grade 3 steer or heifer carcasses, as defined by the same standard. All cattle must be born and raised exclusively in the United States, with no individual animal weighing less than 1,050 pounds or more than 1,500 pounds and no individual heifer weighing less than 1,050 pounds or more than 1,350 pounds. A delivery unit must consist entirely of steers or entirely of heifers. ==Secondary Uses== Live cattle futures contract prices serves as a platform for cattle price discovery because futures markets are more publicly visible and accessible, due to lower transaction costs, for a larger number of buyers and sellers than the cash market. A larger number of buyers and sellers in the futures market allows those market participants to incorporate more demand and supply information, such as weather, disease, imports, exports, and world events, into the futures price compared with cash price. Since 9 live cattle contracts are available at any time, prices of contracts with delivery dates in the future can produce forecasts of the spot price of cattle at those delivery times. On an absolute basis, forecasts produced from futures prices do not produce accurate price forecasts, but on a relative basis, those forecasts were found to be better than those produced by the USDA, university economists, statistical methods, and other forecasting sources. Live cattle futures prices are also a part of both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give live cattle futures prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. Conversely, traders and investors have become non-trivial participants in the market for live cattle futures. ==Related Financial Instruments== A Brazilian Live Cattle futures contract also trades on B3 exchange. The contract is denoted in Brazilian reals and can be cash settled. Derivatives on futures and derivatives on packages of futures contracts, such as options, calendar spread contracts, Trade-at-Settlement (TAS) contracts are also available for the CME live cattle futures contracts. Live cattle futures contracts are often grouped together with feeder cattle and lean hogs futures contracts as livestock futures contracts. These commodities share many fundamental demand and supply risks, such long feeding periods, weather, feed prices, and consumer sentiment, which makes grouping them together useful for commercial discussions about both the commodities and their futures contracts. Commodity indices have followed this practice and grouped these futures contracts together in livestock futures contracts categories. ===Gross Margin Financial Instruments=== Cattle producers purchase feeder cattle to feed into live cattle or fat cattle for sale to slaughterhouses. Depending on the operation, producers purchase corn, soybean meal, and other commodities as feed. The difference between the selling price for live cattle and the costs of purchasing feeder cattle and feed (usually assumed to be corn, regardless of actual mix of feed used) is referred to as livestock gross margin (LGM), feeding margin, or cattle crush (as opposed to production margin, which also includes other production costs). Cattle producers can use existing futures contracts for feeder cattle and corn to fix those production cost components into the future. Traders can purchase those futures and the live cattle futures contract in particular ratios to profit from the difference of selling finished live cattle against the cost of buying the feeder cattle and feeding the cattle. In addition to exchange-traded products, cattle producers can purchase livestock gross margin insurance policy contracts (LGM-Cattle) sponsored by the USDA Risk Management Agency from authorized crop insurance agents. These insurance policy contracts are bundles of exchange-traded options on futures contracts, and prices for these policy contracts refer to exchange-traded futures prices. == References == Category:Futures markets ","title":"Live cattle"},{"id":"63871143","text":"Indra Joshi is a British physician who is Director of Artificial Intelligence for NHSX and a founding ambassador of One HealthTech.

The building provided accommodation for many of the offices of Hounslow London Borough Council. ==History== ===Construction and development=== In the early 20th century the Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth had been based at council offices in Treaty Road. In the early 1960s, civic leaders decided this arrangement would be inadequate for their needs in the context of the impending creation of the London Borough of Hounslow and decided to purchase land for a purpose-built civic centre: the site selected for the new facility, located just north of Lampton Park on Lampton Road, had previously been open land. Once the London Borough of Hounslow had been formed in 1965, the new civic leaders proceeded to procure a new building. Construction work, which was carried out by M J Gleeson at a cost of ¬£4.9 million, started in 1972. The new building, which was designed by the council surveyor, George Trevett, was officially opened on 17 November 1975. The design involved four low-rise glass and concrete pavilions connected by a central spine containing the main staircase and was set in extensive landscaping designed by Jakobsen Landscape Architects. Three of the pavilions contained open plan space for council officers and their departments while the south-eastern pavilion, sometimes referred to as the \\"civic pavilion\\", contained at its centre a twelve-sided council chamber which appeared at roof level as a drum. The main frontage of the civic pavilion, like the other pavilions, featured a series of glass entrance doors on the ground floor; there were layers of continuous stone facing panels above and below a continuous band of glazing on the first floor. After the civic centre became uneconomic to operate, the council entered into a development agreement with a joint venture of Notting Hill Genesis and Bouygues Development for work on the first phase of a residential development, on an adjacent site, which started in December 2016. The main building was decommissioned and the site was handed over for the second phase of the residential development in summer 2019. ===Hounslow House=== In 2015, the council decided to procure a smaller facility which would be located in the centre of the borough and more accessible to the public. The new facility, known as Hounslow House, which was designed by Sheppard Robson and built by Bouygues Construction in Bath Road, was officially opened by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on 1 May 2019.

The Maple Hills Maintenance Company has been operating and managing the park and pool since 1959.[2] == History of Renton == The Duwamish tribe were the first people to have inhabited the land before it was settled on by Henry Tobin in 1853.[3] After some trial and error of developing a mill and creating a functioning town, a landowner named Erasmus Smithers met Tobin‚Äôs wife in 1857, and after marrying they collectively owned about 500 acres of land.[3] More settlers began to move to the area, and that growth led to the first plat of Renton to be proposed in 1875,3 and the town was finally incorporated in 1901.[4] It was not until the 1940s that Renton saw a large increase in its population.[4] The Boeing company came into Renton in 1941 to build planes during World War II, and with it brought four million dollars in federal money to aid in population expansion, which created communities like Maple Hills.[4] Today, Boeing remains Renton‚Äôs largest city employer.[4] == Demographics == The residents of Maple Hills are primarily Caucasian, making up 72.8 percent of the population.1 Asians and Hispanics are the next largest race represented, making up 6.7 percent and 6.2 percent of the population, respectively.[1] The median household income is $95,702 as of 2016.[1] == Maple Hills Elementary school == Maple Hills Elementary School is photographed on May 5, 2020 on a sunny Spring afternoon. Maple Hills Elementary is one of the 15 elementary schools in the Issaquah School District[5]; all elementary schools in this district teach kindergarten through grade 5 levels.[6] Its students as well as those from Apollo, Briarwood, and Newcastle Elementary all later join together in Maywood Middle school, and those same students later go to Liberty high school.[6] Maple Hills was built in 1969, and it was later renovated in 1996 to have a central library with classrooms surrounding it.[7] Other features such as its gym, auditorium, garden, sand field, and courtyard are other relevant components of the school. == Maple Hills Pool == The Maple Hills pool consists of a 4-lane, 25-meter pool with a wading area and a baby pool.[2] There is also the main office with attached men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs locker rooms. The pool usually opens to the community in late May and closes in early September.[2] [8] The pool is also home to a summer league team that is a part of the Midlakes Swim League: the Maple Hills Marlins. The team has many traditions such as themed swim meets, a picnic award celebration at the end of the season, and big buddies, where an older team member acts as a mentor to a first-year swimmer.[6] Apart from the Marlins, the pool also offers swim lessons, lap swim, open swim, and can be rented for parties and events.[6] == Maple Hills Park == The park consists of two tennis courts, a playground, a baseball field, an asphalt walking path, a picnic shelter, and a soccer field.[2] The baseball and soccer fields are often used and maintained by local teams.[2] == Notable events == Each year, the community hosts an Easter egg hunt, 4th of July 5k and parade, and polar bear swim.[2] Other non-annual events have also been put on such as hot dog feeds and park cleanups.[2] \\\\----[1] ‚ÄúMaple Hills neighborhood in East Renton Highlands, Washington (WA), 98027, 98038, 98058, 98059 detailed profile‚Äù.

In the sense of a guideline or a prototype, it supports the demanding process of developing handwriting skills and abilities in a visual and illustrative way. Teaching scripts are represented as alphabets (upper and lower case letters), which are generally accompanied by numbers and punctuation marks. For detailed information on the execution of movements and the design of individual letters and their incorporation into words, various learning materials such as writing exercise sheets or corresponding exercise books are usually provided. ==Historical context== Historically, the older approach was to provide students with a beautiful, readable, and efficient cursive as a standard script for learning. Students were supposed to bring their writing closer and closer to this perfect model. In the first third of the 20th century, type teachers such as Rudolf von Larisch and Ludwig S√ºtterlin changed this traditional approach by defining the teaching script as a starting point instead of a target model. The teaching script does not represent a desired target script. It therefore does not have to be particularly beautiful or efficient, but above all simple and clear. The students should develop an individual handwriting from it. The fact that this goal is not always achieved does not change the popularity of the concept. In 1916, the writing pedagogue Fritz Kuhlmann took an even more far-reaching approach: the students should develop an individual handwriting from block letters rather than from a teaching cursive. The urge for speed should lead the pupil to invent combinations of letters and fluid, uninterrupted strokes himself. This approach did not prove successful at the time, but it was revived in 2011 under the name Grundschrift (\\"basic script\\") and has been tested again since then. ==Basics== The following information is included in a teaching script: *the character of the line as a formative element (for example, a monoline nib stroke, an broad nib stroke or a pointed nib stroke), *the ratio of line width to font size, *the design of the characteristic features of the individual characters, *the size and width proportions of the letters and their shape elements, *the position of their main axes (inclination angle), *the connections and ligatures and *the execution of movements in detail and as a whole (ductus). In Germany, teaching scripts are part of the curriculum for German lessons. It contains statements about the binding nature of the respective template. Furthermore, teaching scripts have the function of illustrating the coordination of the individual aspects of the design (angle of inclination, proportions of size and width, reversal of movement in the form of angles, arcs, cover lines or loops, letter spacing and connections). In this way, teaching scripts demonstrate a certain style principle that helps learners not only to give the individual letters an unmistakable shape, but also to establish a certain visual order in the script. Such an order is aimed at combining the parts into an easily comprehensible whole and is an essential prerequisite for the legibility of the scripts. Lineaments are an aid in the difficult process of ordering. There are different views on the use of lineages when learning to write. The design of teaching scripts represents the interface between type design and the didactics of native speaker teaching. Learning to write by means of graphomotor skills is one aspect of the very complex process of learning to write in primary school. In the history of writing education, the concepts of how to structure the process of acquiring skills and abilities in handwritten writing have undergone major changes. This has an impact on the form of the respective teaching scripts. ==Development in Germany== ===Standard and teaching scripts until 1941=== In Germany, after the Carolingian minuscule (9th‚Äì12th centuries), a cursive writing style had prevailed, building on the Gothic cursive (from the 14th century) ‚Äì an italic form of Gothic writing in everyday use (from the 12th century). This development was continued by the Nuremberg master scribe Johann Neud√∂rffer (1497‚Äì1563), who had played a decisive role in the creation of Fraktur. In his writing book \\"Eine gute Ordnung und kurze unterricht [...]\\" (Nuremberg, 1538), he created a unified style from letters of German cursive scripts ‚Äì more precisely German Kurrent scripts ‚Äì which has been around for a long time. With the spread of the school system from the 16th century onwards, reading and writing skills became commonplace among ever more diverse classes. Alongside the German Kurrent, the humanistic cursive developed as a script for Latin and non-German texts, and from this the Latin cursive evolved. In the German-speaking world it was necessary and common for educated people to learn two scripts, the German and the Latin script. In 1714, a decree in Prussia for the first time introduced a standard script, which is said to go back to the Berlin teacher Hilmar Curas (Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium). Its pointed, right-leaning forms, which largely avoided curves, also became naturalized in other German territories and became characteristic of German Kurrent scripts. The Berlin graphic artist Ludwig S√ºtterlin (1865‚Äì1917) changed this typical style of the German Kurrent script. He relied entirely on the concept of the teaching script ‚Äì which as such need be neither beautiful nor efficient, but above all clear and simple ‚Äì as well as the monoline nib for beginners. He developed his own typeface, which stood vertically on the line, divided ascenders, corpus size and descenders in a 1:1:1 ratio, and had geometric-looking spikes and curls. The S√ºtterlin script ‚Äì which existed in two variants, as German (Kurrent) and Latin script ‚Äì was used in Prussian schools in 1924 and from 1930 in most other German countries as the school teaching script. In Hesse, another typeface pedagogue, Rudolf Koch, developed his own concept, which he presented in 1927: the Offenbacher Schrift. Koch rejected S√ºtterlin's monoline nib and teaching-script principle. His script ‚Äì which also existed as German (Kurrent) and Latin script ‚Äì was written with the broad nib and was in principle to be retained in later life, although it also took on personal traits. However, with the introduction of S√ºtterlin's script in Hesse in 1930, the Offenbach script remained unused. Likewise, the St√§bchenschrift developed by Maximilian Schlegl in the 1930s did not become established. In the Third Reich, the Nazi Party Gauleiter Hans Schemm introduced his own teaching script in Bavaria in 1933: the Bavarian \\"Volksschrift\\". This contained numerous changes compared to the German S√ºtterlin script, such as the replacement of the small loops by U-shaped arcs, clear differences in the c, C, d, y, I, J, T and Y, vertical umlaut strokes, the number 7 and curls in the number 0 as well as in the O. The Reich Ministry of Education liked this script, but wanted uniformity throughout the Reich. With a decree of 7 September 1934, which came into force at the beginning of the school year 1935/36, the \\"Verkehrsschrift\\" was introduced throughout the Reich. This was a variant of the Bavarian \\"Volksschrift\\", in which the writing was slightly tilted to the right. This was possibly a consequence of the realization that in practice not all pupils reached their own handwriting in accordance with the original idea of the original script and that the stencil- like forms of S√ºtterlin's original script were still to be found in the handwriting of young people.

Now only the Latin script was taught in schools and everything was changed over to it. For this purpose, a new teaching script was created, which was called \\"Deutsche Normalschrift\\". It was developed on the basis of the Latin S√ºtterlin script, with a right slant, more pleasing forms and simplifications such as the abolition of the loops in the x, X and T and the descender length in the z, Z, F and H, but also the addition of loops in the capital letters C, D and L. The long s was no longer contained in it. The letters N, M, P, T and X, but not V, W and Y, are, similar to the Offenbach script, more closely based on the Antiqua, the P has no descender, and X and Z were given a horizontal line. The number 7 was again written with a diagonal line. Lateinische Ausgangsschrift Lateinische Ausgangsschrift, since 1953 The Lateinische Ausgangsschrift (LA) was developed by the Iserlohner Schreibkreis from the Deutsche Normalschrift and was introduced on 4 November 1953 by the decree of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs as the school teaching script in the Federal Republic of Germany. In Bavaria, the LA was only introduced in 1966. The Lateinische Ausgangsschrift shows only minor changes compared to the Deutsche Normalschrift. The letter S was given a shape similar to the L, some small loops were turned to pointed turns, x and X got their loops back. Schulausgangsschrift and Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), a teaching script was initially used which was essentially the same as the LA, with only minor changes such as the letter t or the omission of the horizontal line of the Z. In connection with the introduction of a new syllabus, this teaching script was changed in 1968. Both didactic and aesthetic reasons were decisive for this. In order to be able to start learning to read block letters at the same time as learning to write cursive, the capital letters were simplified. The sequence of movements in the lower case letters was streamlined. This Schulausgangsschrift (SAS) was partially adopted in the old federal states in 1991. At the same time, the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA) was developed in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1969 to overcome difficulties in the use of the Lateinischen Ausgangsschrift. Similar to the SAS, the forms of the VA were brought more into line with the printed letters. For this purpose, it was implemented that almost all lowercase letters begin and also end at the upper middle band, which should standardize the joining of the letters and thus simplify writing. The letter z was given back its descender in the VA. It has been tested since 1972.

The idea behind the Grundschrift is that cursive is no longer taught in any form whatsoever and that only a printed script is used as the teaching script. The pupils should develop a personal handwriting from the printed script completely independently and without any references. ===Today=== in Germany the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift, the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, the Schulausgangsschrift and the Grundschrift are used. It is the task of the respective federal states to issue rules for the use of the scripts, whereby either no script is prescribed, several scripts are available for selection or one script is made mandatory. ==Development in Austria== The oldest Austrian Schulschrift dates back to 1775 and was designed by Johann Ignaz von Felbiger (\\"Anleitung zum Sch√∂nschreiben [...] zum Gebrauch der deutschen Schulen in den k.k. Staaten\\", Vienna 1775) under Empress Maria Theresia. The next standardization dates from 1832, but hardly anyone followed these rules, teachers designed their own templates, sometimes even within a school. The \\"Richtformen 1924\\" were declared binding by the Vienna City School Board, while the other provinces used their own teaching scripts before and also afterwards, in part.exhibition documentation school museum Klagenfurt by Brigitte Strasser Until the school year 1938/1939, the Kurrent script, established as the \\"official and protocol script\\" (and not the S√ºtterlin script, which was in use in Germany), was taught and taught as the first script in elementary school in Austria. The schoolbooks were set in Fraktur and Kurrent script. After the annexation of Austria by the Nazi Germany in 1938, Austria was also affected by the Reich-wide abolition of Kurrent script with the introduction of the \\"Deutsche Normalschrift\\" in 1941. Although the Federal Ministry of Education issued a decree on 22 May 1951 reintroducing the Kurrent script as a secondary script for \\"Sch√∂nschreiben\\" (calligraphic writing), this was only rarely practised anymore. The \\"Lateinische Ausgangsschrift\\" (LA), which was introduced in the FRG in 1953, was also introduced in Austria's elementary schools in 1963 with largely identical letters. \\"P\\" and \\"R\\", however, were written in Austria in one go, i.e. with a loop running continuously upwards on the left. The \\"r\\" was continued after the stroke down to the baseline from there with a small right-turning loop (standing on the baseline) and was thus very similar to the previously used Kurrent script. In 1967/1970, this loop was simplified to a small arc and a second pointed reversal on the baseline, and around 1970, it was further simplified to a single pointed reversal ‚Äì as already done in 1953 in the FRG. In 1995 a new version of the \\"√ñsterreichische Schulschrift\\" was adopted. It removed the loops inside the letters a, d, g, o and in many capital letters. The P and R are no longer written in one stroke, the X resembles the Antiqua-X and the numbers are more straightforward. Since the 1995/96 school year, teachers have had a free choice: during the writing course, either the new \\"√ñsterreichische Schulschrift 1995\\" or the older \\"√ñsterreichische Schulschrift 1969\\" can be used as the teaching script.Bundesministerium f√ºr Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur GZ 38.554/32-I/1/94 ==Development in Switzerland== Schweizer Schulschrift (from 1947) The currently taught Swiss Schulschrift (also known colloquially as \\"Schn√ºrlischrift\\") was introduced in 1947. In 2006, Hans Eduard Meier developed the no-frills Deutschschweizer Basisschrift, which is similar to the Deutsche Grundschrift, and proposed it as a contemporary alternative. In the canton of Lucerne, the Basisschrift has been approved as an alternative since 2006. Other cantons are waiting or are still discussing the use of the script. In 2008, a study by the P√§dagogische Hochschule Zentralschweiz (University of Teacher Education Central Switzerland) showed that students who had learned to write with the Basisschrift were able to write more text in the same time than those who had learned the Schulschrift. In addition, the script was more legible and students more often agreed with the statement \\"I like writing\\".tagesanzeiger.ch: Schreibt die Schn√ºrlischrift ihr letztes Kapitel?, accessed 30 April 2011 ==France== The French Ministry of National Education recommends the mod√®les d'√©criture scolaire A and B by Laurence Bedoin-Collard, H√©lo√Øse Tissot and Marion Andrews for school teaching. They were developed as part of a competition organised by the Ministry of National Education and were published in June 2013. ==Denmark== Formskrift In 1875 broken scripts were abolished and replaced by a looped cursive (\\"l√∏kkeskrift\\"). In 1952, the Formskrift of the Norwegian Alvhild Bjerkenes was introduced to Denmark by the writing and grammar school teacher Christian Clemens Hansen and became the dominant script in schools over the next 20 to 30 years. ==Sweden== Skol√∂verstyrelsestilen In 1959, the school board (Skol√∂verstyrelsen, S√ñ) had the possibility of introducing a uniform writing course examined. Until then there was no binding uniform method. The teaching scripts or textbooks used were Skrivkursen Tomten, Skrivkursen Runa, Min skrivbok, Normalskriften, Funktionell handstil, Stockholmsstilen and Skrivkursen Pennan. In 1975, after a period of research and experimentation, the board introduced the Skol√∂verstyrelsestilen (S√ñ-stilen), which was designed by calligrapher Kerstin Anckers and based on Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's chancery cursive. After heavy criticism, the binding nature of this school script was revoked ten years later and some resumed using older scripts. ==United States== The Spencerian Method was the most important standardized handwriting system in the United States since the 1840s. Around 1888, the award-winning Palmer Method was developed as a simplification of Spencerian, which was supposed to be simpler and faster and soon became the most popular handwriting system. The corresponding Palmer's Guide to Business Writing from 1894 sold one million copies in the United States in 1912. The use of the method declined in the 1950s and it was eventually superseded by the Zaner-Bloser method of 1976, which first taught block letters and then cursive in order to enable written expression as quickly as possible and thus develop the ability to write. In 1978 the D'Nealian method was introduced which sought to alleviate the difficulties of the transition from block letters to cursive writing with the Zaner-Bloser method and returned to a more cursive style based on the Palmer script with block letters that have many similarities to cursive counterparts. Popular newer teaching scripts include Handwriting Without Tears and the Getty-Dubay cursive italic.

This genus is known for its distinctive movement that resembles a snake trashing in a bag. The genus is involved in the digestion of wood materials within its insect-host and is vertically transmitted to insect progeny. The genus is the part of the family Saccinobaculidae. == Etymology == The name for the genus is derived from the Latin noun saccus which denotes sack or bag and the Latin noun baculus that denotes stick. The genus is named for its characteristic movement which resembles a snake thrashing in a bag. == History of knowledge == Saccinobacculus was first described by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934 while observing the hindgut of wood-feeding cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus. Cleveland and his colleagues suggested that there were at least three species of Saccinobacculus present in the hindgut of C. punctulatus; S. ambloaxostylus, S. doroaxostylus and S. minor. However, Cleveland reassigned two species of the genus, S. doroaxostylus and S. minor, to the genus Oxymonas upon revisiting their life cycles and behaviour in 1950. Molecular data collected by Heiss and Keeling in 2006 supported the original placement of these two species in the genus Saccinobacculus. == Habitat and ecology == Saccinobaculus is a genus of symbiotic flagellates that live exclusively in the hindgut of the wood-feeding cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus. Saccinobaculus is found in great numbers and diversity in the hindgut of C. punctulatus and plays a role in the digestion of wood materials that the insect-host feeds on. The mode of nutrition and the specific role of Saccinobaculus in the digestion of wood materials within its insect-host remains poorly understood. This may be due to its resistance to cultivation in a laboratory settings. == Description == === Morphology === The size of the cells within the genus range from 14 to 170 micrometres in length and 7 to 46 micrometers in width. Unlike other anaerobic flagellates, members of the genus Saccinobaculus rarely contain bacterial symbionts on their surface. Some species of Saccinobacculus have evenly-distributed concavities on their surface. The shape of the cell is variable and can take the form of a sphere to an elongated rod. The variability of the cell shape is due to the continuous movement of the axostyle of the cell, an undulating ribbon-like structure consisting of microtubules running along the length of the cell. The axostyle propels the cell in a zig-zag manner that resembles a snake trashing in a bag. The cells may have 4, 8 or 12 flagella on the anterior end with 4 being the most common number. The flagella contribute little to the cell's locomotion as the cell is primarily propelled by its axostyle. The flagella are connected to a pair of basal bodies and emerge at the anterior end of the axostyle. The nucleus is rounded and also associated with the anterior end of the axostyle. Similar to other oxymonads, Saccinobaculus lacks mitochondria and Golgi bodies. Furthermore, the cell has no attachment apparatus (i.e. a holdfast) or an anterior cell extension (i.e. a rostellum). === Life cycles === Saccinobaculus is observed to have both sexual and asexual life cycles. Sexual reproduction only occurs around the time when the insect-host is molting and is triggered by hormones from the insect's prothoracic glands. About a week before the insect host molts, Saccinobaculus produces gametes from a haploid cell through a single mitotic division of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Immediately after the gametes are formed, they unite to begin the process of fertilization. The fertilized cell contains all the nuclear and organellar materials from both gametes until the onset of meiosis, which occurs 24 hours after the insect-host molts and triggers the digestion of one flagellum and one centriole from one gamete and the axostyles of both gametes. After meiosis is complete, the remaining centriole duplicates producing new flagella and axostyles. In mitotic cell division, only the axostyle is digested and renewed. There are some subtle differences in sexual reproduction between Saccinobaculus species. === Genetics === Similar to other oxymonads, Saccinobaculus has a small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequence that is longer than the average eukaryote. Genetic data from the SSU rRNA has been integral in supporting the assignment of the species S. doroaxostylus and S. minor to the genus. == List of species == *Saccinobacculus minor *Saccinobacculus ambloaxostylus *Saccinobacculus doroaxostylus == References == Category:Flagellates Category:Metamonads ","title":"Saccinobaculus"},{"id":"63871697","text":"The K Is Silent is the debut album of the American country music band Hot Country Knights.

He was the second son and youngest child of the Prussian general, Prince Franz Ludwig von Hatzfeldt-Trachenberg and Countess Friederike Karoline von der Schulenburg-Kehnert (1779‚Äì1832), a daughter of the Prussian minister to the General Directorate Count Friedrich Wilhelm von der Schulenburg-Kehnert. His older sister, Countess Luise von Hatzfeldt-Trachenberg was the wife of Prussian General Ludwig Freiherr Roth von Schreckenstein, the Minister of War. Among his other siblings was older brother Prince Hermann Anton von Hatzfeldt- Trachenberg and sister Princess Sophie von Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg. From his elder brother's second marriage to Countess Marie von Nimptsch, he was uncle to Prince Hermann von Hatzfeldt, who represented the Deutsche Reichspartei in the Reichstag.

A system can be either linear or non-linear. Also, a system can be either a system of ordinary differential equations or a system of partial differential equations. == Linear system of differential equations == Like any system of equations, a system of linear differential equations is said to be overdetermined if there are more equations than the unknowns. A system of Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations is an example of an overdetermined system. For an overdetermined system to have a solution, it needs to satisfy the compatibility conditions.https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Overdetermined_system For example, consider the system: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_i} = f_i, 1 \\\\le i \\\\le m. Then the necessary conditions for the system to have a solution are: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_i}{\\\\partial x_k} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_k}{\\\\partial x_i} = 0, 1 \\\\le i, k \\\\le m. See also: Cauchy problem and Ehrenpreis's fundamental principle. == Non-linear system of differential equations == Perhaps the most famous example of a non-linear system of differential equations is the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Unlike the linear case, the existence of a solution of a non-linear system is a difficult problem (cf. Navier‚ÄìStokes existence and smoothness.) See also: h-principle. == Differential system == A differential system is a means of studying a system of partial differential equations using geometric ideas such as differential forms and vector fields. For example, the compatibility conditions of an overdetermined system of differential equations can be succinctly stated in terms of differential forms (i.e., a form to be exact, it needs to be closed).

In 1933, the Nazis closed the unions, and Gottfurcht became an insurance agent. This enabled him to create an illegal trade union organisation in Saxony, Thuringia and Silesia. He was arrested in 1937 and charged with treason, but was released due to a lack of evidence, and in 1938, he was able to emigrate to the United Kingdom. In the UK, Gottfurcht joined the Labour Party and tried unsuccessfully to influence British government policy on Germany after the war.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 95(11), pp.6234-6238. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.11.6234 In sponges, the silicatein enzymes reside in the axial filaments of the axial canals of the siliceous spicules. In contrast, diatoms do not use silicateins but rather small specialised peptides called silaffins which attach long chain polyamines (LCPAs) to lysine groups. Free LCPAs can also cooperate with silaffins. Both silicateins and silaffins form higher-order structures which act both as structural templates (for exoskeletons) and mechanistic catalysts for the polycondensation reactions of silicon-compounds. The Venus' flower basket siliceous sponge is a well-known example of an organism that utilises silicatein. It is known for its remarkable ability to extract silicic acid from surrounding seawater, which is then converted into complex 3D silica structures at ambient temperatures underwater, something human engineering capabilities are unable to replicate without the use of high-temperature. Another example of silicatein-utilising organisms are the suberites, a genus of sea sponge in the family Suberitidae. Suberites consist mostly of cells, in contrast with other Porifera (such as the class Hexactinellida, to which the Venus' flower basket belongs) which are syncytial.W.

It is home to several notable Anchorage residents including former newspaper publisher Alice Rogoff, who hosted sitting US President Barack Obama at her lakeside residence in 2015 during his only visit to Alaska. The Campbell Lake dam failed during the 1964 Anchorage earthquake and again in 1989 when heavy rains caused a nearly 20-fold increase in water flow into the lake. During the 2018 Anchorage earthquake, a sewer pipe became dislodged under the lakebed, requiring drainage of the lake in May 2019 for repairs. ==Hydrology and ecology== Campbell Lake receives inflow from a portion of the Chugach Mountains via the Campbell Creek watershed. Its outflow is a shallow estuary into Turnagain Arm. Lake water temperatures exhibit a thermocline in summer and a reverse thermocline in winter, with surface temperatures varying between approximately in December to in July. Several fish species can be found in the lake including coho salmon, chinook salmon, and blackfish. The lake has been stocked with coho salmon by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to support upstream sport fishing, but fishing is not permitted in the lake. ==Ownership and access== In September 2019, Campbell Lake was the subject of an investigative report arguing that the lake, which was long held to be private, was public under Alaska statutory law. In December 2019, the City of Anchorage and State of Alaska released a joint statement clarifying that the lake is open to the public for \\"boating and all forms of permissible recreation.\\" Campbell Lake can be legally accessed by the public in one of three ways: # By water, using Campbell Creek # By air, using a floatplane or other aircraft # By land, using one of two public easements, both of which can be used \\"without permission\\" of private property owners.

It preferentially affects the muscles of the hip girdle and shoulder girdle. No disease modifying pharmaceuticals have been developed as of 2019, although physical therapy, lifestyle modification, and orthopedic surgery can be used to address symptoms. ==Signs and symptoms== Disease severity varies greatly, even between family members with identical mutations. Age of onset is highly variable, although symptoms usually appear between 8 and 15 years of age. Patients usually lose the ability to ambulate 10 - 20 years after symptoms appear. Milder forms present with symptoms other than weakness, such as muscle aches, cramps, or exercise intolerance, and people in this group can retain ambulation beyond age 60. Weakness is symmetric, progressive, and proximal (on or close to the torso), usually affecting the hip girdle and shoulder girdle muscles. Hip weakness can manifest as a waddling gate. Shoulder weakness can manifest as winged scapulas. Muscle contractures, especially of the Achilles tendon, and scoliosis can also occur. Heart function and intelligence are generally not affected. Additionally, the muscles of the face, eye, tongue, and neck are spared. ===Subtypes=== Three subtypes of the autosomal recessive form have been described * Pelvifemoral (Leyden-M√∂bius) LGMD: Weakness is first apparent in the pelvic girdle, and later in the shoulder girdle. Onset is early. It is the most frequent subtype. * Scapulohumeral (Erb) LGMD: Weakness is first apparent the shoulder girdle, and later in the pelvic girdle. Onset is later, and symptoms are milder. * HyperCKemia: No symptoms, although serum creatine kinase levels are high. There is a less common, autosomal dominant form, which is milder than the autosomal recessive forms, ranging from no symptoms to wheel chair dependence after age 60. ==Genetics== Mutation in the gene CAPN3, which encodes the protein calpain-3 (CAPN3), is the cause of calpainopathy. As of 2019, more than 480 CAPN3 mutations have been reported, some of which can be associated with severe or benign disease course. Usually, the disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, requiring both CAPN3 alleles to be mutated for disease to occur. However, there can be CAPN3 mutations that follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. ==Pathophysiology== left right As of 2019, the pathophysiology is largely not understood, although it is increasingly becoming accepted that calcium dysregulation plays a role. ==Diagnosis== Photomicrograph of muscle affected by calpainopathy. Seen in these views are endomysial fibrosis (black asterisks), central nuclei (black arrows), fiber splitting (yellow triangle), necrosis (black triangles), atrophic fibers (yellow arrows), and increased variation in size and shape. Scale bar: 25¬µm Genetic testing is the most definitive test. If genetic testing is not available, a muscle biopsy with protein immunoanalysis can be used. Biopsy shows general dystrophic features, such as areas of muscle death, variability in muscle size, nuclei in the center of muscle fibers, and disorganized muscle fibers within muscle cells. Serum creatine kinase, a nonspecific marker of muscle damage, can be elevated early in the disease. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) can present similarly, although facial weakness and asymetrical weakness is common in FSHD. ==Management== As of 2019, no disease modifying pharmaceuticals are known. Both strength and aerobic exercise have shown to be beneficial, although strenuous and excessive exercise should be avoided. Physical therapy can address contractures. Orthopedic surgery address foot deformities, scoliosis, Achilles tendon contractures, and winged scapula. Winged scapula can be addressed with either scapulopexy or scapulothoracic fusion. Circumstances to avoid include extremes of body weight, bone fractures, and prolonged immobility. ==Epidemiology== Prevalence ranges from 1 to 9 cases per 100,000 people. LGMDR1 represents 30% of all LGMD cases. ==Research directions== Research is being done to identify the proteins cleaved by calpain-3. Gene therapy is being studied to replace the function of the calpain-3.

Also known as Historic Hotel Bethlehem, it dates from 1922 and is Beaux Arts in style. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of a historic district, presumably the Central Bethlehem Historic District which includes 165 contributing buildings. It replaced a hotel that was converted from a general store in 1822. ==History== Hotel Bethlehem replaced a hotel that opened in 1822 in a building formerly housing the 1794 general store, and was known as The Golden Eagle, later The Eagle, after a mural by Peter Grosh on the facade. This first hotel was remodeled in the 1870s but in 1920 was demolished for replacement with a more modern and more fireproof structure. The Bethlehem Hotel Corporation built the new Bethlehem Hotel starting in 1921, with funding from Charles M. Schwab and others at Bethlehem Steel, and it was opened in 1922. The Pioneer Tap Room is decorated with 1937 murals on the history of Bethlehem by military artist George Gray, part of a series commissioned by General J. Leslie Kinkaid, president of then-owner American Hotels Corporation. The former solarium, now a restaurant, has original Moravian tile.

Goren is an American political scientist and historian. She is a professor of political science and global studies at Carroll University, where she has also been Chair of the Department of History, Political Science and Religious Studies. Goren uses popular culture, such as literature and film, to understand American politics. She has published work on how popular culture affects public perceptions of political leadership by women, how feminist ideas are reflected and affected by popular culture, and the politics of re- distribution in the United States Congress. ==Education== Goren attended Kenyon College, graduating in 1987 with an AB degree in Political Science and English. Goren then attended Boston College, where she earned an MA and then a PhD, both in political science. ==Career== In addition to her articles in peer-reviewed academic journals, Goren has been the author or editor of several books. In 2003, she published The Politics of Military Base Closings: Not in My District. The book uses the Base Realignment and Closing Commission to study the politics of re-distributive decisions by the United States Congress and the president, arguing that the Commission was a tool to shield representatives from the electoral consequences of redistribution. Goren was the editor of the 2009 book You've Come a Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture, which studied the intersection of politics and popular culture from multiple different feminist positions. The core theme of the book is the study of how feminism informs popular culture, and how popular culture in turns affects understandings of feminism. The volume included close readings of television series, books, and films from both second-wave feminist and third-wave feminist writers. The authors and editor deliberately encouraged a critical dialogue between the chapters, arguing that the contrasting perspectives that the authors of the volume took regarding certain popular culture topics mirrored broader disagreements in contemporary American politics. Goren was also the editor, together with Justin S. Vaughn, of the 2012 book Women and the White House: Gender, Popular Culture, and Presidential Politics. The book is a collection of works on how popular culture shapes public perceptions of leadership by women, as well as how these opinions are reflected in popular culture. It particularly focuses on gendered portrayals of, and gendered ideas about, the American Presidency. Women and the White House won the 2014 Susan Koppelman Award, which is awarded by the Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association for the best anthology, multi-authored, or edited book in the topic of feminist studies in popular and American culture that was published in the preceding year. It also received the 2014 Peter C. Collins book award from the Southwest Popular Culture/American Culture Association. Goren was also the co-editor with Linda Beail of Mad Men and Politics: Nostalgia and the Remaking of Modern America, published in 2015. From 2009 to 2011, Goren was President of the Carroll University Faculty. She has also been a 2-time chair of the Politics, Literature and Film section of the American Political Science Association. In 2018, Goren was a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Bonn. There she worked on a project called \\"Nostalgia in the Age of Anxiety: Political Culture, Emotion, and Citizenship\\". Goren has been quoted, or her work has been cited, in media outlets including The Washington Post, USA Today, The Atlantic, WBUR, and WUWM, and she has published in outlets like The Washington Post and Fortune. ==Selected works== *The Politics of Military Base Closings: Not in My District (2003) *You've Come a Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture, editor (2009) *Women and the White House: Gender, Popular Culture, and Presidential Politics, editor with Justin S.

The line operates every 10‚Äì15 minutes at all times. Trips are roughly 50 minutes. This line provides additional express service for route 70 daily between 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM, serving select stops along Georgia Avenue. ==Current Route== Route 79 operates between Silver Spring station and Archives station providing limited stop service along Georgia Avenue. Routes 79 and S9 are the only MetroExtra routes to have full-time service with all other MetroExtra routes operating only during weekday or weekday peak periods. It is also one of the few Metrobus routes with dedicated bus lanes. Route 79 operates out of Montgomery division but has some trips out of Bladensburg division during rush hours. ==History== Prior to route 79, the only express route that operated along Georgia Avenue was the Brightwood Express Line under route 73. Route 73 was the main express route operating along Georgia Avenue running between Silver Spring station and Archives station only supplementing routes 70 and 71 as they run local routes. However, in 2000, route 73 was discontinued and replaced by routes 70 and 71. ===New route 79=== In response to growing demand along Georgia Avenue plus to reduce overcrowding on routes 70 and 71, WMATA launched route 79 under their new MetroExtra brand on March 19, 2007 as a limited stop express service providing service on high ridership lines. Route 79 was the first MetroExtra route introduced by WMATA which operates between Silver Spring station and Archives station during weekday peak-hours only. The new route will only serve 16 stops northbound and 15 stops southbound. The original run of route 79 used the 2007 New Flyer C40LFRs out of Bladensburg division. Although, route 79 started using other buses throughout the years, when the C40LFRs undergoes maintenance. Today, route 79 can be found mostly using any type of Metrobus. ===2011 Service Changes=== On September 25, 2011, new midday service was added to route 79 which operates every 10-12 minutes. ===2013 Service Changes=== On March 24, 2013, new Saturday service was added to route 79. The line will operate every 15 minutes between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. only. On December 29, 2013, new Sunday service was added to route 79 also operating between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. operating every 15 minutes. ===Cash Free Plot=== In 2018, WMATA began experiencing \\"cashless\\" payment on buses as part of a plot to speed up travel time. One of the routes that will work for the plot was route 79. On June 24, 2018, route 79 began a six-month cash free plot for WMATA. According to WMATA, route 79 was selected for the plot due to its proximity to retail stores and Metrorail stations to purchase or load SmarTrip cards, as well as alternative bus service for cash-paying riders. Passenger wishing to pay with cash would have to ride the local route 70 instead. Controversy The plot had passengers worried overall. Non SmarTrip riders will lose access to one of the most heavily used bus lines in the system. WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld stated: It is something that‚Äôs a trend within the industry, but we want to see how that plays out here in our community. DC Councilmember David Grosso sent a letter to WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld, urging him to consider the implications of cashless bus service stating: As this policy seeks to push cash users to utilize a SmarTrip, it will lengthen their commutes because it will be difficult and potentially expensive to find and use a SmartTrip machine unless they happen to live, work, or go to school near a Metrorail station or WMATA retail partner. This is particularly concerning for residents in Wards 7 and 8, where only 3 non-Metrorail station sales locations exist. Metro also asked the public's feedback on cashless payment and can be expanded onto other MetroExtra routes and future limited stop routes. However, riders are not in favor of the cashless experiment. Metro Accessibility Advisory Committee Chair Phil Posner told the Metro Board in an WTOP interview: Cash-free buses are something we have always worried about for the disability community and the underserved community, because there is a group that doesn‚Äôt have access to anything but cash ‚Äî do not have credit cards, do not have bank accounts, do not have checking accounts. The 79 express makes 16 stops... the alternate route, the 70, makes 49 stops. Make a decision that has a little heart to it for the people, the large population, that doesn‚Äôt have it, because this is a pilot that‚Äôs going to affect everything from Columbia Pike throughout the entire system, and I think that‚Äôs really important to take into account. Maryland Metro Board Member Michael Goldman also said: Let‚Äôs see what the experiment shows, but we obviously have problems not just on bus but on rail with individuals entering the system and not paying. So let‚Äôs see what happens on the bus side and see if, on balance, this produces more benefits in terms of shorter stops at bus stops and a shorter ride for our passengers than... whatever revenue might be lost by allowing a few riders to travel for free. The Metro Board took in all surveys by November 2018 and will consider if they should extend the cashless payment. ===Extension of Cashless Payment=== In December 2018, WMATA announced that the cashless payment plot will be extended for another six months on route 79 with a full permanent adoption being decided in 2019. ===Discontinuation of Cashless Payment=== In May 2019, WMATA announced that the cashless payment plot will end on June 23, 2019. Regular fares will still be applied to the route. ===2020 Proposed Changes=== During WMATA's FY2021 budget year proposal, WMATA proposed to raise the MetroExtra fare from $2.00 to $3.00 at all times. However, WMATA also proposed to operate route 79 up to 10:00 p.m. instead of 7:00 p.m. daily. ===2020 Changes=== On August 23, 2020, southbound route 79 service was rerouted to operate along 7th street instead of 9th street in order to streamline service. ==References== 79 ","title":"Georgia Avenue Limited Line"},{"id":"63872411","text":" ªEua National Park is a national park on the island of 'Eua in Tonga.

He was born in Qufu, Shandong, China and relocated to Taiwan in 1949 in the aftermath of the Chinese Communist revolution. In Taiwan, he served as the chairman of Chinese Baptist Convention and as the pastor of Keelung Baptist Church and Xiamen Street Baptist Church. He was also the founder of Kindly Light Baptist Church and Youth Park Baptist Church. == Biography == Kung Fan-pei was a 74th- generation descendant of Confucius (not in the main line of descent). He held a degree in fine arts from Ching-Hua Fine Arts Institute (what is today Central Academy of Fine Arts). His wife was Hsu Jui-jung. During the second Sino-Japanese War, Kung and his wife fled to Jinan and began attending church services before being baptized. After World War II came to an end in 1945, they went back to their hometown, Qufu, where Kung became a fine arts teacher in a local school. Before long, however, they were forced to flee from their hometown again as the Chinese Civil War broke out and the Chinese Communist army took over Shandong. Kung joined the Republic of China Air Force and served as a cartographer in the rank of second lieutenant. Along with the retreating Republic of China Armed Forces, Kung and his wife arrived at Taiwan in 1949. Having graduated in 1968 from Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary with a bachelor's degree in theology, Kung became a minister at Keelung Baptist Church. In 1976, Kung became the pastor at Xiamen Street Baptist church and founded Kindly Light Baptist Church. In 1983, he was elected chairman of Chinese Baptist Convention and conducted an official visit in November to Missouri, United States in his capacity as the chairman of the convention.

This includes people born in the UK who are of Bhutanese descent, and Bhutan-born people who have migrated to the UK. ==Background== According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, around 350 Bhutanese refugees settled in the United Kingdom in 2007. The resettlement was carried out under the Gateway Protection Programme. The European Resettlement Network, which is co-coordinated between the International Organization for Migration, the UNHCR, and International Catholic Migration Commission, has produced data which suggests this has mainly been from asylum centers in Nepal. Countries such as the United States and Canada have also welcomed many Bhutanese immigrants, alongside the UK. ==History== In August 2010, the first known Bhutanese people to emigrate to the United Kingdom arrived in the country. The resettlement came after the UK Border Agency sent an interviewing team to the refugee centres of Nepal, including the Beldangi, Goldhap, Khudunabari, Sanischare and Timai camps. In May 2013, a group of Bhutanese British residents, who had successfully settled in the UK, presented a talk at SOAS University of London, detailing the experiences of acclimatising to life in the country. In April 2016, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge met with a group of Bhutanese Britons, who worked and studied in the United Kingdom, at their Kensington Palace home. The meeting was aimed at speaking with Chevening Scholarship-Bhutanese students, who wore traditional gho and Kira-dress, ahead of a royal visit to Bhutan. Notable Bhutanese people to have studied in Britain include filmmaker and lama Khyentse Norbu, who attended SOAS University of London, the School of Oriental and African Studies, in the early 1990s. ==Academic research== In a study conducted for the European Bulletin of Himalayan Research in 2013, Dr Nicole Hoellerer examined integration difficulties for Bhutanese people, including unemployment, cultural adjustment, language barriers, and mental health, particularly for those living in the Greater Manchester area.

Joe and The Land of Ta stickers for Dennison. == Personal life == Sam Petrucci was born in Medford Massachusetts on December 22, 1926 to Salvatore and Mary Petrucci (n√©e Dunn). He worked as a bellhop at the Ritz Carlton as a teenager. Petrucci joined the Navy at the age of 16; he became a radio operator on the USS Willard Keith. After World War II, he studied art at Vesper George School of Art. He married Leona Petrucci and together they had five children: Maureen, Ken, Lisa, Linda, and Steven. Leona Petrucci died in 2008. Sam Petrucci died of natural causes on September 27, 2013 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. == Career == Sam Petrucci's career as an artist began in the 1960s. His early work was for the Hassenfeld Brothers Toy Company (Hasbro) where he illustrated board games for Superman, The Mighty Hercules, and The Banana Splits. He also illustrated the packaging for Mr. Potato Head. A 1978 Lassie lunchbox he designed for Thermos is displayed at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institute. He did design work on the team yearbooks for the Red Sox and Boston Bruins in the 1960s and 1970s. Sam Petrucci founded two design studios: Thresher & Petrucci followed by Sam Petrucci & Associates. He later worked for Gunn Associates in Boston where he designed packaging and company logos for at least 25 years. He retired in 1994. === G.I. Joe === Sam Petrucci designed the original logo and box art for Hasbro's G.I. Joe action figure toy line in 1964. According to his Gunn Associates colleague John Filosi, Petrucci turned down Hasbro stock and accepted a flat payment for his art. Petrucci was a regular guest at G.I. Joe conventions. He attended GIJoeCon in 2009 and 2011. In 2002, he appeared in G.I. Joe Documentary: The Story Of America's Movable Fighting Man and created the original cover art for the documentary. === Design and logos === Sam Petrucci designed packaging and logos for numerous companies, including Charleston Chew, Ocean Spray, Veryfine, Gillette, Newport, Titleist, Marshmallow Fluff, Converse, Polaroid, TJ Maxx, Prince Spaghetti, Salada tea, Bose, BASF, the World Wildlife Fund, Friendly's, Poland Spring, Smokey Bear, Sunkist, Dunkin' Donuts, Gorton's Fishsticks, the Massachusetts Lottery, Venus Crackers, Jose Cuervo, Boston College, Harvard, Liberty Mutual, and Hewlett-Packard === The Land of Ta === The Land of Ta sticker sheet including Geedis The Land of Ta was a short-lived series of fantasy stickers produced by the Dennison Manufacturing Company in 1981 to 1982. The first two sticker sheets titled The Land of Ta (1981) were illustrated and painted by Sam Petrucci, who was not credited. Sheet #80-218 featured original characters named Zoltan, Harry, Iggy, Tokar, Geedis, and Erik. Sheet #80-219 featured six more original characters: Hermann, Eris, Uno, Shimra, Radon, and Stefan. An unknown artist illustrated the third sticker sheet (#80-224) titled Women of Ta (1982); it featured female characters named Cecily, Astrid, Sybil, Amneris, Ursula, and Rimelda. Sam Petrucci did regular artwork for stickers produced by Dennison Manufacturing Company. This included sticker sheets for spaceships, cartoon baby animals, holiday stickers. Also in 1981, Petrucci did the artwork for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rub-down transfers produced by FNR International Corp.  Geedis  The character Geedis (a horned, bear-like creature) of The Land of Ta became an Internet meme in 2017. Comedian Nate Fernald discovered an enamel pin of Geedis pin on eBay and tweeted on June 21: On August 1, a scan of The Land of Ta sticker sheet that included Geedis was rediscovered on a Flickr page. Speculation about the pins and stickers being merchandise for a wider media franchise grew but no further information about The Land of Ta or the identity of the artist was available on the Internet. Fernald bought upwards of 80 Geedis pins from the eBay seller and posted a video of his pin collection to his Facebook page on December 1, 2017. On Reddit, the subreddit r/Geedis was created on September 4, 2017 and became dedicated to solving the origins of Geedis. A June 3, 2019 post on r/UnresolvedMysteries and a subsequent June 8 comment on an r/AskReddit thread caused the r/Geedis subreddit to increase from 250 subscribers to over 15,000 subscribers.https://subredditstats.com/r/geedis In 1990, Dennison merged with Avery International Corporation and became Avery Dennison. In 2014, the Framingham History Center in Framingham, Massachusetts opened an exhibition about Dennison after receiving the archives from Avery Dennison This included The Land of Ta sticker sheets. The Reddit focused WBUR- FM podcast Endless Thread discovered the Geedis mystery from the growing r/Geedis subreddit. In their August 23 episode \\"Geedis: An Internet Mystery For The Ages... Gets Solved!\\", co-hosts Amory Sivertson and Ben Brock Johnson interviewed Nate Fernald, r/Geedis Redditors, Framingham History Center staff, and former Dennison staff. The duo contacted former Dennison Art Director Tom Manguso and his son Bill recognized the Land of Ta stickers as the work of Sam Petrucci. Petrucci was a coworker of Bill Manguso at Gunn Associates and a peer of Tom Manguso at school. Tom Manguso was the one who brought in Petrucci to work for Dennison. Sivertson and Johnson discovered the 2013 obituary for Sam Petrucci and successfully contacted all five of his children. They met with Linda Petrucci in New Hampshire at the family lake house that was designed by her father. There they saw much of his original artwork, including the pencil sketches titled The Fantasy Land and the final mounted artwork for The Land of Ta, which included his signature. In the interview, former Dennison General Manager Lou D'Amaro recalled a coworker regularly used the term \\"geetus\\" as slang for money, giving a possible origin to the name \\"Geedis\\". Former staff members on a Dennison Alumni Facebook page claimed Dennison never produced enamel pins.

The virus was first called Ag80-663 but was renamed to Rio Negro virus in 2005. The virus is a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex (VEEC), which are a group of alphaviruses in the Americas that have the potential to emerge and cause disease. Closely related viruses include Mucambo virus and Everglades virus. == Structure == Rio Negro virus is a spherical, enveloped virus. The complete virus particle, called a virion, leaves the host cell by budding and using a part of its host cell's membrane as the envelope. On the surface of the envelope are proteins that attach to receptors on the surface of cells. There are 80 'spikes' embedded in the stolen membrane, which are arranged in a T=4 icosahedral symmetry. In all, the Rio Negro virion is about 70 nanometers (nm) in diameter with 3 structural proteins making up the capsid. There are 2 open reading frames (ORF) on the genome. The proteins (E1, E2, and C) are encoded in the C-terminal ORF near the 3' end while the non- structural proteins (nsPs 1-4) are encoded in the N-terminal ORF the 5' end. The E1 and the E2 proteins are used to make up the base of the protrusions that interact between the capsid and the membrane. == Viral genome == The virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome that is 11.5 kilobases in length. It encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The Rio Negro genome is a non-segmented genome, meaning that to make copies or proteins, the whole genome must be translated to get a specific part. These are then broken up into sub-genomic proteins, which encode the structural proteins. The genome and the sub-genome have 5' caps and poly(A) tails. == Transmission == The main vector of transmission for Rio Negro is mosquitoes and rodents. There are seven mosquitoes that have been scientifically shown to be carriers of the Rio Negro virus. The species with the most evidence of infection were the Culex interfor, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes albifasciatus, and Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus. == Viral replication cycle == === Entry === Rio Negro virus, like all alphaviruses, has glycoprotein receptors, called E proteins, on its envelope. which recognize cellular receptors in order to perform membrane fusion. On the viral envelope, there are originally two of these glycoprotein receptors, P62 and E1, which form a dimer. P62 is eventually cleaved into E2 and E3 proteins, forming a trimer, and this prepares these proteins to be reactive to acidic conditions. Membrane fusion is initiated by receptor recognition, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Then, in response to the low pH of the endosome, an irreversible change in the conformation of the glycoprotein trimer occurs. The E2 protein's cytoplasmic domain interacts with the nucleocapsid of the virus, while its ectodomain binds to receptors on the surface of the host membrane. When the E2 protein binds to host receptors, the virus is engulfed into the host via endocytosis. Once the virus is in a cellular endosome, with low pH, the E1 and E2 proteins disassociate. This conformational change exposes the viruses' fusion peptides, which then fuse the membrane of the virus and the cellular endosome, which transports the nucleocapsid of the virus into the cytoplasm of the host cell. === Genome replication === After membrane fusion, the genome of Rio Negro virus enters the host's cytoplasm, and this is where replication and transcription occur. The viral genomic +ssRNA is used both to translate proteins and to transcribe (+)ssRNA copies of the viral genome. The viral genome has two ORFs which generate the nonstructural and structural polyproteins. There are five structural proteins - C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1 - as well as the nonstructural polyprotein - nsP1-4. Rio Negro virus, as a type of alphavirus, encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) in it's genome that are used in RNA synthesis. These are initially produced as a polyprotein, but are later cleaved by viral or host proteases, to form separate polyproteins. The first cleavage produces polyprotein P123 and nsP4, and these form a negative sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) template strand to be used to replicate the viral genome. Then, the P123 polyprotein is further cleaved to form nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 proteins, in addition to nsP4. These produce +ssRNA copies of the viral genome, using the -ssRNA strand as a template, that will later be distributed to the virions which will be released after assembly. The RdRp is capable of de novo RNA synthesis. === Assembly and release === Alphavirus nucleocapsids are assembled in the cytoplasm from the capsid proteins produced in translation of the viral genome. Alphavirus virions are composed of the lipid envelope in which the E2 and E1 glycoproteins are located, and the nucleocapsid, composed of the capsid protein, which surrounds the genome. The capsid proteins have two domains: the C-terminal protease domain and the N-terminal domain, which has a strong positive charge. The protease function of the C-terminal serves to cleave the capsid protein from the polyprotein in which it was produced, so that it can separate to form the capsid. The viral genome contains conserved regions that serve as packaging signals, which increase the efficiency of viral packaging. One of these packaging signals is in the nsP1 coding sequence in the Venezuelan, Eastern, and Western equine encephalitis viruses. This area of the genome forms eight stem loops. Each of these loops contain triplet guanine (GGG) nucleotides at the stem tip. When the nucleocapsid of the virus is assembled, encapsulating the newly produced viral genome, it exits the cell by budding through the plasma membrane. This is also where virus-encoded surface glycoprotein E1 and E2 are assimilated onto the virion. == Host interactions == The virus capsid and de novo viral gene expression is needed to shut down STAT1 creation. Not only that, research shows that VEEC viruses don't seem to be affected by some of the cell's defenses, mainly type I and II IFNs. == Tropism == Infection in humans and horses are different. In horses, the virus attacks the central nervous system, causing paralysis and eventual death. When the virus infects humans, symptoms manifest as fever, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and back pain. Humans tend to recover in a few weeks, during which sever symptoms are limited to the first couple days. The case fatality rate for human adults is only 1%, but it is much higher in children, rising to 20%. Horses have a 10% chance of dying from infection. Like most virus infections, there is the normal collection of flu-like symptoms from the immune system fighting back. There is a 4‚Äì14% chance of neurological complications developing from infection. Death is usually caused by encephalitis and bleeding in the brain, lungs, or intestines. == References == Category:Alphaviruses ","title":"Rio Negro virus"},{"id":"63872655","text":"Tehran Children: A Holocaust Refugee Odyssey is a book by Mikhal Dekel published in 2019. In it Dekel reconstructs her father Hannan's journey as a child refugee fleeing Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II. Hannan was one of nearly 1,000 child refugees who travelled from Central Asia to the Middle East as they fled the conflict. The book includes archival research, memoir, and travel reportage from Poland, Russia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Israel. The New York Times wrote that the experiences of these children had been ‚Äúlittle researched and reported‚Äù prior to Tehran Children. The book examines the ‚Äúprofound dislocations ‚Äì geographical, familial, psychological ‚Äì of the first stages of the German invasion of Poland,‚Äù leading to an exodus in which the children endured Soviet Gulags, the ‚Äústarving regions of Communist Uzbekistan, until they found refuge in Iran.\\" The Times noted ‚ÄúTehran Children suggests pathways for further research into a wide range of topics,‚Äù including American Jewish leadership during World War II. the Jewish Agency in Palestine, Polish- Jewish relations, and Bukharan Jewish communities, along with questions about the psychology of survival. \\"'Tehran children [is] not simply another detail of the Holocaust but a matter of enduring existential, psychological and moral reflection.\\" Reviewers have drawn comparisons between the events recorded in Tehran Children and the experience of child refugees around the world through the present day. The Guardian writes: ‚Äúwhat makes Dekel‚Äôs study so valuable is not just its assiduous detailing of one family‚Äôs fate during the second world war, but how it also makes us reflect on our current era, with its mass migrations of desperate people fleeing conflict and hardship only to meet inflamed nativism and the desire to shift responsibility for their fate from one country on to the next.‚Äù Tehran Children is a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize in 2020. ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Books about the Holocaust ","title":"Tehran Children"},{"id":"63872665","text":"The Currimundi Lake (Kathleen McArthur) Conservation Park is a protected area that is located approximately north of Caloundra, Queensland, Australia.

The Columbia collection consists in part of diaries, letters, photographs, and other material, of Missourians ranging from farmers, bankers, and frontier pioneers. However, during 2011, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection was absorbed into the State Historical Society and ceased to exist. The manuscripts and collection of the Western Historical Manuscript Collection can be accessed at the Society's Research Center located in Ellis Library and at Society research centers in Kansas City, St. Louis, Rolla, Cape Girardeau, and Springfield. ==Personal life== While teaching in New Mexico he met Mary Louise Webb. They married on June 5th, 1929 in Roswell, NM. He was father to three children; Richard F. (d. 1935), and two adopted daughters, Mary Ann (d.1965) and Barbara Lee (d. 1984). Both Lewis and his wife Mary (who he referred to as Louise) and their daughter set up a number of endowments for educational benefit. Atherton was also an active researcher of his own family history; this legacy was donated to the University of Missouri. ==Death== Atherton died in Boone County, Missouri on March 25,1989, aged 84. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Carroll County, Missouri. ==Ancestry== Atherton descended from Henry Atherton, a Quaker (b.1653) of Farnworth, Lancashire, who emigrated to America in the 1700s, and resided in Chester, Pennsylvania. ==See also== American frontier - Lewis E.

In 1990, the E791 collaboration was joined by Prof. Val Fitch's group from Princeton to conduct a search for a hypothetical doubly-strange dibaryon H.

C56 (1997) 116, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.56.1164 In 1995, Lang joined a newly proposed MINOS experiment at Fermilab, a long-baseline search for neutrino oscillations. Discovery of neutrino oscillations in Japan in 1998 invigorated the physics program of MINOS that took data between 2003 (since 2005 with the NuMI neutrino beam) and 2012. The experiments operated two detectors separated by 734 km. It continued at a higher beam energy as MINOS+ between 2013 and 2016. Lang and Prof. Jennifer Anne Thomas of UCL are Co- Spokespersons of MINOS+. Together, MINOS and MINOS+ achieved some of the most precise determination of oscillation parameters Œ∏23 and Œîm232 and have set some of the most stringent constraints on the existence of sterile neutrinos \`\`Measurement of Neutrino and Antineutrino Oscillations Using Beam and Atmospheric Data in MINOS, P.

Since 2004 Lang has also contributed to the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments designed to discover the neutrinoless double-beta decay. This process, if observed, would demonstrate neutrino to be a Majorana particle (i.e., particle and anti-particle represent the same fundamental quantum field). The NEMO detection technique was invented by Serge Jullian and collaborators at LAL Orsay and successfully applied to seven isotopic samples of NEMO-3 (Ca-48, Se-82, Zr-96, Mo-100, Cd-116, Te-130, and Nd-150).

The goal of SuperNEMO is further improvement of the experimental method that would allow to probe the effective neutrino mass in the 50 meV range.

These matches are from International, European, and American competitions. ==History== ===North American Soccer League=== In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA- sanctioned United Soccer Association, which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the US and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network (which signed a two-year contract to broadcast a game every Sunday afternoon live and in color). The NPSL kicked off on Sunday, April 16 with a full slate of five matches. However, the ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement was terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NASL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.Sports Illustrated, Soccer Is Getting A Toehold, August 30, 1976, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091476/index.htm The leagues merged in 1968 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). It has been suggested that the timing of the merge was related to the huge amount of attention given throughout the English-speaking world to the victory by England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, Goal. While the USSF and FIFA refused to recognize the NPSL, the television contract with CBS guaranteed some element of financial stability. In 1974, although the Los Angeles Aztecs had a league-best record and points total, and rightly should have hosted the championship final, CBS intervened and strongly influenced the NASL's decision to play the match in Miami. CBS was under contract to air the game live and was unwilling to black-out the large Southern California viewing audience. At the time it was the standard in many US-based sports for the host market not to broadcast games locally unless they were sold out. At the time, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum had a capacity of 94,500 and, even in a best-case scenario, an Aztecs sell-out was unlikely. Moreover, in an effort by CBS to capture more viewers during the peak East Coast time slot, a Los Angeles-hosted game would have begun at 12:30 (PDT) local time. The league recognized that both these factors would be detrimental to ticket sales and agreed to moved the game to the Miami Orange Bowl with a 3:30 (EDT) local start. CBS had also stepped in the previous week and forced the Toros to play their semi-final match at the much-smaller Tamiami Stadium in Tamiami Park. This was done so that if Miami did win, CBS's production crews would have a full week for set-up in the Orange Bowl stadium.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat;=19740814&id;=UDw0AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=yesFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4148,1615343&hl;=en ===1974 FIFA World Cup=== By 1970, the NASL was struggling, and had lost its TV contract with CBS. As a result, they didn't provide any network TV coverage of the 1970 World Cup. 1974's coverage contained week-old filmed highlights on CBS Sports Spectacular. For the Final, CBS used BBC's feed with announcer David Coleman. ===Major Indoor Soccer League=== The MISL made inroads on national television in 1982‚Äì83. While the spring would see the end of the league's two-year deal with the USA Network, CBS would broadcast a playoff game live from Cleveland on May 7 that drew an estimated four million viewers. One game during the 1983‚Äì84 season was televised on CBS (Game 3 of the championship series on June 2) as well. 1984‚Äì85 would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television, CBS broadcast Game 4 of the championship series live on May 25. ===NCAA Men's Soccer Championship=== By 1990, CBS would televise the final of the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament between UCLA Bruins and Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Mike Joy (play-by- play), Seamus Malin (analysis), and Jim Gray provided commentary. ===UEFA club competitions=== Originally the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Super Cup would've aired on CBS Sports networks starting from 2021‚Äì22 seasons. But due to Turner Sports has decided to resign after airing most matches at the round of 16 in 2019‚Äì20 season, CBS advanced and extended the competitions rights for one and half (one for UEFA Super Cup) seasons earlier starting from the quarter finals in 2019‚Äì20 season (including the remaining round of 16 matches). ===National Women's Soccer League=== On March 11, 2020, the NWSL announced that it has entered into a three-year media agreement with CBS Sports and the video game-oriented streaming service Twitch. For the 2020 NWSL season, CBS Sports will broadcast 87 matches (including the playoffs) split between CBS, CBS Sports Network, and CBS All Access in Canada and the United States, with the exact distribution among the channels subject to change, while Twitch will stream an additional 24 matches for free. Twitch will also become the NWSL's international media rights holder and stream all matches outside Canada and the United States for free. ==References== ==External links== * Category:CBS Sports Category:CBS Sports Spectacular Category:CBS original programming Category:CBS Sports Network original programming CBS Sports Category:American live television series CBS CBS Sports ","title":"Soccer on CBS Sports"},{"id":"63873071","text":"Jonathan Pratt is an American diplomat who is an announced nominee to be the United States Ambassador to Djibouti. == Early life and education == Pratt earned a Bachelor of Arts from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut and an Master of Arts from the University of California, San Diego.\\"President Donald J.

It exists in both verse and prose versions. There are three manuscripts in verse and four in prose, including a prosification made by Jehan Wauquelin for Duke Philip the Good in 1448, which survives in a beautifully illuminated manuscript (now Royal Library of Belgium MS 9967). The most extensive verse version, found in a manuscript of Arras, has almost 15,500 alexandrines divided into 399 laisses each with its own end rhyme. ==Synopsis== Siege of Rome, painted by Loyset Li√©det, from MS 9967 The story is set in Middle Ages. The title character is the daughter of King Antoine of Constantinople. Her mother is a niece of Pope Clement given to Antoine in reward for his bravery against the Saracens. She dies giving birth and her daughter is named after Helena of Constantinople. When she is thirteen years old, Antoine falls in love with her and asks Clement for a dispensation to marry her. The pope agrees only after an angel assures him the union will never be consummated. Antoine successfully defends Rome from the Saracens, but when he returns his daughter has fled to a monastery in Flanders. When the Saracen king of Flanders falls in love with her, H√©l√®ne flees by ship but is captured by pirates. When the pirate captain tries to rape her, she prays to the Virgin Mary, who sends a storm that causes a shipwreck of which H√©l√®ne is the sole survivor. Stranded on the coast of England, she is found by King Henry, who marries her against his mother Marguerite's advice. When he goes off to defend Rome from the Turks, leaving his pregnant wife in the care of the earl of Gloucester, his mother tries through fraud to have H√©l√®ne and her newborn twin boys executed. The earl, however, only amputates her right arm. He then executes his own sister, Marie, whose death by fire was prophesied at her birth, in H√©l√®ne's place. She and her children are set adrift at sea in a rudderless boat. H√©l√®ne and the boys land on the island of Constance (ever since called Scotland), where the children are taken by a wolf and a lion. Believing them dead, H√©l√®ne sails for France. The boys are rescued by a hermit named Felix, who names the one Lion and the other Brac, because he is holding his mother's arm (French bras). In Rome, the hundred-year-old pope and King Henry defeat the Turkish king Butor and Henry adopts his crest of three leopards as his own. It is the coat of arms of England down to the present. Meanwhile, Antoine, still searching for his daughter, exorcises an evil spirit from Graibaut, king of Bavaria, who had fallen in love with his daughter, Clariande. Graibaut retires to a hermitage, leaving Bavaria to Clariande. Antoine goes to Flanders, where he repents of his incestuous desires. In England, he meets a distraught King Henry and the two realize they are in- laws. When the fraud perpetrated by Marguerite is revealed by Antoine's ruse, Henry has her burned to death. Gloucester then reveals that he burned his sister in place of H√©l√®ne. The two kings are joined by a third, Amaury of Scotland, exiled by his people on account of his conversion to Christianity. When they reach the age of sixteen, Lion and Brac go searching for their mother. They come to the court of Clariande, who has recently married the earl of Gloucester, but they must flee when she falls in love with Lion. In France, they are baptised by an archbishop of Tours named Martin. Lion and Brac are christened Martin and Brice. Throughout, their good deeds to the poor are emphasised. The three kings fight numerous battles in their search for H√©l√®ne. They capture Bordeaux, which becomes an English possession, and baptise its pagan king, Coustant, who joins them. They arrive at Tours, where H√©l√®ne goes into hiding, but they recognize her arm, which Brice still carries. Brice goes to England, but the four kings march to liberate Jerusalem from the pagans. Coustant is captured. Plaisance, the daughter of the king of Jerusalem, falls in love with him. When the two are found together, Coustant kills the king and is miraculous brought to the Christian camp by Saint George. A pregnant Plaisance flees to the protection of a Roman senator and is baptised. The senator falls in love with her, poisons his wife and tries to have her infant son murdered. A prophecy says that the two ladies (Plaisance and H√©l√®ne) will only be rescued when Jerusalem, Flanders and the city of Castres in Lombardy have been conquered. Thieves spoil the murder of Plaisance and Coustant's son, who is left in a forest near Castres, which is being besieged by Clovis I of the Franks. When the senator makes advances on Plaisance he is paralyzed and she flees to the pagan king of Castres. The siege of Jerusalem ends when King Amaury manages to scale the tallest tower. The pagan king of Jerusalem now converts and becomes an ally. This is the centrepiece of the chanson. H√©l√®ne is working as a washerwoman fending off the amorous advances of beggars when she decides to visit the pope. Plaisance has opened a hostel for pilgrims. When H√©l√®ne falls ill on her journey, she is nursed back to health by Plaisance. King Hurtaut of Castres falls in love with her, but she flees to Rome. There she meets the pope, her uncle, but keeps her identity concealed. When she learns that Henry is coming, she returns to Tours. Coustant goes in search of Plaisance and learns of the survival of his son. The remaining kings take Acre and plan to assault Mecca when Clement recalls them to deal with Hurtaut. During the siege of Castres, Amaury is captured and crucified. After two months, the city falls. Plaisance and Coustant are reunited and Henry gives them the city as a wedding gift. It is renamed Piacenza after Plaisance. The conquest of Flanders involves fighting dwarfs and giants. Henry is captured at Bruges and imprisoned in a snake pit. Antoine, Martin and Brice rescue him. Antoine, Brice and the archbishop of Tours are then captured at Hantonne in Scotland by Amaury's still pagan brother. They are freed by Amaury's secretly Christian sister Ludiane, who marries Brice and gives birth to the future Saint Brice. At last the principal characters surround Tours and demand to know about the one-armed woman. Her neighbours hand her over and beg for mercy. After 32 years, she is reunited with her father. Her son Martin miraculously restores her arm. All go to Rome to see the aged Pope Clement. There Henry and H√©l√®ne die and are buried. Brice becomes king of England and Constantinople. Martin succeeds to the archbishopric of Tours and is succeeded in turn by his nephew, Saint Brice. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Chansons de geste Category:14th-century poems ","title":"La Belle H√©l√®ne de Constantinople"},{"id":"63873116","text":"Brave Faces Everyone is the third studio album by American rock band Spanish Love Songs.

He graduated B.A. in 1831 as a member of St John's College, Cambridge, was a wrangler, obtained a first class in the Classical Tripos, and was bracketed with Joseph Blakesley for the Chancellor's medals. He proceeded M.A. in 1834. He was a Fellow of the college from 1833 to 1835. By the mid-1830s Hoare had married, and was living at Ashurst Park near Tunbridge Wells. His brother Henry Hoare started living at Staplehurst, not far away, at this period, shortly before his marriage of 1836. Ordained in 1841, Hoare became that year a curate of All Saints' Church, Southampton. Poor health prevented Hoare taking further preferment. He devoted himself to study, and became a Hebrew scholar. From 1848 to 1862 he was secretary and commissary to the Australian Bishop of Newcastle, William Tyrrell. Tyrrell graduated at St John's College in 1831, as Hoare did. They had rowed together in the college boat, and Tyrrell's biographer describes Hoare as his \\"bosom friend\\". He remained in England and was a confidential correspondent for Tyrrell.

It took place on July 11, 645 AD. The small but elite Tang army wiped out the Goguryeo relief force trying to come to bolster the defenses of Ansi, achieving a major victory. ==Background== The Emperor of China, Taizong of Tang, decided to invade Goguryeo Korea in 644 AD. The murder of the previous king of Goguryeo, Yeongnyu of Goguryeo, and other officials by the military dictator Yeon Gaesomun was used as the pretext for the invasion. The said officials are known to court the Emperor of China and had their kingdom on friendly terms with China, something that Yeon Gaesomun, himself a military hardliner, never approved and hence the reason for their murder. The invasion finally commenced on 1 April 645, when Tang forces led by general Li Shiji, under orders from the Emperor, crossed into Goguryeo territory with his army. The whole endeavor was a combined naval and ground assault of Goguryeo territories north of the Yalu River, with the Goguryeo provinces of Yodong and Baegam now in danger of falling under the sway of the Tang. Yeon Gaesomun proceeded to mobilize an army of 150,000 soldiers led by generals Go Hye-jin and Go Yeon-su to bolster the northern defenses of the kingdom by June 645. The size of the army was already proportionately very huge in relation to the small population and fragile economy of the kingdom. The mobilization of such huge army took place while Tang forces marched eastwards across Goguryeo territory and taking cities one by one, in such that by 11 June they are finally at the gates of the fortress city of Ansi, the capital of Yodong province, the second-largest city in the kingdom with 100,000 inhabitants, and the locus of the northern overland Goguryeo defensive system. Should the city fall to the Chinese, the rest of Goguryeo south of the Yalu River is defenseless to invasion. The huge relief army was thus gathered at Pyongyang and then marched north and made haste in an attempt to aid the beleaguered fortress city. == Prelude == Spies and mounted scouts scouring the northern part of Goguryeo reported to Emperor Taizong that a sizeable relief force from Pyongyang is on the way to prevent Ansi from falling to the Tang. This was the army that Yeon Gaesomun sent to relieve Ansi along with its two generals. A war council was then convened thereafter with the Emperor at the head, telling his generals that earthworks needed to be made that are to be perfectly situated at steep hills surrounding Ansi to prevent any chance of escape by the defenders of the city, while the army would face the relief force and hid a small cavalry detachment led by prince Li Daozong in a hill to flank the relief force from the rear; the battle would thus be decided in a hammer and anvil fashion as the Emperor planned. The two armies finally faced off each other at the plain situated at the foot of Mount Jupil by 21 June, with the Goguryeo army just across a river at the south end of the plain. == Battle == The battle was joined on 23 June when one of the Goguryeo generals, Go Yeon-su, sighted that the Tang army was seemingly smaller and had its lines thinly held. With this, he decided to attack with the cavalry and attempt to dislodge the large Tang army in front of his army. What he did not know is that it was actually a ploy by the Emperor Taizong to lure the Goguryeo army into a trap as earlier planned by his subordinates. The Goguryeo cavalry led by Go Yeon-su charged across the plain dominating the battlefield at the foot of Jupil Mountain just south of Ansi, towards the Tang infantry that was awaiting them in a shield wall formation. The other general, Go Hye-jin, followed suit and also joined the attack. Despite mass projectile shots from archers, crossbowmen and catapults just within the Tang formation, the cavalry charge kept up its momentum until it finally impacted the shield wall with many Tang soldiers dead in the process as the cavalry charged across. But it soon came as a shock for both generals that behind the long shield wall of the Tang army were massive and dense amounts of infantry with Emperor Taizhong and his entourage far behind observing the scene, and yet despite it they continued the assault on the Tang army. The massive Tang battle line thus slowly developed from a straight line into a U-shaped formation as its army purposefully gave way to the Goguryeo attack, giving the Goguryeo a false sense of victory at this stage. When Emperor Taizhong finally deemed the time right to spring his trap, he ordered to sound the drums and horns to signal the flanking attack by Zhangsun Wuji and other generals with a 11,000-strong cavalry detachment from behind hidden in a hill north of Mount Jupil until now. In what seemed to be a Cannae-like event, the Tang cavalry finally closed in into the rear of the Goguryeo cavalry, hitting it through its rear. The Tang army started pushing and tightening the encirclement even as the two Goguryeo generals tried to rally their men to fight on, but the one-sided mass slaughter continued. Seeing that they could not salvage the situation, the two Goguryeo generals tried as best as they could to get what was left of their force out of the encirclement to rejoin the main body of their army across the river to the south, but 30,000 of their men died trying to do so. Worse came when they found out that the bridges in the river that leads them back to the main body of their army were already torn down by the Tang commander Zhangsun Wuji under orders from Emperor Taizhong who already foresaw the event. Finding no other way to rejoin the main body of their army, the two generals rallied whatever remained of their force northwards to the peak of Mount Jupil with the Tang army in hot pursuit. The Tang army then caught up and encircled the remaining Goguryeo force atop Mount Jupil once again. In an attempt to save their beleaguered comrades atop Mount Jupil, the main body of the Goguryeo army finally joined the battle by fording the river and attacked the Tang army. However, soon they soon found themselves counterattacked on three sides by the Tang army, having failed to reach their comrades atop the mountain. Seeing that all was lost, Go Yeon-su and Go Hye-jin surrendered what remained of their command that was stranded atop the mountain, now reduced to just 3,800 wounded and famished men. What remained of the Goguryeo army that had not yet surrendered, that is, the force that tried to save their comrades atop Mount Jupil but failed, is now also subjected by attacks of the Tang army on three sides, pummeling it into a pulp until they finally retreated and dispersed southwards, only to be chased down by the pursuing Tang army with most of them dead during the chase and captured 33,000 Goguryeo soldiers prisoner. Among these, the Tang forces sent 3,500 officers and chieftains back to China, executed 3,300 Mohe troops, and eventually released the rest of the ordinary Goguryeo soldiers. As part of the war spoils taken from the enemy, the Tang army captured from the vanquished Goguryeo army 50,000 horses, 50,000 cows, and 10,000 metal body armor. == Aftermath == The destruction of the Goguryeo relief army at the hands of the Tang army isolated the city of Ansi from the rest of the Goguryeo kingdom. From then on, the garrison of the city would be left alone and at the mercy of the invading Tang army. The two Goguryeo generals, Go Hye-jin and Go Yeon-su, then defected to the Tang and were thus given imperial Chinese royal titles by Emperor Taizhong, and they later on gave advice to the Emperor on his campaign to subjugate Goguryeo. After the battle, the Emperor officially began the siege of the city that would go on for three months before being lifted due to the onset of bad weather and dwindling of supplies on part of the besiegers. Although the siege was abandoned and hence the city was saved, this disaster of a battle greatly consumed the already very limited manpower pool of Goguryeo so much that it would have a negative effects on its conduct of war for the rest of the conflict, which after years of battles and sieges would eventually result to the end of its existence and the conquest of most of its territory including its capital Pyongyang by the Tang with the rest going to another Korean kingdom, Silla, in 668 AD. == Popular culture == The 2018 South Korean film The Great Battle featured this battle as its first scene. == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:Battles involving the Tang dynasty Category:Battles involving Goguryeo Category:645 Category:640s conflicts ","title":"Battle of Jupilsan"},{"id":"63873197","text":"The Andromeda Evolution is a 2019 novel written by Daniel H. Wilson. It is a sequel to Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, published 50 years prior in 1969. It is the nineteenth and final novel under Crichton's name, and the fourth and final novel published after Crichton's death. ==Plot== 50 years after the first Andromeda incident, an anomaly is found deep in the Amazon rainforest. A large, black structure has appeared, killing off every lifeform in its path. ‚ÄúProject Eternal Vigilance‚Äù, a project dedicated to keeping an eye out for the Strain, suspects it to be a mutant version of Andromeda. The anomaly is reported and another ‚ÄúProject Wildfire‚Äù takes off. Nidhi Vedala, Harold Odhiambo, Peng Wu, Zachary Gordon, and Sophie Kline are selected as the field scientists for the investigation by computer generation. However, overseer General Stone replaces Gordon with James Stone, the son of Jeremy Stone, based on a hunch. The field scientists are told about their positions and ushered to a spot in the rainforest right outside of the quarantine zone for the anomaly. Sophie Kline does not appear, noting that she is an American astronaut residing at the International Space Station, who also suffers from ALS. Stone arrives late because he was added at the last minute, sparking tension between him and the leader, Vedala (who also does not believe he is qualified to be there). The group starts off towards the anomaly (despite Kline's constant disapproval), led by Sergeant Eduardo Brink and guided through the rainforest by natives. As Kline studies the anomaly from space, she confirms that it is a new strain of Andromeda: AS-3. After seeing many ominous signs from the native tribes, the group decides to stop for the night. In the darkness, a tribe attacks in a strangely violent manner. All of the guides are taken down and Brink kills off all of the tribe members. However, he is shot in the shoulder with an arrow contaminated with the AS-3, and dies overnight. Peng finds an Omega poison in his bag, and keeps it. She does not feel as if she can trust the others with her new knowledge due to a pre- existing anxiety disorder. The field scientists are alone, and begin studying the tribe members‚Äô bodies. They figure out that they were infected with the AS-3, and had been mining the anomaly to create weapons (such as Brink's fatal arrow). Meanwhile, Odhiambo points out a little tribal boy who had been hiding. The kid does not appear to be sick. Stone uses a translation device to converse with the boy, who reveals that his name is Tupa. Tupa explains that he is the only surviving member of his tribe. He and James Stone become inseparable, much to Vedala's discomfort. Meanwhile, the team misses their rendezvous with Stern due to the circumstances. The government is planning to resort to ‚ÄúOperation Zulu‚Äù to get rid of the anomaly, a plan which would wipe out the scientists as well. With this knowledge, Kline tries to reach Brink, not knowing of his death. She asks him to use the Omega, and Peng, knowing what that means, informs the others that for some reason Kline wants them dead. They set up a sign saying ‚ÄúALIVE‚Äù to reveal that they are not dead yet, and continue on. Once they get to the anomaly, the group realizes that it is constantly growing, and that it is extremely hot. Peng becomes increasingly anxious. They decide to enter the anomaly through its opening, much to her discomfort. Stone orders Tupa to stay back, but the boy secretly follows soon afterwards. Inside the anomaly, Stone uses drones to check ahead. They find the mangled body of a white man melted into the floor inside, raising questions as to where they are. They then come to the realization that they are in a capsule building. They enter a room to find many other bodies - construction workers, and the source of the Andromeda anomaly. As they look around, they find a control hatch leading down under the Amazonian lake it had landed over. As they continue to explore and discover, a radio transmitter is stimulated and Sophie Kline's voice comes over the radio. She explains that they have reached the control room, and that she warned them to stay away. Tupa is revealed and runs to Stone as Peng verges on a panic attack. Then, a broken propeller starts again and the Andromeda reactivates. As the floor becomes quicksand, they rush under to the hatch they found previously. Vedala ushers Peng along, but she is preparing to make a run for a different exit instead. Vedala watches as she runs and trips, and begins dying of infection. As she lies on her back in agony, she reveals to one of Stone's drones in her dying breaths that the Andromeda is on every planetary body in the solar system. It was alien machinery, looking for other life forms. Meanwhile, Kline locks up her fellow astronauts and begins working against the Andromeda, a long-awaited plan. She sees it as yet another threat, and she creates a ‚Äúspace elevator‚Äù from the anomaly and tries to create a new strain based on AS-1 and AS-2 to defeat AS-3 with the help of her robot, despite Stern's begging for her to stop. She built the anomaly. As the remaining team in the Amazon continue down the hatch, water from the river starts coming. The team rushes to escape it and to find a way out. Stone tries to help Odhiambo, who is older, but eventually it becomes worthless. Odhiambo begs for Stone to save himself, so Stone leaves him behind as Odhiambo drowns to death Eventually out of the hatch, Stone is left with just Vedala and Tupa. They realize that Kline has created a space elevator. Communicating with Stern, Vedala notes that the only way that they can stop Kline is to do so directly: traveling to the ISS. Her and Stone go up to the ISS through the space elevator, and are forced to face Kline. They find her dying of her own creation. They beg for her to stop, yet Kline resists and upsets Stone by calling him, ‚ÄúJamie.‚Äù Eventually, she brings out her robot to fight them directly. It being much more powerful than either scientist, they are completely powerless to it. It breaks in Stone's helmet, and he realizes that the only way to stop it is to stop Kline herself. So, he uses the Omega poison against her, stored in his pocket to keep away from Tupa. Kline is killed, along with her robot. Vedala, who now has major injuries from the robot's attack, approaches Stone and realizes that he has gotten infected from breathing in the strain. He tells her to leave him to die, yet as she goes she tries to think of ways that he can live. They start admitting things to each other, and he eventually admits that Jeremy Stone adopted him, and that he was ‚ÄúJamie Ritter‚Äù, the baby from the first incident. Vedala realizes that Stone has benign microparticles still in his lungs from his first infection, protecting him and making him immune from Andromeda. The two continue onwards. The other two astronauts put Vedala on morphine, yet someone still needs to sever Kline's ribbon to finally stop her plan. James Stone goes back down through orbit to do so, and as he is forced to speed up due to Kline's creation's acceleration, he briefly sees his dead mother from Piedmont who assures him that he needs to stay alive. He continues and gets the deed done, eventually reuniting with Tupa who had found his way out of the anomaly. The two were both the sole survivors of their respective birthplaces. Afterwards, Stone and Vedala are hinted at getting married and adopting Tupa. At the very end, Stern and a group of other scientists notice that Andromeda has reached Saturn and is directly connecting to an unknown extraterrestrial source. ==Main Characters== James Stone: A technician previously known as Jamie Ritter, the adopted son of Dr. Jeremy Stone.

Over ground workers have diversified into other roles such as stone-pelting, mob- rioting, ideological support, radicalisation, and recruitment of militants. In 2020, up until 8 June, around 135 over ground workers were arrested in Jammu and Kashmir by the Jammu and Kashmir police.

Creating a sense of alienation is also one of the responsibilities of OGWs‚Äîin other words, conducting psychological warfare against the government. Lt Gen K K Khanna writes: OGWs provide real-time information to the terrorist elements or militant groups to carry out tactical operations. While the tactical operations are carried out by those who are motivated for multiple reasons such as religious reasons, monetary reasons etc, OGWs are mainly motivated by money. This synergy between the OGWs and those who carry out the tactical operations results in cumulative impact.

It is often the case that during encounters, militants and OGWs are found together, and accordingly die together. In other cases, OGWs have been caught separately, such as in the aftermath of the 2019 Pulwama attack.

It ran from the Seaboard Air Line Railroad‚Äôs main line at a point known as Gross to Callahan connecting two pre-existing tracks. Gross was the name of a small turpentine village along the Seaboard Air Line main line about 7 miles north of Yulee (near the current interchange between Interstate 95 and US 17). From Gross, the line proceeded southwest though a forest where it crossed Mills Creek to Callahan where it connected with the Seaboard's line from Fernandina and Yulee to Baldwin (the former Florida Railroad). The Gross Cutoff was built in 1925 and acted as a bypass for the busy Jacksonville Terminal area, which trains would have to otherwise pass through. Trains could then continue from Callahan to the Seaboard main line in Baldwin. Enough train traffic was diverted on to the Gross Cutoff to cause the Seaboard Air Line to abandon the old Florida Railroad from its connection with the Gross Cutoff in Callahan to Yulee in 1954. In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line merged with its rival, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the main line of which crossed the former Florida Railroad in Callahan. The merged company was named the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The line was designated as the Gross Subdivision in the Seaboard Coast Line era. In the merged network, the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad main line was prioritized for through train traffic to and from the north, reducing the importance of the Gross Subdivision. The line was abandoned in 1985, right around the same time the former Seaboard Air Line main line was abandoned in southwestern Georgia, cutting it off as a through route. ==References== Category:Defunct Florida railroads Category:Railroad cutoffs ","title":"Gross Cutoff"},{"id":"63873450","text":"Katerina Akassoglou is a Greek neuroimmunologist who is a Senior Investigator and Director of In Vivo Imaging Research at the Gladstone Institutes of Neurological Diseases. Akassoglou holds faculty positions as a Professor of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco and as an Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego. Akassoglou has pioneered investigations of blood-brain barrier integrity and development of neurological diseases. She found that compromised blood-brain barrier integrity leads to fibrinogen leakage into the brain inducing neurodegeneration. Akassoglou is internationally recognized for her scientific discoveries. == Early life and education == Akassoglou was born in Athens, Greece. She was inspired to pursue science in her undergraduate degree after her high school biology teacher assisted her in securing a summer internship in an Immunology lab. Akassoglou pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of Athens, graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Biology in 1996. She stayed at the University of Athens for her graduate degree, where she focused on neuroimmunology. Her work explored the role of the cytokine TNFŒ± in neuroinflammation under the mentorship of George Kollias and Lesley Probert within the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. During her PhD, Akassoglou pursued training in neuropathology under the mentorship of Hans Lassman at the University of Vienna, Austria. After completing her graduate studies in 1998, Akassoglou went to the United States to pursue her postdoctoral training under the mentorship of Sid Strickland at both the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Rockefeller University. She specialized in neurovascular biology and began to study the actions of Fibrin in the central nervous system. She completed her postdoctoral training with Strickland in 2002 and then pursued a second postdoctoral fellowship at the New York University in the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine until 2003. == Research== To explore the biology of Tumor Necrosis Factor signalling and probe its role in promoting disease, Akassoglou expressed TNFŒ± in a transmembrane form on various brain cells. She found that when she specifically expressed TNFŒ± on astrocytes, this led to chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. This was not the case for TNFŒ± expression on neurons, which highlighted that contact dependent TNF signals in the vicinity of astrocytes promote degeneration. Since it was evident that TNF signalling contributed to neurodegeneration, Akassoglou explored how TNF signalling in the central nervous system might be implicated in multiple sclerosis. After inducing expressing of TNF from glial cells, she found oligodendrocyte death and myelin degeneration in the central nervous system, similar to the pathology one would find in MS. Akassoglou then found that by blocking the TNFŒ± receptor, she was able to abrogate inflammation and cell death suggesting a major role for TNF signalling in MS type brain pathology. Early into her postdoctoral work, Akassoglou found that deposition of fibrin exacerbates neuronal injury and degeneration, and agents which lyse fibrinogen could act as potent therapeutic agents in neurodegeneration. Akassoglou and her colleagues then probed the underlying mechanisms with which fibrin mediates neuronal damage, and they found that fibrin has an affect on Schwann Cell differentiation, keeping these cells in their non-myelinating state. They further found that fibrin deposition also changes the extracellular matrix which inhibits Schwann Cell migration, further preventing re-myelination and leading to degeneration of peripheral nerves. == Career == In 2004, Akassoglou joined the faculty in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego, where she is Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology. Akassoglou's lab was centered around exploring neurovascular regulation of inflammation and tissue repair in the context of various neurological diseases. Akassoglou's lab seeks to understand how blood proteins interact with cells and disrupt signalling in the brain parenchyma in times of blood brain barrier disruption. The overall goal of the lab is to target these mechanisms therapeutically in neurological disease to stop neurodegeneration and inflammation in the central nervous system. In 2008, Akassoglou accepted a position as an Associate Investigator at the Gladstone Institutes of Neurological Disease, maintaining an Adjunct Professorship in Pharmacology at UCSD. Akassoglou is also a Professor of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences and she now Directs the Gladstone Center for In Vivo Imaging Research. Her lab focuses on in vivo imaging to observe the behavior of immune and glial cells in the CNS during their interactions with blood proteins. Akassoglou's work has made changes to the way the field understands the interactions between the immune system, vascular system, and the brain. Her research elucidated the role that fibrin, a blood protein implicated in coagulation, has in the activation of microglia and the development of inflammation and neurodegeneration. Akassoglou and her group developed an immunotherapy to inhibit fibrin's actions in the brain to abrogate inflammation and prevent neuronal death. Following this drug development, Akassoglou co-founded a spin-off company at Gladstone Institutes, called MedaRed, that will continue to develop neuroimmune targeting therapies for neurodegeneration treatment. Akassoglou is the first female investigator at Gladstone to have founded a spin-off company. === Role of fibrinogen and microglial activation in neurodegeneration === Akassoglou and her team were the first to show that fibrinogen leakage into the brain parenchyma activates microglia and leads to neurodegeneration. They found that when fibrinogen binds to the microglial receptor CD11b/CD18 it leads to microglial migration towards vasculature and the release of reactive oxygen species that damage neurons and lead to neuronal death. However, when they blocked the receptor for fibrinogen on microglia, they no longer saw microglial migration towards vasculature and neuronal death did not occur. They later found that fibrin binding to the microglial receptor directly promotes spine elimination of neurons and promotes cognitive decline. Again, they used two-photon imaging to track the progress of disease and directly observe the role fibrinogen plays in microglial activation, spine elimination, and subsequent cognitive decline. In order to understand the progression towards neurodegeneration after blood brain barrier leakage, Akassoglou and her team tracked the activity patterns of thrombin and found that thrombin activity in the CNS preceded any sign of disease, and when thrombin activity peaked, so did fibrin activation of microglia, followed by neuron death. These findings suggest that early detection of thrombin might be a suitable diagnostic for later neurodegeneration. Since Akassoglou and her team found fibrin so critical in the development of neurodegeneration in times of blood brain barrier leakage, they designed a novel therapeutic to target fibrin and prevent its effects on microglia. They generated a monoclonal antibody, 5B8, that binds to fibrin and is able to inhibit CNS inflammation and oxidative stress without affecting blood clotting capabilities. Akassoglou then proceeded to push this monoclonal antibody into the biotechnology space so that it can be further tested and eventually used in clinical trials and then for treatment of various types of neurodegenerative and brain autoimmune disorders. == Awards and honors == * 1998 Women In Neuroimmunology Award by Cedric Raine and the International Society for Neuroimmunology * 2000 Young Investigator Award from the International Society for Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis * 2002 Young Investigator Award from the International Society for Neurochemistry * 2006 Young Investigator Award from the International Fibrinogen Society * 2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) * 2007 Dana Award in Brain and Immunoimaging *2008 John J Abel Award in Pharmacology (4th female in 60 years to win this award). *2009 EUREKA Award from the National Institutes of Health *2015 The Marilyn Hilton Award for Innovation in MS Research *2019 Barancik Prize for Innovation in Multiple Sclerosis Research *2019 Greek Top Women Award == References == Category:Greek immunologists Category:UCSF School of Medicine faculty Category:University of California, San Diego faculty Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:Greek women scientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from the Athens Urban Area ","title":"Katerina Akassoglou"},{"id":"63873514","text":"Eva Lindstr√∂m (2014) Eva Lindstr√∂m (born 1952) is a Swedish illustrator and author.

Alva attained a Master's in Public Administration in International Development (MPA/ID) from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, which she accessed after obtaining the Fulbright and Mary Jo Bane scholarships (2012-2014). She also completed an internship at the Pratham Foundation Aser Center in New Delhi, India, as part of Harvard's Women and Public Policy program. In the same way, she took leadership programs at Georgetown University. ==Career== In her last year of college, Alva joined the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance as an assistant and analyst in the Public Investment Department, and later in the Public Budget Department, in 2007. In 2012, she transferred to the newly created Ministry of Development and Social Inculsion, where she served analyst at the Office of the Deputy Minister. Following her graduation from Harvard, Alva was appointed to the Ministry of Education as coordinator of Management Tools for Results, head of the Programming Unit, and finally in 2015, Head of the Budget and Planning Office. She returned to the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 2017 as advisor to the Public Investment Department. She ultimately was appointed Director General of Public Budget of the Ministry.

Widely reviewed on publication, the book gained additional attention during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. ==Author== A graduate of the University of Missouri, Christopher Leonard was formerly an agribusiness reporter for the Arkansas Democrat- Gazette and the Associated Press. He was a fellow at the New America Foundation when he wrote the book. ==Content== Several reviewers emphasized vertical integration as key to the growth of Tyson Foods as described in the book. Kirkus Reviews described the book's message as \\"Using Tyson as a window on modern meat production, Leonard shows how the company has eliminated free market competition through vertical integration, buying up independent suppliers (feed mills, slaughterhouses and hatcheries) and controlling farmers through restrictive contracts.\\" In the Wall Street Journal, Moira Hodgson wrote that the book describes how the company founder John W. Tyson \\"left his nearly bankrupt family's farm in Missouri. He headed with his wife, his son and his truck to Arkansas, where he began to invest in chickens, hauling birds from the South, where they were cheap, to Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. He used his profits to buy chicken houses and eventually bought his own hatchery and feed mill, vertically integrating his company by buying up the firms that supplied it.\\" Christine Sismondo, writing for the Toronto Star, described how Tyson \\"got into all aspects of the business, starting with chicken feed and hatcheries, until he owned practically every cog in the chain that linked the egg to the grocery store, \\" adding that \\"Business majors will recognize this as an early and successful instance of 'vertical integration,' something Tyson pioneered in agri-business. Having tight control over the whole supply chain paid off and Tyson Foods is now the largest meat producer in the world, with a practical monopoly on wings, nuggets and tenders plus a stronghold on pork and beef as well. Writing in the Virginia Quarterly Review, James McWilliams characterized Tyson's methods as described in the book as a \\"rotten system\\", adding that \\"Tyson‚Äôs vertical integration enables the company to dictate contracts that enfeeble growers in insidious ways.\\" McWilliams concluded that a chicken farmer \\"has no control over the health of his birds or the quality of his feed\\", adding that \\"an unruly contract grower will quickly become the unknowing recipient of inferior food and sick hatchlings‚Äîin essence, the season‚Äôs dregs. Contractually, he can do nothing about the hand Tyson deals him. His numbers will drop and, after a few lackluster growing periods, the manager, citing the low figures, will fire the farmer, leaving him to default on his bank loan. What Tyson gets out of the move is both the removal of a troublesome farmer and space for a new farmer to get a new loan to build a new set of barns.\\" In the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, K. Aleks Schaefer wrote that the book \\"traces the evolution of the modern American meat industry from its post-Depression origins to the present through the eyes of Tyson Foods‚Äô innovators and contract farmers. Readers experience first-hand the exhilaration of a young couple breaking ground on their first chicken farm and suffer the sorrow of that same couple, years later, as their farm is foreclosed. We sit in Neal's Caf√©, a small diner in Springdale, Arkansas, as John and Don Tyson, in their matching khaki coveralls, discuss corporate strategy and contrive the McDonalds McNugget.\\" ==Critical reception== In the New York Times, Nick Reding described the book as a \\"brilliant, in-depth portrait of Tyson Foods\\" that \\"leans left, with a journalist‚Äôs tireless reporting and uncommon empathy for small producers of chicken and pork, making it easy to fault Tyson for everything that ails us.\\" Writing in the Washington Post, Bethany McLean described the book as a \\"deeply reported narrative about how big business has come to rule the production of meat.\\" A review in Publishers Weekly said that the author \\"pulls off a stunning feat in putting the heat on the major industrial meat giants,\\" adding that \\"the hardest body blows are landed by Leonard on Tyson Food, the nation's biggest meat company, whose production and distribution practices were previously hush-hush, due to a rigid code of silence and potential retaliation on those who snitch. Founded during the Great Depression, Tyson Foods fashioned a highly profitable empire through smart alliances with bankers, creating a network of local contract farmers and keeping them on a short economic leash while controlling the entirety of the supply chain.\\" Dan Charles of National Public Radio wrote that the book \\"aims a spotlight at Tyson Foods, which helped create the modern chicken industry. And it recounts the stories of people, mostly farmers, whom Leonard contends Tyson has chewed up and cast aside since its incorporation in 1947. ==Attention during the Covid-19 pandemic== During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the book was mentioned in the press and its author Christopher Leonard was quoted as an expert on Tyson Foods as the coronavirus spread through the meat processing industry. In an interview published in the Los Angeles Times, Leonard said \\"This is 100% a symptom of consolidation,\\" adding \\"We don‚Äôt have a crisis of supply right now. We have a crisis in processing. And the virus is exposing the profound fragility that comes with this kind of consolidation.\\" In the Financial Times of London, Leonard was quoted about the full page ad that John H. Tyson signed in the New York Times and other papers, calling the statement \\"extraordinarily rare, if not unprecedented,\\" adding \\"to so blatantly advertise that the system is falling apart was breathtaking. I mean, the entire rationale for Tyson Foods‚Äô existing is that they can get meat to the grocery counter consistently, affordably and in a way that doesn‚Äôt make you sick.\\" ==References== Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Agriculture books Category:American non-fiction books ","title":"The Meat Racket"},{"id":"63873679","text":"The Gordon River Greenway is a nearly 2-mile system of trails and boardwalks running along the Gordon River in Naples, Florida. ==Route== Gordon River as seen from bridge.

ABC first broadcast World Cup matches in 1970, when they aired week-old filmed highlights shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. ABC would broadcast at least portions of the World Cup again in 1982. And finally, beginning in 1994, ABC was the official American network broadcaster of the World Cup up through 2014. ABC also broadcast the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1999 and 2003. ==Coverage history== ===1970=== The first American telecast of a World Cup match was when NBC aired the final between England and West Germany from four years prior. NBC there, aired the contest on a same-day tape delay using the BBC‚Äôs black-and-white feed. In 1970, it was ABC's turn to broadcast the World Cup final. While ABC aired the contest between Italy and Brazil in color unlike what NBC did in 1966, ABC decided to wait until Christmas, six months after Brazil won, to show it as part of an episode of Wide World of Sports. ===1982=== In 1982, PBS and ESPN provided the first thorough American television coverage of the FIFA World Cup. ABC aired the first live telecast of the final. ABC aired commercials during the live action. Meanwhile, PBS aired same day highlights of the top game of the day. :Commentators *Giorgio Chinaglia (studio analyst) *Paul Gardner (color commentary) *Mario Machado (color commentary) *Jim McKay (play-by-play) *Jack Whitaker (studio host) ===1990s=== 1994 The 1994 FIFA World Cup marked the return of the World Cup on ESPN and ABC and the first time they used their own commentary teams for all matches. Roger Twibell was the lead play-by-play announcer. Other play-by-play announcers were: Bob Carpenter, Bob Ley, Ian Darke, Randy Hahn, and Jim Donovan. Seamus Malin and Rick Davis were the lead color commentators. Other color commentators were: Clive Charles, Ty Keough, Peter Vermes, Ron Newman, and Bill McDermott. Jim McKay was the studio host alongside studio analyst Desmond Armstrong. The 1994 American coverage had many firsts: The first with all of the matches televised, the first with no commercial interruptions during live action, and the first to feature an on- screen score & time box. 1998 In 1998, all of the matches were televised in the United States live for the first time. Bob Ley and Seamus Malin was the lead broadcast team with other broadcast teams include: Roger Twibell and Mike Hill, JP Dellacamera and Bill McDermott, Derek Rae and Ty Keough, and Phil Schoen and Tommy Smyth.

Terry Gannon hosted in the studio alongside studio analysts Eric Wynalda and Giorgio Chinaglia. 2006 The 2006 coverage from Germany was fully live as well. Dave O'Brien joined Marcelo Balboa on the primary broadcast team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup coverage on ESPN and ABC Sports, despite having no experience calling soccer matches prior to that year. Because The Walt Disney Company, owner of both television outlets, retained control over on-air talent, the appointment of O'Brien as the main play-by-play voice was made over the objections of Soccer United Marketing, who wanted JP Dellacamera to continue in that role. Disney stated that their broadcast strategy was intended, in voice and style, to target the vast majority of Americans who do not follow the sport on a regular basis. Mispronunciation and incorrect addressing of names, misuse of soccer terminology, and lack of insight into tactics and history plagued the telecasts, resulting in heavy criticism from English- speaking soccer fans, many of whom ended up watching the games on Univision instead.

In 2015, Stevens' children filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against CBS over its use of the theme in the rebooted series. ==Alternate versions== ===The Ventures' version=== The Ventures' cover of the song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, peaking at no. 4 on May 9, 1969, and 11 weeks on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, rising to no. 8 on May 16. It was also the title track of their 1969 album Hawaii Five-O. In Canada, it peaked at no. 5 in the May 12, 1969, issue of RPM magazine. ===Other versions=== Although the theme is most widely known as an instrumental, it has been released with at least two similar but different sets of lyrics. The first, \\"You Can Come with Me\\" by Don Ho, opens with an instrumental in the familiar tempo, then settles into a ballad style for the sung portion.Don Ho version of theme song (lyrics only) The second, by Sammy Davis Jr., titled \\"You Can Count on Me (Theme from Hawaii Five-O)\\", maintains the driving style of the original instrumental throughout.Sammy Davis Jr. version of theme song (audio). ==In popular culture== The theme is popular with college and high school marching bands, especially at the University of Hawaii, where it has become the unofficial fight song. The tune has also been heard at Robertson Stadium after Houston Dynamo goals scored by Brian Ching, a native of Hawaii. Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of Northern soul and was popular on dance floors in the 1970s. Australian proto-punk band Radio Birdman borrowed heavily from the program and its theme for their 1977 single \\"Aloha, Steve & Danno\\", later included on selected versions of the album Radios Appear. Band leader Deniz Tek, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, during the heyday of MC5 and The Stooges, commented that he found Sydney of the early 1970s to be a rather quiet and staid place in comparison, and that airings of the program were a weekly highlight. The song was written after the band members realized they were spending a lot of evenings watching the program. The lyrics of the song's verses consist entirely of references to story lines of the early episodes. The chorus alludes to the boredom which band members experienced when the program was not on. The song's guitar solos and other musical elements were directly derivative of the program's theme; Stevens received a writing credit as a result. In the Australian movie The Dish, the theme was mistaken for the national anthem of the US by a local band upon the visit of the US Ambassador to Parkes, NSW, to commemorate the 1969 Moon landing. Bill Murray sang his own made-up lyrics to the song on one of his \\"Nick the Lounge Singer\\" skits on Saturday Night Live. On the 1997 Bill Nye the Science Guy episode \\"Volcanoes\\", the MIDI version of \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" was used during the \\"Pahoehoe Five-O\\" segments. The song was also featured in the film 50 First Dates (2004), and the Sammy Davis Jr. version of the theme song was re-recorded by Los Straitjackets with Deke Dickerson and released in 2014. Darts player Wayne Mardle used the song as his walk-on song in 2013. The Ventures version appears in a 2019 TV commercial for Papa John's Pizza. Philippine radio broadcaster Neil Ocampo is widely credited by both listeners and the media industry in popularizing the theme as it became the signature opening theme of his long- running national radio program that ran from 1996 until prior to his death in 2020. ==References== Category:1960s instrumentals Category:1968 songs Category:Hawaii Five-O Category:Television drama theme songs Category:The Ventures songs ","title":"Hawaii Five-O Theme"},{"id":"63873940","text":"Roger River is a rural locality in the local government area of Circular Head in the North West region of Tasmania.

This budget occurs during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand and on the same day that the country exits the lockdown brought about by alert level 3. == Background == The 2020 budget was released in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which spread to New Zealand in late February 2020. In response to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the country entered into a nationwide lockdown on the evening of 25 March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed. Because of the closure of businesses, the government offered a $12.1 billion wage subsidy scheme to offset employment costs in an attempt to keep as many New Zealanders as possible in their jobs. The original contents of the budget were set aside and replaced with a plan on how New Zealand will recover from the lasting effects of COVID-19, of which this budget is only the first step. Finance Minister Grant Robertson states that the economic recovery for New Zealand will create an extended operating deficit and increase debt to above previous targets, however he points out that New Zealand entered the COVID-19 crisis with a debt of below 20% of GDP compared to the United States with 90% and the United Kingdom with above 75%. The budget expands on the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme infrastructure project. == Major announcements == The 2020 budget includes allocating NZ$50 billion to the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which will be spent on several areas including a NZ$3.2 billion wage subsidy scheme, business support, trades training support, a NZ$1.1 billion environmental jobs package, $900 million to support MƒÅori, housing, and extending the school lunch programme.

In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U he had a number of strong performances but no major tournament victories and was ranked as the game's 22nd-best player of all time. After the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he established himself as one of the best players in the world. He has won one major Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament, Shine 2019, and was ranked as the second best Super Smash Bros. Ultimate player in the world in the Panda Global rankings for the second half of 2019. In both Smash games, he primarily utilizes Princess Peach. In Wii U, he used Rosalina and Luma and Zero Suit Samus as secondary characters. In Ultimate, he uses Princess Daisy and Zero Suit Samus as secondaries. ==Career== ===Super Smash Bros. for Wii U=== Samsora's first major Super Smash Bros. result came at a Clutch City Clash, a regional tournament held in August 2016, where he eliminated reigning Evo 2016 champion Elliot \\"Ally\\" Carroza-Oyarce from the tournament before losing to Yuta \\"Abadango\\" Kawamura in the grand finals. In the Panda Global Rankings, considered the most authoritative ranking of Smash for Wii U players, Samsora debuted at 29th in the edition covering the second half of 2016, owing in part to his results at Clutch City Clash as well as top 17 placings at two major tournaments. In January 2017 he took second in another minor tournament, Smash Conference LXIX, in what would wind up his highest placing in a tournament that year. While failing to secure a tournament win, Samsora placed highly in a number major Super Smash Bros. for Wii U tournaments in 2017, finishing tied for 5th at CEO Dreamland, tied for 33rd at Evo 2017, and tied for 9th at DreamHack Atlanta, among several other 7th and 9th-place results. He was ranked the 24th and 22nd best player in the Panda Global Rankings for the first and second half of 2017, respectively. 2018 was Samsora's most successful year in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U competition. He began the year taking third at the PAX Arena invitational at PAX South 2018. He would go on to make strong showings in several major tournaments; taking 7th at MomoCon 2018 and SwitchFest, 9th at Frostbite 2018, Get On My Level 2018, and 2GG: Hyrule Saga, and 17th at CEO 2018, all in the first half of the year. In addition, he won two minor tournaments, Saints Gaming Live 2018 and Denti's Bizarre Adventure 8. As a result of his strong performances, he jumped 10 places in the Panda Global Rankings, to 12th best in the world. In the second half of the year, Samsora took 7th at Low Tier City 6, 5th in DreamHack Atlanta 2018, and second in Super Smash Con 2018, where he lost to Leonardo \\"MkLeo\\" L√≥pez P√©rez. In December 2018, Panda Global released a ranking of the top 100 Smash for Wii U players from the game's release through the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which ranked Samsora 22nd. Throughout Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Samsora consistently used Princess Peach as his primary character. He occasionally used Rosalina and Luma, and more rarely Zero Suit Samus, as secondaries. ===Super Smash Bros. Ultimate=== Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was released in December 2018, and Samsora tied for 5th in one of its first tournaments, Let's Make Moves, held at the end of that month. Days later, multi-esport organization eUnited announced that they had signed Samsora as their first Ultimate player. Samsora competed in eight of the eleven major tournaments held in the first half of 2019, finishing 2nd Smash 'N' Splash 5, 3rd at Genesis 6, and rounding out the results with two 4th- place finishes, a 5th-place finish, two 9th-place finishes, and a 13th-place finish. He also won a minor tournament, Kawaii Kon 2019. In the inaugural Panda Global Rankings Ultimate, Samsora ranked 4th behind MkLeo, Gavin \\"Tweek\\" Dempsey, and Tyler \\"Marss\\" Martins. Samsora's results continued to improve going into the second half of the year. In July, he won the minor tournament Defend The North 2019. August was the most significant month of results in his career. At the beginning of the month he took 4th at Evo 2019, the largest offline tournament by number of participants in Smash Bros. franchise history. A week later he took 2nd at Super Smash Con 2019, defeating MkLeo in the winners' finals round before losing to him in the grand finals. At the end of the month, he won Shine 2019, again facing MkLeo in the grand finals and this time emerging victorious. Shine was his first premier-tier tournament win. Samsora took 2nd place at two other major tournaments in the months that followed, DreamHack Atlanta 2019 and Smash Ultimate Summit 2. The latter event was an invitational featuring many of the best players in the game and included a number of side-activities and competitions, including a talent show. For the show, Samsora cosplayed as Princess Peach, where he performed a runway walk and performed the character's in-game taunts. In the second bi- annual ranking for Smash Ultimate, Samsora rose to 2nd place. Aside from one tournament where he finished tied for 13th, he took tied for 7th or better at every event he attended over the second half of the year. In 2020, Samsora finished tied for 9th in one of the first tournaments of the year, Let's Make Big Moves, before winning the minor tournament Tampa Never Sleeps 8 later that month. At the end of January he took 3rd at Genesis 7, then tied for 13th at Frostbite 2020 the following month. Frostbite was the last major tournament held before Panda Global Rankings suspended the 2020 competitive season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While CEO Dreamland 2020 no longer counted towards the rankings, the event still took place, though with a significant number of player cancellations. Samsora won the event, then donated a portion of his prize money back to the tournament organizer, who had announced that the tournament was in dire financial straits due to the loss of revenue from the cancellations. Due to the pandemic, most of the subsequent tournaments scheduled for the first half of the year were cancelled or moved online. Ultimates online service suffers from noticeable input delay and lag, and many top players had poorer than normal performances in online tournaments. Samsora entered the Hungrybox-organized The Box tournament in May, but finished outside the top 50. As with Smash for Wii U, Samsora uses Princess Peach as his primary character. His secondary characters in Ultimate are Princess Daisy and Zero Suit Samus. In September 2020, someone claiming to be a friend of Samsora, as well as CaptainZack, the minor who had been involved in sexual misconduct allegations against fellow pro Smash player Nairo, alleged that Zack was the one who initiated the relationship via non-consensual first contact while Nairo was asleep and requested the payments to stay silent, and that Samsora had pushed Zack into revealing the situation publicly for personal gain, with the friend stating that even though Samsora knew about the situation, he continued to collaborate with Nairo on several occasions until the information was revealed publicly, and that \\"Zack had been in relationships with many adults, and Samsora ha[d] never cared\\" then. It was unclear from the message posted as to whether Nairo continued the relationship with Zack following their first encounter or not, and if he did, whether it was of his own free will or because of the information Zack had on him. Samsora denied the allegations against him. ==Personal life== Samsora was born in Louisiana.

Some dinoflagellates have further switched to dinoflagellate histone-like proteins (HLPs) for packaging.

The parish was founded to serve the needs of Italian Catholics in the area by the then-Bishop of Brooklyn, Charles McDonnell, in 1902. It was placed under the patronage of Saint Rosalia, the patron saint of Palermo, Italy, a region from which many of the Italian-born parishioners hailed. The founding pastor was P. Sapienza, who conducted the first Masses in a converted three-story clapboard house on 62nd Street near 13th Avenue. Within a few years, a small permanent church was constructed to serve the congregation. The parish came to be considered the \\"Mother Church of Italian immigrants\\" of the diocese. In 1923 Angelo Raffaelle Cioffi (born 1887), a native of Cervinara in the Italian Province of Avellino, who had emigrated to the United States in 1907 as a seminarian, was appointed pastor of the parish by Thomas Edmund Molloy, then Bishop of Brooklyn. He stayed in the parish until his death in 1979. In 1972, the parish obtained an organ built in 1928 by the Skinner Organ Company, which had originally served a Congregational church in Connecticut. ==Shrine Church of Regina Pacis== At a Sunday Mass in May 1942--during the course of World War II, Cioffi urged his congregation to build a shrine dedicated to Mary, under her title of Queen of Peace, for the safe return of the men of the parish and country from the battlefields of the war and for a just and lasting peace. The parishioners accepted the challenge and vowed to erect the church. A building fund was then established which included plans for the projected shrine, as well the construction of a new convent, and the enlargement of the parish school. The Shrine of Regina Pacis was completed and dedicated in August 1951. Within a week, a pair of gold crown created from the jewelry of the faithful to honor the image of the patroness of the shrine had been stolen. The theft made national headlines. Very shortly, the objects were returned through the mail, leading the pastor and others to declare it a miracle. ==Closure== With the passing of the years, the Italian population of the area came to be replaced by members of other ethnic groups, most noticeably Spanish and Chinese. By 2016 most of the services had moved to the shrine church, now a minor basilica, and the Diocese of Brooklyn had determined that the expenses of running the original church were not sustainable. The decision was made to close St. Rosalia Church permanently and to move its operations to the basilica. This was done in June of that year and many of the church furnishings were transferred to other churches. The marble altar of the church and its main image of St. Rosalia were moved to the basilica, along with its vestments and memorial plaques.. In March 2018, the current pastor, Ronald T. Marino, announced that the site was to be sold as an empty lot, leading to the assumption that the church was to be demolished. Residents of the neighborhood united to oppose the demolition of the church. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn Category:Roman Catholic churches in Brooklyn Category:Italian-American culture in New York City Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1905 Category:Catholic congregations established in the 20th century Category:Former Roman Catholic church buildings in New York City Category:1902 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"St. Rosalia Church (Brooklyn)"},{"id":"63874343","text":"Marie Rose Mureshyankwano (born 1968) is a Rwandan politician.

The existing building complex was originally built in 1905. Qingdao Observatory was once an important scientific research institute in Qingdao, and also played an important role in the development of modern meteorology and marine science in China. Together with Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory and Hong Kong Observatory, they once were known as the \\"Three Observatory in the Far East\\". Qingdao Observatory has been listed as \\"Meterology Observation Dome\\" amongst the \\"Top Ten Scenic Spots in Qingdao\\". Its building complex now belongs to the North Sea Fleet of the PLA (People‚Äôs Liberation Army) Navy and the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is part of the Qingdao German Building Complex, a national key cultural relics conservation site. ==History== ===Establishment and initial development of the observatory=== On July 23, 1896, the German navy Iltis gunboat was hit by the storm and sunk in the waters of the Yongluo Island in Rongcheng, Qingdao. The German navy believed that the lack of an accurate weather forecast was one of the reasons for this shipwreck. In 1898, German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen proposed in his book Shandong and its portal Jiaozhou Bay (German: Schantung und seine Eingangspforte Kiautschou) to repurpose the Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory of Qingdao into a scientific research centre with an observatory to observe marine weather. alt= On March 1, 1898, the German Navy Port Surveying Department set up a temporary organisation responsible for astronomical meteorological observations and land surveys in Qingdao. Their base of operations was officially named Metrology and Astronomy Observatory on June 14 of the same year. It‚Äôs currently located in office blocks surrounding the Public Security Bureau of Qingdao, and initially served only to observe temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind force, etc. The institute conducts meteorological observations 3 times per day and reports daily weather maps and forecasts (including storm warnings). In 1904, Qingdao Observatory extended its operations to astronomy and timekeeping functions. On May 10, 1905, the observatory moved to Guanshan Mountain. In 1909, the observatory‚Äôs operations extended further to include topographic surveys and geomagnetic, seismic, tide and sunspot observations. Observatory and the Dushu hospital at the foot of the mountain On January 1, 1911, the observatory was officially renamed the Royal Observatory of Qingdao. On January 9, 1912, the observatory building was completed. The Qingdao New Newspaper and the Shanghai German Newspaper subsequently reported the inauguration ceremony of the Observatory. At the end of Germany‚Äôs lease for Qingdao territory in 1914, the scientific scope of the observatory has already encompassed astronomy, meteorology, earthquakes, geomagnetism, tide observations, timekeeping, topographic surveys, and sea surveys. There were more than ten observatories in Jinan and the Weixian County along the Jiaoji Railway as well. ===Japanese occupation period and its once unsolved case=== The Recording of the Observatory in Taking Over Qingdao Memorial Photo After the Japanese army occupied Qingdao in November 1914, the Qingdao Observatory was taken over by the Japanese Navy's temporary Qingdao Port Division and renamed the Qingdao Observatory. In December 1922, the Chinese government took back Qingdao's sovereignty. According to an annex to the \\"Shangdong Cases Detailed Agreement\\" signed by the Chinese and Japanese parties on December 1, Japanese personnel would be granted temporary stay after the handover of the meteorological observatory, including Chinese meteorologists Jiang Bingran, Zhu Kezhen, and astronomer Gao Pingzi, but Japan touted the content of the agreement and refused the handover. Claiming that China had no meteorologists, they proposed a partial handover until China had professional personnel. Jiang Bingran along with others held the handover ceremony, however the Japanese still retained significant control over the meteorology observatory. Regarding the taking back of the meteorological station, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Jiaoao Commercial Port Supervisor Office have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Minister in China and the Japanese Consul General in Qingdao. After China officially took over the observatory, Japanese personnel still refused to withdraw and continued to use the observatory instruments for observation, sending data back to Japan. In October 1924, the former director of the Qingdao Observatory Iruma Takeshi stated in \\"the Opinion\\" that \\"China already has talents for astronomical and meteorological observation who are able to shoulder responsibility. I hope that the Chinese government can finalise the pending case so that Japanese personnel can return to their country as soon as possible\\". However, the Japanese government repeatedly evaded responsibility, resulting in the pending case remaining unresolved. Japanese personnel did not leave the observatory until the end of 1937 when Japanese nationals evacuated from Qingdao. ===Development during the Republic of China period=== On October 10, 1924, Jiang Bingran, Zhu Kezhen, Gao Lu, and others initiated the establishment of the Chinese Meteorological Society at the Qingdao Observatory, with the purpose of pursuing \\"progress in meteorological science and development of weather forecasting\\". In 1925, the observatory built a small domed equatorial chamber on the west side of the observation field and fitted a 16-cm refracting telescope left over from the Germans to observe sunspots; this accumulated China's first batch of sunspot observation data. \\"Longitude Measurement Monument\\", established in 1987 to commemorate the observatory's participation in the Longitude Survey of the World In May 1926, Gustav Felier, Chairman of the International Longitude Survey Committee, sent a letter inviting the Qingdao Observatory to participate in the first International Longitude Survey (also known as the Longitude Survey of the World). The Ministry of Education therefore appointed the Qingdao Observatory as the sole representative of Chinese research institutes in the scientific community to participate in the event. Director of the observatory, Jiang Bingran, inspected various observatories in Shanghai and Hong Kong in the summer of that year. He believed that the Qingdao Observatory lacked new measuring instruments so he applied for 5,000 rmb in funding from the General Office of Jiaoao Commercial Port Bureau to purchase new instruments. Original Doom Room of Qingdao Observatory , 2016 On August 12, 1930, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held the 15th Annual Conference at the Qingdao National University, during which Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Li Shizeng, Zhu Kezhen, Jiang Bingran, Song Chunyi and others jointly proposed first the construction of the Qingdao Aquarium, and then the establishment of the China Ocean Research Institute. It was later agreed to be designed by the Observatory's Marine Office and located at Waterfront Park on Laiyang Road. The Qingdao Aquarium was the largest and most advanced marine science exhibition hall in China at the time. In March 1932, the observatory began to implement high-altitude observations once a day as reference for weather forecasts. Later, upon the request of China Airlines, the observatory provided daily high-altitude observation data to airlines. (According to some, the pilot-balloon observation began from March 1932, once every two days, and then the pilot balloon was provided by China Airlines, and the observation changed to a daily frequency). Original Qingdao Coastal Biology Research Institute In April 1935, the China Branch of the Oceanographic Group of the Pacific Scientific Association was established in Nanjing. They planned to set up marine biology research institutes in Xiamen, Dinghai, Qingdao, and Yantai of which Qingdao Coastal Biology Research Institute was co-chaired by Qingdao Observatory and Shandong National University. However, due to the July 7th Incident and the overall outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Institute's work did not begin. ===Decline and recovery during and after the Sino-Japanese War=== Observatory during the second Japanese occupation After the July 7th Incident of 1937, Qingdao Observatory personnel evacuated from Qingdao in September. On January 10, 1938, the Japanese navy occupied Qingdao and the observatory was taken over by the Japanese navy. According to Wang Huawen (self-titled as binhua), the first director of the Observatory following the Sino-Japanese War, he interned at the Observatory in his early days during Jiang Bingran‚Äôs time as director of the Observatory. When taking over it after the Sino-Japanese War, he found that the Observatory was devastated, and many instruments had been destroyed by the Japanese military police. After Japan surrendered in August 1945, the Chinese Navy Rear Admiral and the North China Naval Reception Commissioner She Zhenxing began to take charge of the Observatory. In December, the Navy transferred it to the Qingdao Municipal Government and resumed its original name: the Qingdao Observatory. From 1946, Wang Huawen served as the director of the observatory and began to organise the restoration of the observatory. ===Since 1949=== The top of Guanxiang Mountain in the 1950s On June 2, 1949, the People's Liberation Army gained entry and stationed themselves in Qingdao, which was shortly followed by the Qingdao Military Control Commission taking over the observatory. In May 1958, Qingdao Observatory's geomagnetic and seismic related personnel and instruments were transferred to the Chinese Academy of Sciences‚Äô Geophysics Institute in Beijing. The astronomy section was reconstructed and renamed the Qingdao Observatory, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences‚Äô Purple Mountain Observatory, and astronomical observations continued relying on the dome room and other facilities in the observatory. View from Guanxiang Hill and Observation Deck from Signal Hill, 2015 Qingdao Observatory's main functions include astronomical observation and science popularisation through events and activities. It is open to the public from time to time. When special astronomical phenomena occur, it may also be open to the public for observation. Qingdao Observatory organises astronomical stargaze, astronomical summer camps and other events as well. In 2012, the observatory was recognised as a national science education centre by the China Association for Science and Technology. The initial part of the observatory dome room which was built in 1931 is still used by the observatory. The expanded part which was built in 1996 is now used by a youth hostel. The Observatory office building built during the period of German Leased Territory is now the residence of the Marine Hydrological and Meteorological Centre of the Navy‚Äôs North Sea Fleet. ==Architectural characteristics and protection status of cultural relics== Stele of German poetry in the observatory, shot during the second Japanese occupation period The office building is located on the top of the east side of the observatory. The platform of the building is 77.76 metres above sea level. The 21.6-metre-high building has a 3-floor main body and 7-floor tower. The outer walls are all made of granite stone and the roof slopes with beef- tongue-like tiles. The parapet wall at the top of the tower is constructed into a castellated shape. The entire building is shaped like a medieval European castle. According to German naval literature, the Observatory building is designed with the following: offices, laboratories, libraries, public reading rooms, a temperature-controlled basement with clocks, temperature coefficient-measuring rooms equipped with a dual heating system, metalwork workshops and other auxiliary rooms. The ground floor of the building lays a fuchsia glazed tile floor connected by stone steps. There is still a white marble stone monuments intact on the corridor wall, engraved with a German poem by German poet Ernst von Wildenbruch.Ernst von Wildenbruch}} { !The poem !English translation - valign=\\"top\\"  :Deutsche fern vom Heimatland :haben hier am fremden Strand :diesen Bau geschichtet; :Schiffen soll er in der Not :k√ºnden, wenn das Wetter droht, :wenn der Sturm sich schlichtet. :So als Helfer aufgestellt, :sei der Gru√ü er, den der Welt :deutsches Volk entrichtet.  :Germans far from home have here on the foreign beach layered this building It forecasts ship in an emergency announces when the weather threatens When the storm is settling it positioned as a helper :and the greeting for the world :that German people sent } In 2000, the Observatory site was listed amongst the first batch of historically outstanding buildings in Qingdao.

The plant was variously known as the Lancaster Cork Works and the Lancaster Closure Plant. ==History== The property was operated as a cork factory dating to 1865 and was acquired in the late 19th century by Armstrong Cork Co., later renamed Armstrong World Industries. In 1929, Armstrong consolidated its cork operations at the site, making Lancaster \\"the 'cork capital' of the world\\". At that time, the \\"Cork Works\\" on New Holland Avenue manufactured a wide array of cork products, including soles and heels for shoes and cork-lined metal tops for soft drink bottles. The company's linoleum manufacturing business developed using byproducts from cork manufacturing. The plant was later used for closure and plastic container manufacturing and became known as the Lancaster Closure Plant. In 1969, Armstrong sold its packaging business, including the Lancaster Closure Plant, to Kerr Glass Manufacturing Corp. Kerr manufactured plastic bottles at the plant but ceased operations there in 2000. ==Redevelopment== In 2004, Barry Baldwin acquired the property for $1.2 million with plans to redevelop the site into \\"Urban Place\\", a mixed use complex of retail, restaurants, offices, apartments, and a hotel. The hotel opened in 2010.

At the age of 14 she sang for the first time at the Oper Frankfurt. At the age of 19 she received a two-year contract there in 1914 and made her debut in Das Nachtlager von Granada by Conradin Kreutzer. In 1916 she moved to Schwerin before she went to Berlin in 1920. There she was engaged at the Berlin State Opera from 1920 to 1924, and afterwards at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. The singer expanded her repertoire in all directions, singing famous roles as both a lyrical and lyrical-dramatic soprano. Guest performances with Bronsgeest's touring opera made her famous in Holland, Spain and all over Germany. But already in 1928 an illness put an end to her opera career. After that she only appeared in concerts (until 1934) and sang for recordings.Karl-Josef Kutsch, Leo Riemens: Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon. Electronic version of the third, extended edition. Directmedia, Berlin 2004. This, however, with an extraordinarily large response. She belonged to the most successful stars of the 1930s and left more than 300 recordings. Bettendorf married in 1931 and lived in Austria ever since. After the death of her husband in 1938, she was in such a bad financial situation that she had to give concerts again. So it came to the , in the context of which she gave concerts in Poland, Russia, Greece and Albania in front of German soldiers.

Depending on the agreement with the cities and municipalities, it may also be possible to use a 'yellow bin' (). Yellow bags or yellow bins are part of the Dual System in the German waste management industry. The waste collected in the yellow sack is mainly sorted mechanically in special sorting plants. In the first few years after the introduction of the Yellow Bag in 1991, the majority of waste still had to be sorted by hand, as the necessary techniques and machines were not available. In the 1990s, the corresponding technologies were developed and are now standard practice. In some other European countries there are yellow dustbin containers for the disposal of light packaging. It is not necessary to pack the separated waste in a special waste bag before disposal. The dimensions of a (folded) yellow bag are 90 cm √ó 62 cm. == Origin == The sacks are produced by billions \\"in Far East\\" and delivered to the local authorities via wholesalers and waste disposal companies, who in turn distribute them free of charge to households and, in addition, keep them available for take-away in town halls and recycling centres. == Pick up and transport == The collection of the sacks filled with waste is carried out by companies commissioned by the Dual System, either by waste collection or private specialist disposal companys, with certain streets in a city being served on certain days of the week. If no waste information exists, the responsible city administration will usually tell you when the collection is to take place. In some districts (e.g. District Pfaffenhofen, District Ravensburg), however, the yellow bags must be transported by the citizens themselves at their own expense to central collection points which are only open on certain days; in the district of Pfaffenhofen, a citizens' survey was conducted on this in 2014. Via disposal logistics, the yellow bags are transported to the waste sorting plant, which carries out the sorting. The legal basis is provided by the Packaging Ordinance. (\\"VerpackV\\"). The empty yellow bag is not recycled, but can be used as a substitute fuel e.g. in cement works. If it is too dirty, it is sent as the rest to the waste incineration plant. == Contents == The following rules must be observed for the contents of the yellow bag or the yellow bin: Only packaging made of plastic, metal or composite materials belong in the yellow bag (or directly in the yellow bin), (examples): * Packaging made of plastic * Bubble wrap * Aluminum cans and PET bottles that are deposit free * Detergent bottles, yoghurt pots, plastic tubes, toothpaste tubes, packaging for oral hygiene, hair and body care products * cartons of milk, water, juice and wine (e.g. Tetra Pak) - cartons made of composite materials (such as beverage cartons of milk, juice or wine) belong in the yellow bag, since the paper part of this composite material can be used, for example, to make tissue paper and handkerchiefs * Plastic bags, ice cream packagings * Packaging made of composite materialsn * Vacuum packaging for coffee, polystyrene packaging etc. * Packaging made of metal, aluminium foil, beverage and tin cans, crown caps, metal closures, lids, blister packs for medicines etc. To note: * in Austria, these metallic materials are collected separately in some municipalities * in some municipalities in Bavaria tins and other metal waste are still collected separately via depot containers * certain items such as CDs or DVDs and batteries do not belong in the yellow bag, only the empty plastic sleeves are allowed * Glass belongs in the bottle bank, - the separate glass waste collection existed before the introduction of the Packaging Ordinance * Packaging made of cardboard or paper is waste paper and should not be disposed of in the yellow bag. == Recycling rate == According to an answer to a parliamentary question by B√§rbel H√∂hn, the recycling rate for tinplate in Germany in 2009 was 92 percent, for aluminium 60 percent and for plastics 43 percent. In 2012, according to the Gesellschaft f√ºr Verpackungsmarktforschung (GVM), the material recycling rate was 93.1 percent for tinplate, 71 percent for beverage packaging and 48.2 percent for plastics. On behalf of the Federal Environment Agency, GVM determined in a study published in 2015 that the packaging waste occurrence in private households in 2013 was 8.06 million tonnes. In Germany, less than half of the packaging from the yellow sack (and the yellow bin) is recycled. In 2014, on the other hand, 44.1 percent was disposed of in waste incineration plants. According to a calculation by the √ñko-Institute, 51,1 % was used as substitute fuel in cement works, 40 % as input for material recycling, 6 % as input for waste incineration plants and 2,8 % as input for raw material recycling in blast furnaces. https://www.gruener-punkt.de/fileadmin/layout/redaktion/Nachhaltigkeit/Studie- Oeko-Institut/16-09-21_OEko-Institut_Abschlussbericht_LCA-DSD.PDF == Future == The yellow bag could disappear in the long term, say scientists for waste management such as Klaus Wiemer (Kassel) and Horst Fehrenbach at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (Heidelberg): As the willingness of Germans to separate their waste is declining, expensive sorting machines could soon make sense. This is especially true if rising energy prices lead to competition for waste recycling. So far, however, new, expensive sorting machines are not economical. == References == == External links == * Federal Association of the German Waste, Water and Raw Materials Management Industry. * Altstoff Entsorgung Austria, organizes the collection in Austria Category:Waste management in Germany Category:Waste collection ","title":"Yellow sack"},{"id":"63874834","text":"Joaquin Orth (born 28 April 1955) is a Mexican equestrian.

It is the country's only higher educational institution for health sciences. As of 2019, the rector of the university is Prof. Dr. Cevdet Erd√∂l. ==History== The University of Health Sciences (SB√ú) was established as a state university on 27 March 2015. The Haydarpa≈üa Campus of the Marmara University at Haydarpa≈üa neighborhood of Kadƒ±k√∂y in Istanbul was allocated to the SB√ú on 15 April 2015. The Haydarpa≈üa Campus of the university was named \\"Mekteb-i Tƒ±bbiyye-i ≈ûahane K√ºlliyesi\\" (\\"Imperial School of Medicine Campus\\") to honor the original name of the building. In August 2016, \\"G√ºlhane Askeri Tƒ±p Akademisi\\" (\\"G√ºlhane Military Medical Academy\\") in Etlik, Ankara was incorporated into the University of Health Sciences by lifting its military status. The university began its education in the 2016‚Äì17 academic year with 82 students in medicine. ===Hamidiye Campus, Istanbul=== The construction of the Haydarpa≈üa Campus building was ordered by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876‚Äì1909) in 1894. The building was designed by the architects French-Ottoman Alexander Vallaury (1850‚Äì1921) and Italian Raimondo D'Aronco (1857‚Äì1932). The rectangular-plan building covers with an inner courtyard land. The opening of the School of Medicine, named (literally: \\"Imperial School of Medicine\\"), took place by the sultan on his birthday on 6 November 1903. While the building hosted the Military Medicine School until 1909, it later served for a civilian Medicine School. It had a botanic garden with medicinal plants. It featured faculties of medicine and pharmacy. The school had an underground tunnel connection to the military hospital across it. In 1933, with the reorganization of the higher education in Turkey after the Atat√ºrk's Reforms, the Medicine School was closed. The building was allocated to the Haydarpa≈üa High School. From 1983 on, the building was used by the Marmara University as a campus including also a Faculty of Medicine. All faculties, colleges and institutes situated at the Haydarpa≈üa Campus were prefixed \\"Hamidiye\\" by a presidential decree in June 2019 after Abdul Hamid II, the founder of the initial medical school. ===G√ºlhane Campus, Ankara=== In 1897, a protocol was signed with the German Empire to improve the medicine education in the Ottoman Empire. Prof. Robert Rieder of University of Bonn and Dr. Georg Deycke of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf came to Istanbul in 1898. In addition to their works at the Imperial School of Medicine, they converted the building of the military junior high school inside G√ºlhane (literally: Rose Garden), the courtyard of Ottoman sultan's Topkapƒ± Palace, into a modern healthcare facility. It was opened on 30 December 1898 and named \\"G√ºlhane Seririyat Hastanesi\\" (\\"G√ºlhane Clinic Hospital\\"). G√ºlhane Hospital's first active presence took place in 1909 when its physicians, who were transferred to the newly established Faculty of Medicine, made out the majority of the academic staff. During World War I, the hospital undertook important duties in the successful delivery of health services to the Ottoman Army, and in the treatment of wounded soldiers brought from the Battle of Gallipoli (1915‚Äì1916). During the occupation of Istanbul from 1918 to 1923, G√ºlhane Hospital was transferred to G√ºm√º≈üsuyu quarter of Beyoƒülu, Istanbul, and continued to serve during the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1922). Following the end of the occupation of Istanbul, the hospital returned to its previous location. With the beginning of World War II, it was decided to move the hospital to Ankara. In 1941, it started as \\"G√ºlhane Askeri Tababet Okulu ve Hastanesi\\" (\\"Gulhane Military Medical School and Hospital\\") in the buildings of the military hospital at Cebeci quarter of √áankata district of Ankara. Iy played an important role in the establishment of Ankara University Medical School in 1945. Eleven of the fourteen professors and founding staff members originated from the Gulhane Military Medical School and Hospital. In 1947, it was renamed to \\"G√ºlhane Askeri Tƒ±p Akademisi\\" (GATA) (\\"G√ºlhane Military Medical Academy\\"), and collaborated with the Ankara University's Medical School until 1952. In 1952, the Academy moved from Cebeci to Bah√ßelievler, Ankara leaving its buildings to the university's Medical School. As the buildings became insufficient, it was decided in 1963 to build a modern hospital complex in Etlik neighborhood of Ke√ßi√∂ren, Ankara. In 1971, the Academy moved into its new location. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt on 15 July, all of the 32 military hospitals, including the GATA, were transferred from the Ministry of National Defense to the Ministry of Health in August the same year. The GATA was renamed \\"G√ºlhane Eƒüitim ve Ara≈ütƒ±rma Hastanesi\\" (\\"G√ºlhane Education and Research Hospital\\"), and was incorporated into the SB√ú by a presidential decree. ==Academics== ===Hamidiye Campus=== The academic units situated at the Hamidiye Campus in Haydarpa≈üa, Istanbul are: * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Dentistry * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Nursing * Faculty of Health Sciences * Faculty of International Medicine * Faculty of Life Sciences * Institute of Health Sciences * Institute of Sports Health and Sports Science. ===G√ºlhane Campus=== Following academic units serve at the G√ºlhane Campus in Etlik, Ankara: * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Dentistry * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Nursing * Faculty of Health Sciences. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Turkey Health Sciences Health Sciences Category:Universities established in the 2010s Category:Universities and colleges in Istanbul Category:Education in Istanbul Category:Kadƒ±k√∂y Category:Universities and colleges in Ankara Category:Education in Ankara Category:Ke√ßi√∂ren ","title":"University of Health Sciences (Turkey)"},{"id":"63875027","text":"The Baynes Mountains are a mountain range in Namibia. ==Description== The Baynes Mountains form an escarpment plateau in Kunene Region in northwest Namibia, near the border with Angola (formed here by the Kunene River).

The flowers are clustered, with a corolla of blue to purple petals. The fruits feature oblong pods measuring up to long, each with two to six seeds. The species is considered most similar to Abrus schimperi. ==Distribution and habitat== Abrus kaokoensis is only known from three locations in Namibia, all in Epupa Constituency near the Angola border. Therefore, the species may also occur in Angola, but areas neighbouring the Namibia border are little documented botanically. The type specimen was from the Kunene River valley. The species' habitat is on stony soil or in rocks, at altitudes of . ==Conservation== Despite its presence in a limited number of locations, Abrus kaokoensis is not considered threatened. Two of the species' populations coincide with livestock farming, but those populations appear healthy. The other population, in the Baynes Mountains, is in an unpopulated area. A natural threat to Abrus kaokoensis comes from blister beetles, who consume the plant's flowers. As a result, few flowers in the studied area went on to produce pods and seeds. ==References== Category:Faboideae Category:Flora of Namibia Category:Plants described in 2011 ","title":"Abrus kaokoensis"},{"id":"63875186","text":"Kawasaki station may refer to: *Kawasaki-juku (), a T≈çkaid≈ç waystation in Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan *Kawasaki Station (, a train station of JR East line in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan *Shin-Kawasaki Station (), Saiwai, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; a train station *Kawasaki-Daishi Station (), Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan; a train station on the Keikyu Line *Keiky≈´ Kawasaki Station (, a train station on the Keikyuu Line in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan *Hama-Kawasaki Station (), a train station of JR East line in Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan *Kawasakishimmachi Station (), a train station on the Nambu Branch Line in Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan *Kawasaki-Gashi Freight Terminal (), Sawai, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; a freight rail line station of the JNR *Buzen-Kawasaki Station (), a train station on the Hitahikosan Line of JR Kyuushu, in Kawasaki, Fukuoka, Japan ","title":"Kawasaki station"},{"id":"63875206","text":"Clark Boyd (born June 14, 1978) is a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing District 46 since January 11, 2018. == Background and education == Boyd was born June 14, 1978 in his hometown of Lebanon, Tennessee.

The concept explains why dieting fails in most cases and results in a Yo-yo effect. A central element of the Summermatter cycle is that reductions in energy intake, occurring with dieting or starvation, initially successfully induce weight and adipose tissue loss. At the same time, the reduced food availability prompts ambulatory activity, which further accelerates body and fat mass loss and depletes ATP, glycogen and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) in skeletal muscle. The scarcity of energy ultimately suppresses thermogenesis in skeletal muscle to conserve energy. As soon as energy becomes available again, this originally adaptive, thrifty program supports the replenishment of energy stores and weight regain. Fat deposition is the most efficient way for the body to store energy. This phenomenon of energy store replenishment is driven by a hyperinsulinemic state and is referred to as preferential catch-up fat. Satiety signals during the period of food availability automatically lead to rest, which further supports adipose tissue regain and the restoration of glycogen and IMCL pools in muscle. As a result, people rapidy regain body weight. Exercise increases energy expenditure and can counteract the suppressed thermogenesis in skeletal muscle thereby preventing weight regain. In addition, regular exercise promotes the turnover of ATP, glycogen and IMCLs The hypothesis was put forward in 2012 and Benton et al named the cycle in 2017 after his inventor, the Swiss biochemist, nutritionist and exercise physiologist Dr. Serge Summermatter The concept of the Summermatter cycle finds broad application in body weight management to time exercise interventions and avoid catch-up fat (yo-yo effect). Moreover, the concept is used by elite athletes to optimally time their exercise and energy intake. == References == Category:Human physiology ","title":"Summermatter cycle"},{"id":"63875253","text":"My Dear Son is a 1989 Hong Kong action drama film directed by David Chiang and starring Jacky Cheung, Bill Tung, Maggie Cheung and Sean Lau. ==Plot== Ho Ka- chai (Bill Tung) makes living by singing sex songs at a public square in Yung Shue Tau.

In 1699 he joined the crew of the ship-of-the-line Nellebladet and was promoted to junior lieutenant. In 1700 he was on board the frigate Blaaheyren.Tops√∏e-Jensen Vol 1 pp 124‚Äì128 In 1702‚Äì1703 he served in the Dutch navy and in 1705‚Äì1706 was recruiting officer for West Jutland. With further promotion in 1707 he was given the responsibility of moving and improving the lighthouse on the island of Anholt. In 1708 Bille was again in the service of the Royal Dutch Navy for a short while. On his journey to Holland his vessel had been ‚Äúvisited‚Äù by pirates who took whatsoever they wanted.Caveat: The reference Project Runeberg has Bille serving in the British navy, with no mention of Holland!Tops√∏e Jensen is more detailed. On return, after serving on the 50-gun Stiernen, Bille became captain of the frigate √òrnenSkibregister - Record card for HDMS √òrnen in the Baltic on whose cruise he reported in September 1709. Operating near the island of Bornholm he took several prizes in the Great Northern War with Sweden. Promoted again in March 1710, he commanded the ship-of-the-line Oldenborg in the fleet of Gyldenl√∏ve. 1711 found him back as recruitment officer in West Jutland, then as second in command of the ship-of-the-line Fridericus Quartus until the middle of August when the ship was severely damaged by a fire that claimed the lives of three men. In 1712 in command of the ship-of-the-line DelmenhorstRoyal Danish Navy website - Delmenhorst, he served in Gyldenl√∏ve‚Äôs fleet, and later under Admiral Raben at the action of 30 September near R√ºgen.One of several naval engagements between the Danes and the Swedes that year in the tussle for Stralsund. More details in German Wikipedia at :de:Seeschlacht vor R√ºgen (1712) and in Norwegian Wikipedia at :no:R√ºgen-aff√¶ren During the battle one of his ship‚Äôs cannons exploded killing and wounding some of his crew (an event which was to recur on the same ship a few years later). Convoy duties with Delmenhorst in 1713 were followed by a land appointment in 1714 as head of recruitment in East Jutland..br> In 1715, once more on Delmenhorst, he again fought the Swedish fleet, this time at the Battle of Fehmarn (1715), after which battle he was promoted to commodore and awarded a gold medal. Later in the summer of that year (on 8 August 1715 off Jasmund on R√ºgen) he was again in action during the Battle of R√ºgen (1715), engaging three Swedish ships in quick succession, until he had used all the ship‚Äôs gunpowder. It was in this action that another of Delmenhorst‚Äôs cannons exploded, killing one crew member and injuring three. Transferred to command the ship-of-the-line HavfruenSkibregister - Record card for HDMS Havfruen (the mermaid) in the Baltic fleet Bille was then ordered, in January 1716, to take charge of the sea batteries off Copenhagen. ==Flag rank== On Christmas Eve 1717, Bille was promoted to Rear Admiral and appointed Deputy in the Danish admiralty. In 1718 in the ship-of-the-line Wenden he commanded a squadron under admiral Raben, and from July an independent squadron operating in the Baltic. 1720 saw Bille with orders to go to Pomerania (esp. Stralsund) his main task was to remove the timber and other materials for shipbuilding, and to prepare transport for repatriation of the Danish troops as the enemy (Swedes) approached. He sought advice on how he would pay for thisR√ºgen and Stralsund were occupied and administered by the Danes from early 1716, but returned to Sweden by the treaty of Frederiksborg of July 1720. See Swedish Pomerania In 1721 Bille was sent with the Snow Hummeren (the lobster) to Danzig and Riga to buy and load a cargo of hemp for the fleet. In consideration of the many extra expenses he incurred on this voyage in the monarch‚Äôs interest, he was awarded a special daily allowance plus the services of a personal secretary and a servant. 1723 Bille flew his flag in Nordstiernen with a squadron of seven ships-of-the-line and a number of lesser ships. 1725 Bille complained to the king about ‚Äúthe secret commission‚Äù - a whispering campaign against him in the royal court. Such complaints of dishonourable conduct were dismissed as unfounded. In the same year he commanded a squadron of ten ships-of-the-line until it was recalled and the ships laid up on the grounds that the danger of war was past. The following year he sailed with eight ships-of-the-line and four frigates, again flying his flag in Nordstiernen, under sealed orders. Many of the fleet were in poor condition, dilapidated and leaky. Together with a similar sized British squadron they instituted a blockade of the Russian fleet in Reval (modern day Tallinn). One of his ships, HDMS Ebenetzer sprang a leak and was sent home with the frigate S√∏ridderen, whilst his former command HDMS Beskiermeren ran aground at the approaches to Reval and was rescued only by the timely attention of the English admiral. The blockade of Reval began on 7 July 1726 until the approach of winter demanded withdrawal. October storms ravaged the fleet and separated many of the ships from each other. When they reached Danzig for repairs before sailing on to Copenhagen there was much sickness aboard (scurvy and pneumonias). The investigations by the Danish Admiralty into all the accidents and poor management of the 1726 campaign were to reverberate for the next three years. From 1729, for six years, he was head of the naval shipyard at Holmen. It was after this period that the head of the Danish navy, Count F Danneskjold-Sams√∏e instituted the court martial process against fabrikmester Knud Benstrup in relation to the building of HDMS Christianus Sixtus (1733), during which Michael Bille was found to have been negligent in the performance of his duties and lost the confidence of the Danish King, Christian VI. In consideration of Bille‚Äôs previous good service, court martial proceedings were not called for against him, but the monarch took a strong interest in the case and, in 1737, had Bille retired from the service with the rank and pension of ViceAdmiral. ==Retirement== Bille retired quietly to Holb√¶k where he died on 2 May 1756. His body was transferred to the chapel of the naval Church of Holmen on 29 May that year. ==Notes== ==References== ==Citations== *Project Runeberg : C F Bricka on Mikkel Bille in Danish Biographical Dictionary *Royal Danish Naval Museum website - Danish ships *Royal Danish Naval Museum - Menu - Skibregister for record cards where these exist. *T.

He serves as the rabbi of the city of Dresden, Germany and the Liberal Jewish community \\"Migwan\\" in Basel, Switzerland. He is the founder of the Haichal Besht synagogue in Bnei Brak, Haichal Besht synagogue in Berlin and the Besht Yeshiva in Dresden. == Early life and education == Weingarten grew up in the Hasidic Satmar community in New York. The eldest of eleven siblings, his mother tongue is Yiddish. His family on his father's side emigrated from post-World War II Hungary, and his maternal ancestors came from Lithuania. He was a critical thinker from an early age and asked questions in the Yeshivot, which was met with rejection in the ultra-Orthodox community. He received his first rabbinic ordination at the age of 17. The following year he went to Israel to continue his studies and lived in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak for ten years. At the age of 19 he was engaged and married at 20. Two years later he was already the father of two children. In Israel he was ordained a rabbi two more times. In 2014 Weingarten left Israel and the ultra-Orthodox community and went to Germany. He studied \\"Jewish Studies\\" at the University of Potsdam until he was appointed rabbi to Dresden and Basel in 2019. == Career == Akiva Weingarten has been rabbi of the \\"Migwan\\" Liberal community in Basel and the city of Dresden since August 2019. There he took over the office of his predecessor Alexander Nachama. Today Weingarten supports Jews who have left the ultra- Orthodox communities to get integrated in a life outside of the strictly religious environment. In 2017 he founded the liberal Hasidic community \\"Besht-Berlin\\", where Kabbalat Shabbat services, Kiddush and joint study groups were held regularly. == Philosophy == Weingarten is unique as a Liberal rabbi who wears Hasidic clothing such as the shtreimel and kaftan on Shabbat. In his sermons, he often uses Hasidic stories and explanations about the Torah, along with a liberal and up-to-date interpretation. He describes his approach to Judaism as liberal Hasidic. == References == == External links == * Akiva Weingarten, personal website * Migwan Basel, Liberal Jewish community of Basel, Switzerland * Shalom Dresden, Jewish community of Dresden, Germany * Facebook, personal Facebook page * Youtube, personal Youtube page Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Satmar Hasidim Category:People from New York City Category:People from Bnei Brak Category:American emigrants to Germany Category:German rabbis Category:1984 births Category:Living people ","title":"Akiva Weingarten"},{"id":"63875389","text":"The Lungi Panchi Dance is the dancing style among the Santal people of West Bengal..

The phrase may originate from a 1927 poem by Yitzhak Lamdan which stated \\"Never again shall Masada fall!\\" In the context of genocide, the slogan was used by liberated prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp to express anti-fascist sentiment. The exact meaning of the phrase is debated, including whether it should be used as a particularistic command to avert a second Holocaust of Jews or whether it is a universalist injunction to prevent all forms of genocide. It was adopted as a slogan by Meir Kahane's Jewish Defense League and used to justify acts of terrorism against perceived enemies of Jews. The phrase is widely used by politicians and writers and it also appears on many Holocaust memorials. However, some commentators have noted that the phrase is empty or overused and does not reflect the reality of multiple genocides which have occurred since the Holocaust. It has also been appropriated as a political slogan for other causes, from commemoration of the 1976 Argentine coup, the promotion of gun control or abortion rights, and as an injunction to fight against terrorism after the September 11 attacks. ==Origins== During the liberation of Buchenwald, a sign states \\"Form the Antinazifront! Remember the Millions of victims Murdered by the Nazis / DEATH TO THE NAZI CRIMINALS\\" Memorial to Radogoszcz prison in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ states \\"Nigdy wiƒôcej faszyzmu\\" (Never again fascism) The slogan \\"Never again shall Masada fall!\\" is derived from a 1927 epic poem, Masada, by Yitzhak Lamdan. The poem is about the siege of Masada, in which a group of Jewish rebels (the Sicarii) held out against Roman armies and, according to legend, committed mass suicide rather than be captured. In Zionism, the story of Masada became a national myth and was lauded as an example of Jewish heroism. Considered one of the most significant examples of early Yishuv literature, Masada achieved massive popularity among Zionists in the land of Israel and in the Jewish diaspora. Masada became a part of the official Hebrew curriculum and the slogan became an unofficial national motto. In postwar Israel, the behavior of Jews during the Holocaust was unfavorably contrasted with the behavior of the defenders of Masada: the former were denigrated for having gone \\"like sheep to the slaughter\\" while the latter were praised for their heroic and resolute fight. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its allies murdered about six million Jews, during World War II in Europe, in a genocide which became known as the Holocaust. The first use of the phrase \\"never again\\" in the context of the Holocaust was in April 1945 when newly liberated survivors at Buchenwald concentration camp displayed it in various languages on handmade signs. Cultural studies scholars Diana I. Popescu and Tanja Schult write that there was initially a distinction between political prisoners, who invoked \\"never again\\" as part of their fight against fascism, and Jewish survivors, whose imperative was to \\"never forget\\" their murdered relatives and destroyed communities. They write that the distinction has been blurred in the subsequent decades as the Holocaust was universalised. According to the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 because \\"the international community vowed never again to allow\\" the atrocities of World War II, and the Genocide Convention was adopted the same year. Eric Sundquist notes that \\"the founding of Israel was predicated on the injunction to remember a history of destruction‚Äîthe destruction of two Temples, exile and pogroms, and the Holocaust‚Äîand to ensure that such events will never happen again\\". The slogan \\"never again\\" was used on Israeli kibbutzim by the end of the 1940s, and was used in the Swedish documentary Mein Kampf in 1961. ==Definition== graffiti Never Again! A Program for Survival (1972) According to Hans Kellner, \\"Unpacking the semantic contents of 'Never Again' would be an enormous task. Suffice it to say that this phrase, despite its non-imperative form as a speech act, orders someone to resolve that something shall not happen for a second time. The someone, in the first instance, is a Jew; the something is usually called the Holocaust.\\" Kellner suggests that it is related to the \\"biblical imperative of memory\\" (zakhor), in Deuteronomy 5:15, \\"And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm.\\" (In the bible, this refers to remembering and keeping Shabbat). It is also closely related to the biblical command in Exodus 23:9: \\"You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the feelings of the stranger, having yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt.\\" The initial meaning of the phrase, used by Abba Kovner and other Holocaust survivors, was particularistic to the Jewish community but the phrase's meaning was later broadened to other genocides. It is still a matter of debate whether \\"Never again\\" refers primarily to Jews (\\"Never again can we allow Jews to be victims of another Holocaust\\") or whether it has a universal meaning (\\"Never again shall the world allow genocide to take place anywhere against any group\\"). However, most politicians use it in the latter sense. The phrase is used commonly in postwar German politics, but it has different meanings. According to one interpretation, because Nazism was a synthesis of preexisting aspects of German political thought and an extreme form of ethnic nationalism, all forms of German nationalism should be rejected. Other politicians argue that the Nazis \\"misused\\" appeals to patriotism and that a new German identity should be built. Writing about the phrase, Ellen Posman noted that \\"A past though often recent humiliation, and an emphasis on former victimhood, can lead to a communal desire for a show of strength that can easily turn violent.\\" Meir Kahane, a far-right rabbi, and his Jewish Defense League popularized the phrase. To Kahane and his followers, \\"Never again\\" referred specifically to the Jews and its imperative to fight antisemitism was a call to arms that justified terrorism against perceived enemies. The Jewish Defense League song included the passage \\"To our slaughtered brethren and lonely widows: / Never again will our people's blood be shed by water, / Never again will such things be heard in Judea.\\" After Kahane's death in 1990, Sholom Comay, president of the American Jewish Committee said \\"Despite our considerable differences, Meir Kahane must always be remembered for the slogan 'Never Again,' which for so many became the battle cry of post-Holocaust Jewry.\\" ==Contemporary usage== Never Again memorial to the Rwanda genocide According to Aaron Dorfman, \\"Since the Holocaust, the Jewish community's attitude toward preventing genocide has been summed up in the moral philosophy of 'Never Again.'\\" What this meant was that the Jews would not allow themselves to be victimized. The phrase has been used in many official commemorations and appears on many Holocaust memorials and museums, including memorials at Treblinka extermination camp and Dachau concentration camp, as well as in commemoration of the Rwanda genocide. It is in wide use by Holocaust survivors, politicians, writers, and other commentators, who invoke it for a variety of purposes. In 2012, Elie Wiesel wrote: \\"'Never again' becomes more than a slogan: It's a prayer, a promise, a vow... never again the glorification of base, ugly, dark violence.\\" The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum made the phrase, in its universal sense, the theme of its 2013 Days of Remembrance, urging people to look out for the \\"warning signs\\" of genocide. Demonstrators commemorate the 1976 Argentine coup in 2011. In 2016, Samuel Totten suggested that the \\"once powerful admonition [has] become a clich√©\\" because it is repeatedly used even as genocides continue to occur, and condemnation of genocide tends to only occur after it is already over. An increasing number of commentators have indicated that the phrase has become empty and overused. Others, including Adama Dieng, have noted that genocide has continued to occur, not never again but \\"time and again\\" or \\"again and again\\" after World War II. Multiple United States presidents, including Jimmy Carter in 1979, Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H. W. Bush in 1991, Bill Clinton in 1993, and Barack Obama in 2011, have promised that the Holocaust would not happen again, and that action would be forthcoming to stop genocide. However, genocide occurred during their presidencies: Cambodia in Carter's case, Anfal genocide during Reagan's presidency, Bosnia for Bush and Clinton, Rwanda under Clinton, and Yazidi genocide for Obama. Elie Wiesel wrote that if \\"never again\\" were upheld \\"there would be no Cambodia, and no Rwanda and no Darfur and no Bosnia.\\" Totten argued that the phrase would only recover its gravitas if \\"no one but those who are truly serious about preventing another Holocaust\\" invoked it. ==Other uses== Protest against Immigration detention in the United States In Argentina, the phrase (never more) is used in annual commemorations of the 1976 Argentine coup, to emphasize continued opposition to military coups, dictatorship, and political violence, and a commitment to democracy and human rights. \\"Never again\\" has also been used in commemoration of Japanese American internment and the Chinese Exclusion Act. After the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush declared that terrorism would be allowed to triumph \\"never again\\". He referenced the phrase when defending the trial of non- citizens in military courts for terrorism-related offenses and mass surveillance policies adopted by his administration. Bush commented, \\"Foreign terrorists and agents must never again be allowed to use our freedoms against us.\\" His words echoed a speech that his father had given after winning the Gulf War: \\"never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature\\". The phrase has been used by political advocacy groups Never Again Action, which opposes immigration detention in the United States, and by Never Again MSD, a group that campaigns against gun violence in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. ==See also== *Responsibility to protect *The war to end war ==ReferencesCategory:English words and phrases Category:Aftermath of the Holocaust Category:Genocide prevention Category:Holocaust terminology ","title":"Never again"},{"id":"63875516","text":"Bothrops marmoratus, also known as the marbled lancehead, is a species of snake in the family Viperidae.

It was demolished in 1982. ==History== The original vestry hall in Kensington High Street The building was commissioned to replace a mid-19th-century vestry hall in Kensington High Street, which had been designed by Benjamin Broadbridge in the Tudor style for the Parish of St Mary Abbots. After the vestry hall had become inadequate for the their needs, civic leaders decided to procure a new town hall; the site chosen for the new building had previously been occupied by the Kensington National School. The new building, which was designed by Robert Walker in the Italianate style, was built by Braid and Co. on an adjacent site just to the east of the old vestry hall and was completed in 1880. The design involved a frontage of seven bays facing onto Kensington High Street; the central section of three bays featured a doorway with stone surround and canopy on the ground floor; there were tall windows with integrated oculi interspersed with Corinthian order columns on the first floor and a large carved pediment and flagpole above. A large extension at the rear of the building, intended to create a new courtroom and committee room to a design by William Weaver, the surveyor to the vestry, and William Hunt, was completed in 1899. It went on to become the headquarters of the Royal Borough of Kensington when the area secured Royal borough status in 1901. Speakers in the post-war era included the leader of the Union Movement, Sir Oswald Mosley, who gave a speech at the town hall in 1963. Following the creation of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in 1965, the council chose to build modern facilities at the new Kensington Town Hall in Hornton Street. Margaret Thatcher chose the town hall to deliver her \\"Britain Awake\\" foreign policy speech, which lambasted the Soviet Union for seeking world dominance, in January 1976. After the council moved to Hornton Street in 1977, the old town hall closed and was partly-demolished on the instructions of the Leader of the Council, Nicholas Freeman, \\"in controversial circumstances\\" involving an impending conservation order, in June 1982. Although demolition was temporarily halted, by the time that happened, the main frontage and the interior had been so badly damaged thay what remained had to be completely cleared in 1984. The Royal Fine Arts Commission deplored the actions of the council as \\"official vandalism\\" and the Kensington Society predicted that the council would be \\"completely condemned\\" for their actions. A journalist writing in The Times recorded the council as being \\"deeply shamed for the example it had set to other listed-building owners\\". ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1880 Category:Buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:City and town halls in London Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1982 ","title":"Old Town Hall, Kensington"},{"id":"63875950","text":"Jacqueline Marie Zaba Niki√©ma (born September 19, 1957 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso), a career diplomat, is the Ambassador from Burkina Faso to the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP).

The plant is used in fishing, for fuel, for medicine, as a source of non- edible oil, in construction and as food. ==Description== Casearia graveolens grows as a 3 to 15m tall tree. Its trunk, with dark-grey rough, fissured bark with white specks, grows to a dbh of 20 cm when the tree is between 3-6m. The green, smooth branches have grey-white patches, with glabrous branchlets, twig tips and terminal buds. The leaves are broadly elliptic to elliptic-oblong, 6‚Äì15 cm by 4‚Äì8 cm, with reddish brown dots and streaks visible at low magnification. The flowers are axillary glomerules, few to many flowered. Ripe seed capsule is orange-yellow, turning dark reddish-brown or blackish-brown when dry. Several seeds that dry to a pale yellowish-brown, ovoid in shape and around 4mm in size. The tree flowers in March and April in Zh≈çnggu√≥/China, fruiting in September and November. In its western range it may only grow to some 6m. On the Indian subcontinent, it is deciduous, flowers in February and March (mostly on leafless branches), it fruits from July to November, while the new leaves flush in June‚ÄìJuly and persist until February. ==Taxonomy== The epithet of the species, graveolens, refers to the strong, offensive, smell of its foliage. Casearia graveolens can be distinguished from other Casearia species by possessing narrowly lanceolate stipules, 5-10mm, caducous early, leaving a large conspicuous pale brown scar on young growth, the leaves possess 10-14 pairs of lateral veins, and possess dots and streaks, while being glabrous or glabrescent below. Another source, differentiating Casearia species in south-central Asia, uses the following characteristics to differentiate the species: Deciduous. The margin of leaves are crenulate, serrate or shallowly either, but infrequently entire. The subpersistent stipules, clustered at the flushing stem, are linear or are lanceolate with an acuminate tip. The young leaves are very chartaceous, and turn blackish-green when dry, with the pellucid brown streaks and dots clearly visible at low magnification. Tertiary leaf veins are finely reticulate, while the stem is purplish-grey with conspicuous lenticels, white in colour. ==Habitat== The tree grows in open forests in Cambodia, and in forests between 500 and 1800m elevation in Zh≈çnggu√≥/China. In the Himalayas and sub-Himalayas it is common in deciduous forest at the higher elevation of 250-2500m. It has been recorded within rocky deciduous hardwood forest at low altitudes up to 600m. The tree is very common in valleys and ravines with subtropical forest in southern India and the Western Ghats. ==Distribution== It is found in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, South Central Zh≈çnggu√≥/China (Yunnan), Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India (including in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal), the Eastern Himalaya region, including Bhutan and Nepal, the Western Himalaya region and Pakistan. While the Flora of Pakistan states that it has not been recorded in that nation, Samarakoon lists three specimens from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan. ==Vernacular names== *', ' (=\\"deer hip\\", Khmer) *', ' (Vietnamese) *', È¶ôÂë≥ËÑöÈ™®ËÑÜ (Chinese). *' (Bonda, Odisha) *' (Gujarati) *', ' , ', ' (Hindi). *', ', ', ', ' (Kannada, Karnataka]) *' (Kondh people, Odisha) *' (Konkani) *', ', ', ' (Malayalam, Kerala) * ', ', ' (Marathi, Maharashtra) *', ', ', ' (Odia) *' (Ollari, Odisha) *' (Parji, Odisha) *' (Surguja district, Chhattisgarh) *', ', ', ' (Telugu) *' (Nepali) ==Uses== The fruits, stem bark and leaves of C. graveolens have been used to stupefy fish in Cambodia and elsewhere. The wood is regarded as excellent firewood in Cambodia. In India the plant is used in Ayurveda medicine for treatment of cancer and viral diseases. In some places in India the root paste is used to treat piles and the juice is given for jaundice. Looking at how communities living close to each other have different names and uses for plants, Merlin Franco & Narasimhan recorded the different uses of plants by communities in Koraput and Malkangiri districts in Odisha, eastern India. While people in Kondh, Poraja (Parji-speakers) and Gadaba (Ollari-speakers) villages all use oil from the C. graveolens for non-edible purposes, the Bonda villages use it as an edible oil. Only the Kondh and Gadaba villages used the trees trunk in furniture and construction and only the Bonda people used the fruit as a vegetable. In the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh, east-central India, people use the plant to produce types of beer. The root is one of a number of plant ingredients of a ranu, a Fermentation starter tablet for handia (rice-beer) and mahua (a fermented product of Madhuca longifolia var. longifolia corollas). The bark is also added to the handia rice beer, either to increase intoxication or to quicken fermentation. ==References== graveolens Category:Flora of Andhra Pradesh Category:Flora of Assam Category:Flora of Bangladesh Category:Flora of Bhutan Category:Flora of Bihar Category:Flora of Cambodia Category:Flora of East Himalaya Category:Flora of Gujarat Category:Flora of Himachal Pradesh Category:Flora of India (region) Category:Flora of Karnataka Category:Flora of Kerala Category:Flora of Laos Category:Flora of Madhya Pradesh Category:Flora of Maharashtra Category:Flora of Meghalaya Category:Flora of Myanmar Category:Flora of Nepal Category:Flora of Odisha Category:Flora of Pakistan Category:Flora of Sikkim Category:Flora of South-Central China Category:Flora of Tamil Nadu Category:Flora of Thailand Category:Flora of Uttar Pradesh Category:Flora of Vietnam Category:Flora of West Bengal Category:Flora of West Himalaya Category:Flora of Yunnan Category:Plants described in 1852 ","title":"Casearia graveolens"},{"id":"63876006","text":"A postal strike controversy in Finland refers to a series of events in late 2019 in Finland, where widespread trade union protests which later resulted in the resignation of PM Rinne and the dissolution of his cabinet.

It ultimately led to the resignation of prime minister Rinne, when the Centre Party withdrew its support from the current government. ==Background== Labor unions in Finland have been traditionally strong, but they have been angered by the competivity pact, which increased working hours three days a year without pay rise between 2016 and 2019. The deal was negotiated in 2019, to help Finland recover from recession. The center-left government, elected in 2019, was considered more favorable to employee concerns. However, a decision by PM Rinne to shift 700 posti workers from packaging and e-commerce into a collective bargaining unit prompted widespread protests from postal workers. ==The strike== In response, the postal and logistics union went into strike on November 11. 14 days later, solidarity protests from union in other industries shut the nation down. Despite disruption in daily lives, 60 percent of Finns supported the move. Two days later, the postal workers reached an agreement with the government. Both parties settled that the 700 workers will return to the previous collective employee-employer agreement, and workers will return to their work. ==Aftermath== In wake of the crisis, the Center party said that it had lost confidence in Rinne, and Rinne handed over his resignation to president Sauli Niinisto. Sanna Marin, a Social democratic party member, was appointed prime minister following his resignation. ==References== Category:2019 in Finland Category:Postal strikes Category:Controversies in Europe Category:2019 controversies Category:2019 protests ","title":"Finland postal strike controversy 2019"},{"id":"63876019","text":"is a specialist Japanese paper.

He was a highly recruited prospect while playing at St. Mary's High School in his hometown of Clinton, Iowa, and is considered one of Iowa's best high school basketball players. Bergman played collegiately for the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Creighton Bluejays. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (NBA) but elected to pursue a career in psychiatry over playing professional basketball. Bergman worked at Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, New Hampshire, for 24 years until his retirement in 2015. ==Early life and high school career== Bergman was born and raised in the town of Clinton, Iowa. His father was an aluminium plant worker and his mother was a homemaker. Bergman is of German descent through his paternal grandfather. While attending elementary school, Bergman was convinced by his school coach, Gene McDonald, to begin playing basketball due to his height. McDonald continued to mentor Bergman as a player when he attended St. Mary's High School in his hometown of Clinton and played on the basketball team there. Basketball became the foremost part of Bergman's life and he practiced rebounding, free throw shooting and ball handing extensively. Bergman was a three-time all-state selection and named a first-team Parade All-American during his senior season. Bergman received 150 athletic scholarship offers from teams including the North Carolina Tar Heels, Kentucky Wildcats and the UCLA Bruins but he decided to stay in his home state and play for the Iowa Hawkeyes. ==College career== Bergman with the Creighton Bluejays in 1970 Bergman sat out his freshman season with the Hawkeyes in 1966‚Äì67. While at the University of Iowa, he developed an interest in psychology and childhood development and volunteered at a university program for children with disabilities. On the court, Bergman struggled during his sophomore season and failed to find a consistent role with the team, while he considered head coach Ralph Miller \\"terrible\\". He elected to transfer to the Creighton Bluejays after only having played 12 games with the Hawkeyes. Bergman began playing for the Bluejays during the 1968‚Äì69 season, but again had a troubled start and did not find himself a valued contributor until the 1969‚Äì70 season when he averaged 10.5 points and 7 rebounds per game. At the conclusion of the season, he was selected by the San Francisco Warriors in the seventh round of the 1970 NBA draft and the Kentucky Colonels in the 1970 ABA draft. However, Bergman still had a semester left of eligibility and elected to return to the Bluejays in an attempt to earn a higher draft selection for the 1971 NBA draft. After the first semester finished, Bergman stayed at Creighton University and began graduate work in psychology. Bluejays head coach Eddie Sutton believed that Bergman would have great potential as a professional player due to his shooting and defensive abilities, calling him the \\"finest defensive player\\" and \\"the most energetic hustler\\". Bergman graduated in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in psychology. ==Professional basketball career== Bergman was selected in the 1971 NBA draft as the 31st overall pick by the Cincinnati Royals. He played in the 1971 preseason with the Royals, but felt like he was used out of position at center instead of his natural power forward by head coach Bob Cousy. Bergman was the final Royals player cut before the start of the 1971‚Äì72 NBA season. He ultimately never played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as he decided to retire and return to school to continue studying psychology. ==Psychiatry career== Bergman enrolled at Xavier University and pursued a master's in psychology. While in graduate school, he found a job at Longview State Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. His stint at the hospital, where he worked with criminally insane patients, influenced a change in educational goals. He decided to attend medical school to become a psychiatrist and be able to prescribe medications. Bergman left Xavier without finishing his master's program. He enrolled at numerous medical schools and was accepted by the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara in Mexico, where he became fluent at speaking Spanish as they did not speak English at the school. He received his medical degree in 1980 and found employment at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Bergman worked there for five years alongside colleagues including Fred Berlin and John Money. He then worked at Taylor Manor in nearby Ellicott City, Maryland but later chose to move to a safer area to raise his son. In 1991, Bergman moved to Keene, New Hampshire and was appointed medical director of the mental health unit at the Cheshire Medical Center. He worked there for 24 years before he retired in 2015. ==References== ==External links== *College statistics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball players Category:American psychiatrists Category:Basketball players from Iowa Category:Cincinnati Royals draft picks Category:Creighton Bluejays men's basketball players Category:Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball players Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:People from Clinton, Iowa Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:San Francisco Warriors draft picks Category:Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara alumni Category:Xavier University alumni ","title":"Joe Bergman"},{"id":"63876046","text":"The W350 Project is a proposed wooden skyscraper in central Tokyo, Japan, announced in 2018.

Wood was chosen since timber-based structures have proven to be very resistant to earthquakes. The project requires 185,000 cubic meters of timber (or 6.5 million cubic feet), and plans to revitalize forestry and timber demand in Japan. The choice of wood, aside from its aesthetics, is aiming \\"to transform the town into a forest\\". Wooden structures are also easier to rebuild or replace if it collapse than concrete structures.

All 24 seats in the New Hampshire Senate were up for election. It resulted in Republicains maintaining control of both chambers of the New Hampshire General Court. In addition, Republican Chris Sununu won the open 2016 New Hampshire gubernatorial election giving the New Hampshire Republican Party total control of the state government for the first time since Republican Governor Craig Benson was defeated by Democrat John Lynch in the 2004 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Furthermore, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was able to win the state in 2016 Presidential election by fewer than 3,000 votes (0.4%) and Democrat Maggie Hassan won 2016 United States Senate election by around 1,000 votes (0.2%). Primary elections were held on September 13, 2016. == Background == In the 2014 New Hampshire state elections, Republicans expanded their majority in the New Hampshire Senate to a margin of 14‚Äì10. Republicans also gained control of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. On the other hand, incumbent Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan was able to secure a second two-year term preventing total Republican control. == Campaign == A major issue of the campaign was the long planned extension of MBTA's Lowell Line from Lowell towards Nashua, Manchester and Concord as part of the so called Capital Corridor. Democratic candidates for the General Court were overwhelmingly in favor of the project, while most Republican candidates were opposed. One exception was Daniel Innis, Republican nominee in the 24th district, who stated that \\"[The project] clearly adds value.\\" The 2016 elections were seen as crucial for the project. In case the project would get political approval, the State of New Hampshire was expected at the time to pay around $72 million of $245.6 million for the construction of the line as well as between $3 Million to $5 million per year for the operation of it. ==Results== === Analysis === Despite Hillary Clinton carrying New Hampshire by a small margin in the simultaneous 2016 United States Presidential election, Democrats were not able to achieve significant gains in New Hampshire's state legislature. In total, just two seats changed hands between the parties. On the one hand, State Senate District 7, which was carried by Donald Trump by a 54-40 margin, switched from the Democrats to the Republicans. On the other hand, Democrats flipped State Senate District 16, which was carried by Hillary Clinton by a 48-47 margin. A total of four districts elected a Senator of a different party than the party of the presidential nominee that the district. State Senate Districts 1 and 18 reelected their Democratic Senators, despite being carried by President Trump. On the other hand, State Senate Districts 9 and 24 reelected their Republican Senators, despite being carried by Hillary Clinton. === Overview === { style=\\"width:60%; text-align:center;\\" + ‚Üì - style=\\"color:white;\\"  style=\\"background:red; width:58.3%;\\"  14  style=\\"background:blue; width:41.7%;\\"  10 -  Republican  Democratic } Source: Official results. { class= !

The company was created for the purpose of exploiting both the intellectual property rights of Chapman's creations and also those of interested third parties. The company is structured to allow greater rewards and input to property creators. This developed from Chapman's own frustrations at his lack of involvement with his Bob the Builder character. He created the character in the early 1991s and struck a deal with HIT Entertainment which saw them develop the character. The project was handed over to Hot Animation, specifically Jackie Cockle and Curtis Jobling, who took the basic title and premise of the show and ran with it, developing the project in-house from a blank canvas. The resulting show was commissioned by the BBC. In May 1996, Chapman Television Channel launched, a stop-frame animation show on Five's Milkshake! The show has been sold into over 100 territories worldwide. Fifi and the Flowertots features the voices of Jane Horrocks and more. In May 1996, Chapman Television Channel launched their second show, The idea for the show was suggested by Brands Hatch employee David Jenkins and features the voices of comedian Peter Kay and more and racing driver Sir Stirling Moss as the narrator. In July 1999, Chapman Entertainment announced the departure of their MD Greg Lynn ahead of massive company redundancies, \\"soaring costs and challenging trading conditions\\" were listed as the reason's for the redundancies. In August 1999, Chapman Television Channel announced the company being place for sale. It has placed poor toys sales as the main cause. In November 1998, Chapman Entertainment announced the company being placed into administration. again blaming poor toys sales as the main cause. In September 2001, DreamWorks Animation (which would be acquired by NBCUniversal in 2001) acquired Chapman Entertainment's TV library. The acquisition adds to DreamWorks growing library of family entertainment brands that also include properties gained when it acquired Classic Media in 2000.

Early in the 19th century the population was 176 and only half the land in the parish was enclosed. Later in the century, it was described as hilly, much of which was pasture, with the village consisting of a few farmhouses. Glandwr Baptist chapel in the village was built in 1894.

Around two-thirds of its personnel were women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The regiment defended London, operating the heaviest guns serving with Anti- Aircraft Command. ==Organisation== Cap Badge of the Auxiliary Territorial Service By 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì400.Routledge, pp. 338, 407. An ATS member of a mixed 3.7-inch HAA gun battery, December 1942. By 1942 the training regiments were turning out a regular stream of Mixed HAA batteries, which AA Command formed into regiments to take the place of the all-male units being sent to overseas theatres of war. One such new unit was 163rd (Mixed) HAA Regiment. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed on 28 June 1942 at Wimbledon in South London and 553 (M) Bty was regimented with it.Frederick, p. 792. This battery had been intended for 132nd (M) HAA Rgt, but its formation had been delayed because of a shortage of ATS personnel. It had finally been formed on 16 April by 205th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield from a cadre provided by 105th HAA Rgt.Frederick, pp. 761, 785. Two other batteries joined the regiment at this time: 350 Bty from 105th HAA Rgt and 538 (M) Bty from 141st (M) HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 780, 787. 565 (M) Bty joined the regiment on 14 September 1942; this had been formed on 10 June at 24th HAA Training Rgt, Blackdown Camp, from a cadre provided by 132nd HAA Rgt. ==Defending London== The new regiment was assigned to 48th Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 1st Anti-Aircraft Division (later 1 AA Group) defending the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ), and apart from a few weeks remained with it throughout its service.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. ===Baby Blitz=== ATS women operating a height and range finder on an HAA gun site, December 1942. The Luftwaffe carried out few bombing raids on London during 1942‚Äì43, preferring to concentrate on softer targets such as provincial cities (the Baedeker Blitz) or on 'hit and run' attacks by Fighter- bombers against coastal targets.Collier, Appendix XXXVIII.Routledge, pp. 401‚Äì4; Table LXVIII, p. 405. However, in January 1944 it resumed night raids on London, which became known as the 'Baby Blitz'. These raids employed new faster bombers with sophisticated 'pathfinder' techniques and radar jamming. For example, on the night of 21 January 200 hostile aircraft were plotted approaching the South Coast in two waves, which intermingled with returning aircraft of RAF Bomber Command. This caused problems of identification and restrictions on fire, but the guns of 2 AA Group and then 1 AA Group engaged as the raiders approached London. Only one-fifth of the raiders reached the city, the remainder turning away to bomb open country. AA guns brought down eight aircraft. At the end of January London Docks received a 130-strong raid dropping flares and incendiaries as they had in the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì41: about one-third reached their target and five were shot down. February began with a 75-strong raid, of which only 12 reached the IAZ and four were shot down. On 13 February only six out of 115 bombers reached London. The climax came with five raids in the week 18‚Äì25 February varying from 100 to 140 in strength. These met intense AA fire from the Thames Estuary onwards and fewer than half made it to central London: the AA score was 13 shot down while the night fighters added 15. Facing these casualty rates, the Luftwaffe switched to targets away from London until 24 March, when a 100-strong raid on London lost four aircraft, and finally on 18 April a raid of 125 aircraft lost 14 shot down and only 30 reached the IAZ. Although much damage was caused in London, the rising efficiency of the HAA guns and radar made the enemy's losses unsustainable.Collier, Chapter XXI.Collier, Table XLII.Routledge, pp. 409‚Äì10.

By the autumn of 1944, the regiment was serving on 5.25-inch guns ‚Äì the heaviest guns in service with AA Command ‚Äì with 350 Bty operating the powered twin ex- naval turrets covering London. This required a higher personnel establishment of 8 officers, 186 male other ranks and 211 ATS per 5.25-inch battery, 12 officers, 147 male other ranks, 293 ATS for the turrets.AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148.Routledge, pp. 406‚Äì7. ===Operation Diver=== Soon after the Allied invasion of Normandy began on D-Day, V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', began to be launched against London from Northern France. V-1s (known to Londoners as 'Doodlebugs') presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but it presented a severe problem for AA guns, and after two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the London IAZ and other parts of the UK and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where a 'downed' V-1 would cause no damage. This meant that the remaining HAA guns around the IAZ, including the fixed 5.25-inch guns, were silenced, to the rage of Londoners, who were unaware of the tactics being employed. As the launching sites were overrun by 21st Army Group, the Luftwaffe switched to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea, so 1 AA Group had to redeploy again to the east of London. This reorganisation entailed 163rd (M) HAA Rgt transferring within 1 AA Group to come under the command of 26th (London) AA Bde in November‚ÄìDecember 1944. It returned to 48th AA Bde within weeks.Routledge pp. 408‚Äì21. By now, AA Command was being forced to release personnel, both male and ATS, for service with 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe, and a large number of units had to be disbanded.Routledge, pp. 407, 420‚Äì1. 565 (M) Battery began disbanding on 18 September, and completed the process by 16 October. It was replaced on 7 February 1945 when 505 (M) Bty joined from 157th HAA Rgt, but by then the war in Europe was coming to an end. 553 (M) Battery disbanded at Southend-on-Sea on 31 March 1945. ==Postwar== AA Command's formation patch. 163rd (M) HAA Regiment remained with 48 AA Bde in 1 AA Group after the war had ended.Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. When the RA was reorganised on 1 April 1947, 163rd (M) HAA Rgt was redesignated 101 (M) HAA Regiment in the postwar Regular Army, (taking the number of a pre-war Territorial Army unit in Scotland that had been redesignated 501 HAA Rgt). 350, 505 and 538 Batteries were redesignated 241, 296 and 323 (M) Btys. It was one of only three Mixed regiments in the postwar Regular RA.Frederick, pp. 779, 1018.Frederick, p. 961100‚Äì110 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. The regiment formed part of 15 AA Bde ‚Äì the Regular Army element of the old 48 AA Bde ‚Äì in 1 AA Group of AA Command.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.Frederick, pp. 1049‚Äì50. However, the new regiment did not last very long under postwar cuts. It was reduced to a cadre in London on 30 June 1948, 323 Bty was disbanded on 10 October, and RHQ and the other two batteries were placed in suspended animation on 10 November, completing the process by the end of the month. Brass collar badge of the Royal Artillery ==Insignia== While the male members of the regiment wore the Royal Artillery's 'gun' cap badge, the women wore the ATS cap badge, but in addition they wore the RA's 'grenade' collar badge as a special badge above the left breast pocket of the tunic. Both sexes wore the white RA lanyard on the right shoulder.Sainsbury, Plate 9, p. 7. ==Notes== ==References== * Basil Collier, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom, London: HM Stationery Office, 1957/Uckfield: Naval & Military, 2004, . * J.B.M.

Our position is, we think, close to what Hammersley calls 'subtle realism' (1992: 53).\\" * Mays, N., & Pope, C. (2020) \\"Quality in Qualitative Research\\", in Catherine Pope & Nicholas Mays (eds) Qualitative Research in Health Care (pp. 211‚Äì233), Fourth edition, Hoboken, John Wiley & Sons, p. 216: \\"The role of qualitative and quantitative research is thus to attempt to represent that reality rather than to imagine that 'the truth' can be attained. Hammersley calls this subtle realism.\\" * Scanlan, L., Douglas, G., Robinson, M. G., Butler, I., & Murch, M. (2003) Divorcing Children: Children's Experience of Their Parents' Divorce, London, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, p. 14: \\"Shaw suggests that children's accounts must bear some relation to our 'approximate understanding of real social conditions' (p.27), displaying what Martyn Hammersley calls 'subtle realism' (Hammersley 1992).\\" Its central issue is the relationship between the investigator and the phenomena being studied: are those phenomena and their characteristics independent of the process of inquiry, or is the character of what is investigated determined, structured, or shaped by the research? Subtle realism insists that phenomena are independent, but that knowledge of them is always constructed by the investigator‚Äîrather than, for example, being logically derived from sense impressions. It also asserts that social inquiry cannot reproduce phenomena, or capture their essence, but can only produce answers to particular questions about them.Hammersley, M. (1992) What's Wrong with Ethnography?, London, Routledge, Chs 1 and 3. There are many concepts of realism, such as metaphysical realism, epistemological realism, internal realism, and critical realism.Porter, Sam (2011) \\"Realism\\", in Robert L. Miller & John Brewer (eds) The A‚ÄìZ of Social Research: A Dictionary of Key Social Science Research Concepts, London, Sage.Maxwell, Joseph A. and Mittapalli, Kavita (2015) \\"Realism as a Stance for Mixed Methods Research\\", in Abbas Tashakkori and Charles Teddlie (eds) SAGE Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social & Behavioral Research, Thousand Oaks CA, Sage.Madill, Anna (2012) \\"Realism\\", in Lisa M. Given (ed.) The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods, Thousand Oaks CA, Sage, pp. 732‚Äì735. As with these other examples, subtle realism involves a contrast with rejected alternatives, in this case not just with forms of anti-realism but also with na√Øve realism. The latter is the idea that knowledge must be a direct product of contact between an investigator and an independently existing reality, this contact taking place via the senses or by some other direct means. A corollary of na√Øve realism is that, without such immediate contact, no knowledge is possible.Hammersley, M. (1992) What's Wrong with Ethnography?, London, Routledge, Ch 3. ==Features in detail== Against relativism, subtle realism asserts that there is a single reality (not multiple realities corresponding to different perspectives), and that it is possible to gain knowledge of the phenomena that make up this reality. Against naive realism it holds that that beliefs cannot be logically derived from, or proven absolutely via, sense impressions or any other kind of immediately given data; that a distinction must be drawn between what is true and what can be believed with justification, the latter being decided on the basis of what is beyond reasonable doubt; and that any understanding or knowledge produced comprises answers to particular questions about the phenomena, rather than capturing those phenomena \\"in themselves\\"‚Äîin other words, it cannot simply reproduce them.Hammersley, M. (1992) What's Wrong with Ethnography?, London, Routledge, Ch 1. Deciding what is beyond reasonable doubt involves assessing: # plausibility‚Äîthe relationship between a knowledge claim and what is already taken to be well-established knowledge (Does it follow logically from this? Is it more weakly implied by this? Is it compatible with this? Is it at odds with this?); # credibility‚Äîhow the knowledge claim was produced, specifically what were the chances of error in its production.Hammersley, M. (1992) What's Wrong with Ethnography?, London, Routledge, Ch 4. Faced with a knowledge claim that is neither sufficiently plausible nor credible to be beyond reasonable doubt, determining its likely truth depends upon the evidence available to support it. This evidence, in turn, is judged upon its plausibility and credibility. Beside the search for evidence, further information may also be sought about how the knowledge claim, or relevant evidence, was produced‚Äîso as to have better grounds for assessing its credibility.Hammersley, M. (1998) Reading Ethnographic Research, Second edition, London, Longman, Ch 4. To use a commonplace example from detective stories, a witness claims to have seen someone murdered. A first basis for judging this is whether or not the allegedly murdered person is known to be still alive‚Äîif so, the claim is very implausible. If the person concerned has disappeared, then the claim that murder has taken place is compatible with what is known, so this provides a degree of plausibility, though relatively weak; finding the body would increase the plausibility. To strengthen the basis for making a judgment about who was the killer it is necessary to make sure that the witness was where he or she claimed to have seen the murder; had a clear view of what went on; that what was seen is strongly indicative of murder; and so on. In seeking further evidence we may want information about the witness (how good is the eyesight, does he or she have any reason to lie, and so on), facts about the scene, or testimony from other witnesses. In this way a case can be built for concluding that a murder took place and who did it, that it did not take place, or that the validity of the witness's statement remains uncertain. Nevertheless, any claim about the murder remains fallible, even if it is beyond reasonable doubt. The implications of subtle realism for social research are that scientific investigation of social phenomena is possible and desirable; and that it is quite distinct from, even though it shares some characteristics with, the production of literary or artistic fictions or the pursuit of practical or political goals.Hammersley, M. (2008) Questioning Qualitative Inquiry, London, Sage, Ch 8. Equally important, it does not differ fundamentally in character from the ordinary inquiry and sensemaking that people do during the course of everyday life; though the questions it addresses are usually much more difficult to answer than mundane ones, and it employs refined methods designed to tackle those questions.Seale, C.

The project started in 1990 and was funded by the both Inter-Ministerial Committee of Space Science and Technology (CICYT) and the Instituto Nacional de T√©cnica Aeroespacial (INTA) who was also responsible for the project's management. After some feasibility studies, the satellite entered design phase in 1993. The main objectives of the program were to develop a technology demonstrator in order to test and develop the nation's capabilities to produce and manage spacecraft. To this end, INTA teamed up with private enterprises and universities to acquire funds and resources. Nonetheless, emphasis was also put on keeping the costs to a minimum and to ensure affordability.M. A. Garcia Primo, ‚ÄúSpanish MINISAT Program - Objectives and Operational Results,‚Äù Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Small Satellites Systems and Services, Sept. 14-18, 1998, Antibes Juan les Pins, France The initial program was supposed to involve at least four minisatellites (Minisat 1 to 4) but only Minisat 01 was put into orbit. A second design, the Minisat 02, was developed and tested in 2001 but the mission was canceled and the satellite scrapped by 2002. == Mission == The Minisat 01 was conceived to perform Earth observation on a low orbit in addition to four different scientific experiments: * EURD (Espectr√≥grafo Ultravioleta extremo para la observaci√≥n de la Radiaci√≥n Difusa - Extreme UV Spectrograph for the Study of Diffuse Radiation). * CPLM (Column of Liquid Bridge in Microgravity). * LEGRI (Low Energy Gamma Ray Imager). * ETRV (Experiencia Tecnol√≥gica de un Regulador de Velocidad - Speed Regulator Technology Demonstrator). An alternative payload was devised but not implemented consisting on four additional experiments: GOYA (Gamma-ray burst Observer Yearned-Always), SIXE (Spanish Italian X-ray Experiment), DOPA, XRASE. These experiments would be later projected for the Minisat 02 before the whole project was scrapped. == Body == The satellite was build between CASA, who was in charge of developing the platform, and INTA, who mainly devised the different payload and experiment implementation. A great degree of emphasis was put on keeping cost down so the construction was modular (able to allocate up to 300 kg of payload), small (about 1145 mm x 1005 mm x 1170 mm) and projected to have a service life of 4 to 5 years. The body ended up weighting 195 kg (100 kg structure and 95 kg of payload) and was shaped like an hexagonal prism with the experiments attacked to the top and bottom faces while the sides mounted 4 deployable AsGa solar panels (550 mm x 800 mm in size) capable each to fully provide the power needed to run the satellite (about 50 W).D. Garcia-Asensio, M. Perez-Ayucar, M. A. Serrano, ‚ÄúMINISAT 01, Concept and Evolution in the Operations of a Successful Small Mission,‚Äù Proceedings of the 18th International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics (ESA SP-548), Munich, Germany, Oct. 11-15, 2004 The core contained a NiCd battery and the onboard central computing and processing unit (a modified Intel 80386 microprocessor) with 32 Mb of RAM, 512 kb of EEPROM, 2.4 MIPS of throughput, 32 MBytes of data storage and multiple redundant cores. A bus connection links the microprocessor to the experiments capable of providing point-to-point interfaces while managing the control subsystem. This was divided in two basic units: the thermal and the kinetic units. The first consisted on insulator coating around the body with both, internal and external, thermistors to measure temperature and active internal heaters around experiments and battery in order to keep the temperature within operational ranges. The kinetic unit ensured the Minisat 01 maintained a favorable position to maximize sunlight incidence on the solar panels in addition to stabilize the spacecraft on its 3 axis. This unit consisted on a combination of 3 torque rods placed orthogonally to each other and a reaction wheel in the spin plane. Data of the current position of the body was provided by two perpendicularly put sun sensors and two biaxial magnetometers which, working in cooperation, could provide accurate information on the satellite's position up to ¬±3¬∫ of error.Gim√©nez, √Ålvaro. Science with Minisat 01: Proceedings of the Workshop held in Madrid 26‚Äì28 April 1999. Dordrecht; Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, ¬©2001. Communication with Earth was maintained using bidirectional RF transmitters operating on the S-band with a downlink speed of 1Mbit/s and an uplink speed of 2 kbit/s. == Launch == The S/C was launched from an American Lockheed L-1011-385-1-15 TriStar registered N140SC with a Pegasus-XL rocket from Gando Air Base in the Canary Islands the 21st of April 1997. It was successfully put on a near-circular close orbit of 585 km of apoapsis and 566 km of periapsis with and inclination of 151¬∫ (29¬∫ retrograde) and an orbital period of 96 minutes. After 5 years of successful operation, the satellite reentered the atmosphere on 14 February 2002. During its whole service life it was operated by INTA, who monitored the satellite from the Maspalomas Station (15¬∫ 37' 45‚Äù W, 27¬∫ 45' 49‚Äù N). == Experiments == === EURD === alt= Being the result of the joint efforts of INTA and the University of California, Berkeley, this device was to conduct spectrographic observations of diffuse EUV radiation in the interstellar medium in order to examine the Mesosphere's composition. The focus of these observations were oxygen lines and high energy (above 10 eV), high mean life (above 1024 s) neutrinos whose presence may be indicative of dark matter. To archive that, the device employed two independent spectrometers equipped with modulable spectral band (between 350 and 1100 √Ö). This allowed to compare and filter the readings obtained in order to minimize systematic errors caused by the ionizing nature of EUV, thus, ensuring a higher degree of precision. Each spectrometer was about 40x40x13 cm in size and 11 kg in weight with acute grating (8 cm of diameter, 18 cm of focal length with holographically ruled 2460 lines/mm and made of silicon/boron carbide) in order to protect the measuring instruments. Under the grating, the Multi-Channel Plate (MCP) detectors with wedge and strip encoding are allocated, facing the exterior through a lens which provides them with 26¬∫ x 8¬∫ FOV and four possible positions. These were: open (transmitting all wavelength), shielded (blocks all emission and allows for internal radiation readings), magnesium fluoride filter (which allows to measure Lyman-alpha spectral series) and aluminum filter (which blocks most of the Lyman radiation while letting EUV through). The device was placed at one end of the satellite, facing anti-sun direction and it was operated continuously during the satellite's life. === CPLM === Developed by the Technical University of Madrid the CPLM was experimentation module created to study the behavior of fluids when allocated inside axis-symmetric bridges under conditions of microgravity. It consisted on a test cell containing the fluid bridges embedded between several optical detectors, which were capable of measuring changes in position and shape of the fluid, and a command unit. This unit was itself built with a motor, able to change the direction of the bridges and to reset the experiment, and an accelerometer which measured the forces acting on the test fluid. The module was allocated inside a cylindrical container which also held the power supply, several temperature and pressure sensors and a back-up memory card. During its operational run the liquid bridge would be oriented perpendicular to the z-axis (Sun-to-satellite direction) and activated for 5 minutes once a week. As a result, the satellite would spin ¬±0.375 rpm longitudinally as a direct consequence from the accelerations applied at the CPLM. === LEGRI === Fermi gamma telescope which is similar to the LEGRI. The LEGRI was developed by an international composed by INTA, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), the University of Valencia and the University of Birmingham. The main objective was to build a prototype gamma-ray telescope capable of detecting low energy radiation (between 10 and 200 keV) produced by the dispersion of gamma radiation emitted by celestial bodies such as black holes, binary stars or neutron stars. The device was to incorporate some cutting-edge technology for its time, such as HgI2 emerging detectors developed by the Centro de Investigaciones Energ√©ticas y Medioambientales (CIEMAT) capable of providing accurate readings on the operating energy range and a high degree of thermal resistance and a very good efficiency-weight ratio. Originally 100 such detectors where to form the LEGRI sensing sub-unit but the experimental nature of this technology made INTA choose to mix an array of 80 HgI2 20, more conventional and reliable CdZnTe detectors. This decision also allowed to directly compare their performance when working on a 0 g environment and sharing FEE and background noise fluxes. Besides the sensing sub-unit, LEGRI incorporated a filtering unit made of a mechanical collimator supported on a honeycomb tungsten plate which is allocated in front of the detectors, a high voltage power supply needed to feed the device, and a processing unit which manages data and provides continuous attitude readings on the satellite in order to ease image reconstruction while avoiding signal noise. === ETRV === Developed by CASA, the ETRV was a speed regulation mechanism capable of deploying various devices such as solar panels, antennas and proves. It consisted on an electrical motor connected a torsion spring mounted over a gearbox capable of regulating motion and providing a certain degree of stability. To simulate payloads, a small flywheel was added to the end of a deploying arm directly connected to the gearbox. To ensure the correct positioning of the movable arm an electromagnetic Reed switch would measure momentum, gyro angle and rate of the arm providing real-time corrections for the system and allowing a maximum deployment speed of 180¬∫ in about 3 minutes. The time control during the different phases of deployment was ensured by a pyrotechnic nut, responsible for maintaining the system's integrity until the firing of a pyro-kintetic charge which would signal the conditions were met to begin the whole placement process. == References == Category: Spacecraft launched in 1997 Category: Satellites of Spain Category:INTA satellites ","title":"Minisat 01"},{"id":"63876941","text":"Kenji Morimoto (born 14 December 1975) is a Japanese equestrian.

The oldest part is a Grade II* listed building and the later part is Grade II listed. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace a mid-19th- century vestry hall on King's Road, which had been designed by William Willmer Pocock in the Italianate style for the Parish of St Luke's and which had been found to be structurally unsound. The oldest part of the current complex is the vestry hall in Chelsea Manor Gardens, which was designed by John McKean Brydon in the Neoclassical style and built by a local builder, Charles Wall; it was officially opened on 12 January 1887. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing onto Chelsea Manor Gardens; the central section of three bays featured three windows above which there was a large Venetian window flanked by huge Ionic order pilasters supporting a pediment. A cupola with a dome and weather vane was erected at roof level. This building became the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea on its formation in 1900. Internally, the main rooms were the main hall, which was particularly ornate, a smaller hall and the Cadogan Suite, the latter two being located in side wings off the main hall. After civic leaders found that Pocock's vestry hall was structurally unsound, they elected to demolish it and construct a new structure to the designs of Leonard Stokes in the Neoclassical style on the King's Road site. The works were carried out by A.N. Coles of Plymouth at a cost of ¬£35,000 and completed in 1907. The design for this frontage involved 15 bays with two sections at either end with doorways with fanlights flanked by windows and by full-height Ionic order columns supporting pediments; the two end-sections also had windows on the first floor. The frontage also had a clock which projected over the street and central bellcote. The complex ceased to be the local seat of government when the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was formed in 1965. However the Brydon building became the main Kensington and Chelsea Register Office and subsequently hosted several famous weddings including the marriage of Judy Garland to Mickey Deans in March 1969. After being refurbished by Roderick Ham & Partners, the Stokes extension became the main Chelsea branch library in 1978. The Chelsea Art Society also decided to establish its home in the Stokes extension in 1994 and it began to hold a series of annual exhibitions there showing work by both professional and non-professional artists. An internal refurbishment of the rooms in the Brydon building was completed by Ark Build in February 2019. ==References== Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1887 Category:Grade II* listed government buildings ","title":"Chelsea Town Hall"},{"id":"63876984","text":"David Cooper (born 15 December 1970) is an Australian equestrian.

He was a son of Freiherr Johann Alexander Saurma von der Jeltsch-Lorzendorf (1804‚Äì1841) and the former Freifrau Marie Luise Antonie Anna Franziska von Frankenberg und Ludwigsdorf (1807‚Äì1876). His older brother was Johann Josef Arthur Saurma von der Jeltsch-Lorzendorf, who married Laura \\"Lory\\" Henckel von Donnersmarck (a daughter of Hugo Henckel von Donnersmarck). His younger brother was the prominent numismatist Hugo von Saurma von der Jeltsch. His paternal grandparents were Freiherr Johann Anton Saurma von der Jeltsch and Aloysia Gr√§fin von Hoverden-Plencken. His maternal grandparents were Count Joseph von Frankenberg, Baron von Schellendorf, heir to Warthau and Countess Maria Theresia von Frankenberg (an supporter of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). He studied law at the University of Bonn. ==Career== He entered the diplomatic service in 1850, eventually becoming attach√© in Paris. In 1866, he took part in the Austro-Prussian War as a Prussian army officer. After the war, he managed the business of various legations and in 1872 he became a legation councilor. In 1873, he was appointed embassy councilor in Constantinople and in 1875, he became German Consul-General in Belgrade, followed by Consul- General and diplomatic agent to Egypt and based in Alexandria in 1879. In 1882, he became German Ambassador to the Kingdom of Romania in Bucharest and, in 1885, to the Kingdom of the Netherlands in The Hague. In 1891, he became a Prussian envoy to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart. In 1893, he became the first German Ambassador to the United States, replacing Minister Baron von Holleben, who took his old post in Stuttgart. Before taking his post in Washington, D.C., he traveled to New York City with Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the Counselor and First Secretary to the German Embassy, where they toured the city, visiting the New York Stock Exchange and the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park, which he had seen while stationed in Egypt. In Washington, the Ambassador resided at 1435 Massachusetts Avenue which was bought by the German government a few months before his arrival. In November 1894, he was among the guests who dined with President Cleveland's Solicitor General Lawrence Maxwell Jr., including Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham and Justice Stephen Johnson Field. In 1895, he was replaced by Max von Thielmann. In 1895, he returned to Constantinople to serve as German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. In his report about the treatment of the Armenians, Anton: > \\"stressed how nonsensical he found both the demonstration and the demands of > the Armenians, drew particular attention to the role of the police force. He > wrote that the police did not only tolerate 'that the population was > massacring the Armenians, but was cheering them on and took part itself in > the slaughtering of already heavily wounded and tied-up Armenians.' He also > described how \\"Armenians were then even 'raided and slaughtered' in their > own homes.\\" He was replaced in Constantinople by Baron Adolf Marschall von Bieberstein, the former German Minister for Foreign Affairs, in 1897. From 1897 to 1899, he was the German Ambassador to Italy in Rome, where he replaced Bernhard von B√ºlow who succeeded von Bieberstein as the Emperor's Minister for Foreign Affairs. Saurma von der Jeltsch retired in 1899, shortly before his death in April 1900. ==Personal life== Anton was married to Margarete von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg (1850‚Äì1923), a daughter of Pauline de Castellane and Count Max von Hatzfeldt, who spent ten years from 1849 to 1859 as the German Minister to France and who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1856 which ended the Crimean War. After her father's death, her mother remarried to Louis de Talleyrand- P√©rigord, duc de Valen√ßay, 3rd duc de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Her elder sister, H√©l√®ne, was the wife of Georg von Kanitz (aide de camp to Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia). Together, they were the parents of two children: * Freiherr Maximilian Saurma von der Jeltsch (1873‚Äì1949), who married Anne Marie Strachwitz von Gro√ü-Zauche und Camminetz. * Freifrau Carmen Saurma von der Jeltsch (1875-1952), who was given a ball in Washington for her debut while her father was Ambassador. She later married Stanislaus Graf Hoyos, Freiherr zu Stichsenstein.

The main traffic artery of the housing estate is a road running in the north-south direction, which is formed by Prostƒõjovsk√° and Volgogradsk√° streets. == History and present == Construction of panel buildings (panel√°ks or commieblocks) began in 1962 and ended in the early 1990s. Between 1990 and 1994, 'Kostol Panny M√°rie Kr√°ƒæovnej Pokoja' (Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace) was built in the housing estate. In 2008, an apartment building on Bajkalsk√° street was completed, containing 16 residential units. Apartments Ast√≥ria were completed in 2015 and in 2016 the apartment complex Apartments Torysa on Mukaƒçevsk√° street was completed. In 2017, the Na trojke project was completed, which was created after demolishing a dilapidated hospital at the same exact place, and a complex of four multifunctions Biko≈° apartment buildings is also under construction, with a planned completion in 2020. As of today, old apartment buildings are getting gentrified and painted, and modern apartment buildings might get built in this housing estate. Na trojke is an example of a modern looking apartment building in this housing estate. In recent years, individual housing construction is getting built the Kr√°ƒæova hora district, where several new streets have been added. Currently, this construction is being expanded as part of the Kr√°ƒæova hora project, and a new district of family houses is also under construction on the edge of the housing estate above Prostƒõjovsk√° Street, not far from the final public transport stop (MHD). On 6 December 2019, there was a gas explosion in the apartment building on Mukaƒçevsk√° no. 7, in which 8 citizens were tragically killed. It was one of the greatest misfortunes of its kind in the modern history of Slovakia, some, such as Mons. Bernard Bober, named it Pre≈°ovsk√° trag√©dia (Pre≈°ov Tragedy).

Puerto Rico was left with no electricity nor available water island-wide.

The money was immediately used to provide small grants to individuals and organizations on the island to procure urgent needs of what items could be found. Initially, just obtaining necessary items was difficult. \\"You get a private cargo plane landing in the Aguadilla airport, and when that plane lands, is that there's not enough personnel to help unload the plane,\\" said PRxPR co-founder Carmen Baez,‚ÄùThere‚Äôs not enough personnel to guard the merchandise, to load the trucks, to drive the trucks to where they're needed.‚Äù The organization has continued for the last several years now to focus on the infrastructure of the island, helping to install solar energy, water purification systems, distribute water, food and medical aid, repair structures, and provide grants to individuals, especially farmers to help them individually recover and aid in the overall recovery. ‚ÄúPeople have lost their livestock - the chicken that laid the eggs, the pork that provided the meat, their orchards and gardens that provided their vegetables.‚Äù As Federal Aid is slow to come, organizations like PRxPR are continue to provide help and hope to the people of Puerto Rico. ‚ÄúThe most disadvantaged victims of Hurricane Maria are now the ones that are further suffering under the burden of politics,‚Äù Carmen Baez is quoted to say. ‚ÄúIf the federal aid was limited and slow before, now it will be worse.‚Äù A year after the storm Francisco Cerezo, an attorney and one of the founders of PRxPR, said \\"There is still a lot of need, But if there is one ‚Äòsemi-silver lining,‚Äô it's that people have united to help.The diaspora always had many different kinds of divisions,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThere are all kinds of ways Puerto Ricans self- identified.

During World War II, he was shot down over Germany and, after evading capture for several days, snuck into a Luftwaffe airfield and stole an enemy plane which he flew back to Allied lines. He also became a flying ace credited with 14 or 15 aerial victories, including five in a single day, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. == Early life and World War II == Bruce W. Carr was born on January 28, 1924, in Union Springs, New York. He began flying at the age of 15 in 1939, and enlisted into the United States Army Air Forces on September 3, 1942. Carr entered the Aviation Cadet Training Program, where his military flight instructor happened to be the very same person who taught him to fly in 1939. Due to his previous flying experience, Carr was placed in an accelerated training program, flying the P-40 Warhawk at Spence Field, Georgia. Acquiring over 240 flight hours, Carr was promoted to flight officer on August 30, 1943. Carr deployed to Europe in February 1944, where he was assigned to the 380th Fighter Squadron, 363rd Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force, at RAF Rivenhall in Essex, England. The 363rd was one of the first units to adopt the P-51 Mustang. Carr had never flown above 10,000 feet, but when he took the P-51 to an altitude of 30,000 feet, he was duly impressed and named his plane \\"Angel's Playmate.\\" === Ace status === On March 8, 1944, Flight Officer Carr scored his squadron's first kill, however, he was not given credit for it. Carr chased a German Me109 to within a few feet off the ground, firing his guns the whole time. Only one bullet hit the enemy plane, and the pilot bailed out far too close to the ground and crashed. Carr said he scared the German pilot to death and caused him to kill himself. Upon returning to the airfield, Carr was criticized by his leaders for being \\"overaggressive.\\" In May, he was transferred to the 353rd Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group, at RAF Lashenden in Kent. Claiming a probable kill over Normandy, France, on June 14, Carr scored his first official credit on June 17, when he assisted another pilot in downing an Fw190. The next day, the squadron transferred to an airfield in France. On August 18, Carr was commissioned as a second lieutenant. On September 12, Second Lieutenant Carr's flight strafed several Junkers Ju-88 bombers on an airfield in Germany. Later in that same mission, the flight spotted over 30 Fw190s approximately 2,000 feet below them. Carr personally shot three from the sky before escorting a fellow pilot, whose aircraft was badly damaged, back to base. Carr was awarded the Silver Star for his actions that day. === Shot-down over Germany === On October 29, Carr shot down two more Me109s and claimed ace status while on a strafing mission over Germany. Four days later on November 2, Second Lieutenant Carr led his flight on another strafing mission over a German airfield in Czechoslovakia. Carr's P-51 was struck by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to bail out. He evaded capture for several days until he was physically exhausted, starving, and suffering from exposure to the elements. Carr decided it was better to surrender to the Germans rather than be captured. Carr went to a nearby enemy airfield to turn himself in when he observed a ground crew fueling and arming an Fw190 on the airstrip. Once the crew left, Carr snuck through a fence and climbed into the cockpit. He spent the night familiarizing himself with the controls of the Fw190, which were all labeled in German. At dawn, Carr started up the engine and took off from the airfield with no resistance from the enemy. When Carr reached friendly lines, Allied troops mistook the Fw190 he was flying for an enemy plane and opened fire. To avoid being hit from friendly fire, he flew just above the treetops at 350 miles per hour. After flying 200 miles, he arrived at his home airfield. Unable to deploy his landing gear and with no radio to communicate that he was friendly, Carr made a belly landing in order to avoid being shot down by his own air defenses. Carr's Fw190 was surrounded by military policemen, and he was unable to convince them he was with the 354th. However, his group commander soon arrived and recognized Carr. Carr is the only Allied pilot known to leave on a mission flying a P-51 and return in an Fw190. He was promoted to first lieutenant and then went on leave on November 15. === Further war service === On April 2, 1945, First Lieutenant Carr was leading three other aircraft on a reconnaissance mission near Schweinfurt, Germany, when he spotted 60 German fighters flying above them. Despite the enemy having an altitude advantage and outnumbering them, Carr led his flight in an attack and the pilots downed a total of 15 aircraft. Carr personally shot down two Fw190s, three Me109s and damaged a sixth fighter. This feat made Carr the last ace in a day in the European Theater during the war and he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. Carr was promoted to captain on April 9, and claimed several more aerial victories that month, claiming two final victories on April 25. Carr flew a total of 172 combat missions during the war, accumulating 14 or 15 confirmed air-to-air victories. He had several more unconfirmed victories and multiple ground kills. == Later career and life == After the war, Carr was assigned to the Acrojets as an F-80 Shooting Star pilot at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. The Acrojets, which preceded the Thunderbirds, were the United States Air Force's first jet-powered aerobatic demonstration team. Major Carr later flew the F-86 Sabre in 57 combat missions with the 336th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron during the Korean War. He then served as the commanding officer of the 336th at Misawa Air Base, Japan, from January 1955 to August 1956. On November 3, 1968, Carr was promoted to colonel, and deployed to Vietnam later that month. Colonel Carr was assigned to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. He flew the F-100 Super Sabre in 286 combat missions during the war, which mostly consisted of flying close air support bombing and strafing missions. Carr was awarded the Legion of Merit and three Distinguished Flying Crosses during his deployment before he rotated back to the United States in November 1969. Colonel Carr retired from the Air Force in 1973. Bruce W. Carr died of prostate cancer on April 25, 1998, in St. Cloud, Florida. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. == References == Category:1924 births Category:1998 deaths Category:American air force personnel of the Korean War Category:American air force personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American Korean War pilots Category:American Vietnam War pilots Category:American World War II flying aces Category:Aviators from New York (state) Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Military personnel from New York (state) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Shot-down aviators Category:United States Air Force colonels Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II ","title":"Bruce W.

After winning his only race as a juvenile in 2017 he developed into a top-class performer in the following spring, finishing second in the Prix La Force and winning the Prix Greffulhe before recording his biggest victory in the Prix du Jockey Club. He never won again but ran second in both the Prix Ganay and Prix d'Ispahan as a four-year-old in 2019. ==Background== Study of Man is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by his owners Flaxman Stables, a company set up to manage the racing interests of the Niarchos family. He was sent into training with Pascal Bary at Chantilly and was ridden in all of his races by St√©phane Pasquier. He was from the eighth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Study of Man's dam Second Happiness finished unplaced on her only start but was a daughter of the outstanding racehorse and broodmare Miesque. ==Racing career== ===2017: two-year-old season=== Study of Man made his first and only appearance as a two-year-old in a maiden race over 1600 metres on heavy ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 21 September. Starting at odds of 4.4/1 in a twelve-runner field he started slowly but took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won \\"cosily\\" by two lengths from the Freddy Head-trained favourite Near Gold. ===2018: three-year-old season=== For his three-year-old debut Study of Man was stepped up in class and started favourite for the Group 3 Prix La Force over 1800 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 10 April. After being restrained at the rear of the nine-runner field he made steady progress in the straight to take second place, one and a quarter lengths behind the British-trained winner Chilean. The Group 2 Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse four weeks later saw the colt start 1.1/1 favourite ahead of three rivals, namely Alhadab (runner-up in the Prix Noailles), Alounak (a Listed winner in Germany) and Assiro. Study of Man took an early lead before settling in second place behind Assiro. He regained the advantage 400 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win \\"readily\\" by three and a half lengths. The Niarchos family's racing manager Alan Cooper commented \\"Pascal Bary told me over the phone recently that Study of Man possesses a similar turn of foot to his grand-dam, Miesque, which gives us great encouragement. St√©phane Pasquier gave him a proper race because this is only his third start and, if we were going to go on to a major Group 1 next, he needed experience. I think he'll have learned from today\\". On 3 June at Chantilly Study of Man started the 4/1 second favourite behind the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Olmedo in the Group 1 Prix du Jockey Club. The other fourteen runners included Key Victory (Newmarket Stakes), Rostropovich (Futurity Stakes, Dee Stakes), Dice Roll (Prix Djebel), Hey Gaman (Washington Singer Stakes) and Intellogent (Prix de Guiche). After settling in mid- division the colt moved up to join the leaders in the straight, took a narrow lead 200 metres out and kept on well to win by half a length from the outsider Patascay, with Louis d'Or and Intellogent close behind in third and fourth. After the race Pascal Bary said \\"Ever since he arrived in the yard, he's been a fantastic horse because he understands everything. He does everything well... To train him is a dream. The horse has more of a miler's pedigree than for a mile and a half, and if we're going to go up to that trip, we had to do it progressively. He's a young horse who'd run only three times, and so you mustn't ask the impossible straight away.\\" After a break of over two months, Study of Man returned in the Group 2 Prix Guillaume d'Ornano over 2000 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 15 August. He started the 4/5 favourite but never looked likely to win as he came home third behind Knight To Behold and Patascay, beaten six lengths by the winner. One month later the colt started at odds of 8/1 for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he finished fifth of the seven runners behind Roaring Lion. Study of Man ended his season in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 7 October and started a 40/1 outsider in a nineteen-runner field. After racing in mid-division he made some progress in the straight but faded in the last 200 metres and came home ninth, four and a half lengths behind the winner Enable. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Study of Man was given a rating of 115, making him the 221st best racehorse in the world. ===2019: four-year-old season=== Study of Man began his third campaign in the Prix Ganay over 2100 metres at Longchamp on 28 April in which he ran second to Waldgeist with Ghaiyyath, Soleil Marin (Prix Exbury) and Intellogent finishing behind. At the same track on 26 May the colt went off at odds of 4/1 for the 1800 metre Prix d'Ispahan in a nine-runner field. After being restrained in the early stages he kept on well in the straight to take second place, three quarters of a length behind the winner Zabeel Prince. In the Prix Messidor over 1600 metres at Deauville on 21 July Study of Man started the 1.3/1 favourite but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Impulsif and Trais Fluors. At the same track three weeks later the colt started second favourite for the Prix Jacques Le Marois but never looked likely to win and came home sixth of the eight runners behind Romanised. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Study of Man was given a rating of 115, making him the 201st best racehorse in the world. ==Stud Record== At the end of his racing career Study of Man was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Lanwades Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk. ==Pedigree== *Through his dam, Study of Man was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:2015 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 20 ","title":"Study of Man"},{"id":"63877838","text":"Fernando Castro Cervantes Mixed Wildlife Refuge (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Central Conservation Area, it was created in 1994 by decree 22848-MIRENEM. == References == Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Costa Rica ","title":"Fernando Castro Cervantes Mixed Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"63877848","text":"The Vespa-Caproni armored car was an Italian military vehicle, designed by the aircraft manufacturer Caproni.

The initial idea was to equip the Italian army with an armored vehicle that is small, light, agile and fast. == Characteristics == The Vespa-Caproni was able to accommodate two crew. Its most striking characteristic was the position of the wheels, which were arranged in rhombus or lozenge configuration: one front and one rear wheel (like a motorcycle), and two central wheels, placed on the sides of the hull; basically a 1x2x1 configuration. This gave the vehicle a particularly small turning radius, useful for an armored car intended primarily for rapid exploration and reconnaissance. Vespa-Caproni had an 8 cylinders Lancia Astura 82 Horsepower engine, which could reach speeds of 86 km/h with operational range of 200 km on road.

The accident is considered one of the deadliest and worst traffic collisions in the history of the state of Tennessee. The accident led to outcry from politicians and citizens calling for traffic safety and infrastructure improvements, such as highway widenings, and the completion of Interstate 81 in Tennessee. ==Incident== Remains of Greyhound bus Around 4:45 a.m, the double-decker bus operated by Greyhound departed from Knoxville en route to Roanoke, Virginia. The bus had traveled eastward along US-11W for 42.4 miles in 50 minutes, averaging a speed of 50 miles per hour. The tractor-trailer had departed at 8:53 a.m. on the previous day from a manufacturing facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, en route to Memphis. The tractor-trailer had driven 517 miles west in a period of 20.5 hours before reaching the site of the accident. The Greyhound bus had approached the site tailing a slow-moving car in the eastbound lane around 5:35 a.m. The bus then attempted to pass the automobile by crossing into the oncoming westbound lane, into the path of the tractor-trailer. The two vehicles then collided head-on at a combined speed of 100 miles per hour, killing the truck driver, bus driver, and 12 of the bus's passengers instantly. ==Investigation== Diagram of crash scene The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation on the crash in 1973 and completed a 38 page report on the collision. This report was then issued to the public in February 1974. The NTSB concluded that the probable cause of the collision was the Greyhound bus driver's attempt to pass the automobile with the view of the westbound semi- truck being obstructed. The driver also failed to avoid the truck for unknown reasons. The lack of restraints for passengers of the bus contributed to several fatalities of those on-board by ejection from the bus. ==Aftermath== Led by the widow of one of the passengers aboard the bus, survivors of the crash and other family members of the victims filed a federal lawsuit against Greyhound for 2.5 million dollars. The jury found Greyhound at fault for failing to take action for the driver of the bus, who had a history of diabetes, heart and liver disease, and several other severe medical conditions. The accident site on two-lane US-11W, as of 2020 Individuals ranging from activists, state and local politicians, engineers, and journalists considered the collision a call to action for the widening of heavily trafficked highways in the state such as U.S. 11W and the completion of then under construction Interstate 81 from Bristol to Dandridge, which paralled the route of 11W. Governor Winfield Dunn called for action to widen 11W from two to four lanes in its entirety from Kingsport to Knoxville, stating: As of the present day, U.S. Route 11W has since been widened to four lanes, except for the nearly 30 mile stretch between Blaine and Bean Station, including where the collision had occurred. It is been suggested that NIMBYism from citizens in Grainger County has played a significant role in the prevention and postponement of the highway construction. In 2020, the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) had completed the right-of-way acquisition phase of the 11W widening project between Rutledge and Bean Station, expecting to begin construction in 2021-2022. ==References== ==External links== * Official NTSB crash investigation report Bean Station, Tennessee bus crash Category:1972 disasters in the United States Category:1972 in Tennessee Category:Transportation disasters in Tennessee Category:Greyhound Lines Category:1972 road incidents Category:Tennessee articles without listas parameter Category:History of Grainger County, Tennessee ","title":"1972 Bean Station, Tennessee bus crash"},{"id":"63878241","text":"Srijana Subba () is a Nepali film actress.

It opposed state control of the economy and instead sought direct worker control over the means of production. ==History== ===Origins=== Many of its members were formerly affiliated with that state's section of Socialist Labor Party of America. The New Unionists was formed after eight members of the Minneapolis SLP resigned in protest, accusing the national SLP leadership of bureaucratic and authoritarian practices. At a Unity Conference in Ypsilanti, Michigan from 22 August through 24 August 1980, the similarly-minded League for Socialist Reconstruction fused with the New Unionist group to create the New Union Party. ===Newspaper=== Jeffrey Miller of Minneapolis was the editor of the party's newspaper, New Unionist, which was published from 1978 to 2005. Among the paper's columnists was longtime member Tom Dooley. Miller died in 2019. ===Activism=== The New Union Party, like other De Leonist groups, ran candidates for political office and organized workers outside of electoral campaigns. In the 1980s, Jeffrey Miller was the party's nominee for three elections: * 1980: Minnesota's 5th congressional district (1.4%), third place of five candidates. * 1982 United States Senate election in Minnesota, 3,300 votes (5th place of 5 candidates). * 1984 United States Senate election in Minnesota, 4,653 votes (4th place of 5 candidates). In 1999, delegates from the NUP attended an International Solidarity Conference in San Francisco organized by the local branch of the Industrial Workers of the World and Workers' Solidarity Alliance. It presented on the contributions of Daniel De Leon to socialist theory. ==Archives== The party's website is archived by the Library of Congress. Party ephemera and its publications are held at Washington State University Libraries Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections. ==References== Category:Socialist Labor Party of America Category:Political parties established in 1980 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2005 Category:Political parties in Minnesota Category:Defunct De Leonist parties in the United States Category:Organizations based in Minneapolis ","title":"New Union Party"},{"id":"63878281","text":"This article displays the rosters for the participating teams at the 1989 Tournament of the Americas played in Mexico City, Mexico from June 8 to June 18, 1989. == Group A == === === *4 √Ångel Caballero *5 Augusto Duquesne *6 Lazaro Borrell *7 No√°ngel Luaces *8 Eduardo Cabrera *9 Ra√∫l Dubois *10 Leonardo P√©rez *11 Adalberto Rodr√≠guez *12 Luciano Rivero *13 Daniel Scott *14 Roberto Sim√≥n *15 Andr√©s Guibert :*Head coach: Carmelo Ortega === === *4 Felipe Payano *5 V√≠ctor Hansen *6 Evaristo P√©rez Carri√≥n *7 Jos√© Mercedes *8 Jos√© Vargas *9 Jos√© Dom√≠nguez *10 M√°ximo Tapia *11 Vinicio Mu√±oz *12 Hugo Cabrera *13 Jos√© Molina *14 H√©ctor Gil *15 Pedro Leandro Rodr√≠guez :*Head coach: Leandro de la Cruz === === *4 Antonio Reyes *5 Juan Espinoza *6 Julio Gallardo *7 Roberto Gonz√°lez *8 Enrique Gonz√°lez *9 Rafael Willis *10 Luis L√≥pez *11 Enrique Ortega *12 Arturo S√°nchez *13 Jos√© Luis Arroyos *14 Rafael Holgu√≠n *15 Norberto Mena :*Head coach: Gustavo Saggiante === === *4 Tito Malcolm *5 Enrique Grenald *6 Gilberto Watson *7 Reinaldo Cousin *8 Anthony Fiss *9 Javier Clifford *10 Mario G√°lvez *11 Iv√°n Ja√©n *12 Edgar Mac√≠as *13 Fernando Pinillo *14 Leroy Jackson *15 Amado Mart√≠nez :*Head coach: Reginaldo Grenald === === *4 Rafael Hern√°ndez *5 Federico L√≥pez *6 Raymond Gause *7 F√©lix Rivera *8 Jerome Mincy *9 James Carter *10 Pablo Alicea *11 Edwin Pellot *12 Mario Morales *13 Orlando Marrero *14 Francisco de Le√≥n *15 Ram√≥n Ramos :*Head coach: Raymond Dalmau === === *4 Elliot Perry *5 Rodney Monroe *6 Jason Matthews *7 Gary Payton *8 Chris Corchiani *9 Greg Dennis *10 Lionel Simmons *11 Antonio Davis *12 Matt Bullard *13 Billy Owens *14 Christian Laettner *15 Doug Smith :*Head coach: Bobby Cremins == Group B == === === *4 Andr√©s Santamar√≠a *5 Marcelo Richotti *6 Diego Maggi *7 Carlos Cerutti *8 Julio Rodr√≠guez *9 Marcelo Milanesio *10 Luis Gonz√°lez *11 Miguel Cortijo *12 Sebasti√°n Uranga *13 Carlos Romano *14 Diego Osella *15 Rub√©n Scolari :*Head coach: Alberto Finguer === === *4 Paul√£o Berger *5 Maury *6 Gerson *7 Pipoka *8 Evandro *9 Cadum *10 Guerrinha *11 Marcel *12 Luiz Felipe *13 Paul√£o Silva *14 Oscar *15 Israel :*Head coach: H√©lio Rubens Garcia === === *4 Rob Samuels *5 David Turcotte *6 Eli Pasquale *7 Spencer McKay *8 Alan Kristmanson *9 Tony Simms *10 Stewart Granger *11 Leo Rautins *12 Phil Ohl *13 Cord Clemens *14 John Karpis *15 Gerald Kazanowski :*Head coach: Ken Shields === === *4 Eduardo Chong-Qui *5 Tom√°s Caicedo *6 Jos√© Saltos *7 Demetrio Vernaza *8 Roland Ponce *9 Armando Rubio *10 Enguels Tenorio *11 Carlos Carrera *12 Ayub S√°nchez *13 Jeff Escalante *14 Hugo Angulo *15 Jos√© Obando :*Head coach: Gonzalo Troya === === *4 Hugo Gonz√°lez *5 V√≠ctor Ljubetic *6 √Ångel Vega *7 Gerardo Koppman *8 Luis Ocampos *9 Luis Dose *10 Santiago Ochipinti *11 Est√©ban Cabrera *12 Luis Schmeda *13 Jorge Cristaldo *14 Santiago Maciel *15 Arnoldo Penskofer :*Head coach: Carlos Mar√≠a Ljubetic === === *4 David D√≠az *5 C√©sar Portillo *6 Felice Parisi *7 Armando Becker *8 Rostyn Gonz√°lez *9 Jos√© Echenique *10 Sam Shepherd *11 Carl Herrera *12 Luis Sosa *13 Gabriel Estaba *14 Iv√°n Olivares *15 Armando Palacios :*Head coach: Jes√∫s Cordovez == Bibliography == * == External links == *1989 FIBA Americas Champioship for Men at fiba.com Category:FIBA AmeriCup squads ","title":"1989 Tournament of the Americas squads"},{"id":"63878315","text":"Tapiria Wildlife Refuge (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Central Conservation Area, it was created in 2011 by decree 36681-MINAET. == References == Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Costa Rica ","title":"Tapiria Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"63878364","text":"Joseph-Fran√ßois-Gabriel Hennequin (Gerb√©viller, 1775 ‚Äì Paris, 1842) was a French writer. == Biography == Born to a lawyer at the Parliament of Nancy, and cousin to lawyer Antoine-Louis-Marie Hennequin, Hennequin joined the French Navy as a boy in 1793, and rose to become an officer in charge of logistics.

It was released as a promotional product for the later-published Euro Truck Simulator 2 on 8 June 2012. ==Gameplay== A screenshot from the Scania PRT-range's cockpit. The game allows players to drive a licensed Scania PRT-range heavy-duty truck under five different game modes. The Driver License mode features various driving trials such as parking and manoeuvring with a standard trailer, which allows players to enhance their basic truck-driving skills. The Competition mode highly simulated Scania's Young European Truck Driver championship, where players can virtually participate in the competition by levels. The Dangerous Drives mode offers multiple scenarios to test players' abilities to drive a truck, ranging from driving through cliffs to reversing free of parking lots with a trailer. The Freeform Driving mode provides players with two sizable maps ‚Äî one is the Scania proving grounds of S√∂dert√§lje, the other is a fictional European city ‚Äî both allowing players to enjoy ETS-2-liked deliver journeys. Time Reaction Test mode is designed to test players' reactions when they are in emergencies in four different scenarios. The game also contains several video clips and photos featuring with the success of Scania in all kinds of fields. ==Development and release== The game was revealed in April 2012 via the blog of the game developer SCS Software. The game was developed by their in-house game engine Prism3D and holds the official license of Scania's Young European Truck Driver championship, allowing players to drive a highly detailed Scania PRT-range heavy-duty truck. It was published to Europe by Excalibur Publishing on 8 June 2012, and later available on Steam after being greenlit. ==Reception== Dustin Thomas of GamingShogun praised both graphics and sound of the game, but criticised the game's difficulty.

The Platform publishes articles about topical and historical political events and developments from a Marxist point of view. On top of that, the Platform organises reading groups and seminars on various subjects, and it translates marxist works to the Dutch language. Finally, the Platform intervenes in the Dutch labour movement, for example by publishing voting recommendations for congresses and leadership elections within the Dutch Socialist Party. == Ideology == The Communist Platform labels itself as generally Marxist. The Platform sees the labour movement as an arena for ideological struggle in which communists should fight for a marxist program. Because of this, the members of the Platform are active within the Socialist Party, the trade union, protest movements and other workers‚Äô organisations. The Platform focuses primarily on influencing the SP through voting recommendations and writing articles to intervene in the internal party debates. On top of that, the Platform has written and proposes an alternative, marxist, program for the SP. This program, named A Compass for the SP, according to the Communist Platform, is a return to the ‚Äòfundamental struggle against capitalism‚Äô as it was described in earlier SP programs. The program calls amongst other things for the establishment of a democratic republic, workers‚Äô militias, an elected judicial system and the nationalisation of the economy and healthcare. Ideologically, the Communist Platform is inspired by the party movements of the marxist parties of the 19th and early 20th century. Karl Kautsky is often heralded for his role in the forging of the SPD party movement and his influence on the Russian October Revolution. Kautsky is also heavily criticised by the Platform for his later role in the rightward turn of the SPD and his support for social democracy against marxism after the split in the Second International. Democratisation of the labour movement is a spearhead of the Communist Platform. It sees democratisation as a precondition for a healthy labour movement and a truly communist society. For this reason, the Communist Platform puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of organised discussion and debate. They engage in polemics with other left-wing organisations to advance the movement as a whole ideologically through the clashing of ideas. The organisation sees internationalism as a precondition for a viable alternative to capitalism. More concretely, it puts a lot of emphasis on a pan-European political approach and takes up calls for Communist Party of the European Union and a Democratic Republic of Europe. == International == The Communist Platform has ties with the Communist Party of Great-Britain (PCC). This is a successor to the disintegrated Communist Party of Great Britain. Members of the Communist Platform have visited the summer school of the CPGB (PCC) in the past. == External link == Website of the Dutch Communist Platform == References == Category:Netherlands Category:Communist parties in the Netherlands Category:Communist organizations Category:Communist organizations in Europe Communist Platform (Netherlands) ","title":"Communist Platform (Netherlands)"},{"id":"63878627","text":"Independence Lake is a natural glacial lake in California, in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The lake, which sits at an elevation of in the upper reaches of the Truckee River basin, has been less affected by development than most other lakes in the area. The Nature Conservancy owns a parcel of land around the lake, which it manages privately as the Independence Lake Preserve with an aim toward conservation and low-impact recreation. ==Geography== Independence Lake sits in a narrow glacial valley immediately to the east of the Sierra crest. Mount Lola, the highest peak in the area, rises from the valley's northern ridge about a mile west of the lake's west end. Carpenter Ridge rises steeply from the lake's south shore, and continues further to the southwest where it reaches its highest point. Upper Independence Creek flows into the lake on its west side through a lush subalpine meadow. The lake's outlet on its east end forms Independence Creek, a tributary of the Little Truckee River and thence the Truckee River. The lake is long and half a mile (0.8 km) wide. The nearest major town is Truckee, to the south by road. The much smaller town of Sierraville is to the north by road. ==Geology== Independence Lake lies in a deep glacial valley that was carved by a former glacier on Mount Lola's eastern slope. ==Ecology== Independence Lake is a crucial habitat for the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. Independence Lake is home to one of only two remaining wild, self-sustaining populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi). This trout is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. It has been extirpated from almost the entirety of its historic range. Other fish species that inhabit the lake include the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni). Independence Lake is unique among the lakes of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada in that it still retains all its native species of fish. The lake's dam keeps out invasive species that might otherwise enter the lake from downstream, thus protecting its native fish populations. A \\"relatively pristine\\" ecosystem surrounds the lake, comprising a number of vegetation types characteristic of the Sierra Nevada upper montane forest. The surrounding forests are dominated by conifers such as the white fir and Jeffrey pine, joined by red fir in the higher elevations. Scattered stands of aspen dot the forest, but are threatened by encroachment from conifers, whose thick foliage impedes on the wide sun exposure that the aspens need in order to thrive. It is thought that the past century of fire suppression has altered the equilibrium of these forests, allowing the white fir to proliferate at the expense of the aspen and the Jeffrey pine. ==History== Independence Lake sits within the traditional territory of the Washoe people, who believed it to be bottomless. They have used the lake for approximately 9,000 years. In the middle of the 19th century the lake became of interest to Europeans for the first time. Sources disagree on who named the lake, and in what year, but agree that it was named on Independence Day. It is most commonly believed that Lola Montez named the lake on a trip to the area in 1853. Montez, a former mistress of King Ludwig of Bavaria, was forced into exile by the revolutions of 1848 in Europe. Montez began traveling the world, and she became well-known as an actress, dancer, and entertainer. Upon arrival in California in early 1853, Montez made herself a home in the town of Grass Valley, where she became a well-known local personality. Mount Lola, a mile west of the lake, is also named for Montez. Augustus Moore, who built an early stage station at the lake, is the other claimant; he said that he named the lake in 1862. In 1879, the lake was dammed for the first time. A wildfire in 1945 burned much of the forested terrain around the lake. After the subsequent logging operations, a new dam was built, increasing the lake's water capacity. In 1947, Sierra Pacific Power Company, now a subsidiary of NV Energy, bought the land around Independence Lake, and closed the area to most public access. In the 1970s, Independence Lake became the latest focus of Disney's long-held aspirations of building a family-oriented ski resort and mountain village in the Sierra Nevada. For years the company had been working on a proposal to develop the Mineral King valley in the southern Sierra, but this plan was facing increasingly long odds due to legal issues and environmentalist opposition. In 1971 the Forest Service recommended Independence Lake as a potentially promising alternative location for such a development. In 1974, Disney partnered with Sierra Pacific to plan and develop a resort at Independence Lake, and in 1975 the companies began working with the Forest Service on a land-swap plan. The project received a mixed reception from local residents. At a public meeting where Disney was to present its plans, protesters picketed the entrance with signs bearing slogans such as \\"Don't Mickey Mouse Sierra County\\". Later that year, with local opposition growing, the county's Conservation Club, which had previously taken a neutral stance on the project, appealed to the Sierra Club for assistance. Opponents of the project cited environmental concerns and fears that the remote rural area's limited facilities would be overwhelmed by the sudden population boom they anticipated would result from the development. They also cited the impact such a population increase would have on the rural, small-town character of the area's communities. In 1978, citizens of Nevada County, Placer County, and Sierra County formed a joint environmental organization to monitor the project. Later in 1978, amidst mounting opposition from local residents and environmental groups, Disney withdrew its applications and abandoned its aspirations at Independence Lake. The United States Congress passed a bill in 2008 directing the Secretary of the Interior to allocate $9 million for \\"acquisition of the land surrounding Independence Lake\\" and \\"protection of the native fishery and water quality of Independence Lake as determined by [a nonprofit conservation organization acting in consultation with the Truckee Meadows Water Authority]\\". In April 2010, The Nature Conservancy purchased the property from Sierra Pacific to establish the Independence Lake Preserve. ==Conservation and management== The Nature Conservancy permits year-round, walk-in day-use access to the lake and its surrounding preserve. However, the road to the lake is not plowed, and due to the area's prodigious winter snowfall it is impassable for much of the winter and spring. To protect the lake from invasive species, all outside boats and watercraft are prohibited at the lake, even non-motorized watercraft such as kayaks and canoes. During the summer season, free kayaks, pontoon float tubes, and small motorboats are available to the public; the motorboats are only available on alternate weeks. The Truckee Meadows Water Authority holds the rights to the lake's surface water. The authority manages the uppermost of the lake's water, controlled by the dam, as part of the Truckee River Project, which supplies municipal water to the Reno-Sparks area. ==Legends== Many visitors to the lake have claimed to see a ghost, wearing a plaid shirt, in the window of a long abandoned boarded- up resort building beside the lake. Caretakers say that they take the reports seriously due to the number of people who have reported such sightings. There are two common theories for the identity of the ghost. In the 1940s, a photographer drowned in the lake, and in 1950, a pilot crashed in the steep valley. Neither body has ever been found. ==References== Category:Mountain lakes Category:Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Lakes of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Lakes of the Great Basin Category:Lakes of Nevada County, California Category:Lakes of Sierra County, California Category:Lakes of California ","title":"Independence Lake (California)"},{"id":"63878648","text":"Suo Lin, or Suo Chen, courtesy name Juxiu, was a military general of the Jin Dynasty (266-420).

The Khoai Mela has now become a part of the culture of the Bengali people and has been taking place for over 20 years. It takes place every Saturday on the bank of the Khoai or Kopai River. The Mela is named after this Khoai region and River. This Mela is also called Shanibarer haat (Saturday fair) due to its opening day. == Description == ===Khoai Region=== The word khoy in Bengali means erosion. This khoai region is a geographical formation of small canyons resulting from constant erosion caused by wind and water. This place is characterized by the Shyambati canal on one side and a Sonajhuri tree forest growing in red laterite soil on the other side. Khoai is surrounded by the famous meandering khoai river or Kopai River. The name is reflective of the characteristics of the region. The name Khoai Mela indicates that this Mela was set up by local artisans on Saturday in the Khoai region on the bank of the Khoai river. This Mela is also called Shanibarer haat (Saturday fair) due to the opening day.

It can also take place on Sunday morning. The Khoai Mela on Saturday is called full haat and on Sunday is called bhaya haat. ===Type of shop stalls=== An open-air stall and a buyer at Khoai Mela Khoai Mela is an open-air Mela, without any covered stalls, on the red ground. The Mela is fully surrounded by Sal, Sagoon, and Eucalyptus trees. Most of the shop owners are women. ===Types of Khoai Mela=== There are multiple Mela committees in different parts of the Khoai region. These are named according to the part of the forest where the Mela is situated, for example: Annya Haat and Sonajhuri Hat These Mela together make Khoai Mela. ===Location === The Khoai Mela is located about 180 km from Kolkata and about 1.5 km from Santiniketan. The nearest railway station is Prantik railway station. Shonajhari trees at Shantiniketan,Birbhum There are several scenic points of interest, with the sonajhuri trees and red soil being the most famous. Sonajhuri literally means droplets of gold, because during the winter season the sonajhuri trees shed their tiny yellow flowers and the whole forest seems to have a downpour of gold. The Bonerpukur Adivasi village is populated by Santhali tribes and the village is dotted with beautiful mud. These houses have walls decorated with tribal paintings and murals depicting daily life. ==Cultural significance== === Literature === At the time of the Poet Rabindranath Tagore the Khoai Mela had not started, but he wrote many poems and songs based on the unique look of the Sonajhuri forest and Khoai river. The knee-deep water poem (Amader choto nodiSahaj Path by Rabindranath Tagore) is one of them. A little well-known novel Hansuli Banker Upakatha (Story of the Sickle-shaped Curve) by Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay was also inspired by the Khoai river. === Art, Music and Songs === The Khoai Mela originally started to explore the art, music, and songs of local peoples and santhali tribes on a larger scale. The main attractions of Khoai Mela are affordable handmade artifacts, such as embroidered scarves, blouses, salwar kamiz, kurta, shirts, different kinds of bags and purses, handicrafts, necklaces, earrings, wall hangings, etc. The local Baul singers present traditional folk music and songs by stringing their ektaras.

It was integrated into Toronto's Fire Services as Station 30. It was sold to the Toronto Firefighter's Association. The Association moved, and sold the building in 2015. The building is on the city's list of heritage structures. By the 2010s industrial enterprises had largely moved from the Portlands, which were often described as the largest parcel of underdeveloped downtown real estate in North America. A plan was developed, and approved, to redevelop the northwest corner of the parcel, building offices and residential buildings on a new artificial island carved out of the existing land. The new Island, Villiers Island, is being raised an additional 2 meters, through landfill, to reduce vulnerability to the rare 100-year or 1000-year flood. However special steps were to be taken to preserve building with inherent cultural heritage. The fire hall is to be moved south, and raised . The building was designed by J.J. Woolnough in the Edwardian Classicism style. In May 2016 Derek Flack, writing in Blog TO, characterized the building as the coolest lease then available in Toronto. In 2019 the building's tenant was a dog-walking agency. The city had been in negotiations with the tenant, and the landlord, to buy the building. But when delays in the purchase seemed to risk delaying the redevelopment of the area the city's acting director of real estate services recommended council consider expropriation. Following the redevelopment the city plans to house public washrooms in the building. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Historic buildings and structures in Canada Category:Waterfront Toronto ","title":"39 Commissioner Street"},{"id":"63878891","text":"The 1913‚Äì14 Bradford City A.F.C. season was the 11th in the club's history.

Examining colonial morphology is the first step in the identification of an unknown microbe. The systematic assessment of the colonies' appearance, focusing on aspects like size, shape, colour, opacity, and consistency, provides clues to the identity of the organism, allowing microbiologists to select appropriate tests to provide a definitive identification. ==Procedure== Some terms used to describe colonial morphology When a specimen arrives in the microbiology laboratory, it is inoculated into an agar plate and placed in an incubator to encourage microbial growth. Because the appearance of microbial colonies changes as they grow, colonial morphology is examined at a specific time after the plate is inoculated. Usually, the plate is read at 18‚Äì24 hours post- inoculation, but times may differ for slower-growing organisms like fungi. The microbiologist examines the appearance of the colony, noting specific features such as size, colour, shape, consistency, and opacity. A hand lens or magnifying glass may be used to view colonies in greater detail. The opacity of a microbial colony can be described as transparent, translucent, or opaque. Staphylococci are usually opaque, while many Streptococcus species are translucent. The overall shape of the colony may be characterized as circular, irregular, or punctiform (like pinpoints). The vertical growth or elevation of the colony, another identifying characteristic, is assessed by tilting the agar plate to the side and is denoted as flat, raised, convex, pulvinate (very convex), umbilicate (having a depression in the centre) or umbonate (having a bump in the centre). The edge of the colony may be separately described using terms like smooth, rough, irregular and filamentous. Bacillus anthracis is notable for its filamentous appearance, which is sometimes described as resembling Medusa's head. Consistency is examined by physically manipulating the colony with a sterile instrument. It is described using terms like brittle, creamy, sticky and dry. Staphylococci are considered to have a creamy consistency, while some Neisseria species are sticky, and colonies of diphtheroid bacteria and beta-hemolytic streptococci are typically dry. Bacteria that produce capsules often have a slimy (mucoid) consistency. When certain microorganisms are grown on blood agar, they may digest the blood in the medium, causing visible hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) on the agar plate. In colonial morphology, hemolysis is classified into three types: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolysis. In alpha-hemolysis, the blood is partially digested, causing the area around the colony to turn green. In beta-hemolysis, the organism digests the blood completely, leaving a clear area around each colony. Organisms that do not produce hemolysis are referred to as gamma- hemolytic. Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene, is noteworthy for producing a \\"double zone\\" of both complete and incomplete hemolysis. The odour of a culture is sometimes considered part of colonial morphology. While intentionally smelling microbial cultures is not advised, some organisms produce distinctive odours that can be detected during routine examination of the culture. Among these are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a grape-like scent; Staphylococcus aureus, which is said to smell like old socks; and Proteus mirabilis, whose scent is alternately described as putrid or like chocolate cake. Other distinctive features of colonial morphology include motility and the production of pigments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the pigments pyocyanin and pyoverdin, which give the colonies a greenish sheen. Some specimens of Serratia marcescens produce an orange-red pigment called prodigiosin. Organisms with swarming motility, like Proteus species, exhibit concentric waves of growth extending from the inoculation point. ==Interpretation== Colonial morphology serves as the first step in the identification of microbial species from clinical samples. Based on the visual appearance of the colonies, microbiologists can narrow down the list of possible organisms, allowing them to select appropriate tests to provide a definitive diagnosis. For example, if a microbiologist observes colonies that resemble a Staphylococcus species, they may perform a catalase test to confirm that it belongs to the genus Staphylococcus, and a coagulase test to determine whether it is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus or a more pathogenic species, such as S. aureus. Observation of hemolysis is useful in the presumptive identification of bacteria, especially streptococci, which are classified on the basis of their hemolytic reactions. For example, Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes strep throat and scarlet fever, displays beta-hemolysis, while Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause pneumonia and meningitis, displays alpha-hemolysis. The highly pathogenic S. aureus classically displays beta-hemolysis, while Staphylococcus epidermidis, part of the normal skin flora and an occasional opportunistic pathogen, does so weakly or not at all. Although automated techniques like MALDI-TOF are increasingly used to identify microorganisms in clinical laboratories, colonial morphology remains useful to distinguish potential pathogens, which must be identified, from normal flora, for which definitive identification is unnecessary, and to confirm identification when automated techniques give inconclusive results. ==References== ==External links== *Colony Morphology Image Gallery at the American Society for Microbiology Category:Microbiology techniques Category:Microbiology terms ","title":"Colonial morphology"},{"id":"63879018","text":"Urs F√§h (born 15 April 1964) is a Swiss equestrian.

In this crisis situation, May 24 (June 6), 1915, General Manikovsky was appointed head of the GAU: \\"Sukhomlinov was replaced by liberal Polivanov and honest Shuvaev, and Sergei, although a great prince, was replaced by such a glorious Russian man as Manikovsky.\\" \\\\- Ignatiev A.A.

He proved himself an energetic leader, was able to establish the production of ammunition and by 1917 fully satisfy the needs of the front. Under him, both the existing military production expanded - arms, artillery, shell, powder - and the construction of new plants began. Qualified artillery specialists were recalled from the front, who joined in the work under the leadership of Manikovsky. The GAU activity contributed to the fact that in 1917 the Russian military command was able to plan a large-scale offensive, which did not take place due to the collapse of the army that began after the February Revolution.–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º –ø–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤—É. –°–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω –ø–æ 1-–µ —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 1903 –≥. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1903, —Å. 999 One of the employees of Manikovsky, an outstanding gunsmith V.G.

He believed that priority should be given to state-owned factories in the distribution of military orders and sharply criticized the overpricing and poor quality of products of private producers, focused on superprofits. In this regard, the industrialists insisted on the resignation of Manikovsky and almost achieved their goal. In March 1916, the Minister of War agreed to transfer the general back to the post of commandant of the Kronstadt fortress (after which Manikovsky asked to send him to the army). However, the possibility of disrupting the supply of the army with ammunition in the event of the departure of the competent chief of the GAU forced the military leadership to leave Manikovsky at his post.–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∞–º –ø–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤—É. –ß–∞—Å—Ç—å I, II –∏ III. –°–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω –ø–æ 4-–µ –∏—é–ª—è 1907 –≥–æ–¥–∞. ‚Äî , 1907. —Å. 801 After this, conflicts with industrialists continued - the general insisted on the obligatory fulfillment of state orders by the private industry. He proposed the creation of ‚Äúmilitary production cells‚Äù in all private plants under the control of the GAU. According to Manikovsky, strong state-owned enterprises should dominate industry during the war, and in peacetime - to serve as a price regulator and the vanguard of technological progress. At the same time, Manikovsky also allowed the active development of private enterprise, but within the general framework of state-monopoly capitalism. ===Russian revolution=== He was close to part of the Duma opposition, one of the leaders of which, N. V. Nekrasov, during the February Revolution, read Manikovsky to the role of military dictator. Since March 6, 1917 - Assistant Secretary of War. He temporarily managed the Ministry of War after the resignation of A.I. Guchkov (late April - early May 1917) and after serving on leave - the actual resignation - A.I. Verkhovsky (October 1917). October 25, 1917 was arrested in the Winter Palace along with the ministers of the Provisional Government. At the end of October he was released and took over the technical leadership of the military department under the Bolshevik government. He tried to preserve the remnants of the fighting capacity of the army, opposed the election of commanders, in connection with which he was accused of disloyalty and was arrested again on November 20, 1917 (together with the chief of the General Staff V.V.

In 1907 when the Philippine Assembly was established, the province had no representation as it then included parts of non-Christian tribelands. Since 1916 when it was re- established as a specially organized province separate from its former Comandancia de Quia√±gan which became the Ifugao sub-province under Jones Law, Nueva Vizcaya has been entitled to one member in the House of Representatives. It remains as a single-member district, except for a brief period between 1943 and 1944 when a second seat was allocated in the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic.

After elementary school he attended a Humanistisches Gymnasium in Cologne, then in 1905 he went to study music at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Tanz K√∂ln there. Among others, he was student of Max van de Sandt, Lazzaro Uzielli, Fritz Steinbach, Ewald Strae√üer and Waldemar von Bau√ünern. At the same time he studied German literature and philosophy at the University of Bonn. In 1908 he moved to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater M√ºnchen and studied musicology among others with Adolf Sandberger and Theodor Kroyer. He also became a member of the .Verband Alter SVer (VASV): Anschriftenbuch und Vademecum. Ludwigshafen am Rhein 1959, . Kaul obtained his doctorate there in 1911 with a dissertation on The vocal works of Antonio Rosetti. A one-year teaching position at the Krefeld Conservatory was followed in 1912 by a call to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik W√ºrzburg. Ten years later he was habilitated with a thesis on the History of the W√ºrzburger Hofmusik im 18 Jahrhundert. In the summer he finally gave lectures - for the first time in the history of the W√ºrzburg Music School - on historical musicology. Kaul strove to expand musicology and achieved this goal: in 1928 he was appointed extraordinary professor. In the Third Reich the topic became more important for ideological reasons. In 1941, at Kaul's insistence, a regular musicological seminar was approved and established by the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture in W√ºrzburg for the first Academic quarter; he himself was appointed to the seminar board.

Transit has variously used passenger trains, horsecars, streetcars, interurbans, trolley coaches, and buses. Current service is through the Central Ohio Transit Authority's bus system, numerous intercity bus companies, and through bikeshare, rideshare, and electric scooter services. Public transit began in Columbus with Union Station, built in 1851. The station was jointly operated by the Columbus and Xenia Railroad and the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, making it the first union station in the world. Local mass transit efforts began three years later, in 1854, with the founding of the Columbus Street Railroad Company. It only began operating in 1863, utilizing a fleet of horsecars (horse-drawn streetcars). Electric streetcars began operation in the city in 1888. Meanwhile, subsequent rail stations were built in the city, including the third Union Station, completed in 1897. Streetcars and their longer-distance interurban counterparts became prolific around this time. In the 1930s, as automobiles grew in popularity and track maintenance suffered, the streetcars were all converted to trolleybuses, taking place from 1933 to 1948. Trolleybuses only operated until 1965, themselves replaced by diesel buses. With private bus operators losing profits, bus service in Columbus was transferred over to the public Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) in 1974. Intercity rail permanently stopped serving Columbus in 1977. COTA operated traditional local bus service until the 2010s, when it began modernizing its fleet with compressed natural gas-fueled buses, redeveloped its route network, and added a downtown circulator, bus rapid transit line, wifi connectivity, contactless payments, and other modern amenities. Resuming local or intercity rail has been proposed since the 1970s, though no legislation has been approved for it. Columbus is now the largest city in the United States without any form of passenger rail service. ==Historical services== ===Intercity rail=== Public transit began in Columbus with the creation of its first train station, the first Union Station. The station was located in Downtown Columbus, Ohio, near The Short North neighborhood. Union Station and its predecessors served railroad passengers in Columbus from 1851 until April 28, 1977. The first station building was the first union station in the world, built in 1851. It was twelve years before any local mass transit was developed in the city. Its replacement was built from 1873 to 1875, just before demolition of the first station building. After traffic problems on High Street, as well as increased rail traffic became problematic, a new station was planned by Daniel Burnham beginning in 1893. The new station opened in 1897, and its arcade along High Street was finished in 1899. By 1928, part of the arcade was demolished. Passenger service significantly declined from the 1950s to the 1970s. The arcade was demolished in 1976 to make way for a new convention center, although it had been placed on the National Register of Historic Places two years prior. Train service stopped at Union Station in 1977, and the remaining portions of the station were demolished in 1979. The demolished arcade was delisted in 1999. A portion of the arcade was saved and is the focal point of the McFerson Commons park in the nearby Arena District. The Toledo and Ohio Central Railroad Station also served the city's Franklinton neighborhood, located near downtown. The station was built in 1895 and designed by Columbus architect Frank Packard. It served the city until 1930, when its services moved to Union Station. The Toledo and Ohio station is only one of two remaining train station buildings in the city. ===Mass transit=== The Columbus Interurban Terminal One of two remaining Columbus streetcars, operated 1926‚Äì1948, and now at the Ohio Railway Museum First formed in 1854, the Columbus Street Railroad Company (CSRC) was authorized by the city to build a number of lines, but nothing came about initially. Its horse-powered streetcar line first ran along High Street on June 10, 1863, in the midst of the Civil War. The initial line ran for from Union Station to Mound Street. When traffic dropped off after the war, the Columbus Street Railroad Company faced financial difficulties, but started making a profit by 1868. Following the stabilization of the High Street line, the Friend Street Railroad Company was created in the same year, first reaching East Public Lane (now Parsons Avenue) and eventually reaching the Fairgrounds (now Franklin Park). Subsequently, the North Columbus Railroad Company, East Park Place Street Railroad Company, State and Oak Street Railroad Company, and the Glenwood & Green Lawn Railroad Company were formed. The horse powered cars were slow, but made it possible to travel to locations within the city that were beyond a comfortable walking distance. Mergers were frequent, and the Columbus Railroad Company (formerly CSRC) merged with the Friend Street Railroad Company and the East Park Place Railroad Company. The new venture was known as the Columbus Consolidated Street Railroad Company. The State and Oak Street lines were bought by the new company in the following years. It was also during this era that long distance rail travel became quite popular. The High Street line faced delays of up to seven hours per day due to the level crossing of 10 heavy rail tracks across High Street at Union Station. To remedy the problem, subway tunnels were built under the tracks. They were dark, and the smell from the horse droppings made the trip unpleasant. From the period of 1863‚Äì1892, more than a dozen horsecar companies set up shop in the city, and total trackage was expanded to prior to electrification. In 1888, the first electric powered streetcar ran on Chittenden Avenue from High Street to the current site of the Ohio State Fair. However, it was not successful initially. The first line with successful electrification was the Glenwood & Green Lawn Street Railroad (with trackage mainly along Broad Street), which was completed in August 1890. The High Street, Long Street, and Mount Vernon Avenue lines were electrified in the following year. The advantages in speed and cleanliness quickly made equestrian power obsolete, and the last horse drawn car ran in 1892. Also in that year, yet another naming change came with the sale of the Columbus Consolidated Street Railroad Company to the newly formed \\"Columbus Street Railway Company\\" for $3,000,000. At this time, the Glenwood & Green Lawn line was acquired. In 1895, the Columbus Railway, Power and Light Company purchased an amusement park that would be known as Olentangy Park. It was located on the southern end of Clintonville. The idea behind the purchase was to increase ridership on the line during non-peak hours by providing an attractive destination at the terminus. Likewise, other transit companies built Indianola Park on North Fourth Street and Minerva Park in the village of the same name. Notable streetcar strikes took place in 1890 and 1892. Electric power ushered in the golden age of street traction in Columbus. In 1899, the subway tunnels were replaced with a bridge which ran above the heavy rail tracks. The system was so popular that Columbus Railway Power & Light experimented with a double deck streetcar in 1914. However, the delays in loading and unloading gave the bi-level design no advantage over its standard counterpart, and the cars were quickly retired. Total trackage reached by 1916, and the system carried 66,000,000 paying passengers with an additional 16,000,000 people riding on transfer tickets that year. By 1927, streetcars ran to Bexley, Gahanna, Green Lawn Cemetery, Minerva Park, Marble Cliff, Upper Arlington, Westerville, and Worthington. Most streetcar lines in Columbus used a broad gauge track which measured . Building non-standard gauge was sometimes used as a way to keep long distance passenger and freight railroads from accidentally or intentionally running their cars on city streets. However, some lines built in the late 1800s used the standard gauge width, such as the Worthington Line which ran long Summit Street, Hudson Avenue, Arcadia Avenue, and High Street. With the advent of the interurban, many sections of dual gauge track were built to allow the streetcars and interurbans to use the same route despite their different widths. ===1910 streetcar strike=== In the summer of 1910, the city experienced a large uprising. The 1910 Streetcar Strike began as peaceful protests, but led to thousands rioting throughout the city, injuring hundreds of people. Conditions for the streetcar workers were difficult. The operators worked for only 19‚Äì20 cents per hour, worked 60‚Äì65 hours per week, and work for years without a day off. These conditions led to a high turnover rate. The Columbus Railway and Light Co. paid its riders to report on irregular employee activities, and the company wouldn't require hearings before firing employees for dishonesty. In early 1910, 35 employees of the company met with manager E.K. Stewart, requesting increased wages. The company fired the entire group as a result. In March, about half of the Columbus Railway and Light Company's employees formed a local chapter of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees labor union. The union sought the reinstatement of the 35 workers, along with pay raises, better working conditions, and job stability. The streetcar company chose a hardline position, with no compromise offered. The public primarily sided with the union. The Columbus Chamber of Commerce, anticipating conflict, hosted a mandatory meeting between the union and company in June of 1910. On July 23, its hearings concluded, finding that both parties were partly at fault, and that a peaceful resolution should be found. The meeting mostly added to tensions, however, and the strike began the next day at 4 am. The union's chapter had grown to 600 members by this point. They planned to not show up for work, instead selling union buttons around the city and picketing the company's streetcar barns. The streetcar company chose to hire strikebreakers at $30 per week, over double the standard wage of $12.50. They also hired a special policing force, supplied by the local John J. Mahoney Detective Agency, to protect the streetcars and facilities. The strike ended up more serious, as crowds barricaded streetcar tracks and threw bricks and rocks into the streetcars. The company police responded with gunfire. That night, 76 people were arrested, though riots continued on the following day. Mayor George Sidney Marshall called in about 5,000 members of the Ohio National Guard. The troops kept order in the city until their departure on August 7. More rioting then took place, with shootings, barricades, stonings, and streetcars blown up with dynamite. It led to the National Guard returning, and the union and public moreso aiming for a peaceful end to the riots. Still about 3,000 to 4,000 strikers, sympathizers, or disrupters continued to riot. It led to a bad public image of the city, hurting business activity, and worrying the city planning for a state fair in September. On October 18, the union admitted defeat, and its 570 striking workers either returned to work or moved to work elsewhere in Columbus, or for Cleveland streetcar companies. ===Further history=== In 1933, a decision was made to gradually convert the system to trolley buses (trackless trams). Slowed by the effects of the Great Depression and World War II, the process took 15 years to compete. On 5 September 1948, the last two fixed rail trams ran along Neil Avenue and Main Street. A lack of investment in maintenance of the tracks, as well as the age of the automobile had slowly brought the demise of the system. The trolley buses did not last long either, being gradually replaced by diesel buses as well. The last trolley bus ran on 30 May 1965. Despite some changes over the years, many current COTA buses run the same routes as the former streetcars. Bus lines 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 13 deviate very little from the routes taken by their railed predecessors. ==Current services== ===COTA=== Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). The service operates 41 routes with a fleet of 440 buses, serving approximately 19 million passengers per year. COTA operates 23 regular fixed-service routes, 14 express services, a bus rapid transit route, a free downtown circulator, night service, an airport connector, and other services. COTA's administrative offices are located in the William J. Lhota Building in Downtown Columbus. It is managed by President and CEO Joanna Pinkerton along with a 13-member board of trustees. COTA is funded by a permanent 0.25% sales tax as well as another 10-year 0.25% sales tax. The agency was founded in 1971, replacing the private Columbus Transit Company. The Central Ohio Transit Authority began operating in 1974, and has made gradual improvements to its fleet and network. Its first bus network redesign took place in 2017. The 2010s have also seen noted service improvements, with the addition of the CBUS free downtown circulator in 2014, its AirConnect airport service in 2016, and the CMAX bus rapid transit service in 2018. ===Intercity buses=== Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines, Barons Bus Lines, Miller Transportation, GoBus, and other carriers. ===Alternative transportation=== Along with most other US cities, Columbus has several private transportation options, including ridesharing, bikeshare, and electric scooters. The city's bikeshare system is CoGo, operated by Lyft. Electric scooter companies operating in the city include Bird, Spin, and Lime.https://www.columbusunderground.com/cogo-now-offering-free-rides-for- healthcare-workers-bw1 ==Proposals== ===Former proposals=== TransCenter TransCenter was a proposed replacement for Union Station. The demolition and replacement of Union Station dates to a 1969‚Äì1975 lawsuit against the Columbus-based Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI). The institute was formed as a nonprofit and still operates as one, though its improper profit uses led to the lawsuit. As a result, BMI offered about $80 million for various causes, including $36.5 million to establish a convention center at the site of Union Station. BMI established the Battelle Commons Corporation in 1974 to handle the project.https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a121573.pdf Battelle Commons Corporation applied for grants to create a transit center as part of the convention center, including from the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) and Federal Highway Administration. The transit center project was supported by the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), Columbus's mass transit agency. The proposed hub, titled TransCenter, was to include 2,000 square feet inside the restored Union Station arcade, containing transit information, ticket offices, a bus waiting and loading area, and entranceways to transit below street-level. A new 20,000-square-foot bus facility and COTA office was to be constructed alongside the arcade. The proposed funding included $6.24 million from the UMTA for buildings and platforms, $1.05 million from the Federal Railroad Administration for restoring the arcade, and Battelle contributing $1.56 million for the building and platforms, and $450,000 for the arcade. The combined project was to cost $9.3 million. It was noted that Battelle made no effort to find funding from obvious sources including the State Historic Preservation Office, the National Endowment for the Arts, Department of the Interior, Community Development Block Grants, or General Revenue Sharing Funds. On October 19, 1976, Battelle's trustees decided to demolish the station, stating it would be an \\"imprudent use of Battelle's money\\", even though it was noted to be a small portion. The organization gave no warning to outside organizations. The State Historic Preservation was not advised, nor was COTA; COTA's executive director stated the public mistakenly blamed it for the demolition. The City of Columbus also stated it was not involved in the decision, but knew Battelle was considering it. Battelle believed the demolition would not block the pending federal funding. At 6 pm on Friday, October 22, 1976, S.G. Loewendick & Sons demolished nearly the entire arcade. By 6 pm on the next day, a temporary restraining order secured by the Ohio Historical Society halted the demolition. The order noted that improper procedures were followed in planning its demolition. Battelle then allowed the historical society 120 days to remove the remaining remnant of the demolition, a single arch left standing; Battelle offered no funds to help preserve or move the arch. COTA's director still expressed his desire for TransCenter to be built, despite the arcade's loss. Battelle published development plans with the arcade removed as soon as October 24. The arcade's demolition prompted the UMTA to withdraw all $6.24 million in funding, stating the act violated the spirit of the law and was inconsistent with UMTA requirements. Ohio Hub The Ohio Hub project, created in 2009, proposed a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to a proposed hub in Cleveland and onward to the east.Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail Retrieved July 26, 2009. As of 2018, the project remained unfunded. Columbus Streetcar The Columbus Streetcar was a proposed streetcar system to be located in and close to Downtown Columbus. Initially planned to run along High Street, the line would have run for and connected the Ohio State campus with the Franklin County Government Center. As of February 2009, the plan is indefinitely on hold. ===Current proposals=== Numerous proposals are being developed to link Columbus with other Midwest cities, and to link neighborhoods within Columbus. Transit modes being developed include intercity rail, the hyperloop, and light rail or bus rapid transit. The Pittsburgh-Columbus-Chicago corridor is one of ten selected by Virgin Hyperloop One for development of a hyperloop system. LinkUS Columbus is a new initiative announced in 2020 to create high-capacity rapid transit in Central Ohio. The initiative is a collaboration between COTA, the City of Columbus, and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. The initiative will also aim to create jobs as well as transit-oriented developments. It will begin its focus on Columbus's northwest corridor, and then to an east-west corridor consisting of Broad and Main Streets.https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200701/columbus-area-initiative-seeks- development-that-wonrsquot-bring-more-cars ==References== ==External links== * Category:Transportation in Columbus, Ohio Columbus ","title":"Public transit in Columbus, Ohio"},{"id":"63879152","text":"The Battle of Sinai or Five Days in Sinai is an Italian produced film released in Italy and Israel in 1968 under the title of \\"La Battaglia Del Sinai\\" and released in an English-dubbed version in 1969.

The main military character Rafi (Franco Giornelli), a captain in the Israeli army, wishes to leave Jerusalem and go to the United States to work as an engineer, and he tells his military girlfriend Alek (Daniele Dublino). He praises Moshe Dayan the Israeli leader. Meanwhile, his civilian counterpart Ylan (Carlo de Mejo), the son of a shipbuilder, lives the life of a playboy at the poolside, before joining his battalion.The Battle for Sinai 1968 In a scene later copied in American Graffiti two cars charge head on at each other in a game of chicken watched by a crowd of teenagers. Two of the men are later part of the battle. Meanwhile, a battalion of tanks is lined up facing the border. Koffi and other officers are briefed on the plan of attack. Outside Jossi (Assi Dayan the son of Moshe Dayan), one of the troops meets his military girlfriend Lails (Katia Christine). The attack begins with an air force strike into enemy territory. The tanks then move forward into the Sinai Peninsula. A tank battle begins with the Egyptian army. rafi acts as a spotter placed in a jeep above the battlefield. Alek and Laila search for their boyfriends from a helicopter, viewing the devastation of burned out vehicles along the road. They find them. An Egyptian soldier fires on the group and blows up the helicopter before being killed. The group then have to walk out of the battlefield. On the long journey they spot a SAM-2 missile base being created. In the base the Egyption colonel (Gideon Singer) plans his defence. Saadia (Ze'ev Revach) and one of the others capture an outlying guard position on the edge of the base. One of the men who can speak Arabic removes his Israeli uniform and acts as a decoy to put another guard out of action. All seven men then attack the base and capture the colonel. Laila hears the gunfire and grabs a gun to help out. She kills two men and is overcome with emotion. They raise an improvised Israeli flag over the camp. The Egyptian command plans to recapture the base or to destroy the missiles captured by the Israelis. The men who escaped the base say they were greatly outnumbered by the Israelis (which they were not). Two armoured cars full of troops are sent back to the base. The Israelis take out one with an RPG. Ylan and another mount a heavy machine gun on a jeep and play chicken with the remaining armoured car, driving it back. Saadia is killed defending the base but the Egyptians are driven off. Rafi and the Egyptian colonel philosophise about the right of Israel to exist. A large group of mainly unarmed soldiers appear looking for water and they oblige. The Egyptian colonel's assistant runs forward and tells the group to attack the Israelis as they are very few. He starts pouring the water away. They attack and kill him and leave quietly with the water. The radio announces the end of the conflict and the film ends with true life footage of Moshe Dayan and the aftermath of the conflict. ==References== Category:Italian films Category:1968 films ","title":"The Battle of Sinai (film)"},{"id":"63879156","text":"Motahar Uddin (24 August 1935 - 10 January 1974) is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Barisal-3. ==Career== Uddin was elected to parliament from Barisal-3 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973.

It was one of Kircher's most highly regarded works and his only complete work on the subject of cryptography, although he made passing references to the topic elsewhere. The book was distributed as a private gift to selected European rulers, some of who also received an arca steganographica, a presentation chest containing wooden tallies used to encrypt and decrypt codes. ==Background== Kircher reported that the origin of the work was a request from Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III to develop \\"a kind of lingua universalis\\" which would allow written communication between all peoples. The Emperor knew of the earlier secret communication system developed by Johannes Trithemius in his 1518 work Polygraphia, dedicated to the art of steganography, and wanted to know if such a system could be used to bridge different languages. Systems of cryptography had been developed in Italy in late medieval times and by the 17th century many rulers employed cipher secretaries for diplomatic and other sensitive communication. The Thirty Years War gave rise to a range of scholarly publications summarising existing knowledge of the field, and there was a growing interest in the relationship between cryptography and linguistics. Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I, who ruled over empires speaking many different languages, were particularly interested in this field. The Jesuit order played an important role in spreading the idea of mathematics as a kind of universal scientific language. As well as geometry and theoretical mathematics, Jesuit scholars worked on a number of applied projects, including calculating machines such as the one Kircher had designed and then described in his 1637 work Specula Melitensis Encyclica and the Organum Mathematicum he had built for Emperor Ferdinand III. By such means the Jesuits sought to cultivate court patronage and to strengthen and propagate the Catholic faith. Kircher had an established interest in the origins and underlying unity of languages and writing systems, which he explored in various works including Prodromus Coptus (1636), Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta (1643) and Turris Babel (1679). He had also studied the Voynich manuscript, although he apparently had no success in decoding it. ==Introduction== The title page of Polygraphia Nova carries an emblem of the hand of the divine creator holding a compass and describing a circle that bears the motto Omnia in uno sunt, & in omnibus unum (\\"all things are in one, and the one is in all things\\"). This axiom was central to all of Kircher's intellectual work, which explored how phenomena from different countries, different times and different belief-systems all shared fundamental unity. The axiom echoed the earleir beliefs of Catalan Neoplatonist Ramon Llull (1232-1316) and the philosophy of Saint Bonaventure, who believed that divine being permeated all aspects of existence, however apparently different they might be: 'Quia vero est summe unum et omnimodum, ideo est omnia in omnibus' ('But because it is most highly one and in every measure, for that reason it is all in all although all things be many and itself is not but one'). In his introduction, Kircher claimed that the book would allow correspondents in any part of the world to exchange letters without speaking each other's languages. In each section, Kircher acknowledged the work of earlier scholars, and the work thus presented a compendium of approaches not previously brought together. ==Section one== Polygraphia Nova was composed of thee sections. The first, The Reduction of all Language to One offered a kind of translation device involving codes in which vocabulary lists were assigned a two-part symbol - a roman numeral and an Arabic numeral. The first part indicated meaning: Kircher provided 1048 multilingual groups of words arranged over 32 pages in tables organised alphabetically in the order of the Latin column. Thus for example one entry is \\"magnitudo, grandezza, grandeur, grandeza, gr√∂sse\\" (greatness). All of these words are assigned the same first-part symbol. The second part denoted grammatical function (e.g. noun (\\"greatness\\"), verb (\\"make great\\") or adjective (\\"great\\")). This would allow a writer in one language to record a version of their text in the code so that a reader who did not speak the same language could translate from the intermediate code into their own. It was based on the Tironian notes system, supposedly devised by Cicero's secretary. In 1624 Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg had published a book outlining this system, under the pseudonym 'Gustavus Selenus', and other scholars had also described it. Kircher's work was therefore not original, but he appended his own universal dictionary, making it a workable system for any rulers who had access to a copy of his book. ==Section two== While the first section was concerned with communicating meaning between languages through an intermediary code, the second section, The Extension of all Language to All allows the conversion of letters into Latin words, regardless of the language encoded. By this means a word in the original language can be rendered into Latin prose; a reader of the same language can then use the dictionary of Latin words to discover the original letter to which it corresponds. This section was based largely on the work of Johannes Trithemius. Kircher reminded the reader that the purpose of the work was to make possible the conversion of kings and princes around the world, and said that the method he described would allow a message to be written that could be understood in any language. ==Section three== The third section, A Technologia is about the Vigen√®re cipher. It explains how to use the tally sticks included in the Arca seu cista steganographica (steganographic ark or urn), a chest with twenty-four compartments holding 144 sticks that can be used like slide rules to rapidly encode and decode messages. Thus Kircher claims, the phrase Cave ab eo quem non nosti ('beware him who you do not know) can easily be translated into ten languages, including Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and Chinese. ==Distribution== Kircher did not keep an organised record of the people to whom he sent a copy of Polygraphia Nova or the arca steganographica and their distribution must be inferred from his correspondence. To further complicate matters, the early exemplars were sent out not with the complete book, but with manuscript versions of one or more of what afterwards became its sections; only later did he follow up by sending the complete book. Some recipients were sent a book, but not an arca; some were sent directly by Kircher himself, while others were sent through intermediaries to rulers with whom he did not enjoy direct contact. The first arca was sent to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1659, and Kircher then sent texts on cryptography to Emperor Leopold, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, Bernard Ignaz von Martinitz, Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Maximilian Heinrich, Elector of Cologne and Pope Alexander VII. In 1661 Kircher sent an arca to the Emperor's younger brother, Archduke Charles Joseph of Austria, which turned out to contain a number of errors. The difficulty of using the arca without a full explanatory manual may have prompted Kircher to produce a single, standard edition of his various manuscripts, and he started sending our copies of Polygraphia Nova in June 1663. ==Legacy== Although the work was much admired, as were the chests of tally sticks, there is no evidence that any ruler used them to attempt the translations he suggested. The only known instance of someone using the techniques described in Polygraphia Nova is an August 1663 letter to Kircher to his long-time correspondent Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, who had also been sent a copy. In 1989 Eduardo Paolozzi created a sculpture fountain entitled Polygraphia Nova in Schwabing, Munich. ==External links (illustrations)== *Page from the dictionary for composing texts in Kircher‚Äôs universal language, Polygraphia Nova, p. 20. *Table from the dictionary for translating Kircher‚Äôs universal language back into the vernaculars, Polygraphia Nova, p. 62. *The steganographic ark, from Polygraphia Nova, p. 130 ==Bibliography== *Bauer, F.L., Polygraphia Nova et Universalis.

The official flag was adopted in 1929 and consists of a white saltire on a blue field, with the city seal in the center. A secondary flag, with a green field and a white crown in the center, was introduced in 1985 and is used at city government buildings. Charlotte is one of the few places to have two official flags. ==Design and symbolism== === Official flag === Seal used on the flag. This seal was historically used in the early 20th century and was designed on the orders of mayor Charles A. Bland. It was rescinded at an unknown time and replaced with the current seal. Blue and white are the official colors of Charlotte, as reflected in the color choice for the field and saltire. The seal depicts a tree in the center, symbolizing growth. The rays radiating from the tree affirm this, representing hope for a bright future. Hanging off the tree is a hornet's nest, a Revolutionary War-era symbol. The symbol was explained in a city pamphlet, which reads: More revolution symbolism can be found within the seal, with a Liberty Cap present, hanging on the tree. Beneath the tree are two hands clasped. Furthering the revolution symbolism is the date \\"1775\\" below the hands, the year the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was supposedly adopted, one year before the Continental Congress adopted their declaration. This revolution symbolism is to convey the idea of freedom for Charlotte's citizens. Surrounding the seal is the text \\"CITY OF CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG COUNTY\\" on the top portion, and \\"NORTH CAROLINA\\" on the bottom portion. Separating the two portions are two blue five-pointed stars. === Government flag === The green field is used to convey ideals the city focuses on. As a city communications representative put it: Green has become somewhat of a de facto official color of the city. The city website uses many variants of green, e-mail signatures of city employees are green, city signs often use green, and the city's streetcars are painted green. The crown, which occupies about three-fifths of the flag, is an homage to the \\"Queen City\\" nickname that Charlotte has. It gained the nickname from the city's namesake, Queen Charlotte, consort of King George III. The crown also represents the unity that all city agencies have as they cooperate for the good of citizens. The crown is the official logo for the city. ==History== The official flag was adopted by the city council on May 6, 1929. The designer of the flag is unknown. The governmental flag was adopted in 1985. The designer for this flag is also unknown. The crown symbol is an officially registered trademark of the city. Only government entities or city-owned properties can fly the alternative flag. The official flag ranked 66th in a 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey of 150 American city flags. The flag ranked second out of three North Carolina city flags. ==References== Category:Flags of cities in the United States Category:Flags of cities in North Carolina Category:Flags of North Carolina Category:Charlotte, North Carolina Category:1929 establishments in North Carolina Category:Flags introduced in 1929 ","title":"Flag of Charlotte"},{"id":"63879300","text":"Stenaspidiotus is an extinct genus of leaf beetle in the subfamily Chrysomelinae.

Generally known as Susan Lowndes, or Susan Lowndes Marques after her marriage to the Portuguese, Lu√≠s Marques, she was born into a distinguished family. Her great, great-grandfather was the British scientist and philosopher Joseph Priestley, who was credited with the discovery of oxygen. Her grandmother was Bessie Rayner Parkes, a prominent British feminist and champion of women's suffrage. Her mother, Marie Belloc Lowndes, was a well-known writer of crime novels and biographies, best known for her novel, The Lodger, based on Jack the Ripper, which sold over a million copies and was made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1926. Her uncle was the poet and novelist Hilaire Belloc. Brought up in inter-war London, Susan Lowndes was therefore always surrounded by books and met many writers who visited the family home. Her father, Frederick Lowndes, worked as an editor for The Times. She was educated at St Mary's Convent, Ascot. On leaving school she did voluntary work and, for a time, ran an antique shop in London. In August 1938 she went with her father for a brief holiday in Lisbon, where she met Lu√≠s Artur de Oliveira Marques (1898-1976), an English-educated journalist. They were married in December of the same year in Westminster Cathedral in London and made their home in Lisbon, later moving to Monte Estoril. Her husband was the editor (later owner) of the Anglo-Portuguese News, a newspaper targeted primarily at the British community in Portugal. She would carry on running it after his death until 1980. He was the Lisbon correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, the Sunday Times and the New York Times, as well as doing some English teaching. Writers remained at the centre of her life. Their son, Paulo Lowndes Marques, recalled visits to Lisbon from Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, Aldous Huxley and Graham Greene. Other visitors included Rose Macaulay, Angus Wilson and Sachaverell Sitwell. During World War 2, in addition to working on the Anglo-Portuguese News, Susan Lowndes Marques and her husband helped out at the Press section of the British Embassy, reviewing the Portuguese press for items of British interest. The Anglo- Portuguese News was the only British newspaper published in Continental Europe during the war and received support from the British Government. Lu√≠s was referred to by Joseph Goebbels as ‚Äúa man to be destroyed‚Äù and in a German propaganda radio programme the paper was called ‚Äúthe voice of Churchill in Lisbon‚Äù. As a consequence, the couple was on the special embassy list for immediate evacuation should Portugal have been invaded and a large sum of cash was always kept at their house just in case. During the war they were also active in supporting the refugees who passed through Lisbon in large numbers. After the war, Lowndes, writing under her maiden name, collaborated with Ann Bridge, wife of the then British ambassador in Lisbon, Lord O'Malley, to publish The Selective Traveller in Portugal (1949), which became a classic in travel writing on Portugal. It involved the two authors in travelling throughout Portugal on poor roads in search of interesting places to recommend to potential visitors. She subsequently wrote Good Food from Spain and Portugal (1956) and Portugal: A Travellers' Guide (1982), as well as annually revising Fodor's Guide to Portugal. Lowndes also wrote two small books on Fatima for thousands of English-speaking pilgrims. She often gave lectures on Portuguese topics in Portugal and Britain. Together with her elder sister, Elizabeth, Countess of Iddesleigh, she edited The Diaries and Letters of Marie Belloc Lowndes (1971), which described the atmosphere of the interwar years in London. English Art in Portugal, written together with Alice Berkeley, was published posthumously in 1994. Susan Lowndes and her husband had three children. Paulo Lowndes Marques (1941-2011) was a lawyer, historian and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Portugal. Ana Vicente (1943-2015) was a leading supporter of women's rights and an author, including of children's books. She also wrote about life with her parents and compiled some of the letters of her mother. Her sister, Antonia Marques Leit√£o (born 1946), married the Portuguese diplomat Rui Burnay Morales de Los Rios da Silva Leit√£o. Susan Lowndes was appointed OBE in 1975 for services to the British community in Lisbon. Someone with strong Catholic beliefs, she was, at the time of her death, the Lisbon correspondent of the London-based Catholic Herald and of the US Catholic News Service. She attached great importance to charity, believing that Christianity was lived in solidarity with the most vulnerable people. Hundreds of letters of thanks in her archives attest to the assistance she gave others. She worked voluntarily at the British Hospital in Lisbon and at St. Julian's International School, among several other organizations. Towards the end of her life she established the British Retirement Home in S√£o Pedro do Estoril for British people in Portugal who had fallen on hard times. She also had a very developed sense of humour.

Hagan (born February 18, 1936) is an American former basketball player. He was an All-American college player at Tennessee Tech before earning similar honors with the Amateur Athletic Union's Phillips 66ers. A native of Glendale, Kentucky, Hagan played for Tennessee Tech from 1957 to 1960. While there, the center became one of the best players in program history. The slender big man was known as a prolific scorer with a deft shooting touch, particularly from the free throw line. In his junior season, Hagan used his offensive skill very effectively in coach John Oldham's high post offense. Hagan averaged 28.8 points per game and engaged in a highly publicized national scoring race with eventual scoring leader Oscar Robertson. At the close of the season, Hagan was named first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference and a third-team All-American by the Associated Press. In his senior season, Hagan's scoring average dipped to 24.3 points per game. He was again named All-OVC and was the only unanimous choice for the squad. Hagan left Tennessee Tech holding a number of records - including total career points (1,539, since eclipsed), total career rebounds (1,108), season scoring average (28.8 points per game in 1958‚Äì59) and career scoring average (21.1 points per game). He was inducted into the Tennessee Tech athletic Hall of Fame in 1979 and his jersey has been retired by the school. Following the close of his college career, Hagan was selected by the Minneapolis Lakers in the third round of the 1960 NBA draft (18th pick overall). Concerned that his thin frame might have trouble in a league marked with burly big men, he instead chose to join the Phillips 66ers of the National Industrial Basketball League. With the 66ers, Hagan won an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship in 1962 and was named an AAU All-American in 1963 and 1964 before retiring to focus on his business career with Phillips. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Kentucky Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Minneapolis Lakers draft picks Category:People from Hardin County, Kentucky Category:Phillips 66ers players Category:Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles men's basketball players ","title":"Jim Hagan (basketball)"},{"id":"63879399","text":"Roberta Gentini (born 8 August 1973) is an Italian equestrian.

This form of marriage is not recommended for Brahmin and Kshatriya and as such considered as unlawful. Typically, it depends on will and desire of man and his wealth but irrespective of willingness of bride. This type of marriage literally amounts to purchasing the bride by a paying a price to her kinsmen. By taking undue advantage of this type a marriage, a rich but incompetent man can have as many wives but poor and competent man may not be able to afford the money to be paid. For such reasons, this type of marriage is not considered as dignified but viewed as lowly. ==References== Category:Marriage in Hinduism Category:Family Category:Vedic Customs ","title":"Asura marriage"},{"id":"63879577","text":"William Haviland William Haviland (1856 - 19 September 1917) was a British actor-manager specialising in the works of Shakespeare who during his long stage career performed with some of the leading actors of his time including Henry Irving and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. ==Early life== Born as William Alexander Irwin in Bristol in Gloucestershire, he was the son of Adeline Ann n√©e Goode (1830‚Äì1905) and Frederick William Irwin (1834‚Äì1930), a Licensed Victualler.1871 England Census for Wm Alexander Irwin: Gloucestershire, Bristol, St Thomas - Ancestry.com He used the stage name William Haviland for much of his theatrical career except for an early period when he was billed as Alexander J.

She also lectured in art history. == Early life and education == Born in Toronto of a prominent family, she was the daughter of Stewart Fielde Houston (1868‚Äì1910), manager of Massey Hall in Toronto and first editor of the Financial Post and Augusta Louise Beverley (Robinson) Houston (1859‚Äì1935), a professional singer, daughter of Mary Jane (Hagerman) Robinson (1823‚Äì1892) and John Beverley Robinson (1821‚Äì1896), mayor of Toronto (1856), member of the House of Commons in Ottawa (1872‚Äì1880) and Lieutenant Governor of Ontario (1880‚Äì1887). Bagnani's great-grandfather was Sir John Beverley Robinson (1791‚Äì1863), Chief Justice of Canada West (now Ontario) from 1829 to 1862. Bagnani went to school in England and to Bishop Strachan School in Toronto, then to Rome for art history. In Rome, she met Gilbert Bagnani (1900‚Äì1985), an Italian-Canadian scholar of ancient history, archaeologist, and classicist. They married in Toronto in 1929. In the early years of their marriage, while living part of the year in Rome, she joined her husband at the excavations of the Royal Italian Archaeological Expedition in Egypt at Tebtunis in the Sahara desert, where he was field director. While at the work site, she drew and painted watercolours (now at Trent University) of workers and local customs, and of early Coptic church frescoes. == Return to Canada == In 1937, Bagnani and her husband returned to Canada, and purchased a farm and house north of Port Hope, Ontario which they called Vogrie, and enlarged to provide sufficient space for their collections of 10,000 books and works of art by painters such as Luca Giordano and Mattia Preti. From 1945 to 1975, Gilbert Bagnani taught in the Greek and Roman department at the University of Toronto. In the 1950s, the Bagnanis commissioned a mural for the house from Canadian artist William Ronald (1926‚Äì1998) of Painters Eleven. Bagnani collected works by Painters Eleven and wrote a brief memoir about them. == Career == From 1951 to 1963, Bagnani worked as head of extension at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now Art Gallery of Ontario), helping to develop a working relationship with the community. When Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, offered her husband a position, in 1965, Bagnani gave lectures there on art history and volunteered at the university's Mackenzie Gallery. She also volunteered at Kingston Penitentiary, Ontario. == Later years == After her husband died in 1985, Bagnani lived in Toronto until her death in 1996. She was buried with her husband in Cobourg, Ontario. After her husband's death in 1985, Bagnani gave the Art Gallery of Ontario the material which today composes the Gilbert and Stewart Bagnani fonds in The Edward P. Taylor Library & Archives. After Bagnani's death in 1996, Nancy Dillow, the heir to her house in Toronto, donated correspondence she found there to the Art Gallery of Ontario (1997 and 2000). Their art works, antiquities, furniture, books and documents were bequeathed to several institutions, including Trent University which besides having a Gilbert and Stewart Bagnani fonds in the library and archives, opened Bagnani Hall using furniture from Vogrie in 2010.

As a loyal partisan of King John Z√°polya, he served as de facto the last Bishop of Csan√°d between 1537 and 1552, before the Ottoman Empire conquered the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the whole territory of the diocese. ==Early life== J√°nos (IV) was born into a Transylvanian noble family in Csesztve, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Cisteiu de Mure»ô, Romania) in 1482. His father was J√°nos III, whose brother L√©n√°rd was an influential magnate and patron of arts in Transylvania at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. His mother was the first unidentified wife of his father. J√°nos also had several siblings, Mih√°ly III, Gergely, Katalin and Zs√≥fia, in addition to half-siblings Ferenc I and J√°nos VI (from their father's second marriage). Some of the members of his family (for instance, his grandfather J√°nos II and uncle L√©n√°rd) financially supported that Humanist scholar circle, which centered around Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (Alba Iulia). His deeply religious father intended his secondborn namesake son for an ecclesiastical career. His education was determined by the influence of the Humanist-Renaissance intellectual trend. According to a contemporary record, J√°nos attended the University of Vienna in 1505. Here he met and befriended with Bohemian-born historian and poet Stephanus Taurinus, who later moved to Hungary due to this relationship. J√°nos continued his studied at the University of Bologna by 19 October 1508. He was already a canon of the cathedral chapter of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r during that time. Barlab√°ssy was first styled as magister by a document issued in 1517. Some historians claimed he also attended the University of Krak√≥w in 1527, but it is plausible that data concerns to his namesake cousin (L√©n√°rd's son). Joining the local Humanist circle, Barlab√°ssy financially supported the construction of the Lazo chapel within the St. Michael's Cathedral of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, built by his relative J√°nos L√°szai. His coat-of-arms, which depicted a bison head could be found on the main ledge of the northern main facade (disappeared during later renovations). ==Ecclesiastical career== Beside his rank of canon at the cathedral chapter of Transylvania, Barlab√°ssy was elevated into the church offices of archdeacon of Szentkir√°ly and Gomb√°s (present-day S√¢ncrai and G√¢mba»ô, respectively) by 19 September 1518, when bought portions and a mill at Csombord (Ciumbrud). Together with his family, Barlab√°ssy was a long-time partisan of Voivode John Z√°polya, who governed Transylvania since 1510. Following the Battle of Moh√°cs, when the Ottoman Empire crushed the Hungarian royal army and King Louis II was killed, Barlab√°ssy attended that diet in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, which had proclaimed Z√°polya as King of Hungary on 10 November 1526. A month later, Z√°polya's rival Ferdinand of Habsburg was also elected king by another diet summoned in Pressburg (Bratislava). Following the death of Giovanni Bonzagno, King John Z√°polya and his spouse, Queen Isabella Jagiellon appointed J√°nos Barlab√°ssy as Bishop of Csan√°d in 1537. The diocese laid in the frontier zone between Z√°polya's realm (in historiography, also known as the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom) and the Ottoman Empire. Barlab√°ssy was a protegee of Bishop George Martinuzzi, King John Z√°polya's most powerful advisor. Martinuzzi reserved for himself the administration and finances (taxes) of the diocese because of the military situation, overshadowing Barlab√°ssy's episcopate (as a result, earlier histroiographical works considered mistakenly that Martinuzzi, who served as Bishop of V√°rad, was also Bishop of Csan√°d during that time). Pope Paul III confirmed Barlab√°ssy's appointment on 30 May 1539. Having regard to Barlab√°ssy's \\"merits and virtues\\", the pope sent the deed of approval with papal legate and chamberlain Hieronymus Rorarius on 29 June 1539. Pope Paul also instructed Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro to explain the reason for the confirmations of Barlab√°ssy and other pro-John bishops to Ferdinand, who resented the decision of the Roman Curia. As an atonement, Pope Paul III decided to spend procuratio (appointment fee) on maintaining the southern military frontier castle system along the border with the Ottoman Empire. John Z√°polya died on 22 July 1540. George Martinuzzi and Queen Isabella secured the infant John Sigismund's inheritance, which violated the Treaty of V√°rad, concluded between Ferdinand and John two years earlier. Ferdinand requested the pope to instruct the pro- Z√°polya bishops ‚Äì including Barlab√°ssy ‚Äì to acknowledge Ferdinand as the sole rightful ruler in accordance with the treaty. However, Barlab√°ssy and other prelates remained partisans of the Z√°polya family and Martinuzzi. In response, Ferdinand I did not recognize Barlab√°ssy's legitimacy and appointed a Transdanubian clergyman Ferenc Ugody as Bishop of Csan√°d on 26 August 1540. During that time, there were several dioceses in Hungary, where two rival and co-claimant bishops were appointed to their positions simultaneously. Barlab√°ssy resided most of his tenure as bishop in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, his position was merely titular due to George Martinuzzi's influence over the Diocese of Csan√°d. King Ferdinand sought to convince Barlab√°ssy to become his confidant, in order to divide the unity of John Sigismund's party. In July 1542, his royal document styled Barlab√°ssy as \\"Bishop of Csan√°d\\" and assured him to confirm that privileges, inaugurations and donations which were made by the late John Z√°polya in favor of the bishop. Barlab√°ssy remained a supporter of Queen Isabella and John Sigismund. He attended the diet at Torda (Turda) on 1 August 1544. According to Martinuzzi's record from February 1550, Barlab√°ssy had various lawsuits with nobleman Mikl√≥s Forr√≥. The litigation process took place in Radn√≥t (Iernut). Martinuzzi forced Isabella to renounce her son's realm in exchange for two Silesian duchies in 1551. John Sigismund and his mother settled in Poland. Martinuzzi was murdered in late 1551 upon the order of Ferdinand. To prevent the unification of the Kingdom of Hungary under a sole monarch, the Ottoman Empire launched a large-scale military campaign against the realm in 1552. The Turks invaded and occupied the southern parts of the kingdom, including the whole territory of the Diocese of Csan√°d, which de facto ceased to exist. Ferdinand I, who was left without a rival for the throne of Hungary until 1556, deprived Barlab√°ssy from his position in 1552. He appointed Ferenc Sz√©kely as Bishop of Csan√°d in the following year. Barlab√°ssy remained in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r in the subsequent years, but was forced to leave the town due to the spread of Calvinism in 1556. The former bishop retired to his family estates, where he died in 1560, at the age of 77 or 78. == References == == Sources == * * Category:1482 births Category:1560 deaths Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Csan√°d Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:University of Bologna alumni Category:People from Ocna Mure»ô John 04 ","title":"J√°nos Barlab√°ssy"},{"id":"63879792","text":"Emil Schuhmann (1 January 1856-15 Aril 1937) was a Texas-born German accordionist and bandleader who created the famous Pyramide toy. The elaborate toy, considered Texas folk art, was purchased in 1969 by Ima Hogg, daughter of Texas Gov. Jim Hogg, and put on display at Winedale Historical Complex near Round Top, Texas, where it remains to this day. == Biography == Schuhmann was born in 1856 in the Waldeck community in Fayette County, Texas, to Carl Schuhmann and his wife, Christiana Friederike Wilhelmine Voigtel. The Schuhmanns immigrated to Texas in 1853 from Oberscheibe in Saxony, Germany. Oberscheibe was a mining community, and that detail as well as others about Emil's father's life, would make their way into Emil's Pyramide toy. Emil was one of four children. The oldest, Wilhelmine, was the only one to marry. Her first husband, Carl Kreidel, died in the Civil War. Her second husband was Eduard Wenzel. Emil and his younger sisters, Anna and Agnes, never married, choosing instead to remain on the family's Waldeck farm. Although Emil lived on a farm, he devoted his life to music. He hired a black laborer named Lufkin Shelby to farm his land. After Emil died, he left 50 acres of land to Shelby. Emil spent his time composing and teaching music. He was a member of the Schuhmann Band along with his cousins, Paul and Gus Schuhmann and other family members. In the 1870s, Emil began carving the Pyramide. He whittled all the pieces out of wood by hand with a pocket knife.. The toy is about 3 feet high and 2.5 feet wide, with a domed building surrounded by a cupola. The building is supported by a papier m√¢ch√© mountain. Three rotating circular platforms laden with carved figures are powered by the heat from thirteen oil lamps attached to the building and the mountain. The lower platform, which rotates inside the mountain itself, carries eight miniature miners, some pushing carts of ore and some carrying axes. The middle platform features soldiers carrying rifles with bayonets. The top platform features band members and a bandmaster. Other details include carved pine and palm trees and wooden figures in a fenced yard in front of the building - a soldier guarding at the gate; a shepherd with a flock of sheep; a hunter aiming his gun at a deer; three dogs and a leopard; and a squirrel looking down from a tree. The mountain is made from an 1872 German-language Galveston newspaper. Many of the scenes depict Carl Schuhmann's life back in Germany. Carl had served in the German Army and worked as a miner Emil displayed his pyramid once a year during the Christmas holidays. He set it up in his living room, lit the lamps, and sat beside it playing Christmas carols on his concertina. As the little grease lamps burned, the heat would make the fan on top turn, and this moved the little wooden men in and out of the mine and the barracks. After his death, the Pyramide was inherited by Emil's nephew, Robert Wenzel. He kept it in the crate that Emil built for it at his home in Seguin for more than 30 years. Wenzel died in 1969 and his widow, Annie, wrote Ima Hogg telling her about the pyramid. Hogg was the daughter of Gov. Jim Hogg. She was a well-known philanthropist and art collector. She was assembling a collection of Texas folk art for an exhibit at Winedale, the historic property near Round Top that she had given to the University of Texas at Austin in 1967. Hogg immediately went to Seguin, saw the Pyramide and purchased it for $500. The toy has been on exhibit at Winedale ever since. Historian Cecilia Steinfeldt, known as the first lady of Texas art, described it as ‚Äúone of the finest pieces of folk art ever made in the Lone Star State.‚Äù Emil Schuhmann, musician and artist Schuhmann Band members Paul with cousin Emil and Paul's brother Gus.

He was connected to many of the leading Catholic families of the land, such as the Bodenhams, Cliffords, Erringtons, Petres and Stourtons.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, Volume 2. H. Colburn, 1847. pp. 1545-6 view on line He proved to be a great benefactor of the Society of Jesus in England in their educational and pastoral endeavours. He was also a benefactor to other Roman Catholic religious and clergy. He was a personal friend of King George III. His sister- in-law was Maria Fitzherbert. After the French Revolution he hosted refugee remnants of the French royal family at his castle. He was the builder, in 1786, of the first Roman Catholic place of worship in England after the Protestant reformation. ==Life== Lulworth Castle Thomas Weld was born into an old recusant family descended from Sir Humphrey Weld, a grocer, who was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1608. He was the fourth son of Edward Weld and Dame Mary Teresa, n√©e Vaughan of the Welsh Bicknor exclave in Herefordshire. Two of his older brothers and both his parents died when he was still a child. At age six in 1761, on the death of his father, Weld inherited the Bowland- with-Leagram and Stonyhurst estates in Lancashire from his father's cousin, Maria Shireburn (died 1754), the independently wealthy widow of Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk (1683-1732).The Authorities of Stonyhurst College, A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others, (Stonyhurst, Lancashire. Third edition 1963) pp.11‚Äì18 After home schooling, he was sent to the English Jesuit school at Watten and Bruges in Northern France and Austrian Netherlands. He was reputedly not a distinguished scholar, due to repeated disruptions of his schooling from local political turmoil, but he developed an attachment to the community he met there and it fostered his lasting interest in education. On return to England, he married Mary Stanley-Massey-Stanley daughter of Sir John Stanley-Massey-Stanley, 6th Baronet (1711‚Äì1794). They had six daughters and nine sons, the eldest of whom was also Thomas, who after being widowed and left with a daughter, entered the church and rose to the status of cardinal.Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Weld.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 January 2019 His older brother, Edward, died in a horse-riding accident three months after his marriage to Maria Smythe (later, Mrs Fitzherbert) in July 1775 and the family inheritance fell to Thomas. His brother's widow, Maria n√©e Smythe, married Thomas Fitzherbert who also died prematurely in 1781. She was introduced to the Prince of Wales, the future George IV and they contracted a morganatic marriage in 1785, which was repudiated both by the king and the Privy Council of England. Subsequently, William Stourton, 18th Baron Stourton, one of Weld's sons-in-law, became executor of Maria's will and fought hard to prove the validity of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, but met implacable opposition from Queen Victoria in the shape of the Duke of wellington.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington-Pillar of State Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1972, p. 288. ===Bibliophile landowner=== Bookplate in the Luttrell Psalter showing crest and ownership of Thomas Weld. British Library As the new owner of Lulworth Castle and the Lulworth Estate, Thomas Weld, who until then had been living with his wife in Britwell in Oxfordshire, refurbished the interiors of the \\"castle\\" in the then fashionable Adam style. It is said the most sumptuous was the library indicating he was a keen bibliophile who possessed a number of exceptional rarities in his collection, including the Luttrell Psalter, the Bedford Book of Hours, bought from Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland in 1786 and Shakespeare's history textbook, Holinshed's Chronicles 1587 2nd edition.Note: An ex libris label in the 1587 copy of Holinshed's Chronicles, as used by William Shakespeare shows it was owned by Thomas Weld of Britwell, Oxon. The book was for sale on the AbeBooks website in 2020 , retrieved 2020-05-06. Thomas Weld's ex libris bookplates all bear the family motto on the plates' ribbon \\"nil sine numine\\". Weld is known to have collected artworks. He was a friend of another Jesuit school alumnus, Giles Hussey (1710-1788), a Dorset artist specialising in portraiture and depictions of Charles Edward Stuart. Two pencil drawings of Thomas and his wife Mary are known to have survived. Although the \\"Castle\\", originally intended as a hunting lodge, fell victim to a disastrous fire in 1929, a number of valuable items it housed appear to have been saved. Unless it had been sold prior to the fire, one of them would have been Engelbert Kaempfer's History of Japan, translated from the German manuscript held by Sir Hans Sloane and published in 1728. ===Builder=== Grade I listed RC Chapel of St Mary, built to look like a house, 1786 Interior of St Mary's Chapel, Lulworth Castle In the absence of public catholic worship, the Welds were accustomed to having services celebrated by a personal chaplain in a chapel space within the castle. One of these came to them fleeing the French Revolution. He was a French ordained Jesuit priest, named Jean Grou, who as well as fulfilling his pastoral duties, was a prolific writer on spiritual matters. He stayed at Lulworth for almost a decade, until his death in 1803.\\"Grou, Jean Nicolas\\", New Catholic Encyclopedia Owing to his personal friendship with King George III, Thomas Weld was able in 1786 to build a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St. Mary to serve as the family chapel in the grounds of Lulworth Castle. Pevsner relates that he needed permission from the King which he obtained on condition it did not look like a church from outside. He asked John Tasker who was responsible for the interior refurbishment of the castle, to design it drawing inspiration from a classical Greek mausoleum, at a cost of ¬£2,380. It was to be the first Roman Catholic chapel to be erected since the time of the Protestant Reformation. It was indeed to be his and his wife's final resting place. The building has been Grade I listed. On August 15, 1790, John Carroll, an American Jesuit friend of Thomas, was consecrated bishop by Bishop Charles Walmesley, assisted by another school friend and personal chaplain, the Jesuit, Charles Plowden, in the chapel of Lulworth Castle. Carroll was later to become the first Roman Catholic archbishop of Baltimore.The American Catholic quarterly review, Volume 14 Lulworth Chapel, Bishop Carroll and Bishop Walmesley The next episcopal consecration took place there on 19 December of the same year when John Douglass was consecrated bishop of The London District (which included the home counties, the West Indies with the exception of Trinidad, and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey) by William Gibson, titular bishop of Acanthus, and Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District.Ward, Bernard. Catholic London a Century Ago, Catholic Truth Society, 1905, p. 62 ===Philanthropist=== Weld became known especially for his charitable works on behalf of the English refugees of the French Revolutionary wars. He donated his Lancashire seat, Stonyhurst, near Clitheroe, with of land, to the returning exiled English Jesuits. He supported the English Poor Clares who had fled from Gravelines. He founded and maintained a Trappist monastery at Lulworth (now Mount Melleray Abbey, Ireland). Following the French Revolution, surviving members of the French royal family were invited to use Lulworth as one of their residences- in-exile. Later Charles X of France and family also stayed there briefly as guests of Joseph Weld, following the July Revolution of 1830 on their way to Edinburgh. He was regarded as very pious and greatly hospitable. He endowed a church, St Michael's and St John's in Clitheroe, and requested that the parish priest say Mass annually for the repose of his and his wife's souls. He was one of the first English Catholics to entertain the king, in 1789 and in 1791 at his Lulworth Estate. He was also a supporter of John Milner. He died suddenly at Stonyhurst, where two of his sons also died, one of them, John, was its Jesuit Rector at the time. He was buried in the chapel of Lulworth Castle. Thomas Weld is believed to have given away half his income to charitable causes. ==The Weld family motto== Nil sine numine translates as \\"Nothing without divine providence\\", and is the motto of the Weld family.

Previously, she served as deputy speaker of the National Assembly from 2013 to 2018, and as MP for Mutoko North until her election as senate president in 2018. She has also served as secretary of the ZANU‚ÄìPF Women's League since 2017. == Early life and education == Chinomona was born on 21 January 1958. She attended Nyamuzuwe High School, where she received her junior certificate, before going on to earn her Ordinary Levels at Murewa High School. She later went on to receive tertiary certificates from Speciss College and Kushinga Phikelela Polytechnic. She joined the liberation movement in 1975 during the Rhodesian Bush War. == Political career == After Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, Chinomona served as the ZANU‚ÄìPF Women's League chairman for Mashonaland East Province. She served in that role until 1990, when she became political commissar. She was also involved in the Women's League as commissariat director. She also worked in the Ministry of Local Government for ten years, and served as Deputy Minister of Home Affairs. In February 2016, while serving as provincial head of the Women's League in Mashonaland East, Chinomona was suspended from ZANU‚ÄìPF in a vote of no confidence by the party's provincial coordinating committee. The reason given was that she had been neglectful in facilitating a planned trip by a group of Women's League members to Harare to meet President Robert Mugabe. However, the real reason was reportedly her association with Emmerson Mnangagwa's Lacoste political faction within the party. The influential party member Sydney Sekeramayi reportedly intervened on her behalf. After the vote of no confidence, she continued to serve in the Women's League, but this time as political commissar.

Shot on location in China and using only native Chinese non-professional actors, the film focuses on the work of Christian missionaries in China through the depiction of a minister, a doctor, a teacher, and an agricultural specialist. The plot centers around Han, a farmer who is battered by war, destruction, poverty, and hardship, yet refuses to accept the healing power of faith. But as he sees the effect of church teachings on his wife, his children, and his neighbors, and even benefits personally from Christian doctrine, he begins to accept Christ into his life. The film was the second in a series of short films developed under the auspices of the Protestant Film Commission for noncommercial release to denominational churches across the United States and Canada. ==Plot== Han, a Chinese farmer, tells his story through voice-over narration. He and his family, along with many others, were forced to flee during wartime as bombs rained down on their villages. Finally they are able to return, taking a long and weary journey on foot back home. While his wife still insists on giving thanks to God before they eat their meager meals on the side of the road, Han wants nothing to do with religion; he feels it is \\"foolishness\\". They return to their village and find the stone mission church still standing while their own home is in ruins. Han's peach orchard is also destroyed, as the trees were uprooted for firewood and the earth strewn with sand. Grimly, Han and his older son toil in the fields every day while his wife and younger children work on restoring the house. While Han's wife continues to be upbeat and buoyed by her faith, Han is bitter about all the troubles that have befallen him. As she and the children happily go to church on Sunday morning, he declares, \\"My religion is work\\". Han also suspects the motives of the church missionaries. He listens in to a lecture and finds the missionary an intelligent man, but cannot believe that he really wants to help him. When the missionaries invite his daughter to attend the mission school, Han at first refuses but gives in when he sees how happy it makes his daughter. She learns to write and though he himself cannot read or write, he proudly keeps her writing in his pocket. The mission also helps the farmers by providing topsoil for them to begin planting again. One day Han's young son finds an unexploded cartridge in their yard and playfully hammers it into the ground. It explodes, wounding him badly. Having no experience with prayer, Han is distraught. The boy is taken to the mission hospital, where the head doctor shows Han around and assures him the wound is not fatal. Han is amazed by how clean the mission hospital is and also how happy the children are there as they heal from their injuries. After two days in the hospital, Han returns to his field and cannot believe his eyes. All his neighbors are pitching in to plow and plant his field. He tells the minister that he cannot possibly pay them, and wonders what motivates them to help him. The minister explains that faith in Christ is expressed through deeds. Just as Christ helped others, it is one's Christian duty to help neighbors in need. Having seen the effect of faith on his wife, children, and neighbors, Han considers adopting it for himself. In the final scene, when his wife serves the meal and pauses to thank God for their food, Han also bends his head in prayer. ==Production== My Name Is Han was the second in a series of short films released by the Protestant Film Commission for screening in denominational churches across the United States and Canada. It was produced by Julien Bryan's non-profit International Film Foundation. ===Casting=== Only native Chinese are seen in the film, including Chinese Christian missionaries. The roles of Han and his wife are played by T'ang, a clerk in the Peiping Union Medical College, and Mrs. T'ang, the latter being cast as a condition for allowing her husband to appear in the film. Neither had any acting experience. Han's children and other youth were students at the American Board of Foreign Missions school. Extras on the film were \\"mainly ex-shop keepers and refugees from the Communists\\". ===Filming=== The film was shot on location in the Chinese province of Hopei. Principal photography was completed in six weeks during 1947 by an American film crew. The People's Liberation Army and the National Revolutionary Army were locked in battle close by throughout the filming, and the crew was warned not to venture out at night lest they be caught in the crossfire. ==Release== The film premiered in Protestant denominational churches in 100 cities in the United States and Canada on June 15, 1948. Following the premiere, the film was distributed to many more \\"churches, ministers' meetings, to youth groups, forums and church-sponsored meetings on labor-management problems\\". The film's release coincided with the launch of a year-long study program on Christian missionary work in China by Protestant churches. In an ironic coda, a few months later Mao Zedong established his communist regime and expelled American missionaries from China. ==Critical reception== The Christian Advocate called the film \\"sincere, genuine and appealing\\". Lindvall and Quicke described the film as \\"extremely well photographed\\" and said that it \\"effectively portrayed Christian witness in China with an economy of dialogue and detail\\". The Akron Beacon Journal, which devoted a two-page pictorial spread to the release, said the film \\"packs more of a punch than many a Hollywood double feature\\". ==Awards== My Name Is Han was named best film with a religious theme by the Cleveland Film Council in 1948. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1948 short films Category:American films Category:Docudrama films Category:Documentary films about Christianity Category:Protestant missionaries in China Category:Films shot in China Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"My Name Is Han"},{"id":"63880202","text":"Abangares River Basin Protected Zone (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Arenal Tempisque Conservation Area, it was created in 1995 by decree 24539-MIRENEM. == References == Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1995 ","title":"Abangares River Basin Protected Zone"},{"id":"63880208","text":"Arenal-Monteverde Protected Zone (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Arenal Tempisque Conservation Area, it was created in 1977 by decree 6778-A. == References == Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1977 ","title":"Arenal-Monteverde Protected Zone"},{"id":"63880229","text":"Gaius Valerius Triarius (died c. 45 BC) was a First Century BC Roman politician and general, a member of the gens Valeria. During the Third Mithridatic War he served as a legate to Lucius Licinius Lucullus, the Roman commander in charge of the war effort against king Mithridates VI of Pontus. He played a pivotal role in the capture of Heraclea Pontica, but was later defeated by Mithridates at the Battle of Zela in 67 BC. ==Family background== Triarius belonged to the famous gens Valeria, but unlike the more famous members of the gens, the Triarii were plebeian. The cognomen Triarius may be an allusion to their military service, since the third, the most veteran, line of the Republican legions were named the Triarii. Triarius's father was likewise named Gaius.Hans Volkmann, RE, Band VIII A,1, p. 232. He also had a brother, Lucius Valerius Triarius, who was quaestor in 81 and praetor in 78.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 77, 86, 91.Hans Volkmann, RE, Band VIII A,1, p. 234. Triarius married Flaminia, a friend of Servilia (Cato's half-sister and mother of Brutus).Hans Volkmann, RE, Band VIII A,1, p. 233. ==Military Career== In 72 BC, after defeating the Mithridatic fleet at Lemnos, Lucullus put Triarius in charge of his fleet and ordered him to patrol the northern coastline of Asia Minor. Eventually, Triarius took the fleet to Heraclea Pontica and supported Lucullus's proconsular colleague Marcus Aurelius Cotta who was besieging the city. Heraclea held out against its besiegers until Menchares, one of the sons of Mithridates and his governor of the Bosporian Kingdom, betrayed his father and stopped supplying the defenders from his dominions north of the Black Sea. Menchares halted his supply shipments in exchange for the status of 'Friend and Ally'. Connacorex, Mithridates's commander, decided to abandon Mithridates's cause, but since he did not trust Cotta he started negotiations with Triarius whom he considered more trustworthy. Connacorex and his men escaped by sea, Triarius letting him through his naval blockade, Triarius then sailed into the harbour and took the city. Triarius's troops started to loot, those Heracleans who escaped the atrocities made their way to Cotta's camp and apprised him of the situation. There was nearly a civil war as Cotta's men felt cheated out of their glory and plunder.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 116 and p. 118; Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, pp. 75‚Äì76. In the spring of 67 BC, Mithridates, who had been driven out of his kingdom by Lucullus, suddenly returned and he caught the Romans off guard.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 140. The Romans had not expected Mithridates to strike at them in Pontus, Lucullus and the bulk of his army had left for Northern Mesopotamia where they were laying siege to Nisibis. Marcus Fabius Hadrianus, whom Lucullus had left in command of Pontus, tried to defeat Mithridates in battle, but was routed. Hadrianus sent out desperate messengers to his commander, Lucullus, and to Gaius Valerius Triarius, his fellow legate, who was nearby bringing reinforce to Lucullus. Triarius arrived first reinforcing Hadrianus and assuming command of the combined army. Mithridates pulled his forces back towards Comana and awaited the Romans.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 141. Plutarch and Appian claim Triarius wanted to defeat Mithridates before Lucullus could arrive and take the glory for himself, but this is in dispute.Arthur Keaveney, Lucullus, A Life, p.167 n.48. Triarius marched his army to Comana, he camped his army near Zela, within striking distance of Mithridates's camp. During the night there was a tornado, which both sides interpreted the omen, as a call to a final, decisive battle. The next day the Romans marched on Mithridates's camp, he met them on the plain. Mithridates first threw his entire force against one section of the advancing enemy and defeated them while holding off the rest. He then rode his cavalry round the rear of the remaining force, attacked them from the front and the rear and broke them too. The fight was long and brutal, but eventually the Mithridatic troops drove the Romans back into a trench Mithridates had constructed in preparation of the battle and had then flooded to conceal it from sight. Many Romans became trapped against this unexpected obstacle and were cut down in great numbers.Appian, Mithridatic Wars, 89. Eventually, Triarius and some of his troops managed to flee, leaving 7,000 dead, including 24 tribunes and 150 centurions.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp. 142-143; Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 107. Lucullus had to hide Triarius to keep him from being lynched by his soldiers.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 107. == Children == From Flaminia, Triarius had two sons, Gaius and Publius Valerius Triarius. During the Civil War Gaius joined the faction opposing Caesar. In 48 BC Triarius with D. Lealius commanded the flotilla gathered from the Roman Asia province and patrolled the Adriatic to keep grain from reaching Italy and to blockade any Caesarian forces.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp. 186‚Äì188. His second son Publius is known for having sued for corruption Marcus Aemilius Scaurus in 54. He also had a daughter named Paula Valeria, who had two husbands. The first one is unknown, but she divorced him to marry Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of the leading men in the conspiracy that led to the assassination of Julius Caesar.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, viii. 7. == References == ==Bibliography== ===Ancient Sources=== * Appian, Mithridatic Wars. *Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares. ===Modern sources=== * Marie-Nicolas Bouillet & Alexis Chassang (red.), Dictionnaire universel d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie, 1878. *T.

He studied at Prague University where he gained his bachelor's degree in 1389 and master's degree in 1394. In 1391,Marcela K. Perett Preachers, Partisans, and Rebellious Religion pp. 193 he was ordained by Pope Boniface IX, at an uncanonical age of twenty, and consequently on 17 May 1391 pope assigned him to the parish of Louny. In the nineties of the 14th he started his service at the side of the king Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia (probably until his death in 1419). He was also a supporter of the Hussites. He was an opponent of Sigismund Korybut and therefore forced to leave Prague in 1427. Around that year he translated the Prague Nov√© Mƒõsto privilegia, which were abolished in 1434. During the request for the reinstitution of the emperor (1436) these privileges were reinstated thanks to the testimony of Vav≈ôinec. ==Work== * Song about the victory in Doma≈ælice(modern name), original Carmen insignis Coronae Bohemiae pro tropheo sibi divinitus concesso circa Ryzmberg et Domazlic, a Latin poem about the Battle of Doma≈ælice, which happened on 14 August, 1431 and during which a part of participants of the 4th Crusade allegedly fled before they have even the Hussite army. * Historia Hussitica ‚Äì Latin chronicle about the Hussite movement, author is writing from the perspective of Prague Hussites.

It advocates for issues related to veterinary medical education, oversees the accreditation process for veterinary medical schools and colleges along with the American Veterinary Medical Association, and manages the Veterinary Medical College Application Service. == History and mission == The AAVMC was founded as an independent, non-profit corporation in Illinois in 1966 and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016. Deans of the 18 United States veterinary colleges and the three Canadian veterinary colleges at the time were made representatives of the organization to represent founding institutions. In 1972, three Councils were formed to create the AAVMC Assembly, which included the Council of Deans, Council of Chairs, which included university department chairs, and the Council of Educators, which included individual faculty members. The AAVMC also began holding the Iverson Bell Symposium in 1972 to promote diversity in the field of veterinary medicine. W. Max Decker became the first formal AAVMC employee in 1977 when he became a part-time director and treasurer of the organization. The organization began to receive corporate support in 1965, when Merck Chemical Division made a donation of $10,000. The three-Council structure of AAVMC was eliminated in 1984, and the organization was restructured to include a board of directors and an executive committee. Billy Hooper, former associate dean for academic affairs at Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, became the full-time executive director and helped create a permanent office in Washington D.C. in 1986. This allowed for a partnership to form between the Pew National Veterinary Education Program and AAVMC, which was operated by the Pew Charitable Trust from 1987‚Äì1989. AAVMC continues to partner with many national and international organizations. In 1995, the national common application service for applicants to veterinary school, the VMCAS, was launched and has been in operation since. The mission of the AAVMC is to promote excellence in academic veterinary medicine as well as provide leadership for the field, with the intent to prepare the veterinary workforce with the appropriate knowledge and skills to meet the needs of animal health, relieve animal suffering, conserve animal resources, promote public health, and advance medical knowledge. It fulfills its mission through advocacy, supporting the work of member institutions, facilitating veterinary school enrollment, and building global partnerships in academic veterinary medicine. The current Chief Executive Officer is Andrew Maccabe, who holds a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from The Ohio State University, a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Arizona. He was a former public health officer for the U.S. Air Force and served as a public health liaison for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prior to his role at the AAVMC. The AAVMC Board of Directors is an elected body consisting of a president, president-elect, past-president, secretary, treasurer, four at-large regional directors, and two at-large directors representing specific areas of veterinary medicine. The non-voting members of the Board of Directors include liaisons that represent the American Association of Veterinary Clinicians, the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities, and the Student American Veterinary Medical Association, along with the Chief Executive Officer. == Advocacy priorities == The AAVMC has multiple key advocacy priorities. They work to ensure support for the Veterinary Services Grant Program. This program, funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) via the Farm Bill, provides financial support for the expansion of rural veterinary practices, mobile veterinary practices, and to recruit additional veterinarians and students to these practices. The AAVMC also supports increasing appropriations allotments for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, which provides $25,000 in loan repayment per year, for a period of three years, for veterinarians who agree to practice medicine in areas that have veterinary medical shortages, as determined by the USDA. In addition, the AAVMC supports increased funding for research programs that target antimicrobial resistance. The AAVMC also supports the Global Health Security Agenda as outlined by the CDC and other national and international health organizations. To advocate for these issues in Washington D.C., the AAVMC regularly writes letters in support of policy initiatives in higher education, animal health, biomedical research, and agriculture. The AAVMC also conducts legislative briefings, has an active Advocacy Committee, works with the Veterinary Medicine Caucus in the United States House of Representatives, participates in the National Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research, and organizes visits to Capitol Hill for member institution representatives. To promote AAVMC advocacy initiatives, the organization launched a Public Policy Faculty Fellows Program, which brings faculty of member institutions to Washington D.C. to develop advocacy skills, learn about the federal legislative process, and explore veterinary public policy. == Member institutions == Colleges and schools of veterinary medicine that are accredited or have gained reasonable assurance from the COE that are within the United States include Auburn University, Colorado State University, Cornell University, Iowa State University, Kansas State University, Lincoln Memorial University, Long Island University, Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, Midwestern University, Mississippi State University, North Carolina State University, The Ohio State University, Oklahoma State University, Oregon State University, Purdue University, Texas A & M University, Tufts University, Tuskegee University, University of Arizona, University of California, Davis, University of Florida, University of Georgia, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Minnesota, University of Missouri, University of Pennsylvania, University of Tennessee, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, and Western University of Health Sciences. Two Caribbean islands have accredited veterinary schools including Ross University (Saint Kitts and Nevis) and St. George's University (Grenada). In Canada, the institutions which have gained accreditation or reasonable assurance from the COE are Atlantic Veterinary College at the University of Prince Edward Island, Universit√© de Montr√©al, University of Calgary, University of Guelph, and Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan. Other AAVMC member institutions include Massey University (New Zealand), Murdoch University (Australia), Royal Veterinary College at the University of London (United Kingdom), Seoul National University (South Korea), Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Mexico), the Universiteit Utrecht (Netherlands), University of Bristol (United Kingdom), University College Dublin (Ireland), University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom), University of Glasgow (United Kingdom), University of Melbourne (Australia), University of Queensland (Australia), University of Sydney (Australia), and VetAgro Sup (France). == Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS) == The AAVMC administers the VMCAS, which is a centralized application system that prospective veterinary students use to submit their application materials. All required application materials are processed, verified, and then sent to the veterinary medical schools that the applicant designates, such that applicants only fill out one main application. Application fees are calculated based on the number of schools that the applicant wants to send their application. == Competency Based Veterinary Education (CBVE) == The AAVMC has spear-headed a working group to develop a competency-based learning framework for veterinary medical education, which would standardize learning milestones and establish core activities that would be required for veterinary students across institutions. The domains of competence include clinical reasoning and decision-making, individual animal care and management, animal population care and management, public health, communication, collaboration, professionalism and professional identity, financial and practice management, and scholarship, and the CBVE framework is accessible online. == Accreditation of colleges and schools of veterinary medicine == Colleges and schools of veterinary medicine in the United States, Canada, and across the globe that wish to become a member institution of the AAVMC must be accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (COE). The COE is recognized by the United States Department of Education and is re-certified as the accrediting body for colleges and schools of veterinary medicine every seven years. Accredited institutions must also renew their accreditation every seven years. The AAVMC appoints 20 members of the COE and funds eight of these members. The AVMA also appoints and funds eight members. The remaining members represent Canada and are appointed by the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association. All appointed members serve six year terms and are full-time, permanent faculty members at either the associate professor or professor level at an AAVMC-member institution or affiliate member, and COE members represent preventative medicine, basic science, large animal clinical science, small animal clinical science, postgraduate education, veterinary medical research, and AAVMC membership. The COE publishes a Policies and Procedures manual, which outlines the current standards for accreditation. These standards include organization, finances, physical facilities and equipment, clinical resources, library and information resources, students, admission, faculty, curriculum, research programs, and outcomes assessment. There are five classes of accreditation: reasonable assurance, provisional accreditation, accredited, accredited with minor deficiencies, and probationary accreditation. Accreditation processes include an on-site visit by the COE and a self-study. == AAVMC publications == The Journal of Veterinary Medical Education (JVME) is a peer-reviewed, internationally distributed journal published by AAVMC. The journal publishes on topics relating to veterinary educational methods, recruiting veterinary students, clinical instruction, higher education policy, and other topics related to veterinary education. The AAVMC also publishes a monthly newsletter called the Vet-Med Educator which highlights current news and events, as well as an annual report about AAVMC activities and accomplishments. The Veterinary Medical School Admissions Requirements Guide (VMSAR) is published yearly with up to date information regarding the admissions process and requirements for AAVMC member institutions to help guide veterinary school applicants. The book summarizes deadlines, prerequisite coursework, tuition and fee costs, and campus life for each institution, provides an overview of the VMCAS, and highlights testimonials from current students and veterinarians to showcase what it is like to be a veterinarian. == See also == * Veterinary medicine * Veterinary medicine in the United States * Veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom * Veterinary Medical College Application Service * American Veterinary Medical Association * Journal of Veterinary Medical Education == References == Category:Veterinary medicine Category:Veterinary medicine-related professional associations ","title":"Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges"},{"id":"63880321","text":"Electrify Canada is a partnership formed by Electrify America in cooperation with Volkswagen Group Canada that will build transformative, ultra-fast electric vehicle (EV) direct current (DC) charging infrastructure throughout Canada. == Overview == Electrify Canada's goal is to promote greater Zero- Emission Vehicle (ZEV) adoption by offering an ultra-fast and convenient charging network.

Atkins and Dora Atkins. She graduated college in 1920 with a Bachelor's degree from Butler University in Indianapolis where she was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She also received a master's degree from Columbia University. Walls taught as a high school teacher in Indianapolis. She also served the Girl Scouts in Kentuckiana for over 20 years and held positions as camp committee member, council board member, council vice-president, volunteer trainer and integration activist. Later in her life she volunteered with Red Cross and supervised tenant selection for the Louisville Housing Commission. == Career and activism == After completing her education, Walls moved back to Indianapolis in 1935 and began teaching high school. She was denied access to use the nearest library in Louisville to research and prepare for a speaking engagement. She was directed to the colored libraries; the western and eastern branches. After going through this incident, Walls began to campaign for the desegregation of the Louisville Free Public Libraries. She first began her activism for this desegregation in 1941 by participation in a sit-in. Instead of taking on the whole entire library system, Walls had to \\"fight each one separately\\". Louisville libraries began to integrate in 1948. Walls also became a member of the Girl Scouts in 1940 and was monumental in the creation of the first African American Girl Scouts troop. She served on the committee for Negro Scouting and created the first camp for black Girl Scouts in the Beecher Terrace Housing Complex. The creation of this camp allowed for more black girls to attain membership for Girl Scouts. Walls became the first African American member for the Girl Scouts board of directors in 1945 and pioneered for the desegregation for a shared camp session for white and black girls. She was successful in the established for an integrated camp Shantituck, which allowed both white and black girls. In 1962, She received the Girl Scouts highest award and Thanks Badge to honor her for her contributions and activism. Walls also became one of the first African American Presidents of The Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Louisville, KY.

He served in World War I, and then played professionally in a band led by John Collins, the father of Lee Collins. Lee Collins described Nelson as a musician with a \\"weird style\\", who \\"liked to do tricks with his clarinet. He would take it all apart and play it.\\" His first known recordings were in Chicago in 1923, as a member of Jimmy Wade's Moulin Rouge Orchestra. While with Wade, Nelson wrote \\"Buddy's Habit\\" with Charley Straight.

The following year, he played on sessions with female impersonator Frankie \\"Half Pint\\" Jaxon. In the mid-1930s he led his own Hot Four quartet, which comprised guitarist Big Bill Broonzy, steel guitarist Casey Bill Weldon, pianist Black Bob Hudson, and bass player Bill Settles.

As a session musician, Nelson played on many blues recordings in Chicago in the 1930s, including records by Sweet Pease Spivey, Lil Johnson, Tampa Red, Bumble Bee Slim, Washboard Sam, Red Nelson, and the Washboard Rhythm Kings. On one 1936 recording by the State Street Swingers, bandleader Leonard Scott is heard to comment: \\"What's that you're doing, Arnett?

A high tackle occurs when a player tackles or attempts to tackle an opponent above the line of the shoulders, or makes contact with another players head or neck. The move is dangerous due to the risk of injury to the head and neck of the player being tackled.251x251px == Rugby Union == High tackles are illegal in all variations of rugby union play, including sevens variation and 10s variation. According to World Rugby laws, \\"a player must not tackle an opponent early, late or dangerously. Dangerous tackling includes, but is not limited to, tackling or attempting to tackle an opponent above the line of the shoulders even if the tackle starts below the line of the shoulders.\\" A player may receive a range of sanctions in response to an illegal high tackle, ranging from a penalty, yellow card, or red card. As per a 2011 World Rugby memorandum on the topic, > \\"A player must not tackle (or try to tackle) an opponent above the line of > the shoulders even if the tackle starts below the line of the shoulders. A > tackle around the opponent‚Äôs neck or head is dangerous play.\\" Reducing player injuries sustained from high tackles has long been a goal of World Rugby. In May 2019, World Rugby released a decision-making framework for high tackles to assist players and referees in avoiding illegal high tackles and appropriately sanctioning players who commit this infraction. The result of the framework's implementation was a 37% reduction in the number of tackle- related concussion incidents per 1,000 player hours at the 2019 World Cup compared to the previous year, with an overall 28% reduction in concussion incidents. In August of 2019, World Rugby announced that reducing tackle height to waist level was one of several trial laws under consideration for implementation by the Rugby World Cup in 2023. Under the new rule, any tackle above the waist would now be considered a high tackle. The rationale for this rule change offered by World Rugby is that \\"forcing players to tackle lower may reduce the risk of head injuries to both the tackler and tackled player,\\" as well as encouraging more offloads and expansive play. Initial trials of this rule change from the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Rugby (FFR) has had positive results, showing that reduction of permissible tackling to waist height reduces the number of head impacts and player injuries. == Rugby League == A referee gives a penalty ruling to a player in a rugby league match. High tackles are illegal in rugby league play. As per International Rugby League (IRL) laws, a player is guilty of misconduct if they, \\"when effecting or attempting to effect a tackle makes contact with the head or neck of an opponent intentionally, recklessly or carelessly.\\" In 2019, the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC), the governing body of the National Rugby League (NRL) cracked down on 'crusher tackles', a particularly dangerous type of high tackle in which a defender forces a player‚Äôs head towards their torso in contact. Numerous similar crackdowns on types of dangerous tackles, like high tackles, have occurred in an effort to make the game safer. A related infraction in rugby league is the shoulder charge, which involves contact to the shoulder or upper arm without an attempt to tackle. A player is guilty of misconduct if they use a shoulder charge, which is defined as when \\"a defender, without attempting to tackle, grab or hold the ball-carrier (or any opposing player) using the arms or hands, makes direct physical contact with the shoulder or the upper arm (tucked into the side).\\" == See also == * Penalty box * Glossary of rugby league terms * Glossary of rugby union terms * Dump tackle * Spear tackle == References == Category:Rugby league terminology Category:Rugby union terminology Category:Banned sports tactics ","title":"High tackle"},{"id":"63880384","text":"Helen Y. Chu is an American immunologist who is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington. Her research considers maternal immunization, with a focus on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chu was the first physician to recognise community transmission of the coronavirus disease within the United States. == Education and early career == Chu was born in Western China. Her grandparents were academics in Luoyang. Her parent and grandparents were sent to work in countryside labor camps, but as her father had been born in the United States, her parents immigrated to Southern California. In 2001 Chu completed her bachelor's degree at Cornell University. She spent one year as a visiting student at the University of Oxford. She moved to Duke University to train in medicine. Chu was a medical resident at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. In 2009 Chu was appointed to the faculty at Harvard University, before being awarded a fellowship at the University of Washington in 2011. During the first year of her fellowship, Chu encountered the fields of public health and epidemiology through her work on Influenza A virus subtype H1N1. == Research and career == Chu specializes in maternal immunization, with a particular focus on influenza and human orthopneumovirus. She is part of Seattle Flu Study, a multi-institutional community-wide virus surveillance platform that began in 2018. Traditionally, people rely on hospital admissions to know when the flu season begins and ends, but Chu believes that it spreads around the community through asymptomatic carriers who do not get admitted to hospital. As part of this study, Chu collects nasal swab samples from patients to better \\"detect, monitor, and control outbreaks\\" in Puget Sound. She makes use of a network of kiosks all around Seattle to collect these samples. She then sequences the genome of influenza viruses to track the flu as it moves around the city. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chu became concerned that human ‚Äì human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was occurring in Seattle. Whilst it would have been simple to repurpose the nasal swabs from the Seattle Flu Study to test for coronavirus disease, Chu was not given federal approval to do so. In an interview with The New York Times, Chu said, ‚ÄúWe felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge. We could help. We couldn‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù. In late February, Chu decided to test for coronavirus disease anyway, even without federal approval. Not long after she started testing, Chu identified a positive coronavirus disease test in a local teenager with no relevant travel history. Chu was the first physician in the United States to identify community transmission of coronavirus disease. Eric Feigl-Ding, epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that Chu ‚Äúis a true American hero, [who] actually broke this epidemic identified in Washington state when no one else wanted her to test for the virus,‚Äù. Despite this, Chu was told that she could not go on testing; because she did not have the correct clinical certification to run coronavirus disease tests. Chu believes that community transmission had occurred well before active surveillance began. The Seattle Flu Study partnered with public health officials to launch a Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, who collect nasal swabs from people across Seattle in an effort to understand the spread of coronavirus disease. Chu shifted her research to focus on the identification of patients who had become infected with SARS-CoV-2. In early March Chu was awarded permission from the Food and Drug Administration to start COVID-19 testing. She conducted an investigation into the prevalence of coronavirus disease, enrolling participants online and rapidly distributing home testing kits. Kits were delivered with same-day delivery, sometimes within hours of people registering on the site, and samples were analysed within two days. Alongside her own research program to better understand the transmission and biology of SARS- CoV-2, Chu is involved with the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 vaccine trials and clinical trials into the use of antiviral drugs. == Selected publications == * * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women virologists Category:Women immunologists Category:Cornell University alumni Category:American scientists of Chinese descent Category:21st-century American women scientists ","title":"Helen Y.

Portuguese Pioneers of Vietnamese Linguistics. Bangkok: Orchid Press, 2002. In the years between 1611 and 1617 he studied at St. Paul's College, Macau, where he was exposed to the works of Jo√£o Rodrigues T√ßuzu. The latter was a Portuguese Jesuit who had pioneered transliteration of Japanese into Latin alphabet using phonetics of the Portuguese language. Jo√£o Rodrigues T√ßuzu arrived in Macau from Japan in 1614, 6 years after completing his most famous work about Japanese grammar, Arte da Lingoa de Iapam. Francisco de Pina arrived in ƒê√†ng Trong (called Cochinchina by Europeans at the time) in 1617 in order to replace the Jesuit Diogo de Carvalho in the missionary work of evangelization developed together with the Italian Francesco Buzomi in modern Vietnam since 1615. At the time there were two Portuguese Jesuit residences in ƒê√†ng Trong: modern H·ªôi An and Qui Nh∆°n. Pina took residence in H·ªôi An, but his missionary work was spread between the two Jesuit missions. Francisco de Pina drowned at sea in modern C·ª≠a ƒê·∫°i on 15 December 1625 while trying to rescue guests on a wrecked boat. His body was buried in an unknown location in H·ªôi An. == Works == Although no works of Francisco de Pina survive today, he is considered to be the first European able to speak fluent Vietnamese, a skill which he used in his missionary work.Do, Quang Chinh, SJ. Dong Ten Trong Xa Hoi Dai Viet - The Society of Jesus in the Vietnamese Society. Montreal: Anton & Duoc Sang. 2007:72 Pina believed that such skill was a fundamental part of the evangelization work, and repeatedly accused his fellow clergymen of not acting in the same manner.Dror, Olga ed. Views of Seventeenth-century Vietnam, Christoforo Borri on Cochinchina and Samuel Baron on Tonkin. Ithaca, NY: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2006 Pina pioneered the method of recording the Vietnamese language with Latin characters, which forms the basis of modern Vietnamese alphabet, while teaching his disciples the Vietnamese language. The most famous of these is Alexandre de Rhodes, who published in 1651 in Rome the Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, a trilingual dictionary between Vietnamese, Portuguese and Latin compiled by Alexandre Rhodes from the work of various Portuguese Jesuits (among which Gaspar do Amaral, Ant√≥nio Barbosa, Ant√≥nio de Fontes and Francisco de Pina himself). Francisco de Pina compiled a first vocabulary of the Vietnamese language in 1619, and reported to his superiors having composed a treatise on orthography and phonetics in 1622 or 1623. Some scholarsZwartjes, Otto. Portuguese Missionary Grammars in Asia, Africa and Brazil, 1550-1800 . Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 2011 have argued that Pina is responsible for writing a grammar based on which Honufer B√ºrgin compiled and edited the text Manuductio ad Linguam Tunkinensem independently of the work of Alexandre de Rhodes. Other scholars have challenged this conclusion by gathering evidence that the Manuductio ad Linguam Tunkinensem was written by Philippus Sibin using the Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum of Alexandre de Rhodes as a reference. == References == Category:Portuguese translators Category:17th-century Portuguese Jesuits Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Translators to Vietnamese Category:Creators of writing systems Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century Jesuits Category:Jesuit missionaries in Vietnam Category:Jesuit missionaries Category:Portuguese expatriates in Vietnam Category:Portuguese Jesuits Category:Jesuit Asia missions Category:Jesuit missionaries in China Category:Missionary linguists Category:Linguists from Portugal Category:History of Catholicism in Vietnam Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Vietnam Category:1585 births Category:1625 deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:People from Guarda, Portugal ","title":"Francisco de Pina"},{"id":"63880441","text":"Arabella Jeffereyes (c. 1734 - c. 1810) was an Irish landowner and social radical. ==Early life== Arabella Jeffereyes was born Arabella Fitzgibbon around 1734. She was the eldest daughter of John and Elinor Fitzgibbon (n√©e Grove). She had two sisters and four brothers, with her youngest brother going on to be the Earl of Clare and Lord Chancellor of Ireland, John FitzGibbon. It appears that Jeffereyes was probably born at Sidbury, Devonshire, before her family moved to Limerick. On 5 June 1762 she married James St John Jeffereyes, a landowner who owned extensive lands including Blarney Castle. The couple had one son and four daughters, Marianne (died 14 Feb 1849), Albinia Jane, Emilia Jefferyes (died 1836), George Charles (died 1841), and Anne. ==Life and family== Jeffereyes positioned herself as one of the leading figures of Cork society and politics, particularly after the death of her husband in September 1780. She had fickle political sympathies, including supporting the Rightboys in County Cork in the late 1780s, allowing them to meet on her estate. She wrote letters to both Catholic and Protestant clergy calling on them to stop oppressing people. Many of her activities led to her being rebuked by her brother, John FitzGibbon. Due to her kind treatment of her tenants, she was known as \\"Lady\\" Jeffereyes, attempting to set the Church of Ireland tithes on her estates, organising marches on churches, and attempting unsuccessfully to arrange the drainage of a lake near Blarney Castle. She was regarded as eccentric by her peers, it is reported that she allowed widows to live rent- free until their eldest son came of age. She did not extend sympathy to criminals, she was the victim of highway robbery in London on 5 June 1784, during which a diamond pin was stolen. She testified at the trial of Robert Moore on 7 July, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. She considered herself a patron of the arts, financing the English actress Mrs Frances Abington. She championed the artist James Dowling Herbert, even when he considered abandoning painting for acting, she found him a position at a London theatre company. Despite the wealth her husband left her, Jeffereyes had financial difficulties, and in 1790 she was threatened with eviction from a house she rented and was only saved from this by her brother, who wanted to avoid any embarrassment. Later the same year, she attempted to secure the post of adjutant general for her son-in-law, Col. Stephen Freemantle, but this was refused by King George III. Her son, George Charles, married Anne the daughter of David La Touche. She arranged for the marriage of her daughter Emily to Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Glengall, having gone to great expense to arrange the match including rescuing Butler from a life of poverty in France. Her eldest daughter, Marianne or Mary Anne, married George Nugent, 7th Earl of Westmeath in 1784, but this marriage ended in divorce. Despite Marianne remarrying, Jeffereyes continued to claim Nugent as her son-in-law. In the 1790s, she broke with her brother FitzGibbon, after they quarrelled over land. Jeffereyes' son sold property to FitzGibbon but later regretted the sale, and Jeffereyes sided with her son against her brother. When FitzGibbon died in 1802, he disinherited her, denouncing her corrupt and dishonest character. She found herself with increasing financial difficulties, appealing to the Castle for a pension in 1807, claiming that she saved Clare from a mob in 1795 while disguised as a kitchen maid. The story was exaggerated but true, but was quietly ignored. ==Later life and death== She brought a lawsuit against her son and another man, David Foley, in 1810, accusing them of blackmail and libel. The co-plaintiff, Sophia, countess dowager of Annesley was represented by Sir Jonah Barrington, and it was claimed that Sophia had stated that Jeffereyes had murdered two patients at Simpson's hospital by poisoning them, a well as arranging the murder of another man to cover up the previous crime. An arrangement was reached out of court, so the case was dropped. In her final years, it is speculated that she may have succumbed to senility or insanity, with the date of her death going unrecorded. Jeffereyes is mentioned in Richard Alfred Milliken's song The groves of Blarney which lauds her as \\"Lady Jeffreys that owns this station/Like Alexander or Queen Helen fair/There's no commander throughout the nation/For emulation can with her compare\\". It has been interpreted as showing Jeffereyes as an anti-establishment and a radical hidden within the nonsensical verse. ==References== Category:1743 births Category:1810 deaths Category:Irish philanthropists Category:Women philanthropists ","title":"Arabella Jeffereyes"},{"id":"63880442","text":"Thankful Owen was an English academic in the mid 17th-century.\\"London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer‚Äù By Hugh Meller, H/ Parsons, B p16: Stroud, Gloucestershire; The History Press; 2011 Owen was born in London and educated at Exeter College, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Oade- Oxwick He was a Fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford from 1642 to 1650; and President of St John's College, Oxford from 1650 to 1660.

Willem- Alexander and M√°xima acceded to the Dutch throne on 30 April 2013 after the abdication of his mother, Queen Beatrix. ==Engagement== Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, eldest son and heir of Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus, met Argentine-born M√°xima Zorreguieta Cerruti at the Seville Fair in April 1999. He did not introduce himself as a prince, and when she later found out, she thought he was joking. Two weeks later, they met again in New York, where M√°xima was working as a banker for Kleinwort Benson. She did not meet his parents, Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus, for some time. As speed skating is one of the most popular sports, and Willem-Alexader is a good speed skater, he proposed to M√°xima on the ice on skates. A week earlier, Willem-Alexander already told his mother and Prime Minister Kok that he would propose to M√°xima soon. He endlessly practices the question, he told in an interview later. With hidden champagne and red roses by the pond of Huis ten Bosch, he invited M√°xima to go ice skating. While on the ice of the pond he proposed her in English, \\"to make sure she would understand it\\". M√°xima was surprised but answered directly with \\"yes\\". The intention was that the intended marriage remained a secret, so as not to get in the way of Willem-Alexander's brother Constantijn and Laurentien Brinkhorst, who would marry in May. Ultimately, it was too difficult to keep secret, so on 30 March 2001, Queen Beatrix announced her eldest son's engagement. On 21 May 2001, the bill seeking consent for the marriage was introduced in parliament. On 7 January 2002, the ondertrouw was published. Zorreguieta became a naturalized Dutch citizen, though she did not convert from Roman Catholicism. It was announced any children born of the marriage would be titled Prince/Princess of the Netherlands and Prince/Princess of Orange-Nassau, with the style of Royal Highness. ==Controversy== During the National Reorganization Process, Argentina's most recent dictatorship, Jorge Zorreguieta, M√°xima's father, served as Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. During this regime, an estimated 10,000‚Äì30,000 people were kidnapped and murdered during this and subsequent military regimes before democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983. Zorreguieta claimed he was unaware of the Dirty War while he was a cabinet minister. At the request of the States General, Michiel Baud, a Dutch professor in Latin American studies, carried out an inquiry into the involvement of Zorreguieta in the Dirty War. Baud determined that M√°xima's father had not been directly involved in any of the numerous atrocities that took place during that period. However, Baud also concluded that Zorreguieta was almost certainly aware of them; in Baud's view, it was highly unlikely that a cabinet minister would not have known about them.Human rights: Zorreguieta vs.humanrights , March 2001. Jorge Zorreguieta's presence at the wedding was debated for months. It was eventually concluded he would not attend. In solidarity, her mother chose not to attend. ==Pre-wedding celebrations== On 31 January, Queen Beatrix's 64th birthday, there was a black-tie dinner and ball at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam for 500 guests to celebrate the impending wedding and The Queen's birthday. The day before the wedding, there was a lunch and concert at the Royal Concertgebouw attended by 1,600 guests. That evening, the couple attend an event organized by the National Orange Committee and the municipality of Amsterdam in the Amsterdam ArenA. About 50,000 people from every Dutch municipality were invited. ==Wedding== ===Civil ceremony=== Per Dutch law, the couple were first required to be married in a civil ceremony. This was performed by Job Cohen, Major of Amsterdam, at the Beurs van Berlage prior to the religious ceremony. The civil ceremony was attended by friends and family of the couple, dignitaries and some 600 invited guests. Witnesses for the Prince of Orange were his brother, Prince Constantijn, and friends Marc ter Haar and Frank Houben. Witnesses for Zorreguieta Cerruti were her new mother-in-law, Queen Beatrix, her aunt, Marcela Cerruti Carricart, and her brother, Mart√≠n Zorreguieta Cerruti. ===Religious ceremony=== The Dutch Reformed Church ceremony took place in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam. The Reverend Carel ter Linden, Minister Emeritus of the Kloosterkerk, The Hague, officiated. Music Music during the service was provided by Bernard Winsemius, organist, Miranda van Kralingen, soprano, the Nederlands Kamerkoor and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, conducted by Ed Spanjaard. Prior to the service, pieces by B√∂hm, Bach and Scheidemann were played on the organ. The bride and groom entered the church together to Entrata Festiva, which was composed by Dutch composer Jurriaan Andriessen for the wedding of Prince Willem-Alexander's parents in 1966. Throughout the service, a number of Dutch hymns were sung. Kyrie from Mozart's Mass in C major, K. 337 \\"Solemnis\\" and Schubert's Ave Maria were also performed. The recessional was \\"Hallelujah\\" from Handel's Messiah. In honour of the bride's parents, who were absent, Adi√≥s Nonino, an Argentine tango by Astor Piazzolla was played. ===Attendants=== The bride was attended by four adult bridesmaids: * Valeria Delger, the bride's childhood friend * Juliana Guillermo, the groom's maternal first cousin * Baroness Theresa von der Recke, the groom's paternal first cousin * In√©s Zorreguieta, the bride's sister Two child bridesmaids: * Princess Pauline of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein * Countess Leonie of Waldburg-Zeil-Hohenems Four pageboys: * Jonkheer Paulo Alting von Geusau * Baron Johann-Casper von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen * Mr Alexandre Friling * Mr Floris ter Haar ===Clothing=== The bride wore a gown of ivory mikado silk, with a cowl neckline, three-quarter sleeves and a five- metre-long train designed and created by Valentino. The skirt was inset with panels of embroidered lace at the sides, flaring slightly from a close-fitting empire-line bodice. Her veil, also a Valentino creation, was of silk tulle and hand-embroidered with a flower and tendril motifs. The court jeweller adapted the Dutch Pearl Button Tiara by exchanging the pearl buttons with five diamond stars which belonged to Queen Emma. The bride carried a cascading bouquet of white roses, gardenias, lilies of the valley and two kinds of foliage. The Prince wore the full dress uniform of a Captain in the Royal Netherlands Navy. He wore the riband and star of a Knight Grand Gross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion, the star of a Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau, the Officers' Cross and the Queen Beatrix Inauguration Medal, 1980. ===Procession and reception=== After the service, the bride and groom drove through the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, Spui, Singel, Muntplein and the Rokin in the Golden Coach. The couple then returned to the Royal Palace and appeared on the balcony above Dam Square. They then proceeded to a luncheon reception. ==Guests== ===Relatives of the groom=== House of Orange- Nassau * The Queen and Prince Consort, the groom's parents ** Prince Friso, the groom's brother ** Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien, the groom's brother and sister-in-law * Prince Bernhard, the groom's maternal grandfather ** Princess Irene, the groom's maternal aunt *** The Prince of Piacenza, the groom's first cousin *** The Count of Bardi, the groom's first cousin *** The Marchioness of Sala, the groom's first cousin ** Princess Margriet and Mr Pieter van Vollenhoven, the groom's maternal uncle and aunt *** Prince Maurits and Princess Maril√®ne of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, the groom's first cousin and his wife *** Prince Bernhard and Princess Annette of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, the groom's first cousin and his wife *** Prince Pieter-Christiaan of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, the groom's first cousin *** Prince Floris of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, the groom's first cousin ** Princess Christina, the groom's maternal aunt *** Mr Bernardo Guillermo, the groom's first cousin *** Mr Nicol√°s Guillermo, the groom's first cousin *** Miss Juliana Guillermo, the groom's first cousin (bridesmaid) House of Amsberg * Jonkvrouw Sigrid Jencquel, the groom‚Äôs paternal aunt ** Mr and Mrs Joachim Jencquel, the groom‚Äôs first cousin and his wife * Baroness Theda and Baron Karl von Friesen, the groom‚Äôs paternal aunt and uncle ** Baron Alexander von Friesen, the groom‚Äôs first cousin ** Baroness Renate von Friesen, the groom‚Äôs first cousin ** Baroness Isabell von Friesen, the groom‚Äôs first cousin * Baroness Christina and Baron Hans von der Recke, the groom‚Äôs paternal aunt and uncle ** Baroness Katinka von der Recke, the groom‚Äôs first cousin ** Baroness Sophie von der Recke, the groom‚Äôs first cousin ** Baroness Theresa von der Recke, the groom‚Äôs first cousin (bridesmaid) ===Relatives of the bride=== Due to the controversy surrounding her father's alleged involvement in Argentina's Dirty War, the bride's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, was not invited.

It has been available since 24 September 2020 for Android and iOS smartphones, and can be used by anyone aged 16 or over. Two versions of the app have been created. The first was commissioned by NHSX and developed by the Pivotal division of American software company VMware. A pilot test programme was begun in May 2020, but on 18 June development of the app was abandoned in favour of a new design using the Apple/Google Exposure Notification system. Scotland and Northern Ireland have launched separate contact tracing apps. == Description == The app allows users to: * Check the risk level of their local authority area (in England) or their country (Wales), which is displayed as low, medium or high; to enable this, the user must enter the first half of their postcode * \\"Check in\\" at places displaying an NHS QR code poster * Be notified when they have been in close contact (within 2 metres for 15 minutes, or for a longer time at up to 4 metres) with someone who has tested positive for the virus * Be notified when local health protection teams determine that people with the virus have attended a business or other venue around the same time as the user * Check their symptoms, and book a coronavirus test if necessary * If asked to self- isolate, receive information and a daily \\"countdown\\". === Implementation === The Android app is coded in Kotlin, and the iOS app in Swift. The backend uses Java and is deployed to Amazon Web Services using Terraform. ==Context== The app was part of the UK's test and trace programme which is chaired by Dido Harding; since 12 May 2020 Tom Riordan, chief executive of Leeds City Council, has led the tracing effort. == First phase and cancellation == ===Description=== In March 2020, NHSX commissioned a contact tracing app to monitor the spread in the United Kingdom of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the 2020 pandemic, developed by the Pivotal division of American software company VMware. The app used a centralised approach, in contrast to the Google / Apple contact tracing project. NHSX consulted ethicists and GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) about the privacy aspects. The app recorded the make and model of the phone and asked the user for their postcode area. It generated a unique installation identification number and also a daily identification number. It then used Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the daily identification number of other users nearby. If a user was unwell, they could tell the app about symptoms which are characteristic of COVID-19, such as a fever and cough. These details were then passed to a central NHS server. This would assess the information and notify other users that have been in contact, giving them appropriate advice such as physical distancing. The NHS would also arrange for a swab test of the unwell user and the outcome would determine further notifications to contacts: if the test confirmed infection with COVID-19, the contacts would be asked to isolate. By June, ¬£11.8 million had been spent on the app. === Deployment === The first public trial of the app began on the Isle of Wight on 5 May 2020 and by 11 May it had been downloaded 55,000 times. When the first national contact tracing schemes were launched on 28 May ‚Äì NHS Test and Trace in England, Test and Protect in Scotland ‚Äì the app was not ready to be included. Replying to a question at the government's daily briefing on 8 June, Hancock was unable to give a date for rollout of the app in England, saying it would be brought in \\"when it's right to do so\\". On 17 June, Lord Bethell, junior minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said \\"we're seeking to get something going before the winter ... it isn't a priority for us at the moment\\". On 18 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced development would switch to the Apple/Google system after admitting that Apple's restrictions on usage of Bluetooth prevented the app from working effectively. At the same press briefing Dido Harding, leader of the UK's test and trace programme, said \\"What we've done in really rigorously testing both our own Covid-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well enough to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world\\". === Key people === Within NHSX, the project was led by CEO Matthew Gould and Geraint Lewis. Around 17 June, Gould and Lewis returned to their other duties, and Simon Thompson ‚Äì chief product officer at online supermarket Ocado and a former Apple executive ‚Äì was brought in to manage the project. === Concerns === The first, ultimately rejected version of the app was subject to privacy concerns, the government backtracking on initial statements that the data collected from the app would not be shared outside the NHS. Matthew Gould, CEO of NHSX, the government department responsible for the app, said the data would be accessible to other organisations, but did not disclose which. Data collected would not necessarily be anonymised and would be held in a centralised repository. Over 150 of the UK's security and privacy experts warned the app's data could be used by 'a bad actor (state, private sector, or hacker)' to spy on citizens. Fears were discussed by the House of Commons' Human Rights Select Committee about plans for the app to record user location data. Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights said this version of the app should not be released without proper privacy protections. The second version of the app, released nationwide, addressed these concerns by employing a decentralised framework, the Apple/Google Exposure Notification system. Under this system, users remain pseudonymous: a person diagnosed with COVID-19 does not know which people are informed about an encounter, and contacted persons do not receive any information about the person diagnosed with COVID-19. The functionality of the app was also questioned in late April and early May 2020, as the software's use of Bluetooth required the app to be constantly running, meaning users could not use other apps or lock their device if the app was to function properly. The developers of the app were said to have found a way of working around this restriction. === Related contracts === Faculty ‚Äì a company linked to Cambridge Analytica ‚Äì provided research and modelling to NHSX in support of the response to the pandemic. Palantir, also linked to Cambridge Analytica, provided their data management platform. These contracts began in February and March respectively. == Second phase == A venue poster showing a QR code to use with the NHS COVID-19 app As outlined on cancellation of the first app on 18 June, the Department of Health and Social Care published on 30 July a brief description of the \\"next phase\\" app. Users would be able to scan a QR code at venues they visit, and later be notified if they had visited a place which was the source of a number of infections; the app would also assist with identifying symptoms and ordering a test. By using the Exposure Notification system from Apple and Google, personal data would be decentralised. Testing of the app by NHS volunteer responders, and selected residents of the Isle of Wight and the London Borough of Newham, began around 13 August. The app was made available to the public (aged 16 or over) in England and Wales on 24 September. === Statistics === The app was downloaded six million times on the first day it was generally available (24 September 2020), and after a little over three days the total exceeded 10 million. After approximately two weeks the app had been downloaded around 16 million times, and Sky News reported that only one alert for an outbreak linked to a venue had been sent. === Limitations === At first, users found they could not enter a positive infection test into the app if the test had been arranged outside the app, such as tests carried out as part of surveys or by NHS hospitals or clinics. This issue was addressed quickly, and from 27 September users could request a code from NHS Test and Trace which they could use to log a positive result. However, the app remained unable to recognise negative results from these tests. ==See also== *NHS app ‚Äì general- purpose app *COVID Symptom Study ‚Äì non-NHS symptom tracking in the UK *COVID-19 apps ‚Äì all countries ==References* Press release for launch of app, 24 September 2020 Category:2020 software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom Category:E-government in the United Kingdom Category:IOS software Category:Mobile applications Category:Privacy Category:COVID-19 contact tracing apps ","title":"NHS COVID-19"},{"id":"63880670","text":"Pacuare-Matina Forest Reserve (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Caribbean La Amistad Conservation Area, it was created in 1973 by decree 2886-A. == References == Category:Costa Rica Category:Protected areas Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1973 ","title":"Pacuare-Matina Forest Reserve"},{"id":"63880681","text":"Knoellia flava is a species of Gram positive, nonmotile, non-sporeforming bacteria.

Disciple of Greek historian Fotios Malleros, he is considered by experts as the first Latin American Byzantinist. His works on history of Byzantium specifically addressing two areas: foreign relations and Byzantine art. At Universidad de Chile, his alma mater, he taught regular courses and was Universidad de Chile Center for Byzantine and Neohellenic Studies co-founder, Latin America's only institution of its kind. Later, he was a professor at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so (PUCV) and Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (PUC) since 1954. Among the many works published by Herrera Cajas, one of his more important articles are \\"Tacitus' Germany. The problem of the meaning of the shield\\" (1957) and \\"Res Privata‚ÄìRes publica‚ÄìImperium\\" (1977). The first article cited is considered by experts as a pioneering study of history of mentalities in Chilean historiography. There, he thoroughly examines Tacitus work in order to analyze what symbolized the shield in early Germans. Since this he project their customs towards medieval history. In words of his disciple Jos√© Mar√≠n, he makes \\"the source speak in a really remarkable way, since Tacitus himself says little about the subject in question\\". Meanwhile, the second mentioned article examines in a conceptual way the Roman institutions trajectory since its foundation in 753 B.C. until the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In work development, it addresses private world particularities and its relationship with public institutions that, at Empire's end, would perish to re-privatize themselves socially. This re- privatization, exposed Herrera, occurred due to influence exerted then by Germanic peoples with their private institutions and completely discards the theories of rupture or continuity between one world and another. Since 1958, Herrera Cajas studied Byzantine Civilization topics as its imperial ideology foundations, its relations with Church, art as one of its central elements, its imperial power symbols, the palatial ceremonial or its dynamics in its foreign affairs mainly with the Frankish Kingdom and Abbasid Caliphate. Among his most notable works are \\"Imperial power symbology in Byzantium: the crowns' earrings\\" (1993‚Äì1996) or \\"The Eurasian steppes: a peculiar historical space\\" (1982), a work that has as putative daughter \\"The steppe towns and Byzantine art foundation: from tent to Christian church\\" (1990). He was Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion (UMCE) Rector (1986‚Äì1989). There he founded the Classical Studies Center. A few days after his death, Universidad Finis Terrae opened the celebration of Jornadas de Historia H√©ctor Herrera Cajas. In 1989 he was accepted as a full member of Academia Chilena de la Historia. Since November 1997, PUCV History Institute's main classroom holds his name. Among his influenced students is National History Prize, Gabriel Salazar, who in 2006, year he received the award, after affirming Mario G√≥ngora was influential in him \\"for his academic quality\\" maintained that he preferred Herrera Cajas \\"for his human quality and his quality in the way he used to made lessons\\". This appreciation wasn't exempt from antagonistic political thought between both, since Salazar was a MIR member while Herrera Cajas was a staunch opponent to 1960s rebel movements. Likewise, once military dictatorship (1973‚Äì1990) occurred, during its course he was an ally of Chilean Ministry of Education doctrinal line at a time when the institution was aligned with General Augusto Pinochet. ==Biography & Academic career== ===Early life, rise and political tensions=== Born in Pelequ√©n, town located on south of Capital city Santiago, he made his first studies at Hermanos Maristas School from San Fernando, Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region. There, he highlighted as outstanding student with drawing skills according to their marks report. Being very young his teaching vocation was already manifested, so that during his last years in school he served as a mathematics teacher in an afternoon establishment. He moved to Santiago once finished his high-school education and in 1948 he joined Universidad de Chile, when he graduated from there in 1953 as History, Geography and Social Sciences Teacher. Apart his regular and compulsory courses, he devoted interest, time, and enthusiasm towards study of languages, specifically Latin, Greek, German and even Sanskrit. In addition, he became an English, French and Italian fluent speaker. He also was interested in Chinese, Arab and Russian, but he didn't reach to dominate them. His philology studies were decisive in his intellectual training. Around his classes, according Jos√© Mar√≠n (one of his students and close friend in his life), the etymology of words used to were key in his narration of history. During his undergraduate period, Herrera was notably influenced by teachers like Eugenio Pereira, Mario G√≥ngora, Juan G√≥mez Millas or Fotios Malleros. In 1953, Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so (PUCV) hired him with the goal to organize its then nascent History Institute. In 1960, he became PUCV Faculty of Philosophy and Education Dean and, default, Colegio Rub√©n Castro Rector due to that institution's dependence from Faculty already mentioned. He continued his studies in Germany (1957‚Äì1958), where he visited several universities. On his return, and after having married Mrs. Ivonne Lavanchy, a member of the Fulbright Commission in 1967, he traveled to Washington DC to dedicate to research for seven months at the Dumbarton Oaks, world's most important Byzantine study center. There, he met prominent Byzantinists. The following year, accompanied by his family, he traveled to France, where he obtained his PhD at University of Bordeaux. That year, Herrera was a May 68 witness and, by the way, his epistolary shows how he tenaciously opposed the so-called ‚ÄúReform‚Äù that parallelly was carried out in Chile. This reform was promoted by christian-democrat government of President Eduardo Frei Montalva (DC), whose party was involved in 1968 PUCV Rector Elections. This election had as candidates to Alberto Vial, near to Achitecture, and Ra√∫l Allard Newmann (DC), the future winner. Despite his reform opposition, according Alejandro Guzm√°n Brito in 2013 Roman Studies Week, he supported Vial through his collaboration with Oscar Godoy, with whom he met in Arica.Homenaje a H√©ctor Herrera Cajas XXV; Minute 17:04 ===Academic maturity=== Cover of Roman Studies Week first volume published in 1977. Despite his discomfort in then-rebellious France, he finished his thesis on Byzantine Empire international relations during migration period. This work was published in 1972 in Santiago by Universidad de Chile Center for Byzantine and Neohellenic Studies, being Chile's first work of its kind published as well as in Latin America, which in Mar√≠n words: \\"Its a study of great intellectual rigor, with an impeccable critical apparatus which all existing sources for the subject are cited and commented; in short, its a highest level research which has deservedly placed its author among most important Byzantinists of (20th) century second half\\". His thesis was the only one work in Spanish language which German historian G√ºnther Weiss included in his specialized bibliographic repertoire. This includes everything relevant that occurred in Byzantinistics between 1968 and 1985. Weiss points out: \\"On Byzantine and Neohellenic Studies Centre publication in Santiago, scholar Professor H√©ctor Herrera Cajas presents all the (Byzantine) important diplomatic relations at great migrations time, treated from Persian border to Danube. The text is worked directly from sources and illustrates very well each moment's political background. Byzantine diplomacy oscillates between demand for universality, and harshest, often painful and distressing\\". It should be noted for other works included in his repertoire, Weiss hardly makes a comment on a few words or, at most, a phrase. In 1973, at PUCV he released Roman Studies Week which is currently held every one year and has become one of Latin America's most prestigious academic exchange relative to History of ancient Rome. Herrera presented works in each of the seasons of Roman Studies Week celebrated between 1973 and 1997. It occurred the same with Medieval Studies Colloquia, which since 1990 has been held every two years in Chill√°n. In 1976, the PUCV Federation of Students elected him as \\"best teacher\\". In 1986, XVII Byzantine International Congress' Administrative Committee, held in Dumbarton Oaks, accepted his presentation on \\"The Steppe Peoples and Byzantine Art Formation: From the Tent to Christian Church\\", but its author didn't could attend to read it. In 1989, he was accepted as Chilean Academy of History's Full Member. In 1992, the Government of Greece decorated him as Commander of the Order of the Phoenix in appreciation for permanent work of Greek culture spreading values in our country. In 1995, now officially invited by the Government of Greece, he visited Balkans Peninsula's country, having the opportunity to personally admire the most important Byzantine monuments. During that trip he met Nicolas Oikonomides, then Director of Center for Byzantine Studies in Athens and who, later, would write commendable words of remembrance, which were published in the book Dimensions of Byzantine Culture (1998). ===Death=== On October 6th, 1997, he died of myocardial infarction at Vina del Mar. The Italian historian, Umberto Laffi, in a condolences letter sent to then PUCV Rector, Bernardo Donoso, stated: \\"The sad news of Prof. H√©ctor Herrera death has deeply moved us. His loss is a severe blow to Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so and, more generally, to Ancient History in Chile, and leaves a feeling of deep affliction in those of us who were fortunate enough to enjoy its high human qualities on memorable occasions.The Roman Studies Week, which he founded and continued to organize with self- denial and a high concept of value of classic studies for many years, constitute a lasting monument that has our universities linked in a scientific set of profitable relationships and exchanges. The efforts that we will continue dedicating together with pursuit of his work will represent fairest tribute to his memory\\". ==Political views== Herrera Cajas supported Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo in 1950s and he was also part of Jorge Prat's candidacy in 1964 elections. ==Scholar legacy== This section aims to bring together the most varied appreciations of his pupils, that is, various historians who, having formed different epistemological or political-ideological conceptions, recognize the teaching work that Herrera Cajas projected in his professional career. ===Impression of his disciples=== Eduardo Cavieres, 2008 Chilean History Prize. Eduardo Cavieres Historian Eduardo Cavieres, student and assistant of Herrera Cajas at Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so History Institute, told about his teacher: Gabriel Salazar Marxist historian and 2006 Chilean Historiy Prize, Gabriel Salazar, was assistant of Herrera Cajas during his years at university. Historian Gabriel Salazar, assistant of Herrera Cajas at Universidad de Chile, highlighted the human quality of his teacher and his way to teach the lessons despite his different political positions. ==Works== ===Books=== * El mundo del ayer.

Despite being well resourced, Katzianer's army failed to achieve any objectives and it was ultimately completely annihilated in the Battle of Gorjani. == Background == After Hungarian defeat in the Battle of Mohacs, Croatian nobility elected Ferdinand I Habsburg as their new king in the Diet of Cetingrad, while Hungarian and Slavonian nobility elected John Zapolya, which plummeted the kingdom into a civil war between two rival kings. By 1528 Ferdinand managed to gain the upper hand over Zapolya in Hungary, however, Zapolya in turn swore an oath to the Ottoman sultan and became his vassal. By spring of 1537, Ferdinand decided to take more decisive effort against the Ottomans so he sent his seasoned commander Johann Katzianer to Kri≈æevci to assemble an army and make preparations for the conquest of Osijek, which was supposed to cut the way for the Ottoman forces between Belgrade and Hungary and prevent their further advance to western Slavonia. == The Campaign == In August 1537 Katzianer's army was encamped near Kri≈æevci and in September they started marching eastwards towards Virovitica. Disagreements soon inflamed between Katzianer and Schlick over the command of the troops as well as between Czech and Styrian soldiers in the army. By September 10 Katzianer's forces reached Virovitica where they ran out of food and became further eroded by maladies due to the autumn rains. By mid September, the army reached Valpovo where they started making preparations for a strike on Osijek, however, Ottomans sent a 5,000 strong reinforcement to the town which mitigated Katzianer's chances for a regular siege. After achieving nothing near Osijek, the army attempted to withdraw back to Valpovo, however Ottomans had cut off their way so instead they decided to maneuver southwest into swampy areas around Vuka river, while also being constantly harassed by the Ottoman attacks. By October 7, the hungry and exhausted army reached Gorjani, hoping to march north towards Valpovo in search for food, however remaining troops found out that Katzianer and some other leading commanders had already deserted them. The remnants of this army were crushed by the Ottomans in the ensuing Battle of Gorjani. == Aftermath == Disaster of this campaign enraged Emperor Ferdinand so Katzianer was tried for cowardice and thrown in prison. He subsequently escaped prison and killed a peasant along the way, only to be captured and executed in 1539 on orders of Nikola IV Zrinski. == Sources == * Kacijaner, Ivan, Croatian Encyclopedia * Klaiƒá, Vjekoslav, History of the Croats (Povijest Hrvata), Matica hrvatska, 1988. * Category:Battles involving Habsburg Croatia Category:16th century military history of Croatia Category:Battles involving Croatia ","title":"Katzianer's Campaign"},{"id":"63880771","text":"Eminem 1999 Eminem is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is considered to be one of the greatest hip hop artists of all time. His success and acclaimed pieces of work during his height of fame in the early 2000s was recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Being highly successful in an art form developed by African Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans, Eminem's reception as one of the greatest rappers of all time has made him hugely important in 21st century popular music. Rolling Stone ranked Eminem 83rd on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 91st on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In 2011, Eminem was called the \\"King of Hip-Hop\\" by Rolling Stone, based on analyzed album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011. ==Influences== Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \\"The Message\\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run‚ÄìD.M.C., Rakim, DMX, Jadakiss, Nas, Raekwon and Boogie Down Productions. In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \\"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \\"workaholic\\" and \\"stacking\\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop.

Since 2010 she has flown Boeing 777-200F freighters, initially as a Senior First Officer and as a Captain since 2019. She achieved wider media prominence in 2018-2020 when she revealed that she had secured the necessary financial and logistical backing to go into space as a space tourist, probably in 2021. ==Early life and career== Maislinger was brought up in the small town of Bad Goisern, Upper, Austria. Her family own a substantial catering and hospitality business, based on Bad Goisern and the neighboring town of Bad Ischl. In 2004, she was accepted to attend the Lufthansa Group Flight School to train as a commercial pilot. After graduating in 2006, she joined Austrian Airlines as a First Officer and flew Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft on short-haul routes across Europe. She also completed a Bachelor's Degree in Technology Engineering. In 2009, she successfully applied to join the fledgling cargo carrier Aerologic, and she began flying their Boeing 777-200F aircraft on long-haul services from Leipzig and Frankfurt, to Asia and the United States. Maislinger initially served as a Senior First Officer, before being promoted to Relief Captain, in 2011, when she was only 25, and to full Captain in 2019. In 2013, she began part-time study at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Medical School, for a doctorate in medicine, a course which usually takes six years to complete, when studied full-time. The main purpose of this direction was the enable her to eventually apply to the European Space Agency as an astronaut. It is expected that ESA will begin their next round of astronaut recruitment in early 2021.http://www.esa.int/About_Us/EAC/EAC_Frequently_Asked_Questions ==German female astronaut project== In March 2016, the German Aerospace recruitment agency HESpace launched a private campaign called Die Astronautin, which had the objective of finding, and flying, a German female astronaut, before 2020. The organizers hoped to find corporate and private sponsors, who would finance a flight on a Russian, or American spacecraft. Maislinger was one of 400 applicants, who would be reduced to two finalists, based on selection process overseen by the German Space Agency DLR. Although she was Austrian, she had lived, worked and studied in Germany for many years, and hoped to obtain German citizenship before the final two finalists were chosen. However, before her nationality became a major issue, Maislinger was eliminated, after reaching the final 30 candidates. ==Space tourist project== In April 2017, after leaving the Die Astronautin project she revealed, via her social media network, that she had been invited to participate in another 'woman in space' project, which would see her sent into space on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2019. The transaction was to be facilitated by the American company Space Adventures. Her main sponsor was said be an unknown, wealthy benefactor, based in Berlin. Other supporters, or sponsors, connected to the project included the Austrian company Red Bull, and their associate company Red Bull TV. In the event, the only available Soyuz seat, in 2019, was sold to the United Arab Emirates Government. After Space Adventures announced a new Space Tourism flight, in February 2019,. which would fly as Soyuz MS-20 in December 2021, Maislinger's name was immediately linked to the project. In private correspondence with spaceflight author and researcher, Tony Quine, Space Adventures confirmed that Maislinger was a client, who was in contention for the Soyuz MS-20 spaceflight. In August 2020, Quine received confirmation that Johanna Maislinger is one of two space tourists who will fly on a visiting expedition to the ISS in December 2021 on the Soyuz MS-20 spacecraft under a contract with Space Adventures. The only previous Austrian to fly in space was engineer Franz Viehb√∂ck who participated in the AustroMir 91 project, launched on Soyuz TM-13 in 1991. ==Personal life== Away from her professional life, and studies, Maislinger regards herself as a versatile Extreme Sports specialist. She holds aerobatics and seaplane pilot ratings, also participating in mountaineering, climbing, sky-diving, cross-country skiing and horse-riding. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people ","title":"Johanna Maislinger"},{"id":"63880837","text":"≈†tefan Moln√°r (born 4 November 1994) is a Slovak footballer who plays for M≈†K Hurbanovo as a forward. ==Club career== ===Spartak Trnava=== In the winter of 2020, Moln√°r had made a surprising transfer to Spartak Trnava, arriving from semi-professional FK Vlƒçany, competing in 4th tier.

His academic career was mainly developed in Chile. ==Biography== He studied at University of Athens, graduating there as a philologist and historian. Juan G√≥mez Millas, a Chilean politician then Universidad de Chile Faculty of Philosophy and Letters Dean, arrived his country in 1947. Initially he taught there, at the Pedagogical Institute, teaching courses on Greek language, history and literature. Although in Chile there was already, since colonial times, a remarkable academic dedication around Classical Age themes, the specific study of Byzantium had not reached the depth that it achieved with Malleros' work and academic activity, who dedicated his life to Byzantinology, both through the publication of specialized books and articles, as well as outreach and extension works, including conferences and even broadcasting programs. His work played a central role so that Byzantinology main works published in Europe and United States were known in Chile, where until then were practically unknown in its intellectual circles. His book's publication, The Byzantine Empire, 395‚Äì1204, marked a milestone for Latin American Byzantinology, since for the first time there was a manual on the history of Byzantium in Spanish and published in Latin America. The book was transformed into a standard didactic work and was republished in 1987. He collaborated in 1953 in carrying out the first extension course on the subject (under the title \\"Byzantium and Western Culture\\") at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so. Likewise, in 1958, five hundred six years after Fall of Constantinople, he held the first Byzantine Week sponsored by that institution. In 1968, Malleros promoted the creation of Universidad de Chile Center for Greek, Byzantine and Neohellenic Studies. This university institution, which has been officially named after it since 1998, receives sponsorship from Greek state through an annual contribution to its financing. Inicially, that contribution was managed by him. The center, which has a library of several thousand volumes, mostly in greek language, has edited several works on its area of study, in addition to publishing magazine Byzantion Nea Hell√°s. ==See also== * H√©ctor Herrera Cajas ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1914 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Greek historians Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:People from Athens Category:20th-century historians ","title":"Fotios Malleros"},{"id":"63880899","text":"right Book of the Wyrm is a 1993 role-playing game supplement for Werewolf: The Apocalypse published by White Wolf Publishing. ==Contents== Book of the Wyrm is a sourcebook containing information on The Wyrm, foe of the Garou Nation. ==Reception== The reviewer from the online second volume of Pyramid stated that \\"Starting with a short story entitled \\"Ill Winds,\\" the book is packed full of attitude, information, and background of the Wyrm.

The brigade only accepted members who had left Cuba in their youth through parental decision and did not participate in anti-Castro activities while in the United States. Many of the members were children of Operation Pedro Pan and had been active in social movements in the United States as well as having garnered sympathies for the Cuban government. Many were contributors the magazines Joven Cuba and Areito which both catered to Cuban Americans that favored dialogue with Cuba. ===First trip to Cuba=== On December 22, 1977 the brigade took their first trip to Cuba, on the request of the Cuban government after President Jimmy Carter briefly lifted the travel ban with Cuba. The travelers were 55 Cuban exiles, because Cuba would only authorize 55 passports. During the group's two week visit they would be meet by cheering crowds, take tours, become involved in volunteer labor, and visit family. The visit was recorded by Cuban filmmakers and released in the film 55 Hermanos which detailed the visitors searches for cultural and political identity, as well as the suffering their exile has caused. The film was widely screened across Cuba, and the vilified \\"gusano\\" image of Cuban exiles faded from popularity. While some of the original brigadistas asked to permanently return to Cuba, Fidel Castro refused and believed they could be more useful to Cuba by politically dividing the exile community in the United States. ===Dialogue and continued trips=== After the visit Fidel Castro would call for dialogues with Cuban exiles abroad. These dialogues resulted in the release of political prisoners, family unifications, and relaxing of restrictions to visit Cuba. The Antonio Maceo Brigade was formally organized in 1978 after the first travelers return. The formal organization would be modeled after the Venceremos Brigade but only offered trips to Cuban exiles regardless of background. The trips are meant for the visitors to reconnect with family, assist in projects in Cuba, and evaluate the island for themselves. Many of the travelers that joined after the original trip were less politically homogeneous. The travelers were still notably counter-cultural, soft drug users, pacifists, and LGBT rights advocates. The Cuban government was uncomfortable with the beliefs and cultural practices many travelers held and tried to instill ideological purity tests in the organization. The organization resisted the demand for these tests, and the Cuban government discouraged contact between exile travelers and Cuban youth. Various Cuban exiles have traveled to Cuba with the organization's assistance and the organization continues to exist today. ==Legacy== ===Politics of Cuban exiles=== After their original trip to Cuba, militant anti-communist factions of the Cuban exile community criticized their visit. In 1979 Carlos Mu√±iz Varela would be assassinated in Puerto Rico. To both Cubans and Americans, Cuban exiles were seen less as a solid anti- communist conservative bloc. The plurality of Cuban exile politics became more apparent to the public. The brigade also opened a space for the involvement of Cuban Americans in leftist politics. Within the Cuban exile community a larger debate opened about the benefits of the 1978 dialogue with Cuba. ===Members=== Many members would later become disillusioned with their hopes for Cuba, and lose their revolutionary sympathies. One former member Elsa Alvarez would be arrested in 2006 for allegedly spying for Cuba whil working at Florida International University. ==See also== * CubaOne Foundation * Venceremos Brigade ==References== ==External links== *Brigada Antonio Maceo Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:DePaul University Special Collections and Archives holdings Category:Cuban-American history Category:Hispanic and Latino American organizations Category:Cuba solidarity groups Category:New Left ","title":"Antonio Maceo Brigade"},{"id":"63881050","text":"Escapar may refer to: *\\"Escapar\\", a song by Kudai from Vuelo (album), 2004 *\\"Escapar\\", the Spanish-language version of \\"Escape\\" (Enrique Iglesias song), 2001 ","title":"Escapar"},{"id":"63881072","text":"Saksumdal Church is a long church of 1875 in Lillehammer municipality, Innlandet county, Norway.

Pedersen and Kristian Svendsrud, a mason and carpenter respectively, started work on the building after other local people made timber and manpower available. The chapel, now referred to as a church, did not have a furnace in its early years as it was lacking a brick flue. It was dedicated on August 26, 1875, by Halvor Olsen Folkestad. ==Building== The building has undergone several renovations. Power was added in 1928 and sacristies were built in 1934. It was remodelled again in 1951 and leaded glass windows were added. The pulpit had painted figures of the evangelists added in 1953 and the backs of the church benches were sealed in 1954. Later renovations added a basement, outbuilding and flood lighting. A wheelchair ramp was added in the 1980s. ==Interior== The altarpiece was made by Kristian Svendsrud and given to the church as a gift by landowner Anders Hovland. The first organ was installed in 1895 and has now been replaced with a new one. In the 1980s the altar was adorned with textiles by textile artist Inger Holb√∏, who also made trade fairs.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Systime become the second largest British manufacturer of computers, specializing in the minicomputer market. The company was based in Leeds, England, and founded in 1973. Its success was based on selling systems built around OEM components from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and it grew to have over 1,300 employees with turnover peaking around ¬£60 million. Systime was unusual among systems integrators in that it actually manufactured the hardware it sold to customers. Systime Computers then fell on quite difficult times, in part due to lawsuits from DEC for intellectual property infringement, and even more so due to running afoul of Cold War-era U.S. export restrictions regarding indirect sales to Eastern Bloc countries. In 1985, what was left of Systime was acquired by Control Data Corporation, and a year later the DEC-related services part of that subsidiary was bought by DEC. Systime then focused on selling products built by its own engineers. The Systime‚ÄìControl Data arrangement did not prosper, and in 1989 Control Data split Systime into four companies, each sold to a management buyout. ==Origins== John Gow was a mechanical engineering graduate of the University of Leeds who had gone into computer programming and then became a software support manager at a Lancashire office of the British subsidiary of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). He also did some hardware sales work, and realized that few of the customers he was selling to actually understood the capabilities of the computers they were buying. In 1972, Gow, then 27 years old, and three others set up a partnership on their own, labouring in Gow's bungalow workshop. System Computers Ltd was created the following year, being incorporated in October 1973. Gow and the three others moved their work into the canteen of an abandoned mill in Leeds. Due to inadequate capitalisation ‚Äì ¬£2,800, in a field in which the minicomputers they would be selling cost ¬£60,000 each ‚Äì the new company had a shaky start and came close to going under right away. The key turning point was engaging with Leeds-based jukebox firm Musichire, which had purchased a computer from DEC but were struggling with it. Systime came in on a consulting basis and sold Musichire both software and new hardware. John Parkinson, financial director of Musichire, was sufficiently impressed with Gow's sales abilities that in 1974, Musichire took a financial stake in Systime. Parkinson subsequently became chair of the board of directors of Systime. ==Success== The initial Systime facility was in former mills off Dewsbury Road in the Beeston area of Leeds (a couple of blocks further left of what is seen here in 2007) Gow emphasized that Systime would provide not just hardware but also software applications, systems engineering, and support. By 1975, Systime had ¬£2.75 million in turnover and profits of ¬£300,000 and was already opening offices and subsidiaries overseas. Musichire's stake in the company became a drag on its growth. Gow engaged with financiers but did not like them and did not want to accept investment from either the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation or from merchant banks, fearing they would demand too much control of the company's direction. However, in 1977 Gow arranged for investment firm Ivory and Sime to buy out Musichire's share. Around the same time, the National Enterprise Board (NEB) convinced Gow to sign up with them; they invested ¬£500,000 in Systime in return for a 26 percent stake in the young firm (which would in time grow to near 30 percent.) The NEB also facilitated the participation of Systime in a new marketing effort in an NEB subsidiary known as Insac Data Systems, which would promote exports of British technology products. Systime's business model was selling products centred around computers originally built by DEC in the United States. They would take actual DEC components and put them together with items such as power supplies and storage cables that they built themselves or obtained from other industry sources. To this base of equipment, Systime added peripherals and software from other vendors and then added some of its own application software. This allowed Systime to provide full solutions to growing customers, such as Gordon Spice Cash and Carry, that were first embracing computerised line-of-business systems during the 1970s. Accordingly, the Systime product lines were based around the minicomputers they produced, the most popular of which were the Systime 1000, Systime 3000, and Systime 5000, all based on different models of the DEC 16-bit PDP-11 minicomputer (roughly, the PDP-11/04, /60, and /34 respectively). The PDP-11-based Systime systems would typically run the DEC's RSTS/E operating system. These systems had many kinds of users; for instance, a botany group at the University of Reading used a Systime 5000. Systime's use of the PDP-11 coincided with an upsurge in the popularity of that model within the computer- using community, one that DEC had not fully antipated, leading to wait times up to three years for systems or components. As a result, Systime began manufacturing its own DEC-compatible memory boards and storage devices. Later, the Systime 8000 series came out, which were based upon the DEC 32-bit VAX-11 supermini. The 8000 series had names that indicated the DEC model they were derived from, so the Systime 8750 was equivalent to the VAX-11/750 and the Systime 8780 was equivalent to the VAX-11/780. The Systime 8000 series systems could run DEC's VMS operating system, but many of them were instead running one variant or another of Unix. This was another successful product; by the mid-1980s around one-third of all VAXen in the United Kingdom were Systime- based systems. A pure software product was Systel, the Systime Teleprocessing System, which acted as a transaction processing system with data dictionary- based programming assist features. As such it was a competitor to products such as TAPS from Informatics General on the PDP-11, but in 1980‚Äì81 Systime saw an opening on the VAX-11 where there were no rival teleprocessing monitors yet. Systel development was half-funded by the Insac arrangement and that entity received royalties on Systel sales. Systime had some success with Systel in the UK and Holland, and made a push to sell it in the United States as well. See also follow-up letter to the editor about this article, Computerworld 13 July 1981. Ian Fallows was technical director of the company during the 1970s. Systime was rapidly hiring not just hardware engineers but also software engineers to work on operating systems, controllers, and telecommunications and networking components. In 1980, Systime had turnover of ¬£24.6 million and a profit of ¬£1.6 million. Those figures increased to ¬£32.1 million and ¬£2.2 million in 1981, respectively. By then, Systime had some 1,150 employees and eleven offices around the United Kingdom. Systime was one of four companies short-listed for the Institute of Directors's annual Business Enterprise Award for 1981. It was an unusual case of a British company succeeding in making minicomputers, a market dominated by American firms. Despite its successes and fast growth, Systime was little known to the general public. ==Transformations== HRH Princess Anne officially opened Systime's new ¬£20 million facility on 27 June 1983. Founder and managing director John Gow is alongside her. In September 1981, Gow announced an ambitious three-year, ¬£46 million expansion plan for Systime, including the building of a second large facility in Leeds, with some of the funding to come from the European Investment Bank and various government grants. The second facility was to enter the microcomputer business for small businesses and, in a first for Systime, would not rely upon DEC components. This reflected that Systime was in the process of manufacturing not just minicomputers but also desktop systems, as well as terminals and printers, most of which were targeted to the Western European market. Systime also ran a service bureau, that offered the creation of application software and that sold maintenance contracts on a third-party basis. In all, Systime's plans anticipated a doubling of its employee count. Ian McNeill was technical director of the company during this period. By 1983, Systime was considered, as The Times wrote, \\"one of the largest and fastest-growing British computer companies\\". It was the second largest computer manufacturer based in Britain, behind only the mainframe-oriented International Computers Limited (ICL). In addition, it was considered an exemplar of new industrial potential in Northern England and the company was often visited by government ministers as a result. However, the switch from the National Enterprise Board to the successor British Technology Group (BTG) left Systime with uncertain funding while it was in the process of its big expansion; as Gow subsequently said, \\"we were sailing along and suddenly started to get really tight on cash. We'd outgrown our resources.\\" Gow had previously considered organising a flotation, but now did not have time to do so, so he sought investments from other British companies, but they all wanted to stage a full acquisition. In particular, there were meetings in January 1983 with two large British technology companies, Ferranti and Standard Telephones and Cables (STC), that did not achieve fruition. So instead, in March 1983 it was announced that Control Data Corporation was buying 38 percent of Systime for ¬£8 million, with another 25 percent to be controlled by Ivory and Sime. At the same time, BTG reduced its investment down to 12 percent. The two companies had had existing business dealings, as Systime bought many Control Data peripheral devices to include in its full systems, and the recapitalisation of Systime was completed in June 1983. At this point, Parkinson departed as chair of Systime and retired from the industry altogether for a while. The new facility, built for ¬£20 million in a nearby area of Beeston, Leeds, had begun operations in October 1982, with computer production taking place there. The facility was formally opened on 27 June 1983 by HRH Princess Anne. The large building featured what one newspaper termed \\"a distinctive reflective glass front\\"; more popularly it became known as the \\"Glass Palace\\". At its peak, Systime had some 1,370 employees and turnover of ¬£60 million. Systime was growing at a 30 percent annual rate during the early-mid 1980s and the strain on its finances was considerable. Systime sponsored a Tyrrell 012 racing car during the 1984 Formula One World Championship season (here seen at a 2012 Silverstone Classic event) Systime attempted to gain a greater public visibility during this period. They became shirt sponsor for Leeds United F.C. for the 1983‚Äì84 season, only the second such sponsor in the club's history. And they sponsored a Tyrrell 012 car during the 1984 Formula One World Championship season, with drivers such as Stefan Bellof, Mike Thackwell, and Stefan Johansson. Relations between Gow and Control Data management did not work out, with the two parties clashing on fundamental decisions. Accordingly, Gow departed Systime in December 1983. He was replaced as managing director by Rod Attwooll, formerly head of the UK division of Texas Instruments. Gow subsequently started his own firm, WGK Electronics, hoping to succeed in largely untapped third-world markets. ==Battles with DEC== In putting together such PDP-11- and VAX-based systems, Systime was inevitably a rival of DEC UK, Digital's United Kingdom subsidiary which sought to sell those systems themselves. Indeed, Systime had discovered in 1979 that it could acquire the same components for 25 percent less in the United States than it could through DEC UK, and it filed anti-trust action in the United States to force DEC to sell it components at American prices. In 1983, DEC UK sued Systime, claiming that Systime was engaging in practices that violated the license for the VMS operating system. The lawsuit was settled later in 1983 via Systime making a $5.5 million payment to DEC. Then in June 1984, DEC sued Systime in the High Court of Justice, saying it had found evidence that Systime, in its layouts and connection schematics for the manufacture of seven different printed-circuit boards for VAX-associated disk drives and controllers, had infringed upon DEC copyrights. The claimed violations had taken place prior to 1983. The suit asked for ¬£5 million in damages and came after a year of negotiations between the two companies had been unable to arrive at an out-of-court agreement. In July 1985, Systime counterfiled in the European Common Market, claiming that DEC's filing represented an attempted act of unfair competition in trying to limit Systime's ability to compete with DEC in the Western European market. The counterfiling also alleged that DEC had in fact infringed upon Systime's copyrights in the printed circuit board matter. ==The Cold War== Eastern Bloc countries looked for a way to get Western computers across the Iron Curtain In the early-mid-1980s Systime Computers ran afoul of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which regulated what goods and technologies Western countries could sell to countries within the Eastern Bloc. British and other European companies protested that many of the computer components prohibited by COCOM were widely available in Asian markets anyway, but the regulations remained in effect. So in order to sell computers outside Britain, Systime not only had to obtain an export license from the Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom), but because American products were involved due to the DEC components in Systime computers, it had to obtain an export license from the United States Department of Commerce. In 1982, Systime voluntarily acknowledged that it had sold some systems to Eastern Bloc countries without that necessary US export license and agreed to pay a fine to the Department of Commerce. However, lawyers for DEC UK pressed further with more serious charges, saying that Systime had not disclosed that it had shipped 400 DEC-based minicomputers, disguise as jukeboxes, to Switzerland that were in fact then headed for the Eastern Bloc. Thus, Systime came under investigation by the United States Department of Commerce for irregularities in the export of computers from the United Kingdom during the 1980‚Äì83 period. In particular, while Systime was not accused of directly trading with the Soviet Union, it was said to have traded with non-aligned countries, including Switzerland, Libya, Syria, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, India, and Malaysia, without having the requisite US export license. Systime denied that its actions were in violation of any British law. Some British officials felt that the export regulations were partly an effort to prevent British firms from gaining a foothold in the burgeoning computer market. In particular, Member of Parliament Michael Meadowcroft, representing the Leeds West constituency, tried to get the British government to intercede against the American action. The directors of Systime said that the export accusation was an underhanded way of those envious of the company's successes to target it. Indeed, they alleged, and MP Meadowcroft related in an address to the House of Commons, that DEC had created a \\"Kill Systime\\" campaign. Elements of this campaign, by this telling, included hiring of private detectives, surveillance of employees, burglary, bribery, destruction of documents, and spreading of false rumours. In any case, some of these allegations had made at the time of the January 1983 meeting between Systime and Ferranti and STC, and these claims played a role in preventing a British-based financial rescue of Systime at the time. The US action against Systime would involve a $400,000 fine against it, to be accompanied by a prohibition against the company using American goods. This had a devastating effect upon Systime, in particular as corporate investors were no longer willing to put monies into the company. Some 1,000 jobs were lost at the Leeds factory, leaving around only 200 employees remaining. Systime directors would put the overall cost to capital and profits at ¬£110 million. As author George E. Shambaugh relates, \\"By 1985, in the aftermath of U.S. sanctions, the company was virtually destroyed.\\" A search by Systime for additional sources of UK funding having failed, in April 1985, Control Data Corporation acquired the balance of Systime that it did not already own. The purchase was also seen as a defensive measure against the still-ongoing U.S. Commerce Department investigation. Then in February 1986, DEC bought 50 percent of the Systime subsidiary from Control Data (which itself was experiencing financial struggles), taking over the Customer Services Division and all the services contracts for DEC hardware. That division had 250 employees and sales and field service contracts representing some 2,500 user accounts. As part of the deal, DEC dropped its ¬£5 million copyright infringement lawsuit against Systime regarding the printed-circuit memory boards. The DEC deal took away Systime's most lucrative business. MP Meadowcroft protested the action, accusing DEC of having \\"improperly colonized\\" Systime. In addition, during 1986 the Systel transaction processing monitor product was split off into the new firm Performance Software Ltd, via a management buyout. As author Kevin Cahill wrote, Systime had become \\"dismembered\\". By 21 April 1986, Systime's tale was the lead story on the front page of The Guardian newspaper. The directors of Systime filed an action with the European Commission saying that the US actions were a breach of European Union laws protecting free trade among member nations, but the damage was done. The British government did eventually file a protest against the United States based on the allegation that the latter had used the Central Intelligence Agency to illicitly gain information about British companies. However the British government did not intercede in any way that forestalled the damage done to Systime, and Meadowcroft's efforts had come to naught. The US‚ÄìUK trade issues were by no means limited to Systime; smaller firms that could not afford the bureaucratic approval process of an export license were affected, as were much larger enterprises such as IBM and Toshiba. An investigation in 1985 conducted by Datamation magazine showed that there was an extensive grey market for computers, especially DEC equipment such as the VAX-11, and that Systime was but one of several sources for such products. And despite COCOM-based efforts to curtail trade with the Eastern Bloc, it only grew more vigorous. The whole matter generated considerable debate during the second Thatcher ministry and a February 1987 editorial from The Guardian, one that mentioned Systime, emphasized the broader importance of the issue and criticised the prime minister for failing to fully take a stand against the Americans on behalf of British technology interests. Editorial. A September 1987 account in the New Scientist also mentioned Systime as the worst hit and criticised COCOM as being antiquated. The exports control issue was not the only factor that led to the collapse of Systime. Primary among the other causes was the company engaging in an overly aggressive expansion without having sufficient funding in place for it. But the role of the exports issue was critical. ==Attempts at new directions== During 1986, with business in rapid decline and the company having lost ¬£3.4 million the previous year, Systime moved to a smaller facility in the Leeds Business Park off Bruntcliffe Lane in the Morley area of Leeds. The \\"glass palace\\", officially opened just two and half years prior, was put up for sale. (An April 1988 piece in The Times pointed to Systime as a cautionary tale in seeing trends of economic rebirth in the North.) Now, as Computergram International stated, \\"a mere shadow of its former self,\\" what remained of Systime decided to focus on Unix- based initiatives among its hardware and software offerings. During 1987, Systime announced its Series 3 computers, based on the Intel 80386 and running flavours of Unix, as well as an OEM agreement with Computer Consoles Inc. to resell that company's Power632S line of Intel-based systems. These joined the Intel-based Series 2 systems that Systime also offered. In addition, Systime forged an OEM agreement with Altos Computer Systems for that company's 80386-based Series 2000 systems, to further complement the Intel product line at different price points and numbers of supported users. Finally, Systime also formed an agreement with Parallel Computers, Inc. to resell that US-based company's fault-tolerant systems. In terms of software offerings, Systime tried to ease migration for DEC PDP-11 users by offering its own Trans-Basic translator, which converted the BASIC programming language from a dialect used on RSTS to one used on Unix. A similar tool allowed users of the COBOL programming language on ICL or Wang Laboratories systems to migrate to Unix- based compilation and deployment. As 1987 became 1988, Systime announced a strategic direction that embraced innovation in software over in-house production of hardware systems. Primary among these was a new product line called Visionware, the first piece of which was PC-Connect, which was in part a terminal emulator for Microsoft Windows that was composed of implementation elements that ran on both Unix and Windows, and supported cut-and-paste between Windows, graphical Unix-based X Window, and Unix character mode applications. PC-Connect was a released product from Systime by 1987, and was further emphasized in 1988. It found early customer use among Systime partners Altos Computer and Computer Consoles, as well as at the UK government's Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency and Manpower Services Commission. Ongoing work on the X aspects of it was done in collaboration with Cambridge-based IXI Limited. Several other Windows‚ÄìUnix connectivity products were also under development as part of the Visionware line. ==Dissolution and fates== White Rose Office Park in Leeds (here seen in 2014) grew out of what once was the Systime Computers facility in the Beeston area of Leeds On 2 June 1989, as Computergram International wrote, \\"Control Data Corp finally got shot of its troublesome UK Systime Ltd business ... and the solution for the once- substantial Leeds systems integrator is dismemberment by management buy-out.\\" The largest of these was Service Technology Ltd, which gained the support and distribution rights for the rebadged Altos Computer Systems and Computer Consoles systems. The other three were Visionware Ltd, which gained the rights to PC-Connect and the Visionware technologies; Manufacturing Solutions Group Ltd, which gained the Sysimp Unix package for manufacturing control; and Streetwise Ltd, which gained Unix-based software for the back-office side for retail point-of-sale systems. Some venture capital monies were involved in support of the buyouts. Visionware succeeded to the point where it was acquired by the Santa Cruz Operation, later becoming part of Tarantella, Inc., which was then acquired by Sun Microsystems and subsequently became part of the Oracle Secure Global Desktop. Noted British entrepreneur Peter Wilkinson, who later co-founded Planet Online and a number of other Internet-related firms, began his career at Systime and many of his later efforts were based in Leeds and included former Systime employees. Control Data kept the Systime UK name after the breakup, and it was listed on subsequent company reports although essentially inactive. The last paper vestige of Systime Computers Ltd was not formally removed from the books at Companies House until 2015. However, the Systime name was kept alive in a different venue. Systime had started a branch company in India in 1979 to do outsourcing work; this Indian entity was then acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary by the India-based CMS Group in 1984, during the time of turbulence for Systime UK. Doing business under the name Systime, and with essentially the same logo as Systime UK had had, this firm became substantial in size and a power in the global software projects field with offices around the world. It continued under the name and in the IT services business until it was acquired by KPIT Cummins in 2011; by 2015, the Systime name was no longer in use.See http://www.systime.net now being redirected to http://www.kpit.com in the Internet Archive. The Systime \\"Glass Palace\\" was bought and refurbished as the Arlington Business Centre, opened in 1988, and eventually became part of the White Rose Office Park. Leeds Industrial Museum (part of Leeds Museums & Galleries) holds examples of Systime computers in its collections and an example was displayed in its exhibition 'Leeds to Innovation' in 2019. ==References== ==External links== * Grace's Guide entry on Systime Computers * Images of Systime Computers * Exchange concerning Systime Computers between MP Michael Meadowcroft (Leeds, West) and Minister for Information Technology Geoffrey Pattie in the House of Commons, 25 February 1986 * Systime alumni site Category:Defunct companies based in Leeds Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of England Category:Defunct computer hardware companies Category:Defunct computer companies of the United Kingdom Category:Computer companies established in 1973 Category:Technology companies established in 1973 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1973 Category:Computer companies disestablished in 1989 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1989 Category:Software companies of England Category:1973 establishments in England Category:1989 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1989 Category:British companies established in 1973 ","title":"Systime Computers"},{"id":"63881278","text":"Laura Miller (born 7 December 2001) is a Luxembourger footballer who plays as a midfielder for the under‚Äì19 team of French club FC Metz and the Luxembourg women's national team. ==International career== Miller made her senior debut for Luxembourg on 3 March 2018 during a 0‚Äì5 friendly win against Kosovo. ==References== Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Luxembourgian women's footballers Category:Luxembourg women's international footballers Category:FC Metz (women) players Category:Luxembourgian expatriate footballers Category:Luxembourgian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Expatriate women's footballers in France ","title":"Laura Miller (footballer)"},{"id":"63881280","text":"Auty may refer to: ==People== * Clint Auty (born 1969), Australian cricket player * Josh Auty (born 1990), British speedway rider * Martyn Auty (born 1951), English film and television producer * Peter Auty (born 1969), English operatic tenor * Wilf Auty (1881‚Äì1951), English rugby union player ==Places== * Auty, Tarn-et-Garonne, commune in the Tarn-et-Garonne department in the Occitanie region in southern France ","title":"Auty"},{"id":"63881285","text":"Cutler Bay Senior High School is a senior high school in Cutler Bay, Florida.

Initially it considered a charter school, but instead decided to persuade the Miami-Dade County School District to establish a district comprehensive high school. At the time the community had two middle schools; the district chose to convert Centennial Middle School into a high school. At the time Centennial and the other middle school, Cutler Ridge Middle, had lower than average student populations. What became Cutler Bay High School took territory from Miami Southridge High School, which previously was the zoned school for the town of Cutler Bay. Cutler Bay High opened in August 2012, making it the first high school in the town. Mayor of Cutler Bay Ed MacDougall stated that by having a zoned high school in the town limits, the community would feel invested in Cutler Bay High. The Cutler Bay city council paid for the development of the school through a $2.75 million loan. Initially Cutler Bay High only had the 9th grade, but it added one grade per year until 2015, and in 2016 its first graduating class had 76 students. Initially the 7th and 8th grades were to remain on the ex-Centennial campus, but they were to be phased out. ==Curriculum and academic performance== The school was to open with standard comprehensive, iPrep (online-based), environmental science and technology, and the Cambridge Program tracks.

These women (also called queens in the competition) compete in a dancing competition and are subsequently rewarded at the end of the competition. ==Dubai controversy== As part of her rewards for winning the competition, PM together with the first and second runners up were expected to go on an all expense paid trip to Dubai. This trip was supposed to be PM's first trip in a plane and she had already made plans on things to do once she got to Dubai some of which include; a pre-Christmas shopping and a tour of interesting places she had heard of. When asked about her expectations she said; \\"I've heard of the tallest building and an exceptional fountain. I want to see and learn about them. I also want to go and study the culture of Dubai and a host of others.\\" PM was unable to board the flight due to her size and the likely situation of her inconveniencing other passengers which might result in a lawsuit against the airline (Emirates Airlines). The two other runners up were however, able to make the trip. According to Atinka media village, the main sponsors of the program, the airline responsible for the flight, denied PM a seat due to her size. They had followed all departure formalities and also informed the ticketing agents about the need for special seats due to the size of the queens (as they are referred to in the competition). Unfortunately at 5:30pm, a few minutes to boarding time, an agent from the airline informed the media house that the airline (Emirates Airlines) was unable to complete the check-in process for PM without giving any tangible reason. On Sunday 17 November 2019, Ama Gyenfa Ofosu Darkwa, popularly known as Embosuohemaa stated that the Atinka Media Village offered to pay for an extra seat for PM, however, the airline reported that two seats were not enough for her due to her size. The media house offered to buy a third seat but the airline company informed the media house that it was not going to be possible. The two other women proceeded with the trip while PM was left behind. She (Embosuohemaa) used the opportunity to call on travelling services to make arrangements to be able to accommodate people of all sizes. She also added that the media house had resolved to provide a Dubai-like experience for her in Ghana. According to PM what Embosuohemaa said was not entirely accurate and not exactly what transpired. She believed she said what she said from a good heart trying to put herself in her shoes. She added that she did not want to speak about the issue and that in due time everything would be brought to light. Moreover, due to what happened, she planned on launching a campaign that will focus on the stigma on plus-sized women. She said; \\"I want to use my campaign to let the world know that there are different people with different body types and everyone should be given equal access to certain things. I would want to use my platform to tell women who are like me to learn to love themselves and believe in whatever they do.\\" She also added that she had received all that she had been promised from the Atinka Media Village and that the media house owed her nothing. In an interview, PM claimed she did not know how much she weighed but always knew her size could be a hindrance for her in situations as these. In response to the situation, Emirates Airlines released a statement as follows; \\"We respect our customers' privacy and cannot discuss specific customer details or cases. Emirates places the highest standards on in-flight safety and as part of this, it is a requirement that all passengers are safely and comfortably seated with their seatbelt fastened. An industry practise for passengers who cannot be accommodated in a single seat due to their size is for them to purchase an extra seat for their own safety and comfort, should a seat be available.\\" ==See also== * Di Asa ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"PM (Di Asa winner)"},{"id":"63881406","text":"Thant Wai Kyaw () is a Burmese politician who currently serves as a member of parliament in the Sagaing Region Hluttaw for Kale Township No. 1 Constituency.

He is the Archbishop of Winnipeg, appointed to the position in 2014 after previously serving as the Bishop of Victoria. He has also served as President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) since September 2019\\\\. Gagnon attended high school and university in Greater Vancouver, before studying for the priesthood at the Pontifical Beda College in Rome. He was ordained a priest in 1983 and served in the Archdiocese of Vancouver as an assistant pastor and parish priest for two decades. He became vicar general of the Archdiocese in 2002, and was consecrated as a bishop two years later. Gagnon has been noted for his work toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Victoria and Winnipeg. He is also noted for calling the first diocesan synod in the Archdiocese of Winnipeg. ==Early life== Gagnon was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, on June 17, 1948, to Th√©r√®se Demers Gagnon and George Gagnon. He is a Franco-Albertan, given his family's ancestral roots in Quebec. Through his matrilineal line, he is \\"closely related\\" to, and a collateral descendant of, Modeste Demers, the first Bishop of Vancouver Island (since renamed to the Diocese of Victoria). The Gagnon family moved to British Columbia (BC) during his childhood, and he graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas Regional Secondary School in North Vancouver. Gagnon went on to study philosophy, history and English at Simon Fraser University, obtaining a BC Teaching Certificate in 1976. He subsequently taught at a public school as a band teacher, and could play the clarinet, flute, and saxophone. Starting in 1978, he attended seminary at the Pontifical Beda College in Rome. On June 24, 1983, Gagnon was ordained to the Catholic priesthood at Holy Rosary Cathedral by James Carney, the Archbishop of Vancouver at the time. ==Presbyteral ministry== Gagnon's first pastoral assignment was as assistant parish priest at St. Mary's Parish in Vancouver, which he began one month after his ordination. He was then transferred to Corpus Christi Parish as an assistant the following year, before becoming a full-fledged pastor at St. Jude's Parish in 1986. He later served as the first parish priest of St. James Parish in Abbotsford from 1993 until 2002, during which time he was also Dean of the Fraser Valley East Deanery. In March 2002, Gagnon succeeded David Monroe as both pastor of St. John the Apostle Parish and vicar general of the Archdiocese, after the latter was appointed as Bishop of Kamloops earlier in January. Gagnon was made a Prelate of Honour of His Holiness in February 2003, in recognition of his service and dedication to the local church. Adam Exner, the Archbishop of Vancouver, noted at the investiture ceremony that Gagnon had \\"rendered outstanding distinguished service in the Church in Vancouver as a loving, effective, and dedicated pastor, a man who is ever ready to meet new challenges ‚Äì a servant ready to go wherever called.\\" ==Episcopal ministry== ===Bishop of Victoria (2004‚Äì2014)=== Gagnon was appointed as the sixteenth Bishop of Victoria, British Columbia, on May 14, 2004. The see had been vacant since January of that year, when Raymond Roussin was appointed as Archbishop of Vancouver. Gagnon was succeeded as Vancouver's vicar general by Mark Hagemoen. He was consecrated bishop and installed on July 20, 2004, at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Victoria, with Roussin serving as the principal consecrator. The red field and gold Latin cross in his coat of arms was influenced by that of Modeste Demers, Gagnon's aforementioned ancestor and predecessor as bishop of the Diocese. Gagnon made his first ad limina visit to the Holy See on October 2, 2006, together with four other bishops from the Assembly of Western Catholic Bishops (AWCB). Gagnon oversaw the conclusion of a financial and legal debacle for the Diocese of Victoria that began in the 1980s under his predecessor, Remi De Roo. It saw the lending of diocesan funds for an investment in Washington state that subsequently failed. In November 2006, the Diocese sold its land in Washington, enabling it to settle its debts completely ‚Äì this included \\"full payment to the bond owners\\", many of whom were parishioners. Two months later, in January 2007, the Diocese won an appeal at the Washington Court of Appeals, successfully reversing a 2005 judgment against it for US$8.5 million in damages for breach of contract. Controversy erupted when Mike Favero, the pastor of Holy Cross Parish for three years, was seemingly forced to step down on January 18, 2007. This occurred three weeks after the resignation of a gay church administrator. Parishioners alleged that it was Favero's refusal to dismiss the administrator that led to himself being forced out by Gagnon, which Favero later confirmed in an interview with a local television station and to the Times Colonist. At a parish town hall meeting, Gagnon contended that Favero had requested to resign in late spring of 2006 ‚Äì before the issue arose ‚Äì for personal reasons, with Gagnon asking him to remain. When the situation became increasingly difficult in November, Favero again requested a sabbatical that would have started in spring 2007. Gagnon also admonished the parish's lay leaders for failing to engender a sense of ‚Äúbalance, fairness and confidentiality to this matter\\". Consequently, Favero broke his silence to refute the assertions made at the parish meeting. He expounded how Gagnon requested that he \\"reorganize the church office\\" and remove the administrator, without bringing up his sexual orientation. Favero was reluctant to do so and decided to consult with the parish council. Favero said that this incensed Gagnon, who reprimanded him for breaching confidentiality. He then wrote a letter to the bishop cautioning him as to the bad precedent this dismissal would set. Favero also affirmed that he had not wanted to leave Holy Cross that spring, having merely responded to an annual memo from the Diocese's pastoral centre by opining how he would prefer to \\"be up-Island, close to [his] parents\\" for his next pastoral assignment. Favero stated that he needed to \\"defend his integrity\\", but that he \\"[did] not want a public battle with the bishop\\", according to journalist Shannon Moneo. Hundreds of parishioners insisted on an apology from the bishop, with some even calling for Gagnon to resign. The discord between Favero and Gagnon was later resolved. In July 2011, the two participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new church where Favero was pastor, and concelebrated the first Mass there ten months later. The Times Colonist reported in 2013 that Favero \\"took responsibility for not honouring confidentiality and misrepresenting events\\". Gagnon served as the AWCB's regional representative on the Permanent Council of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) from 2007 to 2008. He was also on the board of Catholic Missions in Canada starting in 2009. He approved the sale of St. Andrew's Elementary School, located in downtown Victoria, in 2010. This was part of the Diocese's C$20 million plan to renovate and combine its schools. Many schools like St. Andrew's were in need of costly seismic retrofitting and were competing with other nearby Catholic schools for student enrolment. The 150-year-old school closed in June 2013, and was demolished in 2016. Also in 2010, Gagnon went on an 18-day pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain, where he hiked at least a day. ===Archbishop of Winnipeg (2014‚Äìpresent)=== Gagnon was appointed as the seventh Archbishop of Winnipeg on October 28, 2013, and installed at St. Mary's Cathedral on January 3, 2014. Since the Archbishop also serves as the Chancellor of St. Paul's College and has canonical responsibility for it, Gagnon was installed to that position on April 6 of that year. Philip S. Lee, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and alumnus of the college, was in attendance. Lawrence Huculak, the Metropolitan Archeparch of Winnipeg, remarked how Gagnon's \\"extensive contact\\" with First Nations and other ethnic minorities in his past positions made him a fitting selection as Archbishop. Gagnon participated in a reconciliation event with Indigenous peoples organized by the Archdiocese on June 4, 2015. He presented a cheque of C$60,000 to the executive director of Returning to Spirit, a First Nations spiritual charity that works in close cooperation with a predominantly Indigenous parish in the inner city. The funds, which were raised at a Mass held at MTS Centre on May 3 to celebrate the centennial of the Archdiocese, would go toward teaching people about First Nations residential schools. The director gave him the feather of an eagle, which is the \\"highest honour that can be bestowed\\" in First Nations tradition. Earlier that week, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada ‚Äì which documented the country's residential school system ‚Äì issued 94 calls to action. One of these implored the Pope to go to Canada and apologize in person to the survivors of residential schools, comparable to the apology made in 2010 to the victims of sexual abuse in Ireland. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Gagnon articulated his belief that a future papal visit to Canada ‚Äì which he supports ‚Äì should not be made merely for the purposes of an apology, since \\"that ground has been covered already\\". He was referring to the 2009 meeting in Rome, in which Pope Benedict XVI expressed sorrow to a delegation of Indigenous Canadians that included Phil Fontaine, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations at the time. That meeting was organized by Gagnon's immediate predecessor as Archbishop, James Weisgerber. In another interview with the CBC's Power & Politics in 2018, Gagnon expounded on how he did not want a visit by the Pope and a resulting apology from him to be reduced to \\"just a matter of ticking off a particular call to action\\". Gagnon was elected President of the AWCB in February 2016, succeeding David Motiuk. Three months later, he called the first diocesan synod in the history of the Archdiocese. The two-year-long process consisted of six sessions in which delegates from the local Catholic community \\"deliberate on the pastoral needs of the diocese\\". He also reached out to lapsed and former Catholics for their input as to what direction the local church should take moving forward. Gagnon made his second ad limina visit on March 27, 2017, alongside the other bishops of the Assembly. Several weeks later, he voiced his dismay at the decision by the Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries Corporation to allow casinos in the province to open on Good Friday and Easter Sunday for the first time. He observed how this placed profit-making before the welfare of employees, adding how the long Easter weekend was one of the rare times in the year in which \\"families get together\\". Later that September, Gagnon was elected as the CCCB's vice president. He had another audience with Pope Francis that year on December 9, together with CCCB president Lionel Gendron and secretary general Frank Leo. The trio met again with the Holy Father on December 6, 2018. At the CCCB's annual gathering in September 2019, Gagnon was elected as President of the Conference for a two-year term. Reacting to his selection, he said he felt humbled that his fellow bishops had \\"placed their confidence and trust in me.\\" He emphasized how his role was not to advance \\"any kind of platform or agenda\\" or to \\"issue orders\\", but to instead be a facilitator and offer guidelines. On December 12 of that year, Gagnon made his first visit to the Pope as the Conference's president. ==Distinctions== *: Order of the Holy Sepulchre (May 18, 2012) ==References== Category:1948 births Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Archbishops of Winnipeg Category:Canadian music educators Category:Canadian Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Canadian schoolteachers Category:Franco-Albertan people Category:Living people Category:Members of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre Category:People from Lethbridge Category:People of Qu√©b√©cois descent Category:Simon Fraser University alumni ","title":"Richard Gagnon"},{"id":"63881440","text":"Lloyd Eldred Herman (born 1936) is an arts administrator, curator and museum planner who is an acknowledged expert on contemporary craft. He is best known for being the founding Director of the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C.. ==Early life and education== Lloyd Herman is an Oregon native, attending elementary and high school near Corvallis. After graduation in 1954, he enrolled at Oregon State College (now University) with the hopes of becoming an actor, or a teacher. His education was interrupted by 2 years active duty in the U.S. Navy. On his return to Oregon, he enrolled as a junior at the University of Oregon in Eugene, majoring in Speech and Drama. He went to Washington D.C. to enroll in the acting program at Catholic University of America for his senior year. He was not accepted, instead enrolling at The American University, where he graduated with a BS degree in 1960. ==Career== Smithsonian Institution Lloyd Herman joined the staff of the Smithsonian Institution in 1966 as Administrative Officer to the Director of the National Museum, and began to develop a changing exhibition program for the galleries of the Arts and Industries Building. As the Director of what was intended to become the Smithsonian Exhibition Hall, he began booking traveling exhibitions from museums and traveling exhibition services. That experience led him to propose a similar temporary exhibition program for the former Federal Court of Claims building, designed in 1859 by architect James Renwick as the Corcoran Gallery of Art that had been transferred to the Smithsonian. In 1968, Lloyd Herman developed a proposal for the ‚ÄúRenwick Design Centre‚Äù as a changing exhibition program for such exhibitions from various sources, to be administered as a component of the Exposition Hall programs. In 1970, he was hired to implement it as Administrator, Renwick Gallery. He developed temporary exhibitions that would reflect the range that the Renwick Gallery planned to embrace: architecture and design, contemporary and traditional craft, traditional decorative arts, plus ethnic and folk art from various countries. He subsequently became the first Director of the Renwick Gallery, and from 1972 to 1986 presented over 100 exhibitions. Lloyd Herman retired from the Smithsonian Institution in 1986. Museum Planning In 1988, Lloyd Herman began the directorship of the Cartright Gallery, a non-profit craft gallery in Vancouver, B.C., and planned its future as the Canadian Craft Museum. Working there for three years, he developed a space-use plan and an exhibition program. At the same time, he curated traveling shows for the Whatcom Museum of History and Art in Bellingham, WA. They included Into the Woods: Washington Wood Artists, Clearly Art: Pilchuck's Glass Legacy, and Trashformations: Recycled Materials in Contemporary American Art and Design, among others. In 1993 he was hired by Oregon State University to plan a new museum on the Oregon Coast as part of the Thundering Seas Institute, a craft school component of the university's art department. Though advanced architectural planning and land acquisition at Agate Beach in Newport, OR, proceeded, the facility was never built. He joined the planning staff for the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington in 1998 as Acting Senior Curator, writing collection and exhibition policies, and advising on space planning for the facility prior to its construction. Independent Curator, Lecturer, and Writer Lloyd Herman continued to curate exhibitions on craft and design topics for the United States Information Agency, the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and various other museums and traveling exhibition services. He has lectured on American crafts throughout the United States, and in Australia, Canada, England, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Japan, and has juried numerous art and craft competitions across the United States and abroad. In recent years he has led craft tours to Bhutan, India (five times), Iran, Jordan, Morocco, and Vietnam, and lectured regularly on contemporary glass art for Elderhostel/Road Scholar programs in Seattle. Lloyd Herman‚Äôs book, Art That Works: The Decorative Arts of the Eighties, Crafted in America, was published in 1990 by the University of Washington Press, distributor of his Trashformations; Clearly Art: Pilchuck's Glass Legacy; Tales and Traditions: Storytelling in Twentieth Century American Craft and American Glass: Masters of the Art publications. He co-authored the book, Thomas Mann, Metal Artist.

She was born in Versailles, a city in Kentucky on 4 June 1887. Craft was educated at the Kentucky Normal and Industrial Institute for Colored Persons (now Kentucky State University), a historically Black university. After graduating, she taught in Kentucky and also did graduate work in Chicago. She moved to San Diego, California with her husband, John Craft, in 1910. While in San Diego Craft lived with her husband, her sister (Esther Streppe) and her sisters' sons (Thomas, Cecil, and Andrew). Rebeccas Craft and her husband never had children of their own. She lived there for 35 years until she died at 58 years old due to cancer on 6 December 1945. == Career and civil rights work == In 1910 Rebecca Craft and her husband, John E. Craft moved to Logan Heights, San Diego, California. At this point in time, Rebecca was a retired teacher who had previously taught at various schools in Central Kentucky, one being an all-black school. Although Rebecca Craft was qualified for a teaching position since she had previous experience, she was unable to receive a teaching job in the city of San Diego. During this time majority of African Americans in the city before World War II were employed in a service or labor job. So instead of teaching, Rebecca Craft focused on improving the way of life in the African American community in San Diego. Rebecca Craft founded many different community centers for African Americans in the city of San Diego. She founded the Baptist Young People‚Äôs Union, Logan Heights Young People‚Äôs Community Center, and the Negro Women‚Äôs Civic League. These community centers added meeting places, temporary housing and employment, network opportunities, safe places for African Americans, and places where the youth can be educated. The Negro Women‚Äôs Civic league is one of the most famous centers Rebecca Craft founded and it created a lot of benefits for the community. This center empowered Black women to initiate fundraisers for the community and the money that was raised went towards scholarships so African Americans could attend San Diego State University. Rebecca Craft contributed to the Civil Rights Movement in the following ways, by fighting for African American teachers to become employed even though she had been denied for such a position despite her experience and continuing to better African American communities in San Diego. There are two famous African Americans in San Diego that Rebecca Craft help succeed. In 1937, Rebecca Craft and the Women‚Äôs Civic League, fought to have the first African American teacher in San Diego by campaigning. This fight would take years to win. Lorraine Van Lowe was one of those black students who benefited from the Women‚Äôs Civic League scholarships. She attended San Diego State University and graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English in 1933 and was hired as teacher as an adult education teacher for the San Diego Schools. Van Lowe left San Diego in 1939 to earn her master‚Äôs degree in personnel and guidance at Columbia University. Van Lowe returned to San Diego in 1941, the entire time she was gone Rebecca Craft had been campaigning to have a black teacher hired. The Women‚Äôs Civic League had sent four qualified black candidates to be hired but were denied. World War II had caused an increase of students in the school system and the city needed more teachers. Rebecca Craft understood there was a need for teachers and with her persistence on July 21, 1942 Lorraine Van Low was hired at Memorial Junior High. Rebecca Craft not only tried to advocate for more African American teachers to be hired but was very active in the Parent Teachers Association, worked for better school curriculum, and the removal of racially offensive literature from the school textbooks and libraries. Rebecca Craft also pushed for equality in the San Diego Police department as well. Jasper Davis wanted to become a police officer for the city. There was only one black officer on the force at that time, John Cloud. Davis decided to take the qualifying test and placed twenty-fourth in it but was repeatedly passed over when he tried to make appointments to be hired. Jasper Davis then went to see the police chief, Chief Arthur Hill about it and he discouraged Davis and tried to push him away. Rebecca Craft who was an active NAACP member of the San Diego branch became very interested in the number of jobs African Americans could have in the city. Rebecca Crafter and Dennis Allen, president and founder of the San Diego Race Relations Society, went to see Chief Arthur Hill multiple times to convince him to hire other African Americans. The chief denied Rebecca Craft, so she wrote a petition went to churches, the city council, the mayor to have them sign it to put pressure against the police department. Rebecca Craft and others also called the police chief daily to try to get him to change his mind. This type of campaigning went on for over a year and a meeting took place at the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the mayor and chief of police were in attendance. At this meeting, Hugh McBeth a Los Angeles attorney gave a speech that changed the chief of police‚Äôs mind. On 3 March 1931 Jasper Davis was hired and operated radios for two and a half years and stayed on the police department for twenty-three years. == References == Category:1887 births Category:1945 deaths Category:African-American activists Category:People from San Diego ","title":"Rebecca Craft"},{"id":"63881640","text":"Mokim Hossain Howlader is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Barisal-6. ==Career== Howlader was elected to parliament from Barisal-6 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973. ==References== Category:Awami League politicians Category:Living people Category:1st Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mokim Hossain Howlader"},{"id":"63881659","text":"Cr√©mines railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Cr√©mines, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

Presented with the help of the Mus√©e Picasso, the Centre Pompidou, and the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, it was the first exhibition in France featuring the creative process of Pablo Picasso during the Second World War. A total of 100,274 visitors attended the exhibition. == Context == The Mus√©e de Grenoble organized their first exhibition of Picasso's paintings which was the first modern art museum in France to welcome a piece by Picasso (Femme lisant, in 1921). (Sur la mosa√Øque d'images, cliquez sur celle en bas √† gauche) On October 19, 1926, Picasso visited the museum.Mus√©e de Grenoble, Andry-Farcy au mus√©e de Grenoble (1919-1949). This exhibition coincides with one devoted to Andry Farcy ending on November 24, 2019, celebrating the hundredth anniversary of his assumption of office as curator at the Mus√©e de Grenoble. Farcy launched the modern art collection in Grenoble in 1920 and paved the way for all other museums in Europe. == Visit route == The 137 works (paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings) are presented in chronological order from year to year throughout the 16 rooms. During the war, Picasso chose to stay in France and devoted himself to three classic themes: still lifes, the female nude, and the portrait. One of the first works is Chat saissant un oiseau (Cat seizing a bird) from April 22, 1939, illustrating the fear of the painter faced with the threat of a war in Europe with the capture of Prague by the Nazis. Each year begins with a giant historical photograph linked to current events. For the year 1940, Picasso traveled between Royans and Paris where he painted disturbing paintings of toothed fish, such as Caf√© √† Royans in August 1940. Without painting the war, he would represent violence in his paintings. In 1941, while Picasso and his companion Dora remained in a Paris subject to restrictions, he painted Jeune gar√ßon √† la langouste (Young boy with lobster), thus defying the Nazi occupier. That same year, he painted his companion in the paintings Buste de femme (Bust of a woman) and Femme assise dans un fauteil (Woman seated in an armchair). In 1942, still in his workshop in the Grands-Augustins, he produced a sculpture of a painted bronze head but also his paintings L'Aubade and Nature morte au crane de taureau (Still Life with the Skull of a Bull), a tribute to his friend Julio Gonz√°lez who had recently died. This last painting serves as a poster for the exhibition. == Media == Picasso au coeur des t√©n√®bres (2) - Mus√©e de Grenoble.jpg Picasso au coeur des t√©n√®bres (3) - Mus√©e de Grenoble.jpg Picasso au coeur des t√©n√®bres (4) - Mus√©e de Grenoble.jpg Picasso au coeur des t√©n√®bres - Mus√©e de Grenoble.jpg == Notes and References == == See also == === Bibliography === Exhibition catalogue: * === Related articles === *List of Picasso artworks 1931-1940 *List of Picasso artworks 1941-1950 Category:2019 in art Category:2020 in art Category:2019 in France Category:2020 in France Category:Pablo Picasso Category:WikiProject Europe articles Category:WikiProject France articles Category:Coordinates not on Wikidata Category:Art exhibitions in France Category:Events in Grenoble ","title":"Picasso.

He wrote a travelogue about his life in Iran, the Trois ans √† la cour de Perse. Prior to his appointment in Iran, he served as a personal physician to Prince Nicholas of Montenegro (r. 1860‚Äì1918). ==Biography== Feuvrier was born in Saulx, Haute-Sa√¥ne to Fran√ßois Antoine, a military veterinary surgeon. In 1861‚Äì1865, he attended the Military School of Hygiene in Strasbourg, and earned a post-doc at Val-de-Gr√¢ce in Paris. Feuvrier served in Algeria (1861‚Äì1865) and Colmar (1869). He participated in the Franco- Prussian War. Feuvrier then served as a personal physician to Prince Nicholas of Montenegro (r. 1860‚Äì1918). He also participated under Nicholas I in the Herzegovina uprising (1875‚Äì1877) directed against the Ottoman Empire. Feuvrier succeeded another Frenchman, Joseph D√©sir√© Tholozan, as the Shah's personal physician. Though his knowledge of Persian language and culture was limited (learned mainly on the spot), his travelogue provides invaluable first-hand information on an important period during the Qajar era. It is a major source of information in relation to the Tobacco Concession and the Tobacco Protest. Through his personal interest in Persian culture, Feuvrier's travelogue also provides important information on Iran's archaeology, architecture, urbanism, economy, and social life. He was awarded the Order of the Lion and the Sun (1st class with green sash) and the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur (chevalier, 1875; officier, 1890). In addition to his native French, and Persian, Feuvrier held linguistic abilities in Serbian, Italian, Russian, English, and German.

On December 15, 1774, patriots led by John Sullivan again raided the fort, this time seizing numerous cannons. The incident is significant as one of the first overt acts of the American Revolutionary WarSign commemorates William & Mary Raids of 1774 against British fort in NH and the only battle to take place in the state of New Hampshire.When Paul Revere Rode to New Hampshire ==Background== As tensions increased before the American Revolutionary War, Lord North's ministry became concerned that the profusion of arms in New England would lead to bloodshed. On October 19, 1774, King George III issued a confidential Order in Council forbidding the export of arms and powder to America.Crout, Robert Rhodes, \\"Diplomacy of the American Revolution\\", in Encyclopedia of the American Revolution: Library of Military History.

Tensions in Massachusetts nearly erupted into violence in the fall of 1774 when redcoats seized provincial gunpowder during the so-called Powder Alarm. Upon learning of the Order in Council, patriots feared that the British military would make another attempt to seize colonial stores. Patriots in Rhode Island moved munitions from the fort at Newport inland for safekeeping without incident. In Massachusetts, rumors flew that troops from Boston were headed to reinforce Fort William and Mary and seize its powder and arms. On December 13, 1774, four months before his more famous ride in Massachusetts, Paul Revere rode to Portsmouth to sound the alarm. Once he arrived in Portsmouth, Revere met with Samuel Cutts, a local merchant, and together they worked with local Patriots on a plan for the fort.The Midday Ride of Paul Revere == Raid == On the morning of December 14, Patriots from the town of New Castle unsuccessfully attempted to take the gunpowder at Fort William and Mary by trickery. Meanwhile, John Langdon made his way through Portsmouth with a drummer, collecting a crowd to descend on the fort. Several hundred men responded to his call, setting out for the Castle by way of the Piscataqua River. Only one provincial officer, Captain John Cochran, and five provincial soldiers were stationed at Fort William and Mary. Despite the odds against them, they refused to capitulate to Patriot demands. When Langdon's men rushed the fort, the defenders opened fire with three cannons and a volley of musket shot.Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England, A letter directly from Captain Cochran describing the events. Patriots stormed the walls and Cochran's men engaged in hand-to-hand fighting before being subdued by an overwhelming number of raiders. Langdon's volunteers not only broke open the powder house and absconded with about 100 barrels of gunpowder but, to three cheers, hauled down the fort's huge British flag. Several injuries but no deaths occurred in the engagement, and Cochran and his men were released after about an hour-and-a-half of confinement. The next day, additional rebel forces arrived in Portsmouth from across the colony, as well as from Maine. Led by John Sullivan, who was accompanied by Major Alexander Scammell, the rebels returned to the fort late on the night of December 15.Alexander Scammell, the Lovesick Revolutionary War Hero The post was overrun without gunfire and muskets, military supplies and 16 cannons marked as the property of the King were removed. British authorities declared the raids‚Äîfor which Sullivan later received a stipend from the Continental Congress‚Äîhigh treason. == Aftermath == In response to a call for aid from Boston by British Governor John Wentworth, the armed hydrographic survey sloop Canceaux arrived to keep the peace in New Hampshire on December 17,Conforti, Joseph, Creating Portland: History and Place in Northern New England (2007) pp.55-58 followed by the twenty-gun frigate Scarborough on December 19, with numerous Royal Marines aboard. The Governor and his family were driven from their home in Portsmouth in the summer of 1775 and forced to take refuge in the fort, guarded by the guns of British warships. Britain finally gave up on the colony of New Hampshire in order to focus attention on the military situation in Massachusetts and abandoned the fort, removing its remaining equipment to Boston along with Governor Wentworth. The supplies captured by Patriots in December 1774 were later used by New Hampshire's forces against the British military, including in the Siege of Boston and at the Battle of Bunker Hill.Historic Powder Houses of New England: Arsenals of American IndependencePOWDER FOR BUNKER HILL; HOW FORT WILLIAM AND MARY WAS CAPTURED.

Conversely, supplies (including numerous cannon) left in the fort by Patriots following the raids were subsequently put to use by the British forces.

He was appointed in May 2020 by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Prior to the appointment he was also a Republican Party fundraiser. == Early life and education == Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, DeJoy earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from Stetson University in Central Florida. After graduating, he became a Certified Public Accountant licensed to practice in the state of Florida. == Career == === Business === DeJoy was CEO of High Point, North Carolina-based New Breed Logistics from 1983 to 2014, and retired after his company was acquired by the Connecticut-based freight transporter XPO Logistics for a reported $615 million. Following that acquisition, he served as CEO of XPO's supply chain business in North America until his retirement the next year and was appointed to a strategic role on XPO Logistics' board of directors where he served until 2018. A 2001 audit found that the USPS had given New Breed Logistics a noncompetitive contract of more than $300 million starting in 1992. The audit concluded that if the bidding had been competitive, taxpayers could have saved up $53 million. Reporting in 2020, NBC News wrote, \\"The audit raises questions about whether New Breed knowingly overbilled the Postal Service, and it renews scrutiny of the background and qualifications of DeJoy, a prolific Republican Party fundraiser and donor who was appointed to lead the Postal Service over objections from many officials involved in the selection process.\\" In addition, two reports to Congress in 1999 stated that $9 million and $33 million separately paid to New Breed could have been \\"put to better use.\\" The USPS inspector general of the time retired in 2003 after a federal investigation into her abuse of authority, waste of public money and promotion of questionable personnel practices. At the time of his naming as Postmaster General and CEO, DeJoy was president of LDJ Global Strategies, a Greensboro, North Carolina-based boutique firm with interests in real estate, private equity, consulting and project management. === Republican Party fundraising === DeJoy has served as a major donor and fundraiser for a number of high-profile Republican Party politicians. He helped fund President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, co-chaired Rudolph Giuliani's North Carolina fundraising campaign in 2008, and donated a combined $27,700 to Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential campaign. He donated $1.2 million each to Donald Trump's 2020 campaign, and to the Republican Party since 2016. In April 2017, DeJoy was named one of three deputy finance chairmen of the Republican National Committee, along with Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen and the venture capitalist Elliott Broidy. In May 2019, DeJoy became local finance chairman for the 2020 Republican National Convention, then-planned for Charlotte, North Carolina. In September 2020 The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that according to former employees at DeJoy's logistics company New Breed, he participated in a straw donor scheme, reimbursing employees for making political donations. Employees, particularly managers, were expected to contribute to fundraisers for Republican candidates and organizations; they would then be reimbursed in full through the company's system of bonuses. Campaign finance records show that employees at New Breed gave substantial sums to Republican candidates and negligible amounts to Democrats. Between 2000 and 2014, when New Breed was sold, 124 employees gave a combined total over $1 million. Many of these people had not donated before they worked at the company and have not done so since leaving. Pressuring employees to make campaign donations, reimbursements for such donations, and use of corporate money to support individual politicians are in violation of both North Carolina and federal election laws, although some statutes of limitations may have expired. At an August congressional hearing DeJoy emphatically denied having engaged in such practices. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has opened an investigation into the allegations and the possibility that DeJoy lied to the committee, and has called for the Postal Service to suspend him. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said that reimbursing someone for a political contribution would be a violation of state law and that \\"Any allegation that‚Äôs this serious merits investigation.\\" === Postmaster General=== On May 6, 2020, the USPS Board of Governors, all selected by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, announced DeJoy's appointment as Postmaster General and CEO, despite concerns about conflicts of interest. That day, the National Association of Letter Carriers president Frederic Rolando congratulated him on his appointment but warned of politicization of the USPS, writing: \\"Keeping politics out of the Postal Service and maintaining its independence is central to its success.\\" DeJoy did not go through the normal vetting process for Postmaster General; two separate search firms were used by the USPS board, and neither firm mentioned DeJoy in their list of candidates. DeJoy's appointment was not only controversial because of his strong Republican connections, but also because of his financial position. While he divested shares in UPS and Amazon before taking on his role, he did not divest his $30‚Äì$75 million equity stake in XPO, a subcontractor for USPS. Under his tenure as Postmaster General, USPS has increased its business with XPO. Additionally, when DeJoy sold his Amazon shares, he purchased stock options in the company that represent between 20 and 100% of his prior holdings, and, under him, USPS prioritizes Amazon packages. DeJoy is the first postmaster in two decades without prior experience in the United States Postal Service. Upon assuming office on June 16, 2020, he began taking measures such as banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail, to reduce costs. He did not communicate the reasons for such changes within the organization, and such measures also resulted in slowing of the mail service. Congressional Democrats called for the measures to be rolled back. More than 600 high-speed mail sorting machines were scheduled to be dismantled and removed from postal facilities, raising concerns that mailed ballots for the November 3 election might not reach election offices on time. Mail collection boxes were removed from the streets in many cities; after photos of boxes being removed were spread on social media, a postal service spokesman said they were being moved to higher traffic areas but that the removals would stop until after the election. On August 7, 2020, DeJoy announced he had reassigned or displaced 23 senior USPS officials, including the two top executives overseeing day-to-day operations. He said he was trying to breathe new life into a \\"broken business model\\". Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, who chairs the House committee that oversees the USPS, said the reorganization was \\"deliberate sabotage\\". In a letter to postal workers on August 13, 2020, DeJoy confirmed reports of delays in mail delivery, and called them ‚Äúunintended consequences‚Äù of changes that eventually would improve service. At the same time that he was taking measures that postal workers and union officials said were slowing down mail delivery, President Trump told a TV interviewer that he himself was blocking funds for the postal service in order to hinder mail-in voting. After congressional protests, the USPS inspector general began a review of DeJoy's policy changes and whether he was complying with federal ethics rules. On August 18, 2020, DeJoy announced that the Postal Service would suspend cost-cutting and other operational changes until after the 2020 election. He said that equipment that had already been removed would not be restored. In September 2020, a court blocked the USPS from sending Colorado households a mailer with false and misleading information about vote-by-mail for Colorado. Secretaries of state had requested that DeJoy show them previews of the mailers that the USPS intended to send out, but DeJoy refused. The next month, USPS agreed to reverse all changes implemented in June that affected mail services to Montana, settling a lawsuit brought by the state's governor against the institution and DeJoy a day before a hearing was to take place in U.S. District Court in Great Falls. The government institution agreed to reverse removal of collection boxes and mail sorting machines, closure or consolidation of mail processing facilities, reduced retail hours, banning or restricting overtime, and restriction of late or extra trips for timely mail delivery, affecting all 50 states.https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak- lawsuits-montana-steve-bullock-4bdadb8d76f97eccaed706fcaf79f50e ==Other donations and board work== DeJoy donated $747,000 to Duke University in 2014, funding Blue Devil Tower and the DeJoy Family Club at the football stadium. The same year, his son was accepted to the school and joined the school's tennis team as a walk-on. His daughter also attended Duke, majoring in music. , DeJoy serves on the Elon University board of trustees. == Personal life == DeJoy is married to Aldona Wos, a Polish-American physician and former Ambassador to Estonia during the George W. Bush Administration. Since 2017, she has served as the vice chair of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. President Trump announced his intent to nominate her as Ambassador to Canada on February 11, 2020. Her nomination is currently pending before its U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The couple have twins and maintain two homes: one in the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, D.C., and the other, from prior to his government appointment and bought with his wife in 2005, a 10,900-square-foot mansion next to the Greensboro Country Golf Course in Greensboro, North Carolina. == See also == * Logistics * Postal voting in the United States * United States Postal Service * 2020 United States Postal Service crisis ==References== Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Stetson University alumni Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Postmasters General Category:People from Greensboro, North Carolina Category:North Carolina Republicans Category:People from Brooklyn Category: Trump administration controversies ","title":"Louis DeJoy"},{"id":"63881842","text":"The Cantabrian mixed forests is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion in southwestern Europe. It extends along the coastal Cantabrian Mountains and Galician Massif of Northern Spain, extending south into northern Portugal, and northwards through the westernmost Pyrenees to southwestern France. The ecoregion extends from the seacoast to the highest peaks of the Cantabrian Mountains. The highest peak is Torre Cerredo at 2,648 meters elevation. The ecoregion is transitional between the Mediterranean climate regions of Spain and Portugal and the more humid and temperate forests of Western Europe. The lowlands have mild temperate climate, while the high mountains experience cold winters. ==Flora== The ecoregion's altitudinal range supports several plant communities. The lowlands are characterized by broadleaf deciduous forests, with English oak (Quercus robur), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), lindens (Tilia platyphyllos and Tilia cordata), wych elm (Ulmus glabra), and maples (Acer pseudoplatanus and Acer platanoides). Characteristically Mediterranean evergreen trees and shrubs, including holm oak (Quercus ilex), cork oak (Quercus suber), sweet bay (Laurus nobilis), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), and Rhamnus alaternus, can be found in warm and well-drained areas like limestone outcrops. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) is common on Atlantic coastal dunes in northern Portugal and western Galicia, and further inland on rocky dry slopes. Middle- and upper-elevation forests are characterized by deciduous oaks (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica), with European beech (Fagus sylvatica) from the Cantabrian Mountains eastward into France. Stands of white birch (Betula pubescens) appear below the timber line. Above the timber line (1800 meters), subalpine plant communities including low shrubs (including dwarf juniper and heathers), grasses, peat bogs, and rock outcrops cover the highest peaks. ==Fauna== Large mammals include Cantabrian brown bear (Ursus arctos), Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus), Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva), wild boar (Sus scrofa), red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Feral horses (Equus caballus) roam in Galicia's mountains. The broom hare (Lepus castroviejoi) is an endemic species to the Cantabrian Mountains. The reclusive Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a vulnerable small mammal that lives here and in the Pyrenees. The Cantabrian brown bears number over 200 individuals, who live in the Cantabrian Mountains of southern Asturias and Cantabria and the adjacent portion of Castile and Le√≥n. The brown bear population has increased in recent decades from fewer than 100 in the 1990s. The Cantabrian population is the larger of the two remaining brown bear populations in southwestern Europe; the other is in the Pyrenees.Trinidad P√©rez, Javier Naves, Jos√© Fernando V√°zquez, Alberto Fern√°ndez-Gil, Juan Seijas, Jes√∫s Albornoz, Eloy Revilla, Miguel Delibes, and Ana Dom√≠nguez \\"Estimating the population size of the endangered Cantabrian brown bear through genetic sampling,\\" Wildlife Biology 20(5), 300-309, (1 October 2014). https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00069 The Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) is an endangered subspecies of grouse.

Mecodema rectolineatum, Mecodema walkeri), termed the Large Banks Peninsula ground beetle, is a carnivorous forest ground beetle in the genus Mecodema. It is endemic to Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, New Zealand, and is the largest of the 16 carabids found in the area. There are very limited records, and in general there is little ecological knowledge about this species. M. howitti is listed as threatened, range-restricted, and sparse within Banks Peninsula, however the Department of Conservation has been prevented from ranking this species as a priority threatened species due to the lack of ecological information available. ==Description== Mecodema howitti is the largest of the 16 carabid species that can be found in Banks Peninsula, measuring 26-33mm (0.87-1.30\\"). M. howitti are flightless and nocturnal. The body of M. howitti is matte black. The head of M. howitti consists of 1-6 setae arising from a single socket above the eye, or 3 separate setae slightly behind the eye. The thorax is cordate in shape and often has hind corners. There are 10-20 setae on the thorax margins, but are seldom found on the hind corners. The elytra are ovoid in shape, lacking distinct shoulders. The elytra are sometimes coloured brown-black. ==Range== Mecodema howitti is one of about 430 known ground beetle species in New Zealand, and is one of 63 Mecodema species that are endemic to New Zealand. M. howitti is endemic to central and eastern parts of Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, New Zealand. They can be found at both lowland and higher altitudes. Historically, in the 1950s, they have been found in western and northern Banks Peninsula, although habitat loss and high densities of predators have most likely contributed to their absence in these areas. Their sparsity throughout Banks Peninsula is most likely due to their poor mobility. Similarly, the decline in their numbers since the 1900s is most likely due to habitat loss by logging and farming, forest fires, and the increase in predator species in the area, such as hedgehogs and rats. The level of disturbance to their local habitat by stock animals and predators may also influence distribution of M. howitti as well as that of their prey. It is believed that the survival of M. howitti may become threatened in the next 50 years, because they have disappeared from the Port Hills district since 1940, and have not been found in western parts of Banks Peninsula since 1980. ==Habitat== Mecodema howitti are flightless and nocturnal, preferring shaded, vegetated sites. They shelter under fallen logs or large branches during the day time. Like most other carabid species, M. howitti prefer cool, damp local habitats. They have been known to shelter under rocks, however abundance is not as strong here as under woody surface debris. Log remains have been identified as an important aspect of their habitat, however, they may not be a habitat requirement as they could provide for more favourable microhabitat conditions, such as higher moisture levels and lower temperature levels,Thiele (1997), as cited in Anderson, S. J. (2000). Distribution, Habitat Associations, and Activity Patterns of Two Endemic Banks Peninsula Carabid Beetles, Mecodema howitti and Megadromus guerinii (Phd). Lincoln University. but also increased prey availability. Adult M. howitti do not purely rely on woody local habitats, however, as they are known to burrow into the soil. ==Ecology== Phenology Behavioral patterns and activities of M. howitti are very temperature-dependent.Thiele (1997), as cited in Anderson, S. J. (2000). Distribution, Habitat Associations, and Activity Patterns of Two Endemic Banks Peninsula Carabid Beetles, Mecodema howitti and Megadromus guerinii (Phd). Lincoln University. M. howitti show their highest level of activity is during spring and summer months. This is because their activity is dependent on climate conditions such as soil temperature, moisture and rainfall. M. howitti is a nocturnal species but can be present during the day if conditions are moist and light is low. Daytime activity is usually in breeding periods in spring and summer as the beetles have been seen copulating during the day in these periods. The main reason why the species is nocturnal is because they are very susceptible to predation during daylight hours. M. howitti are very inactive during winter so it is believed they may hibernate during this period. Mecodema howitti is still under-documented, so little is known about their eggs, larvae, subsequent developmental stages, or longevity. Mecodema howitti do not migrate, and so gene flow is restricted..Thiele (1997), as cited in Anderson, S. J. (2000). Distribution, Habitat Associations, and Activity Patterns of Two Endemic Banks Peninsula Carabid Beetles, Mecodema howitti and Megadromus guerinii (Phd). Lincoln University. Road and farmland development in the area has resulted in these small populations becoming isolated, and extinction is possible if there are major environmental change. Diet, prey and foraging Mecodema howitti are carnivorous predatory opportunists, feeding on smaller organisms when they are available. Although M. howitti are not specialised hunters of any particular species, they have been known to feed off larvae, pupae and adult invertebrates, such as Tenebrio molitor larvae, pupae of Tipulidae, and adult Holcaspis suteri. M. howitti tend to burrow through upper layers of soil to find their prey. Predators, parasites and diseases Native predators include morepork and Buff weka (Gallirallus australis hectori), although Buff weka are now absent from Banks Peninsula. Most introduced carnivorous predators in the area are nocturnal hunters of invertebrates, such as the possum, ferrets, weasels, rats, and hedgehogs. Mites from the Micromegistus genus have been associated with M. howitti. It is thought that only large carabid species are hosts to these mites, as researchers have not found them on smaller carabid species. It is likely that M. howitti are parasitised by Micromegistus species because of the larger and more preferable microhabitats that M. howitti offer; Micromegistus may also feed on food remains leftover by M. howitti. ==Other information== Although endemic New Zealand species tend to have cultural uses or significance to MƒÅori it is not known if M. howitti are considered important to iwi in the area. ==External links== iNaturalist observation of M. howitti by Jacob Littlejohn ==References== Category:Broscini Category:Beetles of New Zealand Category:Beetles described in 1867 ","title":"Mecodema howitti"},{"id":"63881931","text":"Bazhenovo may refer to: *Bazhenovo, Belebeyevsky District, Republic of Bashkortostan, a locality in Republic of Bashkortostan *Bazhenovo, Birsky District, Republic of Bashkortostan, a locality in Republic of Bashkortostan ==See also== *Bazhenov ","title":"Bazhenovo"},{"id":"63881940","text":"Alopoglossus harrisi is a species of lizard in the family Alopoglossidae.

It was best known as a home for Negro league baseball, but was frequently used for other events, including boxing, wrestling, football, soccer, amateur baseball, and even ice skating competitions. It existed from about 1915 through 1937. The park was on a roughly triangular block bounded by Nagle Avenue and the elevated tracks of the subway's Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line (northwest, third base); 204th Street (northeast, left field); 10th Avenue (southeast, right field); and Academy Street (southwest, first base). The address of the park was sometimes given as Dyckman Street, farther to the southwest. The Dyckman train station provided easy access to the park. The park was also about a mile south of Baker Field, the athletic fields for Columbia University. Most sources list Dyckman's seating capacity as around 4,500. Some sources say the capacity was later expanded to 10,000. An early newspaper reference to the park appeared in the Brooklyn Standard Union for June 3, 1915, reporting on an amateur ball game between two local clubs. As early as 1917, games played by the independent black team called the Cuban Stars were being advertised in local newspapers. The Stars joined the Eastern Colored League in 1923 and operated through 1928. They also played one year, 1929, in the American Negro League. They were then independent during the 1930s. Games involving various Negro League teams were also staged there. A number of them were night games, as Dyckman Oval had acquired lights in 1930, several years before the major league New York area teams did. The Cubans' owner, an entrepreneur named Alejandro Pompez, had a side business in the numbers racket. This eventually got him into legal trouble, and he had to abandon the team. The days of Dyckman Oval came to an end. The stands were demolished sometime during the off-season of 1937‚Äì1938. A writer for the New York Age on April 2, 1938, p.8, lamented having gone to the ball field and finding it gone. Very few photos of this park exist. One widely-circulated photo shows the outside of the main entrance at Nagle and Academy. The block, all the way to Dyckman Street, is now mostly occupied by New York City Housing Authority apartment buildings. The Monsignor Kett Playground sits where the left field area of Dyckman Oval once was. ==References== *Peter Filichia, Professional Baseball Franchises, Facts on File, 1993. * * ==External links== *Dyckman Oval information *Dyckman Oval more details Category:Inwood, Manhattan * ","title":"Dyckman Oval"},{"id":"63882023","text":"Hacienda La Avellana Mixed Wildlife Refuge (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Central Pacific Conservation Area, it was created in 1988 by decree 18186-MIRENEM. == References == Category:Costa Rica Category:Protected areas Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1988 ","title":"Hacienda La Avellana Mixed Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"63882032","text":"Humayun Kabir Chowdhury is a Jatiya Party (Ershad) politician and the former Member of Parliament of Naogaon-2. ==Career== Chowdhury was elected to parliament from Naogaon-2 as a Jatiya Party candidate in 1986. ==References== Category:Jatiya Party politicians Category:Living people Category:3rd Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Naogaon District ","title":"Humayun Kabir Chowdhury"},{"id":"63882034","text":"La Ensenada Mixed Wildlife Refuge (), is a protected area in Costa Rica, managed under the Central Pacific Conservation Area, it was created in 1998 by decree 27211-MINAE. == References == Category:Costa Rica Category:Protected areas Category:Nature reserves in Costa Rica Category:Protected areas established in 1998 ","title":"La Ensenada Mixed Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"63882036","text":"Knoellia subterranea is a species of Gram positive, nonmotile, non- sporeforming bacteria.

Although titled Greatest Songs, the album actually contained re-recordings of songs originally recorded in decades prior. ==Background, content and reception== Greatest Songs was Anderson's album released for Curb Records. It would also be his final release with the label. The album contained re-recordings, technically categorizing it as a studio album. Sessions were produced in 1996. The re-recordings chosen were some of Anderson's biggest hits and most well-known material while signed to Decca Records. The set was a collection of ten newly-recorded tracks. Some of the hits from Anderson's career include \\"Still\\", \\"I Get the Fever\\", \\"Po' Folks \\" and \\"Wild Week-End\\".

It was originally released as a compact disc in 1996, but was later released to digital and streaming retailers in the 2010s. The album did not spawn any known singles nor did it peak on any Billboard charts. Greatest Songs was reviewed by Allmusic, who only gave the project 2.5 out of five stars. Reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine recommended for listeners to avoid the album because it was re-recordings, not originals. \\"Greatest Songs is a budget-line collection featuring pleasant but unexceptional '90s re-recordings of Bill Anderson's best-known material,\\" he commented. ==Track listing== ==Release history== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Region !scope=\\"col\\" Date !scope=\\"col\\" Format !scope=\\"col\\" Label !scope=\\"col\\" Ref. - ! scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" United States  September 1966  Compact disc  rowspan=\\"2\\" Curb Records  -  2010s  Music download  - } ==References== Category:1996 albums Category:Bill Anderson (singer) albums Category:Curb Records albums ","title":"Greatest Songs"},{"id":"63882351","text":"Leionema gracile, commonly known as Mt Greville phebalium, is a shrub species that is endemic to Queensland, Australia.

He is best known for his survey of the border between Queensland and New South Wales. He also surveyed part of the border between South Australia and Western Australia. == Early life == John Brewer Cameron was born on 31 December 1843 in Kilmonivaig, Inverness, Scotland. == Border between Queensland and New South Wales == Zero Obelisk Between 1879 and 1881 the official survey of the 29¬∫S parallel border between Queensland and New South Wales was conducted by Cameron (employed by the New South Wales Government) and George Chale Watson (employed by the Queensland Government). Astronomical observations were taken at the Barringun telegraph station to determine the latitude and longitude. Following these observations, the Zero Obelisk was erected on the banks of the Warrego River, just north of the town of Barringun. Cameron's Corner survey mark, 2001 From this mark, the first 5-mile chord was produced westerly and the mile posts offset from this chord to the arc (chord and arc are used when surveying latitude to allow for curvature of the earth). This continued until the survey intersected longitude 141¬∫ (a point now known as Cameron Corner), a distance of 285 miles 24.96 chains. That spot is marked by the Cameron Corner Survey Marker. Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post, 2007 Watson withdrew from the survey and Cameron then returned to the Zero Obelisk at Barringun and marked the line to the east in a similar fashion. Cameron then erected a 1 ton survey post on the west bank of the Barwon River to mark the end of the survey. == New Guinea == For approximately the last 10 years of his life he was living in New Guinea. There he worked as a surveyor in New Guinea, mostly in the service of the government but also on private work. He owned a large amount of good land and used part of it as a plantation. He was the first magistrate in the western part of the territory. He established the Government station at Mabaduan (), but then relocated to Daru, leaving the station in charge of Mr Hely. == Death == Cameron came to Brisbane in December 1897 to seek partners to help him develop his land in New Guinea. While there, he died of heart disease on 31 December 1897 at the Grand Hotel where he was staying. As he was unmarried and his family were in Victoria, a private funeral was arranged in Brisbane, and the Premier of Victoria communicated news of his death to his family. He was buried on 31 December 1897 in Toowong Cemetery. == Legacy == The border point Cameron Corner is named after him and also the locality of Cameron Corner. The Zero Obilisk, Cameron Corner Survey Marker and Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. == References == === Attribution === This article was based on material from Surveying the Queensland New South Wales border published by The State of Queensland 2018 under CC-BY-4.0 licence, accessed on 7 October 2018. ==External links== Category:Australian surveyors Category:1843 births Category:1897 deaths ","title":"John Brewer Cameron"},{"id":"63882429","text":"Hollis is an unincorporated community in Calhoun County, Mississippi, United States.

Insurgent activity began in late 2018, but drastically increased the following year. Over 500 attacks have occurred since June 2019, when the insurgency intensified. Tensions between reconciled rebels and the Syrian government would lead to armed clashes between the two sides on several occasions. == Background == Daraa and Quneitra governorates with reconciliation areas shown. Following the 2018 offensive that brought Daraa and Quneitra under control of the Syrian Arab Army, many rebels forces in the area agreed to Russian- brokered reconciliation deals, in which they laid down their weapons against the Syrian Army. The rebels also handed over their heavy weapons. Most rebels stayed behind, and control various areas in the province, as well as the Al- Balad subdistrict of the city of Daraa. Those who didn't agree to the terms were sent to rebel held areas in Idlib Governorate by bus. However, due to several factors, Daraa became unstable following the conflict. Tensions arose between the Syrian government and the reconciled rebels. Conditions in the province were lackluster. Most people in Daraa live below the poverty line, the poor financial situation has led to high unemployment, especially among youth. Basic services are in terrible condition, due in part to damage from fighting. Economic downturn and lack of security gave rise to crime and tribal justice, fueling the security chaos. The presence of foreign groups such as Hezbollah increased these tensions. In addition, forced conscription, arrests and disappearances of civilians, former rebel fighters and former rebel commanders fueled anger against the Syrian government. == Factions == The Popular Resistance is the largest of the opposition groups in Daraa. It was created in 2018, but began extensive operations in 2019.

Although given some praise for its innovative concept, affordability and accuracy, it was widely panned for its frequent mechanical malfunctions, with failures to feed ammunition and eject spent casings being reported by a large number of shooters. The poor reliability of this gun made it a commercial failure, causing the eventual demise of the USFA corporation in 2017. ==Design== The ZiP .22 is a straight blowback-operated semi-automatic handgun in a bullpup configuration, with a box-shaped, futuristic-styled polymer frame featuring two holes for the trigger and the user's middle finger, and a flat buttplate on which the shooter's hand rests. It has simple notch and blade sights, and uses Ruger 10-22 removable magazines, with the 10-round wheel magazine being the default. The bolt of the gun has two trapezoidal bars extending out the front of the housing along the length of nearly the entire barrel; pushing these in towards the shooter is the only way to cycle the action. This design choice drew significant criticism, because it required the shooter to place his or her hand next to the muzzle in order to chamber a new round, putting it at risk of injury from accidental or negligent discharges. The firearm was designed to act as the receiver portion of a modular weapon system, which could be built up according to the shooter's needs using a wide range of drop-in expansions. The standard iron sights, mounted on a removable plate, could be swapped out for enhanced sights that glowed in the dark, or a picatinny or scope rail that would allow the mounting of optics. Another rail accessory allowed the ZiP .22 to attach to the underside of a rifle, similar to underslung shotgun designs, in order to provide additional firepower. The ZiP .22 could also itself be converted into a rifle through the addition of a carbine stock and a suppressor, although these accessories as well as a .22WMR conversion kit never made it past the prototype stage due to the commercial failure of the weapon. ==Production history== The ZiP .22 was first revealed to the public in an attempted viral marketing stunt, when a YouTube user, believed to be designer and company CEO Douglas Donnelly, uploaded a video titled \\"Unidentified Firing Object\\", which showed the gun in action at a range. After some speculation about the identity of the firearm, USFA announced plans for its production in late 2012. The development of the ZiP .22 was a big risk for the U.S. Fire Arms Manufacturing Company, a gunmaker that had made a name for itself with its highly regarded replicas of the Colt Single Action Army and other historic guns. The gun, although able to be sold at a low price, required very expensive polymer moulding equipment to produce, the cost of which would require USFA to sell off their Single Action Army production tooling. The company nonetheless took this risk, intending to restart production of replica guns with newly purchased tools once the ZiP had turned a profit. This decision proved to be the company's demise when the ZiP .22 failed on the market due to perennial reliability issues; production of the gun stopped in 2014. USFA itself shut down in 2017, unable to return to production of more successful products. ==References== Category:Semi-automatic pistols of the United States ","title":"USFA ZiP .22"},{"id":"63882812","text":"Nantai () is the largest island in the Min River of Fujian.

She is the Louis L. Goldstein Professor of Public Affairs at Washington College, where she has also been Chair of the Political Science Department. She studies religion, gender, and American politics. Her research includes books on women and politics, the political activities of clergy members in the United States, and the role of women in the Tea Party movement. ==Education and early work== Deckman attended St. Mary's College of Maryland, graduating with a BA degree in political science in 1993. Deckman was the 1993 Valedictorian at St. Mary's College. She then earned an MA in political science from American University in 1997, followed by a PhD in political science in 1999. In 1999, Deckman joined the political science faculty at American University as a visiting assistant professor. In 2000, she moved to Washington College, where she served as Chair of the political science department from 2007 to 2008 and again since 2009, and in 2012 became the Louis L. Goldstein Professor of Public Affairs. ==Career== In 2004, Deckman published the book School board battles: The Christian right in local politics. In School board battles, Deckman studies the Christian right movement that fielded local school board candidates in an attempt to combat what it saw as a left-wing political bias in American public school districts. She employs both a cross-sectional national survey of 671 school board candidates, of whom 127 were affiliated with the Christian right movement, as well as case studies in Garrett County, Maryland, and Fairfax County, Virginia, to study the differences between the Christian right candidates and other candidates. Although Deckman's study confirmed certain differences between candidates who were not affiliated with the Christian right and those who were, it also contradicted the conventional wisdom that Christian right candidates were dramatically different from other candidates, particularly with respect to the funding of and motivation for their campaigns. In 2005, Deckman published Women with a mission: Gender, religion, and the politics of women clergy with Sue E. S. Crawford and Laura R. Olson. The authors present data on the political activities of clergy members and rabbis, including 54 interviews conducted in Indianapolis, Omaha, Milwaukee, and Washington D.C. supplemented by data from the national survey of clergy members in the 2000 Cooperative Clergy Project, to study the political role of clergy and how gender affects this role. They demonstrate that women members of the clergy tend to be politically motivated by progressive goals such as social justice and fighting discrimination. They also study the relationship between the clergy members' political roles and that of their religious denomination and congregation. Deckman co-authored the 2006 book Women and politics: Paths to power and political influence together Julie Dolan and Michele Swers, a textbook on women and politics that had been published in four editions by 2019. Deckman was also the co-editor with Joseph Prud'homme of Curriculum and the culture war: When and where is the Bible appropriate in public schools?, published in 2014. From 2012 to 2014, Deckman was an affiliated scholar of the Public Religion Research Institute, and starting in 2013 was a member of its Board of Directors. Deckman published another book, Tea party women: Mama grizzlies, grassroots leaders, and the changing face of the American right, in 2016. Tea party women studies how women became leaders in the American Tea Party movement through the Mama grizzly archetype associated with Sarah Palin. Through detailed interviews with women involved in Tea Party activism, Deckman argues that the Tea Party functioned as a novel mechanism for women to enter Republican Party politics despite other barriers to their participation. Deckman has been quoted, or her work has been cited, in news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, and Vox. ==Selected works== *\\"Balancing work and family responsibilities: Flextime and child care in the federal government\\", Public Administration Review, with Marni Ezra (1996) *School board battles: The Christian right in local politics (2004) *Women with a mission: Gender, religion, and the politics of women clergy, with Sue E.

He became an archbishop in 1967 and then in the Roman Curia from 1941 until his death. ==Biography== Antonino Arata was born on 28 October 1883 in Piacenza, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 9 June 1906. To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1920. His first assignment as a junior member of the diplomatic corps was in the Nunciature to Czechoslovakia, newly established upon the creation of the new nation in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Appointed first secretary in the spring of 1921, he was in Prague from June 1921 to March 1927, critical years of conflict with the new political establishment. He was then posted briefly to Austria, and then to Portugal and Argentina. In the summer of 1931, as the result of a dispute over Church influence in education, the government of Lithuania declared the Holy See's representative there, Apostolic Internuncio Riccardo Bartoloni persona non grata. By the end of the year Arata was sent to de-escalate the conflict and by 1932 had established a working relationship with the government. In 18 October 1933 he became the charg√© d'affaires in the new nunciature in Estonia, and he headed that nunciature for a few months following the death of the nuncio, Antonino Zecchini, in March 1935. On 12 July 1935, Pope Pius XI appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to both Latvia and Estonia as well as titular archbishop of Sardes. He received his episcopal consecration on 11 August 1935 from Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. After the Soviet Union annexed the Baltic States, the nunciatures in Latvia and Estonia were forced to close and Arata returned to Rome at the end of August 1940. On 31 March 1941, Pope Pius named him assessor of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. On 28 April, he was made consultor to the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and a member of the Pontifical Commission for Russia. On 28 June 1948 he was named a member of the Central Committee for the next Holy Year. Yves Congar, one of the key theologians of the period, reported that in 1946 Arata encouraged his work on Christian ecumenism when few others in Vatican circles were enthusiastic; Arata endorsed the strategy of pursuing local initiatives rather than expect commitment from the Holy See. He died on 25 August 1948 in Grottaferrata, just outside Rome. ==References == ==External links == *Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Antonino Arata Category:1883 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from Piacenza Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Latvia Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Estonia Category:Officials of the Roman Curia ","title":"Antonino Arata"},{"id":"63883039","text":"Wang Chiu-chiang (; pronounced ; born 1957 in Santai, Mianyang, Sichuan), also known as (Wang Jiujiang), is a Sichuanese painter whose work is mostly based on the landscapes of Sichuan and Tibet, by reinterpreting the traditional shan-shui style.

The AFL Grand Final, which is the final premiership deciding match each season in the Australian Football League (AFL), has been played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Victoria every year since 1902, except on six occasions when the ground was unavailable; and it is presently contracted to be played there until 2058. Despite the long-term stability in its location, and its natural fit as the largest stadium in Melbourne and Australia, the ongoing use of the Melbourne Cricket Ground has been controversial throughout its history. During the latter half of the 20th century, the location debate was driven by the Victorian Football League (or VFL, as the league was then known) seeking better commercial terms than it had at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from the Victorian Government and Melbourne Cricket Club ‚Äì the ground's owners and operators respectively. This most notably resulted in an unsuccessful attempt to move the grand final to the VFL-owned VFL Park during the 1980s. In the 1990s and into the 21st century, the VFL expanded interstate to become the AFL, and eight of the league's eighteen clubs have been based outside Victoria since 2012. During this time, the location debate centred around the fairness of the grand final being staged permanently in Victoria after the league had spread nationally. ==Early history== The East Melbourne Cricket Ground staged one of the first grand finals. Early grand finals were played at different neutral venues chosen by the league's match committee a week in advance. The selection of the venue could depend on the condition of the surface, as many grounds were being prepared for the cricket season in September; and at this time, and football was not allowed on the Melbourne Cricket Ground after mid- August, as the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) sought to protect its surface for interstate and international cricket matches. The portion of the gate and privileges for cricket club members demanded by grounds landlords was considered by the league's match committee in its annual choice of venue. Of the first four grand finals, two were played at St Kilda, one at the East Melbourne and one at South Melbourne. In 1902, the ban on late-season football was lifted, and the grand final was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the first time. The MCC was unwilling to grant any concessions to the league regarding its members ‚Äì full members would gain free entry to the game and privileges for ladies' tickets ‚Äì but the VFL nevertheless rewarded the MCC for its assistance in the staging of interstate games that year. The ground was thereafter used for all grand finals; and, after 1908, all finals. Ever since the game moved to the ground, the agreement continued to allow MCC members to gain free entry to the Grand Final if they had paid the following cricket season's membership fee, and the high number of non-paying spectators long became a sticking point in negotiations between the VFL and MCC. In 1929, the MCC began paying the VFL lump sums for the right to host the finals and grand final each year ‚Äì similar to an agreement it already had with the Victorian Cricket Association for exclusive rights to stage international cricket ‚Äì and the lump sum partly covered the cost of its members' entry. This began at ¬£300/yr, then was increased to ¬£500/yr in 1931, as part of a ten-year deal between the VFL, the MCC and MCG Trust (the Victorian Government-appointed body which acts as the ground's owner) to keep the grand final, and other finals, at the ground until 1940; a new sixteen-year agreement, from 1941 until 1956, followed it. ==1950s: the opportunity of the Olympics== The VFL grand final in 1946 from the stands of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the 1950s, the VFL continued to resent its reliance on the arrangement at the ground: the MCG Trust fixed admission prices, and the MCC continued to take a large portion of the gate, retain entry privileges for its members, and pay a ¬£500/yr fee which had not increased since the 1930s. In the early 1950s, the 1956 Melbourne Olympics offered the VFL its first opportunity to break from the deal. In early 1952, 's stadium at Princes Park was selected to be upgraded to become the Olympic Stadium. Different plans for its capacity ranged from 70,000 to 125,000, compared with the Melbourne Cricket Ground's then-capacity of about 88,000. With less hostile landlords, the VFL was widely expected to relocate the finals, including the grand final, to Princes Park under more favourable terms after the Olympics and its current grand final deal ended in 1956. However, in the 1952 Victorian state election, held in December 1952, the Labor Party's John Cain, Sr. replaced the Country Party's John McDonald as Premier of Victoria. Within two months, seeking cost reductions on the Olympics, plans for an all-new stadium at Carlton were abandoned in favour of a much lower-cost redevelopment of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which included the construction of the Olympic Stand and expansion of the ground's capacity to over 100,000. This left the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the only ground large enough to accommodate the Grand Final, giving the VFL little choice but to extend its arrangement at the ground. The issue of the Melbourne Football Club having an unfair advantage by playing the grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ‚Äì which was its normal home ground ‚Äì was noted after the club won five premierships in six years between 1955 and 1960. In 1961, one club delegate proposed in a league meeting that ground's goal posts be moved prior to each Melbourne finals match to temper its home ground advantage, an idea which drew wide laughter before being overwhelmingly voted down. ==1970s-80s: VFL Park== The VFL's next strategy to sever its reliance on the Melbourne Cricket Ground arrangement was the construction of VFL Park (later known as Waverley Park) in south-eastern suburb of Mulgrave. Privately owned by the VFL, the land was purchased in 1962, and the new ground was opened for games in 1970. The first phase of its construction resulted had a capacity of 75,000; and the league started scheduling finals matches at the venue in 1972 ‚Äì but not the grand final. Original designs for VFL Park allowed for eventual expansion to a capacity of 157,000. The VFL put its plans to move the grand final to VFL Park into motion in August 1981: proposing a $14 million upgrade to increase its capacity to 104,500, and announcing that it would be ready for the 1984 VFL Grand Final. However, the Victorian Government, now under premier John Cain, Jr., blocked the upgrade. Initially, it was blocked on the basis that the higher crowd required improved public facilities and transport in the surrounding area, which the VFL agreed to fund; but by the end of 1982, the government stated openly that it preferred and was committed to keeping the grand final at Melbourne Cricket Ground, and thus rejected VFL Park expansion plans. This put the VFL and government in open conflict. Once the VFL's long-term plan for the grand final, the disused K. G. Luke Grandstand is all that remains of spectator facilities at VFL Park. By the 1980s, the VFL's motivation to stage the game at VFL Park was not simply a matter of finding a better commercial deal: it was a matter of financial survival. Rising costs, including player payments, were sending more than half of the league's clubs broke; was in the process of relocating to Sydney due to its financial troubles, and several other clubs (including , and ) were soon to be fighting for their futures. Staging the grand final at VFL Park was worth an estimated $3 million per year to the VFL and its clubs, as it could keep a higher proportion of the gate, and use grand final entry as an incentive to sell VFL Park memberships. Losing the grand final would have been a similar financial negative for the MCC and Victorian government. Both had invested heavily in the ageing facilities at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and grand final entry was also a noted incentive for MCC memberships. Surveys of VFL fans generally favoured the game remaining at the centrally located Melbourne Cricket Ground, rather than VFL Park which was relatively distant in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Negotiations took place throughout 1982 and 1983. The Victorian government committed to a $15 million upgrade of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, including light towers for night football and cricket. The VFL gave up on its grand expansion plans, and sought a smaller $5 million upgrade to bring the capacity to 84,000; but the Cain Jr. government continued to reject any upgrade plans, and even threatened to pass legislation requiring the grand final be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. By late 1983, the parties began negotiating for a new arrangement at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The VFL sought to lease the entire ground for finals, with its 28,000 VFL Park full members granted exclusive use of MCC members' facilities. The MCC executive counteroffered to waive the $250k lease fee, and set aside the members' facilities and the Olympic Stand for shared use by MCC and VFL Park members. The counteroffer was rejected in a vote of the MCC members by a substantial 74% majority; but, the government, via the MCG Trust, was able to use its powers to compel the MCC to accept the deal. The deal was done in early 1984, and plans to move the 1984 Grand Final to VFL Park were abandoned. This outcome still favoured the VFL by $2.4 million per year, as it still enabled the league to use grand final entry as an incentive for the purchase of VFL Park memberships. The MCC and VFL maintained an uneasy relationship through the balance of the 1980s. Then, in 1988, concrete cancer was found in the Melbourne Cricket Ground's ageing Southern Stand. The MCC could not afford to completely rebuild it, so the VFL and MCC agreed to a joint funding arrangement. The brand new Great Southern Stand, with facilities befitting a paid membership, was completed in 1992, and half of it was reserved for exclusive use of VFL members during the football season; MCC members then regained exclusive use of their traditional members' facilities. With a direct financial stake in the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the VFL no longer had an incentive to move the grand final from the ground, permanently ending the grand final location debate as it related to VFL Park. ==1990s to today: national expansion== In the 21st century, the VFL/AFL Grand Final location debate has revolved around whether or not Victoria should always host the premiership deciding match of the Australian Football League. A long-term deal was initially locked in to secure the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the grand final every year until 2032. This was extended in 2009 to 2037; then in 2018 to 2057; then finally in 2020 to 2058. As for all Grand Final venue agreements, they were three-party deals among the VFL/AFL, MCC and the Victorian government's MCG Trust. As the initial long-term deals were put in place, the former Victorian Football League was in the process of expanding interstate, and was renamed the Australian Football League in 1990. Since the admission of in 2012, eight of the league's eighteen clubs have been non- Victorian. The non-Victorian clubs have called into question the inherent fairness of the long-term Melbourne Cricket Ground deal, as it permanently gives the Victorian clubs a home-state advantage in finals and gives non- Victorian clubs a travel cost burden for the grand final. The AFL acknowledged the home state imbalance in its 2018 contract renegotiation ‚Äì by including provisions that interstate clubs be scheduled to play at least two home-and- away games at the venue annually, and to grant training access to the ground during the year and charter flights for interstate teams during grand final week ‚Äì but nevertheless endorsed the long-term extension of the deal. One alternative advocated by some observers would be to play the grand final on the home ground of the higher ranked team, seen as the overall fairest option which allows teams to earn the benefit of home ground advantage through on- field performances over the season. This has been outright ruled out by league CEO Gillon McLachlan because preparation for the grand final ‚Äì including all of the spectator and corporate events which accompany it, contributing significantly to both the tradition and revenue of the game respectively ‚Äì require months or years of planning, making it both impractical and financially costly to leave the venue undecided until after preliminary final weekend. The other alternative would be to encourage competitive bidding among ground owners, typically state governments, to secure the rights to match. This could become a commercially favourable option for the league as it could encourage a direct cash injection to the league by bidders, and former player and coach Michael Voss speculated that such a system could encourage investment in venues nation-wide. However, journalist Michelangelo Rucci notes that unless several state governments were willing to construct 100,000 seat stadiums, the likelihood of a genuinely competitive bidding process which could break the long-term Melbourne Cricket Ground deal on its merits alone is remote; and in the past, Victorian government funding for upgrades to the Melbourne Cricket Ground has generally been conditional upon, rather than a prerequisite to, extensions to the ground's long-term grand final contract. Other than commercial interests and the balancing of home-state advantage, other arguments put forward in the debate include: *That the Melbourne Cricket Ground remains the highest capacity stadium in Australia and thus provides the greatest opportunity for spectators to attend. This remains a strong argument in favour of the arrangement, and part of the AFL's stated model is to maximise the game's in-person attendance. *That the transition from the former Victorian league to a true national league cannot be considered complete until the grand final is shared among the states. *The long history and tradition associated with the game favour continuing to schedule at the traditional venue ‚Äì although it is counterargued that this represents only the Victorian perspective view of the grand final's traditions, and should not necessarily apply in the national era. The subject of which state should host the grand final frequently evokes the game's traditional interstate parochialism, which has typically been a rivalry between Victoria and 'the rest'. ==Grand finals away from the Melbourne Cricket Ground== Brisbane's Gabba was selected over several non-Victorian stadiums to host the pandemic-affected 2020 Grand Final. Since the grand final was first played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1902, six grand finals have been played away from the venue due to its unavailability: *The ground was requisitioned for military use from 1942‚Äì1945, resulting in the use of Princes Park (1942, 1943 and 1945) and the St Kilda Cricket Ground (1944). *The reconstruction of the Southern Stand in 1991 reduced the ground's capacity by half, resulting in the use of Waverley Park. *The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in restrictions on interstate travel and public gatherings in Victoria in 2020, resulting in the use of the Gabba in Brisbane. ==References== Category:Wikipedia controversial topics G * Category:Australian rules football controversies ","title":"AFL Grand Final location debate"},{"id":"63883108","text":"Frank Arguello is an American cancer research scientist, Medical Doctor and author. He introduced the concepts of ‚Äúatavistic oncology‚Äù and ‚Äúatavistic chemotherapy.‚Äù He is the creator and director of the Atavistic Chemotherapy Clinical Trial. == Biography == Arguello graduated from College of Bachelors in Torreon, Mexico, in 1978, with a degree in biology. He earned his earned his M.D. from University of Nuevo Le√≥n School of Medicine in Monterrey, Mexico in 1984 and completed a fellowship at The James P. Wilmont Cancer Centre in Rochester, New York. He is a former assistant professor of pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and assistant professor of oncology at Strong Memorial Hospital Cancer Center in Rochester, New York. Arguello is also a former scientist with the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment & Diagnosis, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland conducting pre-clinical trials and evaluating the potential anticancer properties of new drugs being discovered at the NCI's screening programs. In 2011, he published a book Atavistic Metamorphosis: A New and Logical Explanation for the Origin and Biological Nature of Cancer which gave genesis to the Atavistic Chemotherapy Clinical Trial‚Ñ¢. == Research == Arguello's early research was focused on understanding cancer metastases. His investigations led to the development of laboratory animal models to develop and study experimental metastases to the bones and other organs. Using this model, he studied and described the sequence of events that take place during bone metastasis, particularly vertebral metastasis and spinal cord compression. Arguello and colleagues at the University of Rochester also established that both vascular access of cancer cells to a target organ and the tissue microenvironment in it played a critical role in the establishment of metastases. At the NIH, NCI, Arguello evaluated several novel anticancer agents including 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate, alone and in combination with conventional anticancer drugs for the treatment of human brain tumor xenografts, and flavopiridol in the treatment of xenografted human leukemias and lymphomas. Arguello's current research includes investigations of the unique and perplexing traits shared by pathogenic unicellular organisms and cancer cells. These traits suggest that malignant transformation may represent a re-emergence, in a differentiated cell, of an ancestral genetic program that was active in the evolutionary past of our cells. In other words, the behavior that scientists regard as ‚Äòmalignant,‚Äô including cell autonomy; invasion and digestion of surrounding normal tissues; migration and colonization of distant organs; ability to develop resistance to drugs, temperature, or radiation; and ability to kill the host, are not only characteristics of cancer cells, but of pathogenic and/or single-celled organisms (bacteria, fungi and protozoa). Since human cells originated from a single-celled organism, several scientists have postulated that the pathogenic behavior of cancer cells is likely due to the re-expression of past traits and behaviors (atavism) derived from their past evolutionary experience as independent, single-celled organisms. This reversion or de-evolution of a differentiated cell to its ancestral undifferentiated, unicellular form has suggested that cancer is a cellular atavism. The objective of atavistic chemotherapy clinical trial is to determine whether there is a benefit for patients with inoperable or metastatic cancers when treated successfully with combinations of selected drugs conventionally used in medical practice to kill single-celled organisms, such as antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-protozoal drugs. Preliminary results show that atavistic chemotherapy can induce complete cancer regressions of several types of metastatic and inoperable cancers. Arguello's investigations have been challenged by another cancer researcher, who has been found to have ties to the pharmaceutical industry. == Selected publications == *A murine model of experimental metastasis to bone and bone marrow, F Arguello, RB Baggs, CN Frantz, Cancer research 48 (23), 6876-6881 408, 1988 *Flavopiridol induces apoptosis of normal lymphoid cells, causes immunosuppression, and has potent antitumor activity in vivo against human leukemia and lymphoma xenografts, F Arguello, Mark Alexander, Judith A Sterry, Gabriela Tudor, Erik M Smith, Naina T Kalavar, John F Greene Jr, William Koss, C David Morgan, Sherman F Stinson, Timothy J Siford, W, Gregory Alvord, Richard L Klabansky, Edward A Sausville, Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology 91 (7), 2482-2490,302, 1998 *Pathogenesis of vertebral metastasis and epidural spinal cord compression, F Arguello, RE Duerst, K McQueen, CN Frantz, RB Baggs, L Johnstone, Cancer 65 (1), 98-106, 208, 1990 *Incidence and distribution of experimental metastases in mutant mice with defective organ microenvironments (genotypes Sl/Sld and W/Wv), Richard W Furlanetto, Raymond B Baggs, Brian T Graves, Shari E Harwell, Harvey J Cohen, Christopher N Frantz, Cancer research 52 (8), 2304-2309, 59, 1992 *Vascular anatomy and organ‚Äêspecific tumor growth as critical factors in the development of metastases and their distribution among organs, F Arguello, RB Baggs, AE Eskenazi, RE Duerst, CN Frantz, International journal of cancer 48 (4), 583-590, 34 ,1991 *Preclinical evaluation of 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate alone and in combination with conventional anticancer drugs for the treatment of human brain tumor xenografts, F Arguello, MA Alexander, JF Greene Jr, SF Stinson, JL Jorden, EM Smith, Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology 124 (1), 19-26, 22, 1998 *Experimental bone and bone marrow metastasis in laboratory animals, F ARGUELLO, CN FRANTZ, RB BAGGS, JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute 82 (12), 1069-1070, 4, 1990 == References == == External links == * Category:Cancer researchers Category:American male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n alumni Category:University of Rochester faculty ","title":"Frank Arguello"},{"id":"63883114","text":"Paulette Sarcey (11 April 1924 ‚Äì 5 May 2020) was a French resistant.

Her father, Fro√Øm (Efrayam), was a leather worker and communist activist. Her mother, Jenta (Yentil) Przepiorka, worked in the clothing industry. The family fled antisemitism in Poland in 1923, arriving in France. They settled in Belleville, and Sarcey joined the communist circles in the area. She joined the Resistance in 1940 at the age of 16 alongside other communist youth, most notable Henri Krasucki. She changed her name to Martine while in hiding, but was captured by police of the Vichy Regime on 23 March 1943 after a denunciation. Her final address was at 14 Rue de Vaucouleurs in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. She was taken to a small station of the Paris Police Prefecture, where she was harshly interrogated. Sarcey was first taken to Drancy internment camp, then to Auschwitz on 23 June 1943. Following the death marches, she was interned at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, and shortly thereafter at Neustadt-Glewe, where she was liberated on 2 May 1945. Back in France, Sarcey was reunited with her family, and began aiming at spreading awareness of the horrors of the camps. Her parents hid in their Parisian workshop, and her brother, Robert, was hidden in a Catholic family in Chahaignes. Her father died in 1972, her mother in 1981, and her brother in 2019.

With an intrinsic passion for music, Smith describes being 5 years old and watching Keith Urban's performance on the CMA Awards as being the moment he knew he wanted to be a performer with his own unique style of country music. At the age of 10, he received his first guitar from his father, and over the next four years, Smith taught himself to play and began to write his own songs. By the time he was 14, his skills had progressed so much that when his family took a vacation to Nashville, he had his sights set on the Bluebird Cafe's open mic night, only to find it was closed for a holiday. Undeterred, Smith took his guitar to the lobby of the hotel they were staying and played an impromptu set that was heard by a session player who introduced the young songwriter to renowned producer, Buddy Cannon. Cannon instantly saw the potential in Smith, and Smith's family soon relocated to Nashville where he pursued his dream while finishing high school. == Career == After Smith moved to Nashville, Cannon began to introduce him to many accomplished Nashville-based songwriters, including Jim McCormick, Ronnie Bowman, Marla Cannon-Goodman, and Larry McCoy. Through learning from and working with these writers, Smith cultivated a catalogue of more than 500 songs. Cannon also connected him with Clay Bradley, then a Vice President at BMI, who in 2017 would co-found the artist development and music publishing company, Eclipse Music Group, where Smith would eventually sign his first publishing agreement in 2018. Shortly after signing with Eclipse, he was invited to play at the BMI stage at Hard Rock Cafe at CMA Fest. The performance caught the attention of Big Machine Label Group CEO, Scott Borchetta, who was walking by but was struck by Smith's talent and \\"stopped in his tracks\\" to watch the set.\\" Borchetta requested that Smith send him a few demos, and was so impressed by them that he offered Smith a record deal. Smith released his self-titled debut EP with BMLG on October 4, 2019, and charted in the top 20 on Apple Music in the first day. On March 9, 2020, his single \\"Like I Knew You Would\\" was released for radio plays. In January 2020, CMT's annual Listen Up campaign selected Smith as one of 17 promising new artists to watch. At only 20, Smith is already making himself a household name, having shared the stage with established acts such as Brad Paisley, Florida Georgia Line and Lady Antebellum. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut on February 23, 2020. Until restrictions on public gatherings were put in place due to COVID-19, Smith was slated to join Scotty McCreery on Chris Young's 2020 Town Ain't Big Enough tour. Smith has been sheltering-in-place in Nashville, writing new music and participating in various live-streams. == Artistry == Smith's goal is to create a unique brand of country music that draws from a multitude of styles from 90s country to classic rock to the music scene of New Orleans. By blending these styles and infusing traditional country themes with contemporary sensibilities, Smith hopes to bring a new audience to country music. Calling himself part of the \\"Spotify generation\\", he believes his peers have musical tastes that are eclectic and varied due to being able to easily access a large portfolio of diverse sounds. Smith has expressed the belief that making a human connection through music transcends genre. Smith approaches songwriting as though he's telling a story, and writes with the narrative of a music video in mind. Drawing from his own life experience and blending honesty with a sense of humor he describes as \\"quirky\\", Smith's lyricism is often praised for conveying a maturity beyond his years. A self taught musician, Smith often plays every guitar on his tracks. In addition to acoustic and electric guitar, Smith's self-titled EP features him on the banjo and mandolin. Inspirations for Smith include Pearl Jam, John Mayer, Clint Black, and George Strait. Billboard has compared Smith to a mid-2000s era Keith Urban. == Discography == === Extended plays === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Title !Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Payton Smith  * Release Date: October 4, 2019 * Label: BMLG Records } === Singles === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !Year !Single !Album/EP - ! scope=\\"row\\" 2017 \\"Let Me Help You With That\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 2019 \\"Like I Knew You Would\\" Payton Smith - ! scope=\\"row\\" 2020 \\"Creek Don't Rise\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 2020 \\"Ready Set Summer\\"  } == References == == External links == * Official website Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st-century male singers Category:American country guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American country singer- songwriters Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:Big Machine Records artists Category:Country musicians from Louisiana Category:Singers from Louisiana Category:Songwriters from Louisiana Category:Country musicians from Tennessee Category:Singers from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Songwriters from Tennessee Category:2000 births Category:Living people ","title":"Payton Smith"},{"id":"63883148","text":"The gens Socellia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome.

The disease was first identified in 1996 by plant pathologists at the University of Minnesota, and grouped with the Potato X (potex) viruses. The virus has reached epidemic proportions and can be found in most garden centers and nurseries around the globe. == Emergence == Hosta virus X began showing up in nurseries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People bought the infected hostas, believing that they were new cultivars of the plant. Hosta cultivars such as \\"Break Dance,\\" \\"Eternal Father,\\" \\"Leopard Frog,\\" \\"Blue Freckles,\\" and \\"Lunacy\\" were not actual new cultivars, but instead were Hostas infected with Hosta virus X that were mistakenly believed to be new cultivars. Some of the Hostas infected with the virus were taken to Europe, where they were grown. Eventually, the virus reached the Hosta wholesale stock in the Netherlands, the Hostas were then sold to other wholesale stocks around the world, and caused the virus to spread quickly. == Signs and symptoms == Hosta virus X does not kill the plants infected, but Hostas that have been infected do show a variety of other symptoms, such as: * Ink-bleed, which makes the plant look discolored in certain spots, and this effect is generally centered on a vein. An example of this is shown in the photo in this article. * Desiccation or Collapsed tissue, which can be signs of heavier infection, makes the plant look as if it is dried out. * Mottling, which makes the plant appear blotchy. This is not always a symptom of HVX, and could be from another virus, but it should always treated as an infected plant regardless. Infected Hosta 'Undulata Univittata' with Virus X == Control == Once a Hosta plant is infected, it will be infected for the rest of its life. Any plant suspected of being infected should be burned if it is legal to do so. If it is not, then it should tossed in the garbage, but infected Hosta plants should never be composted. If any plant in a batch shows symptoms, the entire batch should be considered infected and be destroyed. Once a plant has been removed, the spot occupied by the Hosta should be left empty for a long time to prevent the spread of the virus to a plant that replaces it. The virus primarily spreads through infected sap, so cutting multiple plants with the same tool can spread the virus. == References == Category:Potexviruses Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Hosta virus X"},{"id":"63883192","text":"Sciapodini is a tribe of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. ==Genera== *Bickelia Grichanov, 1996 *Condylostylus Bigot, 1859 *Dytomyia Bickel, 1994 *Helixocerus Lamb, 1929 *Mascaromyia Bickel, 1994 *Narrabeenia Bickel, 1994 *Naufraga Bickel, 1992 *Pilbara Bickel, 1994 *Sciapus Zeller, 1842 *Sinosciapus Yang, 2001 == References == Category:Sciapodinae ","title":"Sciapodini"},{"id":"63883193","text":"Jim Condron is an American artist working in painting and sculpture.

In general, a nanoparticle is defined as any particle where one characteristic dimension is 100nm or less ASTM 2456-06 Standard Terminology Relating to Nanotechnology. Available at: http://www.astm.org/Standard/index.shtml. Because of their unique size, these particles begin to exhibit properties that their larger counterparts may not. Due to their scale, quantum mechanical interactions become more important than classic mechanical forces, allowing for the prevalence of unique physical and chemical properties due to their extremely high surface-to-body ratio. Properties such as cation exchange capacity, enhanced diffusion, ion adsorption, and complexation are enhanced when operating at nanoscale.Currall SC, King EB, Lane N, Madera J, Turner S. What drives public acceptance of nanotechnology? Nat Nanotechnol. 2006;1:153‚Äì155. This is primarily the consequence of a high proportion of atoms being present on the surface, with an increased proportion of sites operating at higher reactivities with respect to processes such as adsorption processes and electrochemical interactions. Nanoparticles are promising candidates for implementation in agriculture. Because many organic functions such as ion exchange and plant gene expression operate on small scales, nanomaterials offer a toolset that works at just the right scale to provide efficient, targeted delivery to living cells.Zubarev ER. Nanoparticle synthesis: any way you want it. Nat Nanotechnol. 2013;8:396‚Äì397 Current areas of focus of nanotechnology development in the agricultural industry include development of environmentally conscious nanofertilizers to provide efficient ion, nutrient delivery into plant cells, and plant gene transformations to produce plants with desirable genes such as drought resistance and accelerated growth cycles.Currall SC, King EB, Lane N, Madera J, Turner S. What drives public acceptance of nanotechnology? Nat Nanotechnol. 2006;1:153‚Äì155. With the global population on the rise, it is necessary to make advancements in sustainable farming methods that generate higher yields in order to meet the rising food demand. However, it must be done without generating long-term consequences such as depletion of arable land or water sources, toxic runoff, or bioaccumulative toxicity. In order to meet these demands, research is being done into the incorporation of nanotechnology agriculture. ==Nano- fertilizers== One area of active research in this field is the use of nanofertilizers. Because of the aforementioned special properties of nanoparticles, nanofertilizers can be tuned to have specialized delivery to plants. Conventional fertilizers can be dangerous to the environment because of the sheer amount of runoff that stems from their use.Zulfiqar, F., Navarro, M., Ashraf, M., Akram, N. A., & Munn√©-Bosch, S. (2019, September 16). Nanofertilizer Use for Sustainable Agriculture: Advantages and Limitations. Retrieved from Having a detrimental effect on everything from water quality to air particulate matter, being able to negate runoff from agriculture is extremely important for improving quality of life around the world for millions. For example, runoff from sugar plantations in Florida has spawned the infamous algae bloom called \\"red tide\\" in water tributaries across the state, creating respiratory issues in humans and killing vital ecosystems for years.What does Big Sugar have to do with Florida's red tide? (2018, August 26) Studies have shown that, in most cases, greater than 50% of the amount of fertilizer applied to soil is lost to the environment, in some cases up to 90%.M√≥denes, S. (2019, November 27). Use of nanofertilizers in agriculture: advantages and safety concerns. As mentioned before, this poses extremely negative environmental implications, while also demonstrating the high waste associated with conventional fertilizers. On the other hand, nanofertilizers are able to amend this issue because of their high absorption efficiency into the targeted plant- which is owed to their remarkably high surface area to volume ratios. In a study done on the use of phosphorus nano-fertilizers, absorption efficiencies of up to 90.6% were achieved, making them a highly desirable fertilizer material.Miranda-Villag√≥mez, Iris, L., G√≥mez-Merino, Fernando Carlos, S.-V., Manuel, S√°nchez-Garc√≠a, & √Ångel, M.

Another beneficial aspect of using nanofertilizers is the ability to provide slow release of nutrients into the plant over a 40-50 day time period, rather than the 4-10 day period of conventional fertilizers M√≥denes, S. (2019, November 27). Use of nanofertilizers in agriculture: advantages and safety concerns.. This again proves to be beneficial economically, requiring less resources to be devoted to fertilizer transport, and less amount of total fertilizer needed. As expected with greater ability for nutrient uptake, crops have been found to exhibit greater health when using nanofertilizers over conventional ones. One study analyzed the effect of a potato-specific nano fertilizer composed of a variety of elements including K, P, N, and Mg, in comparison to a control group using their conventional counterparts. The study found that the potato crop which used the nano-fertilizer had an increased crop yield in comparison to the control, as well as more efficient water use and agronomic efficiency, defined as units of yield increased per unit of nutrient applied. In addition, the study found that the nano fertilized potatoes had a higher nutrient content, such as increased starch and ascorbic acid content.Al-Juthery, H. W. A., Al-Taee, R. A. H. G., Al-Obaidi, Z. H. H., Ali, E. A. H. M., & Nal-Shami, Q. M. (2019). Influence of foliar application of some nano-fertilizers in growth and yield of potato under drip irrigation.

B., Farrokhi, N., & Makarian, H. (2014). Some Physiological Responses of Black-Eyed Pea to Iron and Magnesium Nanofertilizers. Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 45(4), 530‚Äì540. doi: 10.1080/00103624.2013.863911. A different study found that zinc nanofertilizers enhanced photosynthesis rate in maize crops, measured through soluble carbohydrate concentration, likely as a result of the role of zinc in the photosynthesis process.Silva, S., Garcia, G., Reis, E., & Dalvi, L. (2020). Foliar nutrient content and maize yield with vinasse application during three crops. Revista Brasileira De Ci√™ncias Agr√°rias - Brazilian Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 15(1), 1‚Äì6. doi: 10.5039/agraria.v15i1a6285 Much work needs to be done in the future to make nanofertilizers a consistent, viable alternative to conventional fertilizers. Effective legislation needs to be drafted regulating the use of nanofertilizers, drafting standards for consistent quality and targeted release of nutrients.Iqbal, M. A. (2019, December 13). Nano-Fertilizers for Sustainable Crop Production under Changing Climate: A Global Perspective. Further, more studies need to be done to understand the full benefits and potential downsides of nanofertilizers, to gain the full picture in approach of using nanotechnology to benefit agriculture in an ever-changing world. ==Nanotechnology in plant transformations== Nanotechnology has played a pivotal role in the field of genetic engineering and plant transformations, making it a desirable candidate in the optimization and manipulation of cultivated plants. In the past, most genetic modifications to plants have been done with Agrobacterium, or utilising tools such as the gene gun (biolistics); however, these older methods of gene implementation face roadblocks due to low species compatibility lack of versatility/compatibility with Chloroplastial/Mitochondrial gene transformations, and potential for cell or organelle damage (due to impact of biolistics). While biolistics and Agrobacterium are useful in specific species of plants- more refined approaches are being explored through the utilisation of nanomaterials- allowing for a less invasive and forced delivery approach. These methods utilise Carbon Nanotube (CNT) and various porous nanoparticle (NP) enabled delivery methods, which may allow for higher-throughput plant transformation- while also circumventing legal GMO restrictions.Wang, J. W., Grandio, E. G., Newkirk, G. M., Demirer, G. S., Butrus, S., Giraldo, J. P., & Landry, M. P. (2019). Nanoparticle-Mediated Genetic Engineering of Plants. In Molecular Plant (Vol. 12, Issue 8, pp. 1037‚Äì1040). Cell Press. doi: 10.1016/j.molp.2019.06.010 The research of non-incorporative/DNA-Free genetic modifications has become a very important field of study, since traditional methods of plant transformation (agrobacterium and biolistics) risk DNA incorporation in the plant genome, thus making them transgenic and qualifying them as a GMO.Demirer, G. S., Zhang, H., Matos, J. L., Goh, N. S., Cunningham, F. J., Sung, Y., Chang, R., Aditham, A. J., Chio, L., Cho, M. J., Staskawicz, B., & Landry, M. P. (2019).

These methods typically rely on functionalization of the surface or manipulation of porosity of a nanocarrier in order to optimize the loading and delivery of genetic information. DNA nanostructures have been shown to be a highly programmable modality in terms of delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA), exploring the optimal design parameters necessary for plant cell internalizationZhang, H., Demirer, G., Ye, T., Goh, N., Aditham, A., Cunningham, F., Fan, C., & Landry, M.

A recent study utilizing DNA loaded CNTs was able to successfully express desired traits in various mature model plant systems- and even isolated Eruca sativa protoplasts while managing to protect and maintain the fidelity of the transferred genetic material.Demirer, G. S., Zhang, H., Matos, J. L., Goh, N. S., Cunningham, F. J., Sung, Y., Chang, R., Aditham, A. J., Chio, L., Cho, M. J., Staskawicz, B., & Landry, M. P. (2019).

Nature Nanotechnology, 14(5), 456‚Äì464. doi: 10.1038/s41565-019-0382-5 Lastly, porous nanoparticles have been shown to be an effective DNA delivering agent for plant transformations- with efficiency depending on pore size and strand length.Hussain, H. I., Yi, Z., Rookes, J. E., Kong, L. X., & Cahill, D. M. (2013). Mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a biomolecule delivery vehicle in plants. Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 15(6), 1676. doi: 10.1007/s11051-013-1676-4 All in all, these diffusion based gene transformation methodologies offer a cheaper mode of plant gene transformation with lower impact to plant tissue, lower transformation efficiencies, and little to no risk of DNA incorporation. Biolistics is the primary approach to plant transformation. The biolistic process involves launching microprojectiles (usually gold microparticles) carrying genetic information through the cell walls and membranes of cells to impart genetic transformation.Wang, J. W., Grandio, E. G., Newkirk, G. M., Demirer, G. S., Butrus, S., Giraldo, J. P., & Landry, M. P. (2019). Nanoparticle-Mediated Genetic Engineering of Plants. In Molecular Plant (Vol. 12, Issue 8, pp. 1037‚Äì1040). Cell Press. doi: 10.1016/j.molp.2019.06.010 As previously mentioned, biolistics may result in damaging the targeted cells or organelles- thus in order to minimize potential cell damage, nano-biolistic methods have been developed. Due to the significantly reduced size of the particle being launched into the cell, the impact can be minimized, while offering a similar efficiency of genetic transformation as traditional biolistics. However, most studies utilizing nanoscale biolistic approaches are done with animal cells, so implementation in plant transformation is still fairly novel and may encounter roadblocks unseen in animal cell studies.Cunningham, F. J., Demirer, G. S., Goh, N. S., Zhang, H., & Landry, M. P. (2020). Nanobiolistics: An Emerging Genetic Transformation Approach. Methods in Molecular Biology (Clifton, N.J.), 2124, 141‚Äì159. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0356-7_7 Overall, nanotechnology provides a novel and competitive approach to genetic transformation of plants. Going forward, future research into the applications of these approaches will span a greater variety of crops, aim to utilize cheaper, more scalable methods, and explore potential environmental effects. Ultimately, once these design criteria will determine whether nanomaterial plant transformations will become a widespread practice in the future of agriculture. ==Public opinion== In recent years, as applications of nanotechnology have exhibited promise in many fields of study, an increasing number of government, scientific, and independent institutional bodies have seen the potential of nanotechnology in making significant contributions to alleviating the burden of the global food supply. Current public views on nanotechnology development in the agricultural industry are mixedCurrall SC, King EB, Lane N, Madera J, Turner S. What drives public acceptance of nanotechnology? Nat Nanotechnol. 2006;1:153‚Äì155.. With consideration of the potential hazards in conjunction with the potential benefits, the current public opinion appears to be relatively neutral as critics see the technology as less risky, and more beneficial than a number of other technologies such as pesticides and chemical disinfectants; however, it is perceived as riskier and less beneficial than solar technologies and vaccinationsCurrall SC, King EB, Lane N, Madera J, Turner S. What drives public acceptance of nanotechnology? Nat Nanotechnol. 2006;1:153‚Äì155.. Among the general public, there still exists negative connotations related to fertilizers and genetic modification of living organisms. Concerns that despite the benefit of higher yields and shorter growing cycles, fertilizers are associated with toxic runoff that contaminate sources of water and can lead to the generation of acid rainMarris, C. (2001). Public views on GMOs: deconstructing the myths. EMBO Reports, 2(7), 545‚Äì548. doi: 10.1093/embo-reports/kve142. Additionally, there exists the unfounded fear that consumption of genetically modified foods is 'unnatural' and dangerous , which has led to numerous legislative efforts- limiting the field to non-transgenic transformations.Marris, C. (2001). Public views on GMOs: deconstructing the myths. EMBO Reports, 2(7), 545‚Äì548. doi: 10.1093/embo-reports/kve142 While the majority of public fears and concerns are unfounded, it is more the result of poor communication and lack of public awareness related to the issue of introducing novel technology to a traditional industry such as agriculture. Ultimately the production of clean and healthy food is considered by many to be of high importance, simply due to the high frequency of consumption and intimate relation people have with the food they consume. ==References== agriculture Category:Agricultural technology ","title":"Nanotechnology in agriculture"},{"id":"63883343","text":"Mesorhagini is a tribe of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. ==Genera== *Amesorhaga Bickel, 1994 *Mesorhaga Schiner, 1868 *Negrobovia Bickel, 1994 == References == Category:Sciapodinae ","title":"Mesorhagini"},{"id":"63883360","text":"The following is a list of bugs of the family Scutelleridae of Nepal.

She is best known for her books and scholarly commentaries on the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. She has translated some of Bakhtin's most influential works, including Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics and The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M.M. Bakhtin. Emerson was Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and of Comparative Literature at Princeton University from 1988 until her retirement in 2015. From 1980 to 1987 she was a Professor of Russian Literature at Cornell. ==Biography== Caryl Emerson grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, and Rochester, New York. Her father was a professor of theory and acoustics at the Eastman School of Music. Emerson completed her undergraduate studies at Cornell, majoring in Russian literature. She received her master‚Äôs degrees in Russian studies and Russian language teaching from Harvard. She worked for some time as a secondary school teacher in New Jersey and then as a teacher of Russian area studies at Windham College in Vermont before completing a doctorate in comparative literature at the University of Texas. At graduate school Emerson encountered the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, who at that time was largely unknown in both his native (Soviet) Russia and the West. As a professor at Cornell, Emerson became a leading figure in the dissemination and explication of Bakhtin's work. Her translation of Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics in 1984 is still the only one used in English. The book is now considered a classic in Dostoevsky studies and literary theory, and has been influential in other disciplines such as philosophy and psychology.Wayne C. Booth (1984). Introduction to Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics. pp. xiii‚Äìxxvii in During her time at Princeton Emerson wrote two books about Bakhtin, Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics (1990) and The First Hundred Years of Mikhail Bakhtin (1997), both of which are considered among the finest commentaries available on Bakhtin's life and work. She has written extensively on other significant Russian cultural figures, notably Boris Godunov, Modest Mussorgsky, Alexander Pushkin and Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. Though retired from formal teaching Emerson has continued to write, edit and translate in the field of Russian literature and Russian cultural studies. Emerson has been widely recognized as one of the leading Slavists in the United States. In 2009 she received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and American Council of Learned Societies for her research on Krzhizhanovsky. She has won lifetime awards for ‚Äúoutstanding contributions to the field‚Äù from the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages (language and literature), and the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (area studies), as well as awards for her individual books. In 1995, she was named the A. Watson Armour III University Professor Emeritus of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Princeton.

In 1978, it was merged with McDowell Holdings, a subsidiary of United Breweries Group. In 1997, it was acquired by the South Korean company LG Chem, which renamed the company to LG Polymers India. LG Chem expanded its operations at the LG Polymers plant five times between 2006 and 2018. The plant manufactures polystyrene, co-polymer products, and engineering plastic compounds. === Lack of environment clearance === The South Korean parent company, LG Chem, said in its May 2019 affidavit, a part of an application for environment clearance, that the company did not have a legitimate environmental clearance issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), after receiving an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), substantiating the produced quantity and for continuing operations. According to the EIA notification (amendment) of 2006 under the Environment Protection Act of 1986, LG Chemicals India, which is part of the petrochemical industry, falls into the category 'A' and should get clearance from the MoEFCC every time they expanded their plant or brought a change to their manufactured product after November 2006. LG Chem expanded its operations at LG Polymers plant five times between 2006 and 2018 without such clearance. According to the May 2019 affidavit, since 1997, it was instead operating with state permits required for starting a new business with renewals every five years. However, LG Chem spokesperson Choi Sang-kyu told the Associated Press (AP) that the company had followed Indian laws and operated based on the officials' guidelines at the state and federal level. He said that the affidavit was a pledge of compliance with the law, rather than an admission of violating the law. After the 2006 notification, Choi said that the company consulted the ministry and was told that no clearance was required. However, Environment Secretary C. K. Mishra told the AP that the plant would have no requirement of clearance in 2006, but a clearance was imperative for any expansion or production change thereafter. LG Polymers had never asked for a federal clearance until 2017, and as per the minutes of a meeting between the company and the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, the latter denied the former's request for producing engineering plastics at its plant. However, a member of the state pollution board said there was no information regarding any order by the state government to stop the plant's operation. In 2018, the company applied for an environmental clearance for the first time, to expand its manufacturing capacity of polystyrene, a plastic used to make bottles and lids. The Environment Ministry sent the application for a review citing that the company did not have a clearance for the chemicals it was already manufacturing. The company withdrew the application while applying for a retroactive clearance that the ministry offered to companies in 2018 as a one- time amnesty, which remained pending until the fatal leak occurred. According to the AP, officials and legal experts like Mahesh Chandra Mehta, an environment lawyer, indicated that the plant seemed to be operating in a legal grey area, with the environmental clearance required under central regulations while the state executives are to look after the enforcement. However, to date there is no indication that the lack of environment clearance played a role in the disaster. Experts are also skeptical, as the plant operated for years without any clearance. Mehta also pointed out that many such industries are operating without a clearance, which shows how weak the environmental laws are in India that has to its credit several of the world's most polluted cities. Mehta also said that each time the company renewed that permit, the state pollution board, which has the power to enforce federal environmental law, would have been able to fine the company or deny a permit until it received federal clearance, which it never did. Dr. B. Sengupta, environmental scientist and former head of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), said that the state permits only consider pollution and do not consider the site safety. In contrast, federal clearance assesses risks concerning the handling and storage of hazardous materials, prevention of potential disasters, and mitigation in cases of disaster. == Leakage and effects == === Facilities and leakage === The plant was re-opened on 7 May 2020 following the nationwide lockdown implemented as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plant stored 2,000 metric tons (1,968 long tons; 2,205 short tons) of styrene in tanks, which were left unattended. Styrene monomer must be stored between because higher temperatures result in rapid vaporization. It is believed that a computer glitch in the factory's cooling system allowed temperatures in the storage tanks to exceed safe levels, causing the styrene to vaporize. Between 2:30 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., when maintenance activity was in progress, the gas leaked from the plant and spread to nearby villages. === Acute effects === The fumes spread over a radius of 3km (1.86 mi). Five villages (R. R. Venkatapuram, Padmapuram, BC Colony, Gopalapatnam, and Kamparapalem) were the most affected areas. Hundreds of people were rushed to hospitals following widespread breathing difficulties and sensations of burning eyes. Many had been found lying on the ground, unconscious as a result of gas exposure. The initial estimate noted at least 11 deaths and 20‚Äì25 people in critical condition. By the next day, the death toll had risen to thirteen. More than 1,000 people were reportedly exposed to the gas. Late at night on 7 May, police ordered the evacuation of people in a radius of the leak. However, police subsequently stated that this evacuation was precautionary and that there had not been a second leak. == Probable leakage and removal of chemicals == Experts from the central government who inspected the plant said that it would have faced a catastrophe had the violation of safety norms at other storage facilities of the plant gone unnoticed for a few more days. They said those facilities were vulnerable to a leak of vapour on a larger scale and stored in a high-risk condition. An expert said polymerization was noticed in another storage. According to Deccan Chronicle, two experts from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Dr. Anjan Ray, director of the Indian Institute of Petroleum, and Shantanu Geete, an industry expert, inspected the storage facilities of the plant, as well as the Vizag port. Dr. Ray, an expert in styrene, recommended that the government immediately remove the materials from the facility. On 11 May 2020, the Andhra Pradesh government directed the company to remove 13,000 metric tonnes (MT) of material out of the country. With the Ministry of Shipping's help, the state government arranged two vessels to carry the load, split into portions of 8,000 MT and 5,000 MT, to the company's headquarter in Seoul. Mekapati Goutham Reddy, minister of industries of Andhra Pradesh, said that the preliminary conclusion from the experts' inspections was that the storage facilities were not designed to keep the material for a long duration. However, the plant personnel claimed that the material was emptied every 10 to 15 days and never stored more than the assigned period. == Relief and rescue == Nearly 200-250 families were evacuated from villages in a radius around the plant. About 300 people were hospitalized, according to a media report. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy, announced an ex gratia of for each family of those killed as a result of the accident. He also announced for those who received primary treatment, for those who received longer treatment, and for those on ventilator support. To neutralize the gas, around of the antioxidant 4-tert-butylcatechol (PTBC) was airlifted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and sent to the crippled factory. Additionally, the central government flew in a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) specialized CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) team from Pune to the site. == Remedial measures by LG == LG Chemicals started support measures to eliminate all risk factors in the plant. In its effort, LG brought ACtify 2680, a green retarder, and ACtify 2673, a polymerisation inhibitor, from Dorf Ketal Chemicals, a Mumbai-based chemical company. To ensure the site's safety, LG said the retarder and inhibitor would be added into the tanks of the styrene stored at LG Polymers to prevent further degradation and any future gas leaks. The ACtify series retarder is a new green polymer retardant that displays thermal stability and protection during unscheduled shutdowns. On 13 May 2020, the LG Chemicals informed media that an eight-member technical team, comprising experts from its Seoul headquarters' departments of production, environment, and safety were sent to investigate the incident and to rehabilitate the victims. LG Polymers India said the team would take prompt rehabilitation and real-time remedial measures. They would meet the victims and affected families to explain support measures in detail and hold meetings with the local State government officials. == Investigation == According to the preliminary investigation, a gas valve malfunction is believed to have caused the leak. The leak was from one of two chemical tanks that had been left unattended since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The malfunctioning of the tank's refrigerating unit led to an increase in temperature, causing the liquid chemical, suspected to be styrene, to evaporate. However, experts have claimed that other chemicals may have also leaked, as styrene is unlikely to spread over due to its chemical properties. === Legal actions === As part of the police investigation following the leak, a first information report (FIR) was filed against LG Polymers by the local police. The report allowed for possible charges under sections 278 (making the atmosphere noxious to health), 284 (negligent conduct with respect to poisonous substance), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life), and 304 (causing death by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53330370>  National Green Tribunal  A petition was filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), India's top environmental court, demanding an investigation into the incident by a high-level committee. A bench headed by the then NGT chair, Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, was formed, and the case was scheduled to be heard on 8 May 2020. On 8 May, the bench ordered LG Polymers India to deposit an amount of as an initial amount with the District magistrate of Vishakapatnam to mitigate the damages caused due to the incident. It issued notices to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), in which it sought the responses of the individual boards and the ministry. It also constituted a five-member fact-finding committee to probe the incident and to deliver a report to the bench. The committee would be supervised by former Andhra Pradesh High Court judge, B. Seshasayana Reddy. The report of the high-level committee headed by the NGT chair issued on 28 May 2020, accessed and reviewed by The Associated Press, found that the storage tanks were outdated and lacked temperature sensors, allowing the styrene vaporization to go undetected. With factory workers and the overall company inexperienced in storing tanks of such dangerous chemicals, the report blamed the incident on \\"gross human failure\\" and a lack of basic safety norms.  Human Rights Commission  The same day as the incident, the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) gave notice to the Andhra Pradesh Government and the central government that it considered the incident a gross violation of India's constitutional right to life. In their notice, the NHRC was seeking a detailed report from the Andhra Pradesh Government on rescue operations, medical treatment, and rehabilitation. It also asked the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs to investigate any possible breaches of workplace health and safety law. Both reports are expected to be delivered within four weeks. == See also == * 2020 Assam gas and oil leak * Bhopal disaster * System accident == References == == Bibliography == *The Vizag gas leak is the most recent of human disasters with the potential to change our lives forever by The Business Insider Category:2020 disasters in India Category:2020 industrial disasters Category:2020s in Andhra Pradesh Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Chemical disasters Category:Disasters in Andhra Pradesh Category:Health disasters in India Category:LG Corporation Category:Man-made disasters in India Category:Mass poisoning Category:May 2020 events in India Gas leak ","title":"Visakhapatnam gas leak"},{"id":"63883494","text":"Paddy Fisher is an American football linebacker for the Northwestern Wildcats. ==High school career== Fisher attended Katy High School in Katy, Texas.

It offers a powerful cell-free (or in vitro) system for studying various cell biological processes, including cell cycle progression, nuclear transport, DNA replication and chromosome segregation. It is also called Xenopus egg cell-free system or Xenopus egg cell-free extract. ==History== The first frog egg extract was reported in 1983 by Lohka and Masui. This pioneering work used eggs of the Northern leopard frog Rana pipiens to prepare an extract. Later, the same procedure was applied to eggs of Xenopus laevis, becoming popular for studying cell cycle progression and cell cycle-dependent cellular events. Extracts derived from eggs of the Japanese common toad Bufo japonicus or of the Western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis have also been reported. ==Basics of extract preparation== The cell cycle of unfertilized eggs of X. laevis is arrested highly synchronously at metaphase of meiosis II. Upon fertilization, the metaphase arrest is released by the action of Ca2+ ions released from the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby initiating early embryonic cell cycles that alternates S phase (DNA replication) and M phase (mitosis). ===M phase extract=== Figure 1. An egg extract is prepared by crushing X. laevis eggs by centrifugation Unfertilized eggs in a buffer containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) are packed into a centrifuge tube. After removing excess buffer, the eggs are crushed by centrifugation (~10,000 g). A soluble fraction that appears between the lipid cap and the yolk is called an M phase extract. This extract contains a high level of cyclin B-Cdk1. When demembranated sperm nuclei are incubated with this extract, it undergoes a series of structural changes and is eventually converted into a set of M phase chromosomes with bipolar spindles. ===Interphase (S phase) extract=== ==Different types of egg extracts== ===Cycling extract=== Figure 2.

Lin discovered the neural circuits in the hypothalamus that give rise to aggression in mice. Her lab at NYU now probes the neural circuits underlying innate social behaviors, with a focus on aggressive and defensive behaviors. == Early life and education == Lin was born in Shanghai, China. She pursued her undergraduate degree in biology at Fudan University in 1997 and studied Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease for her undergraduate research project. After graduating with a Bachelor‚Äôs of Science in Biological Science in 2001, Lin pursued her graduate education in neurobiology at Duke University in North Carolina. Lin studied under the mentorship of Lawrence Katz, exploring the neural processes underlying olfaction. Since olfaction is critical in perceiving the social environment, Lin explored how the olfactory bulb represents complex mixtures of social olfactory stimuli. Using electrophysiological recordings and by fractionation of the volatile compound in mouse urine, she found that populations of mitral cells are activated to single volatile compounds. Specifically, she found one component of male urine, (methylthio)methanothiol (MTMT), which enhances the attractiveness of urine to female mice and that one third of mitral cells are responsive to this olfactant. Lin then conducted an analysis of the responses of olfactory glomeruli to single stimuli and she found that each individual volatile component of a complex olfactant activated one or very few glomerli. This finding showed that the sum of responses to individual olfactory stimuli present within a complex olfactory stimulus gives rise to the neural representation of a complex smell. After completing her graduate work in 2005, Lin moved to California to conduct her postdoctoral work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Lin worked under the mentorship of David Anderson exploring the neural circuits underlying innate social behaviors, specifically aggression, in mouse models. In the Anderson Lab, Lin discovered the role of the ventromedial hypothalamus in driving aggressive behavior. She found that optogenetically stimulating the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus causes male mice to attack both male and female mice as well as inanimate objects. She also found that pharmacologically silencing these neurons prevented aggression and using in vivo electrophysiological recording she determined that these neurons are inhibited during mating. Lin completed her postdoctoral work in 2010. == Career and research == In 2010, Lin began her faculty position at the New York University Langone Medical Center where she holds titles as an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and an Associate Professor of Neuroscience and Physiology. Lin‚Äôs lab explores the neural circuit mechanisms driving innate social behaviors in mice, with a specific focus on aggression and defensive behavior. Lin‚Äôs seminal work discovering the role of the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) in driving aggressive behavior lays the foundation for most of her lab‚Äôs research program. They use genetic tools and in vivo recordings to dissect the many other brain regions within the VMHvl network, they explore the similarities and differences in female versus male neural mechanisms of aggression, and they probe the specific neuropeptides and neurotransmitters that mediate communication in these circuits. === Hypothalamic neural circuits underlying aggression === After discovering the role of the VMHvl in aggression, Lin and her team wanted to explore the neural computations that give rise to aggressive behavior. They found a population of neurons that were specifically activated in response to male investigation, male attack as well as distance from the male aggressor and animal velocity during attack. Through linear regression, Lin and her team found that the VMHvl is capable of encoding environmental stimuli that are important is driving and maintaining aggression in mice ushc as movement, sensory information, and motivation. Lin and her team then explored the neural mechanisms of voluntary attack. They found that the VMHvl is essential for aggression-seeking behavior, such that optogenetic inhibition of this area decreased aggression-seeking while activation increased aggression-seeking and intensified future attack. Performing population optical recording and in vivo electrophysiology allowed them to see that the VMHvl neurons track learned aggression-seeking behavior as well as extinction of this behavior. Lin‚Äôs team then found that a specific circuit, the VMHvl to the lateral periaqueductal grey (lPAG) projection, played a role in transforming the motivational and sensorimotor signals from the VMHvl into aggressive behavioral outputs. Since the neural signals in these downstream VMHvl projectors were time locked to jaw muscle movement, Lin and her team proposed that the lPAG neural activity represents a simplifies VMHvl code that drives aggression-related actions. === Defence behavior === Since Lin had previously found that VMH activation had led to defensive behavior in some of her mice in her postdoctoral work, she pursued an understanding of which VMH neurons encode or drive defensive behavior. She found that the estrogen receptorŒ± expressing cells were excited during defence. When these cells were inhibited optogenetically, it prevented effective defensive behavior in animals that were being attacked. Through further activity dependent investigation, they found that the anterior VMHvl cells were specifically activated due to defence behavior compared to aggression, suggesting that these cells act as a neural substrate for conspecific defence. == Awards and honors == * 2016 Irma T.

Funchal, on Madeira's south shore, is the islands' largest city and principal port. ==Climate== The climate of Madeira is subtropical and maritime. The average annual temperature ranges between 15 and 20¬∫ C at sea level. The climate becomes more temperate with elevation, and frost and snow occur most winters on Madeira's high elevations. Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 750 mm. Prevailing winds are from the northeast, and rainfall is higher on the windward north side of the island. The mountain slopes are frequently shrouded in orographic clouds and fog, sustaining cloud forests in the wettest areas. ==Flora== Madeira has about 1,226 native species of vascular plants. 66 vascular plant species are endemic to the islands, including two endemic genera, Chamaemeles and Musschia. Madeiran endemics include Polystichum maderensis, Cerastium vagans, Armeria maderensis, Goodyera macrophylla, Viola paradoxa, Crambe fruticosa, Matthiola maderensis, Sinapidendron angustifolium, Saxifraga maderensis, Sorbus maderensis, Cytisus maderensis, Senecio maderensis, Phalaris maderensis, Pittosporum coriaceum, and Musschia wollastonii. Another 54 species are endemic to Macaronesia. Over half of Madeira's plant species are also found in the Mediterranean Basin. Before Madeira was settled, laurel forests, known as laurissilva covered most of the island. Laurissilva now covers 16 of the island, and is found between 300 and 1,300 meters elevation on the Madeira's wet north-facing slopes, and from 700 to 1600 meters elevation on the south-facing slopes. Laurissilva is characterized by evergreen trees with glossy leaves, and trees in the laurel family (Lauraceae) are prominent. The laurissilva is similar to the ancient subtropical forests of the Mediterranean Basin, prior to its climate cooling and drying during the ice ages. The paleobotanical record of Madeira reveals that laurissilva forests has existed in this island for at least 1.8 million years. The Canary Islands and Azores are home to smaller areas of laurissilva. The laurissilva of Madeira is of two main types. Moist laurisilva is found on north-facing slopes and canyons. The predominant trees are Laurus azorica, Ocotea foetens, Persea indica, and Clethra arborea. Trees are covered with epiphytic mosses and lichens. Dry laurisilva is found on south-facing slopes, and predominant trees are Apollonias barbujana, Laurus azorica, Picconia excelsa, Visnea mocanera, and Clethra arborea. Other laurissilva plants include the trees Heberdenia excelsa, Laurus nobilis, Pittosporum coriaceum, and Rhamnus glandulosa, and the large shrubs Ilex perado and Ilex canariensis. The laurissilva has an understory of shrubs, ferns, herbs, mosses, and liverworts. Understory plants include the giant cranesbill Geranium maderense, the Madeiran squill (Scilla madeirensis), and the endemic orchids Dactylorhiza foliosa and Goodyera macrophylla. Mountain heathland grows on the high ridges and mountains above the laurissilva. Characteristic shrubs are tree heath (Erica arborea), besom heath (Erica platycodon ssp. maderincola), and Madeira juniper (Juniperus cedrus). Along the southern coast, low forests dominated by the endemic wild olive tree (Olea europaea cerasiformis) and the shrubs Maytenus umbellata, Chamaemeles coriacea (a Madeiran endemic), Dracaena draco, and Asparagus scoparius survive in coastal ravines up to 200 meters elevation. A secondary coastal shrubland of Euphorbia piscatoria, Echium nervosum. and Globularia salicina forms in disturbed areas. Low forests dominated by marmolano (Sideroxylon mirmulans) occur along the northern shore, and in pockets above the south shore Olea forests from 200 to 300 meters elevation. Other coastal plant communities include low shrubland, perennial grassland, and annual grassland.Capelo, Jorge, Miguel Sequeira, Roberto Jardim, Sandra Mesquita, and Jos√© Carlos Costa (2005). \\"The vegetation of Madeira Island (Portugal). A brief overview and excursion guide\\". Quercetea 7: 95-122, 2005 ALFA, Lisboa, Portugal. ==Fauna== 295 bird species and subspecies have been recorded on the Islands, and 42 of them breed here. Endemic bird species include the Trocaz pigeon (Columba trocaz), Zino's petrel (Pterodroma madeira), Desertas petrel (Pterodroma deserta), and Madeira firecrest (Regulus maderensis). The Madeiran chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs madeirensis) is an endemic forest subspecies of the common chaffinch. Berthelot's pipit (Anthus bertheloti) and Atlantic canary (Serinus canaria) are Macaronesian endemics. Tyto alba schmitzi is a Madeiran subspecies of Western barn owl, Accipiter nisus granti is a Macaronesian subspecies of Eurasian sparrowhawk, and Falco tinnunculus canariensis is a Macaronesian subspecies of common kestrel. The plain swift (Apus unicolor) breeds on Madeira and the Canary Islands, and ranges over northwestern Africa. Zino's petrel is a Madeiran breeding endemic, and the Desertas petrel breeds only on the Desertas islands. Other seabirds include the Madeiran storm petrel (Oceanodroma castro), Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae), little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis baroli), white-faced storm petrel (Pelagodroma marina hypoleuca), and yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). Regular visitors include the little egret (Egretta garzetta), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), Eurasian whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), dunlin (Calidris alpina), and ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres). Two bats inhabit the islands ‚Äì the Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis), a Macaronesian endemic, and a subspecies of lesser noctule (Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus). The islands have two endemic lizards. The Madeiran wall lizard (Teira dugesii) lives on Madeira, Porto Santo, the Desertas, and the Selvagens. The Selvagens gecko (Tarentola bischoffi) is endemic to the Selvagens. The islands have over 500 terrestrial invertebrate species, including insects, spiders, and molluscs. ==Human impacts== Portuguese settlers arrived after 1420, and are the first known settlers. The islands' trees were cut for their timber, and Persea indica was the most sought-after. In the 16th and 17th centuries the southern side of Madeira was converted to sugarcane plantations. A system of levadas, water channels 80-150 cm wide, was constructed of stone and later concrete to irrigate the sugarcane fields. Forests and shrublands were denuded to provide charcoal for the islands' sugar mills. Goats, sheep, and cows were introduced to the islands, and forests were converted to pasture land, and the forest understory was grazed intensively. Many exotic plants and animals have been introduced to the islands. A few are invasive. Plantations of Pinus pinaster and Eucalyptus globulus were planted at middle elevations. Eucalyptus has spread extensively on the south slope of Madeira, displacing native species. ==Conservation and protected areas== Approximately 15,000 ha of laurissilva remain on Madeira, mostly on the northern side of the island. 90% of the laurissilva is primary forest, and includes trees up to 800 years old that predate settlement of the islands. The remaining 10% is secondary growth in areas that were last cut during the mid-20th century. 483 km¬≤ (60%) of the ecoregion is in protected areas Madeira Natural Park, established in 1982, protects an area of 444 km¬≤, covering most of Madeira including the island's remaining laurissilva forests. From the 1980s goats and sheep were removed from the forests and the non-forested areas of the park, which has allowed the forest understory and shrublands to recover. The Madeira Islands laurel forest was designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1999, covering an area of 150 km¬≤. The Selvagens were made a nature reserve in 1971, and the Desertas in 1990.UNEP-WCMC (2020). Protected Area Profile for Portugal from the World Database of Protected Areas, August 2020.

Hamilton was a co-founder of Standard Air Lines and through a series of airline mergers became one of the \\"Three Musketeers\\" running Trans World Airlines. ==Early years== Hamilton was born to Wilbur and Martha (Stellmacher) Hamilton on June 9, 1901 in Los Angeles, California. He became a mechanic for the Duesenberg Motors Company. ==Aviation career== Hamilton learned to fly at Burdett Field in Los Angeles by instructor Burdett Fuller. Hamilton became good friends with two other pilots he met there, Jack Frye and Paul E. Richter. Hamilton, Frye, and Richter pooled their money together in 1925 and formed Aero Corporation of California (Aero Corp). Aero Corp bought Burdett Fuller's flight school and did everything from flight instruction, banner towing, crop dusting, charter flights, to supporting local high school aviation clubs. Hamilton ran the aircraft maintenance division of Aero Corp, while Frye and Richter focused on the flying. Hamilton's ability to tune aircraft engines allowed Frye and Richter to set multiple aircraft speed and altitude records, such as the 1926 Reginald Denny Trophy, 1927 Western Flying Trophy, and a 1926 18,000ft altitude record. In preparation for extending their business into Arizona, the trio earned their Arizona State Commercial Pilot Certificates on the same day with Frye getting certificate #1, Hamilton #2, and Richter #3. On February 3, 1926, Standard Air Lines was formed as a subsidiary of Aero Corp, but didn't start flight operations until November 28, 1927. Standard Air Lines ran scheduled passenger service from Los Angeles to Phoenix to Tucson and return. Within a year they extended the route to El Paso, Texas. Standard started with single engine Fokker F-7 aircraft, but soon upgraded to the Fokker F-10 tri-motor aircraft. As in Aero Corp, Hamilton ran the aircraft maintenance for Standard, while Frye and Richter focused on the flying. In early 1930, Western Air Express bought controlling interest of Standard Air Lines, but continued to run it as a separate entity and made Hamilton, Frye, and Richter vice presidents of the Standard Division. In July 1930, Western Air Express merged with Transcontinental Air Transport to form Transcontinental and Western Air (T&WA;). Because of Standard's southern route from Los Angeles to El Paso, the government forced the sale of Standard Air Lines to American Airlines as part of the deal. Hamilton, Frye, and Richter elected to stay with the newly formed T&WA.; Transcontinental and Western Airlines eventually changed their name to Trans World Airlines (TWA) where Hamilton was Superintendent of Maintenance, Frye became President, and Richter Executive Vice President. The trio became known at TWA as the \\"Three Musketeers\\" and was the inspiration for the TWA slogan \\"The airline run by flyers.\\" In 1939, Hamilton left TWA for a position at the Douglas Aircraft Company. ==World War II== Hamilton was called to service in the US Navy in 1942. He worked in the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics and was released from active duty in 1944 at the rank of Captain. ==Personal life== Hamilton married Wilma Sutton in Los Angeles on July 6, 1920. He later married Harriet Fairchild and became the step-father to Juanita and Warren. ==Death== After the war, Hamilton returned to work at TWA. Hamilton died of a kidney infection on March 28, 1946 at the Research Hospital in Kansas City. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. == References == ==External links== *TWA Spirit TWA Co-Founder Walter Hamilton *TWA Museum *Jack and Helen Frye Story Category:1901 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Commercial aviators Category:Airline founders Category:Trans World Airlines people Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Aviators from California ","title":"Walter Hamilton (airline executive)"},{"id":"63883694","text":"The Noire River (French: Rivi√®re Noire) is a tributary of the English River, flowing in the municipalities of Franklin and Saint-Chrysostome, in the Le Haut-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Mont√©r√©gie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This small agricultural valley is mainly served by the route 209 which passes on the south shore and by the rang-de-la-Rivi√®re-Noire Nord road which passes on a segment of the north shore. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March.

During his education in Subotica, he distinguished himself as a gifted pianist, and as early as 1863 he played at a public concert. In parallel with his study of medicine in Prague (which he also studied in Pest) he studied privately with Bed≈ôich Smetana.

With the inevitable salon virtuosity he stood out with his brilliant technique, and at concerts, he often performed works by Serbian composers, his contemporaries, as well as his own compositions and arrangements of folk tunes. Although using a very simple compositional technique, these works - on folk themes or in the folk spirit - were so popular that the people accepted them as their own (eg, \\"Branko's Wheel\\", created on the occasion of the transfer of Branko Radiƒçeviƒá's bones from Vienna to Stra≈æilovo in 1883).Paƒçu's concerts had a great patriotic significance, especially in Hungary, where Serbs fought for their national rights.

It encompasses the Azores archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. These volcanic islands are an autonomous region of Portugal, and lie 1500 km west of the Portuguese mainland. ==Geography== The Azores archipelago consists of nine main islands. The islands extend for more than 600 km (370 mi) in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction. The islands form three clusters. Flores and Corvo are to west; Graciosa, Terceira, S√£o Jorge, Pico, and Faial are in the centre; and S√£o Miguel, Santa Maria, and the Formigas islets are to the east. S√£o Miguel is the largest of the islands, and most populous. The islands are rise steeply from the sea. Mount Pico (2,351 m) on Pico is the highest peak in the Azores. ==Climate== The islands have a temperate maritime climate, moderated by the Gulf Stream. Frosts don't occur below 500 meters elevation. The average temperature is 21¬∞ C in the summer months, and 14.5¬∞ C in the winter. ==Flora== Little natural vegetation remains in the lowlands. The evergreen fire tree (Myrica faya) regrows on old lowland lava flows. Above 500 meters elevation there are enclaves of evergreen shrub forest, characterized by the trees Laurus azorica, Juniperus brevifolia, Picconia azorica, and Erica azorica. Shrubs include Azorean holly (Ilex perado subsp. azorica), Viburnum tinus subsp. subcordatum, and Azores blueberry (Vaccinium cylindraceum), a tall shrub with showy dark-pink flowers. Clethra arborea, a Madeiran native introduced to the islands by humans, has become common in the evergreen forests. Diverse highland peat bogs are found on the islands of Flores and Terceira. ==Fauna== There are 36 species of birds that breed on the islands. The Azores bullfinch or Priolo (Pyrrhula murina) is endemic. The Azores have two native mammals, both bats ‚Äì the greater mouse- eared bat (Myotis myotis) and endemic Azores noctule (Nyctalus azoreum). The islands have no native land mammals. ==Conservation and threats== The Azores were discovered and settled by Portuguese mariners in the 15th century. Prior to settlement the islands were mostly covered in forest. The settlers cleared most of the islands' forests for agriculture and pasture. Domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats were introduced to the islands, along with the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), black rat (R. rattus), Western European house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus), European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), least weasel (Mustela nivalis), and ferret (M. putorius furo). The introduced herbivores altered the island's ecology through grazing, and the introduced predators preyed on native species, particularly birds and their eggs, which were unadapted to predation. Exotic plants originally introduced for timber, windbreaks, and garden plants, including Japanese red cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), Australian cheesewood (Pittosporum undulatum), kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), ice plant (Carpobrotus edulis), Gunnera tinctoria, bigleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla) and the Madeiran native Clethra arborea, have spread into wild areas where they displace native plants and alter habitat for native animals. The Azores bullfinch relies on a few native plants for food ‚Äì Azores blueberry and Azorean hawkbit (Leontodon filii) in August and September, and Azorean holly in March and April. Loss of these food plants contributed to the species' declining population. Between 2003 to 2008 an EU-funded project removed exotic species and replanted native food plants in the Pico da Vara/Ribeira do Guilherme Special Protection Area on S√£o Miguel, and the local Azores bullfinch population subsequently rebounded. BirdLife International (2010). \\"Habitat restoration has led to the recovery of the Azores Bullfinch\\".

It was founded together with the European Youth Centre in Strasbourg to implement the Council of Europe's youth policy. It is based in Strasbourg and has an annual budget of around 3.5 million euros. ==History== The EYF was established in 1972 with initially 17 member states and became a fixture in 1975, a time when traditional youth organizations, like trade unions or party political youth wings, started losing attractiveness and members and at the same time the demand for cultural and leisure services grew. Together with the activities at the European Youth Centre in Strasbourg, the EYF played a vital role in Europe to set up standards in youth work and youth policy making, as well as to strengthen the youth field, which led to the First Conference of European Ministers responsible for Youth in 1985 in Strasbourg. In the early years, until 1988, a so called governing board with young representatives from youth organizations ensured formal youth participation and established the unique co-management structures at the Council of Europe's youth sector. A reform of this Youth Sector by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1988 replaced the non- governmental Governing Boards of the European Youth Foundation and of the European Youth Centre with a single Advisory Committee for both instruments, as well as a new intergovernmental committee, the European Steering Committee for Youth (CDEJ) with the governmental representatives of the member states. In the beginning, the EYF primarily funded activities run by youth organizations, but over time it started to focus more and more on projects that concern all the players in the Council of Europe‚Äôs youth policy, including projects run by young people who are not members of associations and local projects. Since another reform of the Youth Sector in the Council of Europe in 1998, the EYF got a new Statute and has been implementing a programme of financial support to pilot projects linked to the work priorities of the youth sector, namely South-Eastern Europe, conflict regions and human rights education). In 2001, it funded about 200 projects a year, involving over 10 000 young people, and provided support to help over fifty youth organizations to develop their international activities with a total amount of aid of . In June 2008, the Programming Committee on Youth (CPJ) agreed to launch a consultative process on the evolution of the EYF, 10 years after its last reform with the aim of ensuring greater transparency, a greater impact and simplification. Based on this reform, which entered into force on 1 January 2013 the EYF got new revised operational regulations, including the focus on international co-operation activities, structural grants and ad hoc pilot activities. ==Procedures== The Foundation supports and promotes the projects of regional, national and international non-governmental and non- profit youth organizations and networks in Europe, which are by and with young people (youth led), promoting the Council of Europe's youth sector's priorities and having a gender perspective through nonformal learning. Grant application deadlines are on 1 April and 1 October every year, as well as on 1 October every second year for two-year structural grants. Decisions on funding priorities and applications are made equally by representatives of the governments of the member states and by young people themselves in the so called Programming Committee on Youth (CPJ). This committee is composed of eight members each from the European Steering Committee for Youth (CDEJ) with the governmental representatives and the Advisory Council on Youth (AC) with the non-governmental young representatives. Since 1972, more than 350,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 30 have benefited from activities realized with EYF funds. Around 950 organizations from the 50 member states of the European Cultural Convention are registered as partners. The various projects must be related to the values and objectives of the Council of Europe, like human rights, democracy, rule of law, tolerance and solidarity.

It marks the south-eastern entrance to Galway bay and the port of Galway known as the South Sound, with a red sector of the light marking the Finnis Rock. The Eeragh Lighthouse which marks the North Sound entrance to the bay on the north-western side of the islands, was also constructed at the same time. Inisheer and Eeragh both became operational in 1857. ==History== The first lighthouse on the Aran Islands was built in 1818 on Inishmore near Dun Oghil, but it became apparent that it was poorly positioned. Firstly, because it could not be seen at the hazardous ends of the Aran Islands chain, where the North and South Sound approaches were located, and secondly, its location on the highest point of the island also meant it could be obscured in poor weather conditions. Requests from the Revenue Commissioners to the Ballast Board, the predecessor of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to relocate the light went unheeded. But in 1850 the Galway Harbour Commissioners asked the Board to construct a new lighthouse at the north-west end of the islands. To meet this request, it was determined that the best approach was to construct two lighthouses, one on Inisheer and the other, the Eeragh Lighthouse, on one of the Brannock Islands to the north-west of Inishmore. The design of both lights was carried out by George Halpin Junior with construction starting in 1853. They were commissioned on December 1, 1857, with the Inishmore light being deactivated that same date. The Inisheer Lighthouse had a first order optic, supplied by Chance Brothers of Birmingham that emitted a fixed white light with a red sector signalling the Finnis reef. Daniel Crowe & Sons of Dublin constructed both lighthouses and associated buildings, the cost for Eeragh was ¬£15,126.1s.7d. (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) with Inisheer being ¬£14,252.2s.4d (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) In 1913, an incandescent lamp powered by paraffin was installed and its characteristic changed from a fixed light to one that flashed every ten seconds. Inisheer was automated and electrified in 1978, but retained the Chance optics from 1913. In 2014 the optic was replaced by an LED light, with a slightly reduced range. ==Operation== Detail of the tower The optic is located at a height of , within a lantern room at the top of a limestone tower which has been painted white with a broad central black band. The two keeper's houses are built close by, but the light is now maintained by an attendant living some distance away, who monitors the equipment via a radio link. With a focal height of above the sea, the light from the first order Fresnel lens could be seen for 20 nautical miles in the case of white light and 16 nautical miles for the red light. With the installation of the LED light, this has reduced to 18 and 11 nautical miles respectively. The light characteristic is now slightly different from that of 1913, the light emits a white or red light, depending on the direction, in isophase of 12 seconds, that is, it is illuminated for six seconds and darkened during other six. It emits red light in the sector between 245 ¬∞ and 269 ¬∞. In addition, the lighthouse is equipped with a radar or RACON beacon that emits the letter K in Morse code with a range of 13 nautical miles. ==Listed buildings== The lighthouse tower and the two keeper‚Äôs houses are all listed within the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, where it is noted \\"This dramatically sited lighthouse is a masterpiece of ashlar limestone construction\\". ==Access== Located at the southern point of the island on Fardurris point, the site and tower are closed apart from the occasional open day. == See also == * List of lighthouses in Ireland * MV Plassy which ran aground on Finnis reef in 1960 == References == Category:Lighthouses completed in 1857 Category:Lighthouses in the Republic of Ireland Category:Lighthouses on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage ","title":"Inisheer Lighthouse"},{"id":"63885058","text":"NK Alam Chowdhury is a Jatiya Party (Ershad) politician and the former Member of Parliament of Nilphamari-1. ==Career== Chowdhury was elected to parliament from Nilphamari-1 as a Jatiya Party candidate in 1996. ==References== Category:Jatiya Party politicians Category:Living people Category:7th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"NK Alam Chowdhury"},{"id":"63885081","text":"Ahmaad Rorie (born January 1, 1996) is an American basketball player for Keravnos of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1.

The substance exists as an equilibrium of 17 tautomers that easily interconvert among each other. Calculations show that the symmetric tri-oxo form (1,4,7-trihydro-2,5,8-trioxo-s-heptazine) is the most stable. Therefore, this compound contains amide groups rather than imidic acids. ==History== In 1834 Justus von Liebig described the compounds that he named melamine, melam, and melon. In 1835 Leopold Gmelin prepared novel salts by heating potassium ferrocyanide with sulfur); recognizing their connection to the compounds described by Liebig, he named the salts \\"hydromelonates\\" and the corresponding acid \\"hydromelonic\\". In the following years Liebig prepared the same salts by other methods, such as by fusing potassium thiocyanate with antimony trichloride, and eventually determined the formula for the acid. Cyameluric acid, and salts were prepared in 1850 by W. Henneberg, by treating Gmelin's \\"hydromelonate\\" with alkali. The first person to suggest a structure for cyameluric acid was J. Loschmidt, as far back as 1861. His structure was in fact a meta-cyclophane, but it is remarkable since at that time cyclic compounds of any type were not widely recognised. The correct structure (for the trihydroxy tautomer) was published in 1937 by Linus Pauling and J. H. Sturdivant. ==Structure and properties== Numbering of the heptazine atoms The various tautomeric forms differ in the position of the hydrogen atoms. Each oxygen is connected to one of the corner carbons; it may be bonded to a hydrogen, forming a hydroxy group; or may have a double bond to the carbon, in which case the hydrogen is bonded to one of several adjacent nitrogen atoms. The trihydroxy tautomer is one of several that have more than one planar conformational isomer. In this case, there is a symmetric one, with all three hydroxyls bent in the same direction around the ring, and an asymmetric one, with one of them bent in the opposite direction compared to the other two. Calculations show that the symmetric form 1,4,7-trihydro-2,5,8-trioxo is the most stable. The energy of the asymmetric 1,3,7-trihydro-2,5,8-trioxo form is estimated to be 5.61 kcal/mol higher, and that of the two conformations of the trihydroxy form are 19.84 (symmetric) and 20.18 (asymmetric) kcal/mol higher. ==See also== * Melem, 2,5,8-triamino-heptazine. ==References== Johann Josef Loschmidt (1861), Konstitutionsformeln der Organischen Chemie in Graphischer Darstellung.

It accused Keroche of making substandard alcoholic drinks. Without the KeBS mark, Keroche would not have been possible to sell its products in Kenya.https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2001339180/keroche-breweries-woes-started- in-2003.https://allafrica.com/stories/200304090723.html KeBS would in 2016 again seek to withdraw the permits from Keroche. This was after the President issued a crackdown order on illicit and substandard alcoholic products. Keroche, however, moved to court and won the case.https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Kebs-takes-permits-war-with- Keroche-to-Court-of-Appeal/539546-3057982-15kjdilz/index.html. ===Kenya Revenue Authority=== Keroche Breweries has had long - running battles with the Kenya Revenue Authority on tax. In 2015, the company was shutdown for two weeks over a backdated duty of about Sh1 billion for the ready to drink Vienna Ice vodka. KRA ordered the company not to produce excisable goods, an essential shutdown as all alcoholic products are excisable. However, it would be re-opened after a court reversed the KRA order.https://citizentv.co.ke/business/keroche-breweries-reopened-after-court- order-96246/In 2017, the company won a decade-long court battle against the tax man over a tax bill of Kes. 1.1 billion (USD 110 million). In August 2019, Keroche Breweries CEO Tabitha Karanja and her husband, the company's chairman, Joseph, were arrested on charges of tax evasion of Kes. 14 billion (USD 140 million). They were accused of mis-declaring [excise] tax and [VAT] between 2015 and 2019. They were released on a cash bail of Kes. 10 million for the CEO and Kes. 2 million for her husband.https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Keroche- Breweries-bosses-Karanja-court-tax-evasion/1056-5246060-htl2cu/index.html. The matters were however referred to the Tax Appeals Tribunal, with Keroche lodging six appeals. The dispute mainly revolved around the manufacture process of Vienna Ice ready-to-drink Vodka. The Brewer argued that Vienna Ice was not a separate product from its Crescent Vodka as all they did was to dilute it. They therefore paid excise on the vodka component of the drink rather than the full diluted product. KRA argued that as a separate product, it should have excise calculated on the total volume. The other issue in contention was the classification of its pineapple based wines. The brewer classified the wines under World Customs Organization HS Code 22.04 as a fortified wine. However KRA argued that 22.04, which attracts less duty, is for grapes-based wines only and the pineapple based wined should have been classified under HS Code 22.06, which covers others. The tribunal ruled in favour of Kenya Revenue Authority on all the matters but faulted the tax authority for charging interest while the matter was in court.The matter is in appeal.https://www.the-star.co.ke/business/kenya/2020-03-12-keroche-loses- sh9bn-tax-dispute-against-kra/. ===Sachets=== Keroche, in its early days, allegedly sold alcohol in cheap sachets. These are controversially believed to have contributed to alcoholism in the central region of Kenya and rural Kenya, before their ban in 2004.https://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/How-Naivasha-became- paradise-for-moonshine-brewers/1950946-5256108-107hgsbz/index.html. The company has indicated that copycats infiltrated the market and copied their brands, leading to their move away from plastic bottles to using glass bottles.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32495853.

The diversification of Keroche into beer making disrupted the market forcing EABL to issue two new beer brands targeted at low income earners in 2013. https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/brewers-bring-beer-fight-to- east-africa--1314302 In 2020, EABL and Keroche Breweries became engaged in a court battle over the use of the brown Euro Bottle for selling beer.https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/kenyans-on-twitter-join-in-eabl-vs- keroche-breweries-fight-over-euro-beer-bottles/ar-BBZxHGY. EABL engraves its name on beer bottles but Keroche does not. The contention is whether bottles engraved by EABL should be used exclusively for EABL products.

He died in an encounter with Indian security forces on 6 May 2020. == Life == Naikoo was born in Beighpora, a village in Awantipora tehsil, Pulwama district, in April 1985. Some of his relatives have said that he had a passion for painting, especially roses, during his school and college days.Ahmed Ali Fayyaz (7 May 2020), \\"With Riyaz Naikoo's Death, Has Era of Militant Poster Boys Ended?\\", The Quint. Retrieved 13 May 2020. After earning a degree in mathematics he became a math teacher at a nearby school. He gave free tuition to children from economically weaker backgrounds. During the 2010 unrest, he was put under detention by the security forces. On 1 June 2012 he disappeared and resurfaced with a gun. In the next five years he lived the life of a militant and rose to become the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen commander (de facto chief) in Jammu and Kashmir after the death of Burhan Wani and the defection of Zakir Musa. In March 2014, he was involved in killing of a Sarpanch‚Äôs father Haji Ghulam Mohd Dar in Dogripora. He was also wanted for killing and abduction of police officers, murder, firing on a police bus, looting and terror requirement among other crimes. In 2018, police detained Naikoo's 70-year-old father. In retaliation, family members of police were kidnapped by militants from across south Kashmir. His father was soon released and the 11 hostages were accordingly let go by Naikoo. Jammu and Kashmir Police had alleged that he would \\"loot orchard owners\\". Naikoo started the practice of offering gun salutes to militants killed in encounters and posting them on social media. He was responsible for recruiting \\"scores of young Kashmiris in an armed quest for independence from India\\". Police say he rarely used mobiles, used a VPN when he had to, and was known to have used the Bat Messenger app to communicate. Naikoo's videos were circulated on the social media; one such video after the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir showed him saying that the revocation was \\"irrelevant to us\\" and the fight would continue. Naikoo carried a bounty of Rs 12 lakh on his head. Naikoo‚Äôs last audio message in April was related to the COVID-19 pandemic where he requested people to follow medical advice to keep themselves protected. == Death == Naikoo was killed in a gun battle with 21 Rashtriya Rifles and Jammu and Kashmir Police on 6 May 2020 in Beighpora. He was with an associate who was also killed. The encounter was viewed as a big victory for the security forces.Naikoo had been a category A++ terrorist and was in the top 10 on the most-wanted list in Kashmir. As per policy Naikoo's body was not handed back to his family. He was one of Kashmir's longest surviving militants (May 2012 to May 2020 or for 8 years). As a precautionary measure to curb the spread of news, government authorities information imposed communications and information blackouts by barring internet and mobile services across Kashmir valley right after Naikoo's assassination. Protests against the killing of Naikoo were the first since August 2019, when the revocation of Kashmir's special status took place, with at least one protester dying and 50 seriously injured with bullet wounds to the chest and some with pellet injuries in one or both eyes. Syed Salahuddin, the head of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, who is designated as a terrorist by India and the United States, said that \\"the sacrifice would help them achieve the mission that they had set out to achieve\\".

He was first identified as a suspect in the disappearance of a fellow university student in October 2019. On October 30th, after searching his home in Villa Santin, Toluca, State of Mexico, officers found the strangled bodies of three women, two of them buried in the backyard and one hidden in the bathroom. Guzm√°n went on the run, but was arrested over a month later on December 6th. After his capture he admitted to killing not only the three women, but also three other people: a girl and her father in 2012, in Otzolotepec, as well as his own father in 2006, when he was just 16 years old. He is currently awaiting trial for the murders. == Background == Little is known about √ìscar's early life before his crimes, but there have been suspicions that his father was physically abusive to his mother and him.Although Guzm√°n would declare that he was attracted to the idea of killing in his youth, paradoxically, unlike many other serial killers, he also showed a great interest and attachment to animals. At the time of his capture, he had two dogs and a cat as pets, for which he showed great concern during his time in jail. According to Dr. Feggy Ostrosky, his inclination for animals could be because of pathological narcissism, where he sees himself as a \\"protector\\", by taking care of animals he can exercise this role without any resistance from his prot√©g√©s. She considers him a psychopath and narcissist, who is eager for attention. Among his hobbies were krav maga, which he actively practised for at least four years, death metal, satanism and stories about serial killers, whom he admired for their \\"intelligence\\". Although he had lived alone for years, √ìscar was economically dependent on her mother, and neighbors described him as a quiet man who never spoke to anyone and always dressed in black. At the time of his capture, he was studying psychology at a local university. == Murders == === Initial killings === √ìscar's first victim was his own father, whom he murdered at 16 years of age in 2006. During a phone call with his mother from prison made in January 2020, he confessed to the crime. Later on, he formally admitted his guilt. The circumstances surrounding his father's death have not been disclosed, but the prosecution has confirmed that Guzm√°n was responsible. His next victims were a woman identified only as \\"M√≥nica\\" and her father. Guzm√°n first encountered her on September 10, 2012, at a high school in Otzolotepec, quickly becoming enfatuated with and stalking her. At one point, he went to her house and decided to search through, unaware that the girl's father, identified only as \\"Tom√°s\\", was there. After being discovered by the latter, √ìscar decided to kill him, stabbing the man repeatedly and later finishing him off with an axe. He then sat down and waited for M√≥nica to return, with the deceased Tom√°s' remains still in the house. When she arrived, Guzm√°n subdued her using his skills in krav maga and took her to his house in Villa Santin, where he kept the girl alive for two weeks, repeatedly sexually assaulting and torturing her, before ending her life by beating her to death two days before her birthday. He then dismembered the body, put the remains in cardboard boxes and threw then in a ravine in El Mirador, Mexico City. === Fourth and fifth murders === Guzm√°n's next victim was Adriana Gonz√°lez Hern√°ndez, a 27-year-old psychology student at the Insurgentes University of Toluca, who disappeared on March 24, 2017, after leaving her home in El Ranchito neighborhood in Toluca. According to relatives of hers, a few days before her disappearance, Adriana presented √ìscar as her \\"boyfriend\\" at a family gathering. He later confessed to activist Frida Guerrera Villalzavo that he kept Adriana alive until February 2018. The fifth victimw as Martha Patricia \\"Patty\\" Nava Sotelo, 25, a criminology and law student who disappeared on February 9, 2019 in Huixquilucan. Months before she vanished, Patty expressed concerns to her family that somebody was following her, in particular, of a black truck whose driver kept driving after her. It is known that √ìscar knew the Nava family, as the mother was his neighbor. After her disappearance, the last place where Patty's cell phone reception was detected was near the Villa Santin house. She was held captive under the effects of Rivotril (a brand of clonazepam) for several days until her death later that month. === Last murder === The last victim was 23-year-old J√©ssica Guadalupe Orihuela, a fellow psychology student studying in the same university as Guzm√°n, who disappeared on October 24, 2019, after leaving her home in Colonia 5 de Mayo. √ìscar had started harassing her months before her abduction. When she vanished, J√©ssica's family suspected that it none other than Guzm√°n himself: they came to his house on several occasions, but he repeatedly denied having seen her and ended up threatening them to \\"stop bothering him.\\" Far from that, several family members stood outside the house for four days between October 26th and 30th. Legally, the police couldn't enter the premises without a court order, which took several days to arrive, despite the fact that the relatives claimed to have seen J√©ssica through the house windows. On October 30th, the order finally came. The police entered the house, but by then, Guzm√°n had fled. While examining the household, they found J√©ssica's strangled body in the bathroom. She had reportedly been killed hours prior to discovery. == References == Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Mexican criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:Mexican serial killers Category:Patricides Category:People from the State of Mexico ","title":"√ìscar Garc√≠a Guzm√°n"},{"id":"63885625","text":"Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød (born 11 July 1966) is a Tunisian-French film producer. ==Biography== He grew up in Carthage and became passionate about cinema, to the point of bringing VHS tapes from France with the help of a diplomatic friend of his parents.

It was founded in 1941 when Undeb Cenedlaethol y Cymdeithasau Cymreig (National Union of Welsh Societies) and Pwyllgor Amddiffyn Diwylliant Cymru (Committee for the Protection of Welsh Culture) merged to form a new organization with the aim of promoting Welsh culture and the Welsh language and to be the focus and medium of cooperation for that purpose. The new organization took the name of the earlier patriotic movement Cymru Fydd, which was established in 1886. == Cultural activity == Undeb Cymru Fydd's main activity was to press the UK government to adopt policies specific for Wales and to promote the Welsh language in areas such as education and broadcasting. In addition, a series of books and magazines such as Atgofion Cymru (Welsh Memories) for Welsh-speaking members of the armed forces during World War II. Cymdeithas Lyfrau (Book Society) was formed in 1943; which published a journal for teachers Yr Athro (The Teacher), 1951-ca1970, as well as popular calendars. After Undeb Cymru Fydd suspended activity in 1970, Yr Athro was published by Welsh teachers' union UCAC. A joint Committee between Undeb Cymru Fydd and the Churches was appointed to address the displacement of factory workers by the civilian wartime service during World War II. == Political activity == One of the movement's first campaigns was the unsuccessful struggle to protect Mynydd Epynt, a Welsh-speaking farming community as well as other areas of Wales from being occupied by the War Office during World War II. In 1950 a special conference was held which resulted in the Parliament for Wales Campaign culminating in a petition containing 250,000 names being presented to the UK Government. Undeb Cymru Fydd was overtaken by events in the 1960s with the rise of political Welsh nationalism and the establishment of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) in 1962. Throughout its existence, Undeb Cymru Fydd campaigned for Welsh-medium schools, the establishment of an Education Committee, and for better and more Welsh language provision in the media. == Organisation == Undeb Cymru Fydd was managed by a Council and an Executive Committee, and committees addressing specific topics (education, radio, books, and Welsh Churches). At a local level, there were 13 branches inherited from Pwyllgor Amddiffyn Diwylliant Cymru. It held an Annual Conference, usually in June or July. After 1967, there were expert panels covering topics related to women, education, and television. In 1956, a Women's Committee was established, which published its own newsletter, Llythyr Ceridwen (Ceridwen's Letter) between 1956 and ca. 1967. In September 1965, Undeb Cymru Fydd was reorganised and registered as an educational charity, promoting Welsh-medium education for adults, and from then on the Ymddeirdolaeth Cymru Fydd (Cymru Fydd Trust) received applications for financial assistance. All activities ceased in March 1970. and the charity was dissolved in 2000. TI Ellis (1899 - 1970), son of the politician Thomas Edward Ellis (1859 - 1899) who played an important role in the 19th-century incarnation of Cymru Fydd, was secretary of the movement until 1967. Tom Jones worked as a full-time organizer, 1944-1949, as did Gwilym Tudur, 1966 - 1968. The records of Undeb Cymru Fydd were donated to the National Library of Wales in 1997. == References == == Further reading == * T. I.

Jose Gozar was born on April 8, 1918 in Bgy. Ilaya, Calapan, Mindoro to Juan Gozar and Calixta Cangco. His primary and secondary education were completed in his hometown, and after graduating as batch salutatorian from the Mindoro High School in March 1936, he entered the University of the Philippines' College of Liberal Arts as a scholar. Upon his graduation he joined the Philippine Army Air Corps and completed his flight qualifications at the Philippine Army Aviation School at Zablan Airfield in Camp Murphy in the Class of 1940 and commissioned as a 3rd Lieutenant. Lt. Gozar was then assigned with the Philippine Army Aviation School as an Instructor Pilot, training the last batch of airmen before the outbreak of World War II. ==Military Career== On December 8, 1941, despite receiving the news on the attack on Pearl Harbor early in the morning, the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) and its air component, Far East Air Force (FAEF), were caught by surprise by bombers and fighters of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy from Takao Airfield in Formosa. By the end of the day, the FAEF's aircraft inventory was reduced by half, with only a few squadrons surviving the initial raid, including the PAAC 6th Pursuit Squadron. At 11:30 am on December 10, while the officers and men of the 6th Pursuit Squadron was having lunch, general quarters was sounded. Capt. Jesus Villamor, along with Lieutenants Godofredo Juliano, Geronimo Aclan, Alberto Aranzaso, and Jose Gozar met another wave of Mitsubishi G3M bombers and Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters over the skies of Zablan Airfield and Pasig with their Boeing P-26 Peashooters. Jose Gozar Monument in Calapan Plaza In the ensuing dogfight, according to accounts and witnesses, Lt. Gozar's guns jammed and he then attempted aerial ramming of an enemy bomber. After a handful attempts by Lt. Gozar, the Japanese airman turned west and left the area. Lt. Gozar's wingman, Lt. Aclan, following the same tactic was also recognized with a Silver Star. Capt. Jesus Villamor in turn was credited for two kills. The following day, the 6th Pursuit Squadron moved to Batangas Airfield, while Lt. Gozar was left behind with some of the men in Nichols Airfield. On December 12, a force of 27 bombers and 17 fighters targeted Batangas Airfield, and in this aerial battle the PAAC received its first casualty, Lt. Cesar Basa. The 6th Pursuit Squadron returned to Nichols Airfield on December 13 with 4 remaining P-26s. The following day another Japanese bombing raid came, and only one aircraft from the 6th Pursuit Squadron was able to scramble, with Lt. Gozar as pilot. Lt. Gozar was able to survive the encounter against three Japanese Zeros with one unconfirmed kill, and land his damaged aircraft. The accomplishments of Capt. Villamor and the 6th Pursuit Squadron was used by the USAFFE to bolster the morale of the ground troops. On December 15 Capt. Villamor, Lt. Gozar, and Capt. Colin Kelly (posthumously) were personally awarded by Gen. Douglas MacArthur the Distinguished Service Cross for their defense of the airspace above Manila. Lt. Gozar's wingmate, Lt. Godofredo Juliano on the other hand received two Gold Crosses Upon activation of War Plan Orange, the 6th Pursuit Squadron and the rest of the PAAC were ordered to destroy their aircraft inventory. Lt. Gozar and his unit were ordered to a strategic retreat to Bataan and Fort Mills on Corregidor Island, and transformed their mission to air defense. Lt. Gozar and his fellow townmates, Lt. Salvador Encarnacion, and Lt. Arnulfo Acedera who were left in Zablan, found themselves separated from their unit, and proceeded to Bataan on their own. During the early part of the Battle of Bataan, Capt. Villamor and his unit were still hoping to receive new aircraft from Australia. However, the shipment of the Pensacola Convoy never came through. The PAAC was limited then to aerial reconnaissance from Cabcaben Airfield, and anti-aircraft activities. By April 9, 1942, the forces under Gen. Edward P. King in Bataan, which included some the men of the PAAC, surrendered to the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army. Lt. Gozar and his unit joined the Bataan Death March, and was incarcerated in the Prisoner-of-war camp in Camp O'Donnell, Capas, Tarlac. On August 1942, Filipino POWs were released by the Japanese, and Lt. Gozar returned to Calapan and regrouped with fellow officers of the PAAC from Mindoro, Lt. Encarnacion and Lt. Acedera. With instructions from Capt. Villamor, Lt. Gozar and his group made an attempt to escape to Australia and report to the South West Pacific Area. ==Death== Lt. Gozar and his companions left Mindoro and crossed to Panay, and from there crossed to Negros Island where they were initially suspected by the local guerillas as spies. They continued in their attempt to reach Mindanao, but weather conditions at the Tanon Strait turned unfavorable. Their small banca became swamped, and thus Lt. Gozar and Lt. Encarnacion, who was a former varsity member of the Swimming Team of the De La Salle University, attempted to swim back to shore, leaving Lt. Acedera. Lt. Acedera was able to survive by hanging on to the banca, and return to shore and report their status. In the next days, it was assumed Lt. Gozar and Encarnacion were both lost at sea, as no trace except for the latter's jacket was found. By late 1945 Lt. Gozar and Lt. Encarnacion were declared dead. ==Awards and Recognition== For his actions on December 10, 1941, Gozar received the Distinguished Service Cross. Lt. Gozar's citation stated: AWARDED FOR ACTIONS DURING World War II Service: Foreign Battalion: 6th Pursuit Squadron, Division: Philippine Army Air Corps Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, General Orders No. 48 (1941) > The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress > July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross > to Third Lieutenant Jose P.

Jose Gozar engraved by Waterlow and Sons. *On July 1, 1957, the Philippine Air Force began constructing Lt. Jose Gozar Air Station on Lubang Island, Occidental Mindoro, and the radar station became fully operational on November 16, 1961 with the activation of the 582nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (ACWS).

Gozar on his centennial birth anniversary as its Town Hero, and unveiled a marble bust at the Calapan City Plaza. During the event, the Philippine Air Force's Air Education and Training Command based in Basilio Fernando Air Base, in Lipa City, Batangas, conducted a fly past and Missing man formation. *The Philippine Air Force Aerospace Museum in Pasay City has inducted Lt. Gozar in its Wall of Heroes. Lt. Gozar's name is also listed in the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Akron, Ohio, USA. *A number of streets are named after Lt. Gozar. One in Calapan City, another in Naujan, one at the Philippine Air Force's Headquarters at Villamor Air Base, and one at Armed Forces of the Philippines' General Headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo. There is also one barangay and two elementary schools on Lubang Island named after Lt. Gozar. ===Quotations=== *\\"Right now, we are part of God‚Äôs children who ceaselessly roam because of the war. There are still a lot of people left on earth who wholeheartedly offer shelter to wanderes. So what have we to fear?\\" - Quote from the last letter of Lt. Gozar to his family in Mindoro. == References == Category:Filipino military aviators Category:University of the Philippines alumni Category:Military history of the Philippines Category:People from Oriental Mindoro Category:People lost at sea Category:Philippine Air Force Category:1918 births Category:1942 deaths ","title":"Jose Gozar"},{"id":"63885732","text":"Marie-Christine L√™-Huu is a Canadian actress and playwright from Quebec.\\"Marie-Christine L√™-Huu : auteure assum√©e\\".

Earle. It was initially made for Vaudeville performances but was later adapted to a movie cinema. The theatre was a thriving venue for theatrical stage performances, films, and big band jazz music in the 1930s and 1940s, nurturing talents such as Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Billy Eckstine. The Count Basie Orchestra opened a one-week engagement at the Earle Theatre on Friday, 23 January 1942, breaking opening records. Basie also played at the Downbeat jazz club while in Philadelphia. Cab Calloway had an annual concert at the theatre. The theatre returned to Vaudeville for periods, including April 1931Motion Picture Herald, April 25, 1931. and September 1940, with a four-week production of Boom Town.Motion Picture Daily, Jul-Sep 1940. By 1953 the popularity of the theatre had declined due to the growth of television, and the last stage show was given on February 26, 1953. The theatre was demolished later that year and replaced with a two-story department store. ==Architecture== At the time of construction in 1923, the theatre was the costliest theatre ever constructed in Philadelphia. The opulent grand theatre in the Italian renaissance style contained 2768 seats, of which 1164 seats were on the balcony.Stanley Company Will Open New Playhouse This Month, Exhibitor's Herald, 22 March 1924.

Between 2013-2017 around 10,000 titles, capturing 120 years of Great Britain on film, were digitised and made free-to-access in a variety of ways. Many archival clips can be watched for free online via BFI Player. == Unlocking Film Heritage (UFH) == British Film Institute (BFI) feared that the UK‚Äôs audiovisual heritage was in danger of being stranded in the analogue domain and forever inaccessible to the people of Britain. So they made a five year plan - Film Forever: Supporting UK Film 2012-2017 in order to remedy this. BFI consulted and collaborated with commercial facilities, national and regional archives as well as commercial rights holders to establish, harmonise and document technical standards and requirements for preservation and access. Aided by National Lottery funding, the Unlocking Film Heritage Digitisation Fund was launched in 2013. The goal of the programme was to ensure that researchers, film-makers, outreach programmes and the general public easier can access the British intangible cultural heritage. In order to achieve this investments were done in preservation, digitisation and interpretation of audiovisual archival material. The content of the material spans from urban architecture to rural landscapes, from festivals to schools, from local people to famous visitors etc. Around 10,000 titles were digitised and have been documented within the BFI collections information database and the majority are free-to-watch as part of Britain on Film and other themed collections on BFI Player, a webpage developed for within the project. Public access was extended further through social media, theatrical, broadcast and home entertainment releases on Blu-ray and DVD. The UFH project was one of the largest and most complex archive preservation projects undertaken in UK and it won the award for Best Archive Preservation Project at the FIAT/IFTA (International Federation of Television Archives) world conference in Warsaw 2016. A jury of international experts were impressed by the highly collaborative nature of the UFH project, where expertise and commercial service providers from all of UK nations and regions participated. They jury also praised the new technologies and processes invented and used, where the aim was not only to care for the archival collections but also to make them accessible to a digitally connected world. == Participants in the UFH project== The following organisations participated in the project; === East Anglian Film Archive (EAFA) === This regional film archive was one of the first in UK, established in the 70s as a repository for the regions audiovisual heritage.

Already the programme of the publication series Deutsche Musikb√ºcherei showed a strictly anti-modernist, German-national orientation. Since 1919 he had a friendship with the book illustrator who illustrated many of his printed products. He published the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik in 1929 until his death in 1943. In 1939 he was appointed honorary senator of the University of Cologne because of his merits for the Anton Bruckner movement. Since May 1, 1933, Bosse had been a member of the NSDAP (membership number 2.530.992). He was also leader of the artificial circle of the NS-community Kraft durch Freude. On 19 March 1938 Bosse gave the following autobiographical information in response to the questionnaire from the : > After the war I was often active in the national struggles for a new > Germany.

The UOSH project forms part of the core programme 'Save Our Sounds' led by the British Library and involving a consortium of ten regional and national archival institutions. Between 2017 and 2022 the aim is to digitise and make available up to 500,000 rare and unique sounds recordings, not only from the British Library's collection but from across the UK, dating from the birth of recorded sound in the 1880s to the present time. The recordings include sounds such as local dialects and accents, oral histories, previously inaccessible musical performances and plays, and rare wildlife sounds. The consortium will also deliver various public engagement programmes, and a website where up to 100,000 recordings will be freely available to everyone for research, enjoyment and inspiration. == Save Our Sounds == Launched in January 2015, 'Save our Sounds' is the British Library‚Äôs initiative to preserve and make available rare and unique sound recordings, create a radio archive and create a technical infrastructure that will allow born digital music to be preserved . In 2015, the British Library gathered information on the sound collections held by institutions, societies, associations, trusts, companies and individual collectors. 488 collection holders were identified, which together had 3,015 collections, containing 1.9 million items. Most of the information from the audit can be found in the 'UK Sound Directory'. According to a consensus of international sound archivists, there is only a finite number of years before sound collections become unplayable and effectively lost . This is because some formats such as wax cylinders and acetate discs start to naturally decay and equipment required to play some formats will become obsolete. The solution to counteract this is to digitise the recordings and make sure that existing archival material is properly preserved. It is also important to have adequate systems in place for the acquisition of future sound production. 'Save the Sounds' therefore has three major aims, to: * Preserve, digitise and make available as many as possible of UK's rare and unique sound recordings. This will be achieved through the 'Unlocking Our Sound Heritage' project between 2017 and 2022, by a consortium of ten national and regional archival institutions, other selected content contributors, various volunteer organisations and individuals. * Establish a radio archive that will collect, protect and share a substantial part of the UK‚Äôs radio output. This will be carried out by working with the radio industry and other partners. * Invest in new technology so that music in digital formats can be received and to ensure long-term preservation in the future. This will be realised by working with music labels and industry partners. The British Library is also developing a new 'Universal Player' for audio as part of the programme. == UOSH and the British Library == The project was developed in response to, the very real, risk of losing historic recordings forever as the tapes and discs deteriorated, the increasing costs of old playback equipment and a lack of specialist skills . Between 2017 and 2022, the UOSH project aims to preserve, digitise and publish online thousands of rare, unique and at-risk sound recordings from the British Library as well as from other collections around the UK. The consortium has created a network of ten audio preservation centres with staff in place to catalogue and digitally preserve audio recordings. The centres will also deliver programmes of public engagement and outreach activities, including workshops, tours, exhibitions and events . In 2021 a newly developed, purpose-built media player and website, hosted by the British Library, is scheduled to be launched. It will allow the public freely to explore and access recordings that have been cleared for online publication. The regional archival institutions will provide onsite access to their own recordings and those that do not have licences and permissions to be published online. All the digitised recordings can be found in the British Library's 'Sound and Moving Image' (SAMI) catalogue. The National Lottery Heritage Fund provided the UOSH project with a ¬£9.5 million grant and other donors include the Garfield Weston Foundation, the Foyle Foundation, the Headley Trust, the British Library Trust and American Trust for the British Library, as well as other charities and individuals. The total project funding has now reached ¬£18.8 millions. The British Library alone houses over 6.5 million recordings, which feature speech in all spoken languages, music, theatre, radio programmes, oral history, wildlife and environmental sounds from all over the world. Some of the collections and recordings which will be digitised include: slang, dialects and accents from every social class and regional area in the UK, from the 1950s ‚ÄòSurvey of English Dialects collection' to the ‚ÄòBBC Voices archive'; writers reading their own works, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Sylvia Plath and James Joyce; a collection held in the Canterbury Cathedral archives spanning 50 years of services, choral and opera performances; oral histories from World War I and World War II; pirate radio; sound recordings of British wildlife, coastlines and nature, for example calls of long extinct birds and a recording that helped to save the bittern from extinction in the UK; musical performances and theatre plays, including Laurence Olivier playing 'Coriolanus' in 1959; traditional, pop and world music; oral history interviews with people from all walks of life, ranging from Kindertransport refugees, migrant workers to second wave feminists and people with disabilities; radio broadcasts going back to the 1930s, including international pre-war stations such as Radio Luxembourg, Radio Lyons, Radio Normandie as well as early previously unheard BBC Radio recordings with American blues, gospel and jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong, Sonny Terry and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. == Participating institutions == === Archives+ in Manchester === Archives+ at Manchester Central Library is the centre for the North West region, which covers libraries, archives and museums from Cumbria, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. Some of the collections and recordings included in the UOSH project are: 'Manchester Studies oral history archive' created by academics at Manchester Polytechnic during the 1970s and 1980s; the 'Manchester Voices' accents and dialects project ('Manchester Metropolitan University'); interviews with a sword- swallower, a suffragette, the organiser of the Mass Trespass of Kinder Scout, grand-daughter of a woman who witnessed the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre; a gig by Paul Simon, and recordings of killer whales made in the waters surrounding Shetland held by the Centre for Wildlife Conservation at the University of Cumbria. One collection that will be useful for family and social historians is the 'Manchester Studies collection' which includes interviews with people from all over Greater Manchester, who were born in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The collection provides a snapshot of working-class life in the first half of the twentieth century and interviews cover subjects such as life histories, pioneering women in politics, trades unions, domestic service, the cotton industry, pawnbroking, Trafford Park, music halls, maternity services and housing. === Bristol Culture === Bristol Archives (part of Bristol Culture) is working together with 14 museums, archives and institutions in South West England including Kresen Kernow, Gloucestershire Archives and the South West Heritage Trust. Some of the collections being digitised by Bristol Archives include oral history recordings from the British Empire and Commonwealth collection, performances from St Pauls Carnival, 1960s hospital radio from Gloucestershire, and Cornish oral histories and music. The digitised and catalogued recordings will be preserved at the British Library, with local copies also available to listen to at the relevant local reading rooms. Copyright-cleared material will be made available online via the British Library website as well as Bristol Archives' online catalogue. === London Metropolitan Archives === Between 2018 and 2021 London Metropolitan Archives aims to digitise and catalogue sound recordings from their own audio collections as well as those held at local archives, universities, museums and galleries across the Greater London area, including Tate, the Royal National Theatre in London, the Royal Institution of Great Britain and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), as well as borough archives such as Hackney, Brent, and Southwark. The recordings cover everything from oral histories, world music and academic lectures to urban soundscapes. === National Library of Scotland === The National Library of Scotland will be working with 17 different collection partners to digitise, catalogue and clear rights to showcase archival recordings online or on-site. The collections are varied, encompassing oral history, lectures and presentations, traditional music and wildlife recordings that originate from all over Scotland. The Library has also developed an artist-in-residence programme as part of the UOSH project. The first engagement was Val O‚ÄôRegan from Birdhouse Studio in Argyll, who worked with Innellan Primary School and Benmore Botanic Gardens to create new artistic works inspired by the Scottish Ornithologists' Club‚Äôs collection of birdsong and interviews with ornithologists. The Library also has an ambitious volunteer programme both in Glasgow and remotely to digitise, contextualise and curate the content of the recordings. There are also ongoing engagement projects with schools and higher education institutions. === National Library of Wales === Sound & Screen Archive is the department of the National Library of Wales that cares for sound and audiovisual archival materials. The sound collections encompass many aspect of Welsh culture and life in Wales, including private recordings ‚Äì such as concerts, interviews, lectures, readings, oral history interviews and radio programmes ‚Äì as well as commercial material. There are also sound recordings that extend beyond the boundaries of Wales, helping to place the rest of the collections in a wider context. During the UOSH project, sound recordings on various formats including wax cylinder, vinyl, reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and Mini Discs will be digitised, catalogued and made accessible. The material includes interviews with Welsh migrants to North America and Patagonia, dialect recordings, lectures, interviews with industry workers, their families and the community, archives of Welsh traditional music and political speeches by national politicians. The following sound collections and recordings will be digitised as part of the UOSH project: * 'Clwyd Oral History collection' * 'Glenys James collection' * 'Colin Edwards collection' * 'Creating Memory () collection' * 'Llanrwst Memory project' * Collection (the first Welsh language magazine for blind and partially sighted people) * 'Powysland Club collection' * the 'Ceramic Archive collection' from University of Wales Aberystwyth * 'Story of the Forest collection' * 'BBC Radio Cymru collection', including recordings dating back to the late 1930s recorded for the BBC Home Service * the 'Wax Cylinder collection', including the only known recording of Welsh Revivalist preacher Evan Roberts, made in 1904/5 * 'Tredegar Library collection' * 'St Fagans collection' from St Fagans National Museum of History * 'Tiger Bay Heritage & Cultural Exchange collection' * 'Archive of Traditional Music in Wales' () from University of Wales Bangor * the 'Cardiff Business Club collection', comprising speeches made from 1993 onwards to the Cardiff business community * 'Ceredigion Library collection' containing oral history interviews with people from Ceredigion during the 1960s and 1970s Some notable recordings include the 1949 'Eisteddfod Genedlaethol' in Dolgellau, the Cynog Dafis interview with Kate Davies, the poem In Parenthesis read by David Jones and the speech Why should we not sing? by David Lloyd George. As part of the UOSH project, Screen & Sound is working with communities and special interest groups in the Welsh regions. In spring 2020, it announced 20 commissions of ¬£100 to enable composers, musicians and choirs to create new and unique works during the Covid-19 lockdown, by using digitised sound recordings from the collection as inspiration. The aim was to create new interpretations of the sound collections, based on oral histories recorded from various parts of Wales, and present the work in new and exciting ways. The commissioned work will be filmed and displayed on various websites and NLW's social media accounts. === National Museums Northern Ireland === Since 2018 as part of UOSH, National Museums Northern Ireland has already digitised and catalogued over 4,000 recordings from open reels, CDs and cassettes held in its sound archive at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra. These eclectic recordings were collected by curators of the Folk Museum since the early 1960s to capture ways of life that were disappearing. Highlights include many tales of folklore, featuring fairies, ghosts, banshees, cures, childbirth, weddings and wakes; extensive interviews on Ulster‚Äôs churches, religious societies, fraternities and traveller groups; past and present on Rathlin Island; diverse musical pieces, from the Belfast Harp Orchestra to blind fiddlers and Lambeg drummers; famous flautists James Galway and Matt Molloy, uilleann pipers S√©amus Ennis and Liam O%27Flynn, and traditional singers Maighr√©ad N√≠ Dhomhnaill and Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh; accounts of domestic life, agriculture, fishing, turf-cutting, and the origins and vernacular buildings of the Ulster Folk Museum; stories of crafts such as embroidery, lacemaking and weaving; oral history interviews about various Ulster industries, such as textile and linen factories, and transport ‚Äì from Harland & Wolff‚Äôs shipyards to champion motorcyclists, biker culture, Belfast‚Äôs black taxis and the DeLorean Motor Company factory; the loyalist lion-keeper, ‚ÄòBuck Alec‚Äô Alexander Robinson; and 500-plus interviews of the Tape-Recorded Survey, a study of Hiberno-English dialects around Ireland in the 1970s. Most of these recordings coincided with The Troubles, and while political figures such as Rev. Ian Paisley, John Hume, Richard Needham and Charles Haughey feature among the voices, few other recordings focus directly on the conflict. Nonetheless, the tapes provide valuable insights into how ‚Äòordinary‚Äô life carried on throughout. There are also numerous clues to the causes and symptoms of communal strife, even in the sectarian lyrics to children‚Äôs playground rhymes in the late 1960s. National Museums Northern Ireland is also digitally preserving the collections of six partner institutions, from the Glens of Antrim Historical Society to Manx National Heritage. Project outreach work has involved engagement programmes for local community groups, and providing content from May Blair‚Äôs interviews with former Lagan Navigation workers for the Waterways Community‚Äôs Storymaking Festival. === Norfolk Record Office === Over three years Norfolk Record Office aims to digitise sound recordings from their own collections as well as from other collections in the East of England. === The Keep, Brighton === The South East centre for the UOSH project (Keep Sounds) is based at The Keep in Brighton. The project is preserving sound recordings held by East Sussex and Brighton & Hove Records Office (ESBHRO), the University of Sussex Special Collections, the Royal Pavilion & Museums Trust (RPMT), Eden Valley Museum, the National Motor Museum Trust at Beaulieu, Southampton Archives and Wessex Film & Sound Archive (WFSA) at Hampshire Archives. The recordings being digitised include oral history interviews from across the region, exploring all areas of working and domestic life in the 20th century; home recordings from the Copper Family, talks from the modern iteration of the Headstrong Club and a large collection of talks from the Friends of the Motor Museum Trust. === Tyne & Wear Archives and Museums === Tyne & Wear Archives and Museums is the centre for the North East and Yorkshire. The sound recordings will be digitised on-site at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. === University of Leicester === The Midlands centre for the project is based in Special Collections in the David Wilson Library at the University of Leicester. Material is being preserved from collections held in Birmingham, Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. == See also == * Unlocking Film Heritage Project is a UK-wide digitising project for audiovisual archival material. * Endangered Archive Programme * Theatre Archive Project * Qatar Digital Library == References == == External links == * Report: UK Sound Directory; National Audit of UK Sound Collections (Describing the approach, methodology used and analyses of the results.) * Database: British Library's Sound and Moving Image (SAMI) Collections * Website: Archives + in Manchester; Bristol Culture; British Library Sounds (Includes over 90,000 sound recordings, like; music, drama and literature, oral history, wildlife and environmental sounds.) * Blog: British Library's Sound and Vision; The Keep's UOSH; University of Leicester's UOSH; Copyright and Sound ‚Äì A year with the UOSH project (LMA) * Twitter: @BLSoundHeritage; @ScotlandsSound (and more) * Hashtag: #UOSH, #saveoursounds Category:Projects established in 2015 Category:Projects in Europe ","title":"Unlocking Our Sound Heritage"},{"id":"63885920","text":"The tree Castanopsis pierrei is in the family Fagaceae. It is found in Thailand and Cambodia. It provides fuel, food and crop-shading. ==Description== A shrub, or small tree, growing some 5-10m tall. It has leaves with an entire margin, and spiny capsules. The capsules have 1 to 3 nuts each, with the acorn measuring some 3-5cm. ==Habitat== C. pierrei occurs in open formations at low elevations, below 200m. In Thailand it also grows at low altitude, below 100m, in evergreen forest, often near streams. It is found in Northeastern, Southeastern and Peninsular Thailand. In Northern Thailand it is found growing in natural hillside evergreen forest. In Cambodia it is especially common in Siem Reap and Preah Vihear provinces. It also occurs besides roads in Phnom Penh. In the southern Cardamon Mountains and the Botum- Sakor peninsula, the tree occurs in both the short and tall Evergreen sandstone forest. The major timber-extraction forest type, the tall forest occurs on more fertile and clay-rich soils of hill slopes from 10 to 600m elevations. Mixed within the tall forest, with sharp boundaries at times, sometimes gradational, the short evergreen sandstone forest is found on shallow or poor soils, such as the thin soils over sandstone rock, pebble layers, or deep sand soil with a thin humus layer. ==Vernacular names== In Cambodia it is known as kha√¥hs ba:y kri√´m (kha√¥hs=\\"oak\\", ba:y kri√´m=\\"rice- crust\\", Khmer). ==Uses== In Northern Thailand, the tree is used to shade crops in the shifting fallow agriculture of the area, and it provides firewood. The floury fruits, cooked under ashes, are appreciated in Cambodia and the wood is regarded as a good firewood. ==References== pierrei Category:Flora of Cambodia Category:Flora of Thailand Category:Plants described in 1875 ","title":"Castanopsis pierrei"},{"id":"63885924","text":"Elisa Riedo is an academic in the fields of physics, nanotechnology and engineering.

Priced just under $120 and running Android 10, Realme positions it as a budget gaming handset capable of playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, and is the first device to ship with the MediaTek Helio G70 system-on-chip. ==Features== ===Hardware=== Several variants of the phone were released, with different internal storage capacity, RAM, cameras and NFC support depending on the country. The Indian- market variant only comes with two rear cameras and omits the fingerprint sensor, while the international version is equipped with three rear cameras and a fingerprint sensor. Realme later went on to release the Narzo 10A in India, which is essentially the same device as the international C3 variant apart from a redesigned back cover. The Australian-market release is almost identical to the international variants with the addition of an NFC sensor for wireless payments. The C3 also comes with a 3.5mm headset jack, a Micro-USB charging port, a 5000mAh lithium-ion battery with reverse-charging support, allowing the phone to double as a power bank, as well as a dual Nano-SIM and MicroSD card tray. The C3 was initially sold in two colour variants: Frozen Blue and Blazing red; a third colour option named Volcano Grey was later released. The Indian-market Narzo 10A also came in two variants, namely So White and So Blue.

Pr√©vost was born in Geneva to Jean-Jacques Pr√©vost and Marie-√âlisabeth Henri. A cousin was the ophthalmologist Pierre Pr√©vost. Little is known of his early life but he chose science to a career in business after apprenticing in a grocery. He became interested in science after reading the work of the astronomer Duc-la-Chapelle. In 1777, he became a private tutor to the sons of Delmas in Montauban. He founded a society for science in Montauban. In 1807 he identified bunt on wheat as being caused by fungi and suggested that it could be controlled by treating the seeds with copper sulphate. He published his findings in M√©moire sur la cause imm√©diate de la carie o√∫ charbon desbl√©s, et de plusieurs autres maladies des plantes, et sur les pr√©servatifs de la carie (Paris, 1807). He made microscope observations on the germination of the spores of the fungus which was later called Tilletia caries. He determined that the spores needed humidity but dismissed the idea that the disease itself was caused by climatic factors as was then believed. His work was however dismissed by scientists in higher positions such as Henri-Alexandre Tessier. Despite this the farmers around Switzerland followed the method of seed treatment and found it effective. In 1810 he became professor of philosophy at the Faculte de Theologie Protestante, a position he obtained with a recommendation of Marc-Auguste Pictet who wrote to Georges Cuvier. In 1812 he received a doctorate in theology from the Toulouse Academy.

Quercigh moved as a child to Friuli with his mother and his younger brother after the early death of his father. Quercigh studied physics at the University of Milan in Italy, where he became assistant of professor Giuseppe Occhialini in 1959. In 1964 Quercigh moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where he took up a position as fellow at CERN and subsequently became a staff physicist. Initially Quercigh took part in various experiments using the CERN 2 m Bubble Chamber. Then he proposed and led, together with David Lord, the ERASME project, a machine for scanning and measuring film from BEBC. In 1974, Quercigh was appointed spokesperson of the T209 experiment, a bubble chamber experiment studying high statistics 8.25 GeV/c K‚Äìp, which discovered the œÜ(1850) particle‚Äìthe first Regge recurrence of the œÜ meson‚Äìand performed a detailed study of the lifetime of the Œ©‚Äìbaryon, as well as a first evaluation of its spin. As of 1979 Quercigh was the leading scientist for various CERN SPS experiments using the Omega Spectrometer, a facility he promoted with colleagues already in 1968, studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes, hadron spectroscopy and particle and soft photon production mechanisms. This activity focused on the production of baryons and anti- baryons carrying one or more strange quarks in heavy-ion collisions. Quercigh was the CERN contact man or spokesman for the WA85, WA94 and WA97 experiments addressing strangeness and quark-gluon plasma. When CERN announced the observation of the QGP in February 2000, he presented the strange particle production results on behalf of these collaborations. Together with J√ºrgen Schukraft and Hans Gutbrod, Quercigh laid down the foundations of the LHC ALICE experiment. He was then elected as the first chairman of the ALICE Collaboration Board on 20 April 1994 for the period from 1994 to 1998. After retirement from CERN in 1999, Quercigh is honorary staff member.

The protein component generally gives the advantages of biocompatibility and biodegradability, as many proteins are produced naturally by the body and are therefore well tolerated and metabolized. Although proteins are used as targeted therapy drugs, the main limitations‚Äîthe lack of stability and insufficient circulation times still remain. Therefore protein- polymer conjugates have been investigated to further enhance pharmacologic behavior and stability. By adjusting the chemical structure of the protein- polymer conjugates, polymer-protein particles with unique structures and functions, such as stimulus responsiveness, enrichment in specific tissue types, and enzyme activity, can be synthesized. Polymer-protein particles have been the focus of much research recently because they possess potential uses including bioseparations, imaging, biosensing, gene and drug delivery. Structure of a polymer conjugate == Types == === Single chain protein-polymer hybrids === Attaching a single polymer chain to a specific site away from the active center of the protein has less impact on protein activity compared with random attachments. In practice, attaching a single polymer chain can be used to adjust chemical properties of the therapeutic protein. For example, conjugation of a single chain of the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) can increase the hydrodynamic radius of the protein conjugate by 5-10 fold. Attachment to PEG was mainly achieved by covalent conjugation via the grafting to strategy, targeting chemo-selective anchor groups. Other polymers, such as oligosaccharides and polypeptides, offer different properties to the enzymes attached to them. === Stimuli responsive hybrids ===  Heat  Researchers conjugated the thermo-responsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) with the biotin-recognizing protein streptavidin close to its recognition site. At temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), the polymer collapses and blocks the binding site, thus reversibly preventing biotin from binding to streptavidin. By copolymerization with two different thermosensitive polymers poly(sulfobetaine methacrylamide) (pSBAm) and pNIPAm together, researchers can control enzyme activity in a small temperature window.  Light  ((N,N‚Ä≤-dimethylacrylamide)-co-4-phenylazophenyl acrylate) at the active site of endoglycanase creates a photoswitchable protein hybrid. The resulting hybrid catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycoside when irradiated by 350 nm UV light, but turns inactive under 420 nm visible light depending on the conformation of the conjugated polymer. === Polymer shell protein core === A polymer shell is formed by conjugation of multiple molecules of polymers onto the protein core. The polymer shell can either protect the protein core from unwanted degradation or create desired interactive sites for guest molecules. The first generation of polymer shell protein core structures mainly used of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to increase the hydrodynamic radius and reduce immune response to proteins. However, the PEG shell can reduce protein activity in the inner core. More advanced designs use biodegradable linkers to achieve programmed release of the protein core in specific tissues. Several therapeutic designs with biodegradable PEG shells are already being developed in vivo. Direct conjugation of polymers (‚Äúgrafting to‚Äù strategy) can efficiently construct a polymer shell with diverse polymer types, however, it suffers from low polymer density, especially with large polymers. In contrast, ‚Äúgrafting from‚Äù strategy allows the formation of a dense and uniform polymer shell. The protein core can also function as a carrier for other therapeutic molecules, such as plasmid DNA. Dendrite polymer shells have a high volume to molecular weight ratio compared with traditional polymer shells. Using branched carbohydrates can give unique biological properties while maintaining molecular definition. === Non-covalent conjugation === Although covalent conjugation has been the dominant strategy for constructing polymer-protein hybrids, noncovalent chemistry can add another level of complexity and provides the opportunity to create higher-ordered structures. Specifically, self-assembly by non-covalent interactions is progressing rapidly. Supramolecular self-assembly can create nanoparticles, vesicles/micelles, protein cages, etc. Metal-binding interactions, host-guest, and boronic acid- based chemistries are widely studied as non-covalent conjugation methods to create polymer-protein hybrids. === Polymer-Streptavidin system === Streptavidin is a protein purified from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii, which has a high affinity for biotin. By covalently linking streptavidin and polymers, well defined supramolecular constructs can be created due to the high specificity of Streptavidin for both biotin and its analogues. Building upon the covalent core shell strategy, several polymer‚Äìstreptavidin systems have been developed for affinity separation, bio-sensors and diagnostic applications due to the robust binding conditions and stability of the protein. Streptavidin can be used as a macro-initiator for in situ ATRP, through grafting from strategy, a stoichiometrically well defined polymer- protein conjugate can be synthesized. Polymer streptavidin systems can also be empowered to cross the cellular membrane by conjugating with cell penetrating molecules such as peptides and membrane disturbing polymers. Polymer streptavidin systems can also be modulated to respond to certain environmental changes such as pH. By incorporating pH responsive poly(propylacrylic acid) (PPAAc) into the system, tumor cell suppressor p53 and cytochrome C can be delivered into cancer cells efficiently. For biomolecules that are not hampered by the biotin-streptavidin interaction, iminobiotin, an analogue of biotin, has been applied as a pH-sensitive linker that allows the controlled and reversible assembly and intracellular release of cargo molecules in acidic intracellular compartments. === Protein-polymer hybrid supramolecular structures === Polymer-protein conjugates can also form a higher ordered supramolecular structure via self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers into micelles and microcapsules, which is one of the most promising strategies to generate drug delivery systems. Such systems have the innate advantage of rapid preparation, a high drug loading capacity, ease of surface decoration, and the potential to be stimuli responsive.  Micelles  Micelles refers to a type of supramolecular structure consisting of amphiphilic molecules self-assemblies, usually hollow centered. Researchers successfully conjugated a diblock copolymer site specifically onto GFP, the resulting amphiphilic polymer-protein conjugate is capable of reversible self-assembly into micelles. In addition to retaining the native globular shape of proteins, the polypeptide backbone of denatured proteins can also be utilized to be conjugated with hydrophilic polymer chains to generate higher ordered structure through hydrophobic interactions. For example, nanoconjugates of poly-ethylene glycol(PEG) and denatured bovine serum albumin(BSA) will spontaneously self-assemble into a micellar structure, whose protein core can adsorb high numbers of hydrophobic drugs.  Nanoparticles  An efficient way to synthesize protein-polymer hybrid nanoparticles is to take advantage of photoinitiated reversible addition‚àífragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization-induced self-assembly(PISA) by using multi-RAFT modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a macromolecular chain transfer agent. RAFT mediated growth of the PHPMA chains will graft from the BSA-RAFT, and increase the hydrophobicity of the star BSA‚àíPHPMA conjugates. At the critical aggregation concentration, they form nanoparticles due to the hydrophobic interactions. The resulting nanoparticles show excellent encapsulation capability for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, such as cancer drugs and DNA. A rather easy method to prepare protein-polymer hybrid nanoparticles is nanoprecipitation. Spherical nanoparticles composed of BSA-PMMA with diameters of around 100 nm were obtained and the water insoluble chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin was encapsulated within the hydrophobic core consisting of PMMA. Such protein-polymer hybrid nanoparticles possess tunable sizes and surface charges, have attractive bio-compatibilities and allow efficient cell uptake. Camptothecin-encapsulated BSA-PMMA nanoparticles revealed enhanced anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in animals. Beyond the nanoscale, protein-polymer conjugate could also be used as building blocks for constructing more complicated structures such as microcapsules through hydrophobic interactions. By performing pickering emulsion technique to process BSA‚ÄìpNIPAm nanoconjugates into hollowed microcapsules consisting of a closely packed monolayer of conjugated protein‚Äìpolymer building blocks (named proteinosomes). These proteinosomes exhibit protocellular properties such as guest molecule encapsulation, selective permeability, controllable mobilization, gene- directed protein synthesis and membrane-gated internalized enzyme catalysis. Based on the above mentioned method, a multi responsive microcapsule has been synthesized by incorporating photoswitchable spiropyran units and the thermoresponsive monomer N-isopropylacrylamide into the membrane. Stimuli responsive membrane exhibited advantages in the capture and release of different-molecular-weight products by opening and closing the photoresponsive spiropyran ligands, under body temperature, room temperature, UV, redox. Another effective way to modulate the permeability of microcapsules was based on a ‚Äò‚Äòself-sacrificing‚Äô‚Äô strategy. By selectively using lysozyme and BSA as building blocks as well as ‚Äò‚Äòself-sacrificing‚Äô‚Äô components, the corresponding pores could be generated in the membrane, and then the permeability of the generated microcapsules could be increased from10 kDa to 22 kDa and then to 71 kDa. By loading FITC-Lys (14 kDa), RBITCdextran (70 kDa) and DNA (90 kDa) into the microcapsules, a programmed release of the encapsulants from low molecular weight to high molecular weight was realized. Using similar strategy, pH- sensitive protein-polymer microcapsules were developed. Both doxycycline (DOX) and folic acid were incorporated onto the surface of protein covalently. The very low toxicity of polymer-protein nanoconjugates effectively avoided the high toxicity of DOX, which is expected to not only reduce toxic side effects, but also improve anticancer efficiency in vitro examinations. === Protein Nanocages === Protein nanocages are natural nanocarriers composed of protein subunits with a porous structure. They benefit from monodispersity, intrinsic high stability for protection of internalized drugs from enzymatic degradation and controllable assembly for cargo loading and release. However, their application might be blocked by immunogenicity, broad biodistribution and significant function and property variations. The incorporation of polymer chains by performing in situ ATRP on the outer surface of or inside the protein nanocages can be an effective way to mitigate those drawbacks. For example, increased loading density of cargo molecules and enhanced stability of the cage assembly can be obtained via internal ATRP inside the cavity of the virus capsid. Beyond virus type particles, large multimeric proteins such as the iron storage protein ferritin have emerged as attractive tools to be used as well-defined nano-containers. Using a grafting from strategy, polymers can be introduced to ferritin in a highly regular fashion for precise spatial control. These polymer‚Äìferritin constructs exhibited protease resistance, enabling longer retention time within the bloodstream while reducing possible antibody interactions. == Properties == Polymer-Protein nanoparticles not only contain the traditional properties of nanoparticles, but also have their own unique properties based on the properties of specific proteins. Because they are proteinaceous, they have high biocompatibility, biodegradability and biofunctionality. Protein-polymer bioconjugates which is the building block of Polymer-Protein hybrids exhibit a unique array of properties such as: light- switching effects, acoustic signal capture, thermal energy transfer, and magnetic signal response. == Synthesis == === Synthesis of Polymer-Protein hybrids === Generally, Polymer-Protein hybrids can be synthesized by interfacial self-assembly of protein‚Äìpolymer conjugates in emulsions.  Grafting to  Grafting to approach which is the most common and straightforward methodology refers to directly attaching the synthetic polymers to the target protein. This technique can be engineered for site-specific or random conjugation and, when compared to other conjugation methods, provides simple and thorough characterization of polymer before conjugation. And when using this method, the protein remains unaffected by polymerization methods.  Grafting from  As shown in the figure, a protein is firstly conjugated with the initiator and the polymer chain then grows from the protein core in a controlled manner via living polymerization. Likewise, to the earlier discussed methods, grafting from approach can be designed for site-specific or random attachment.  Grafting through  Not like the grafting from and grafting to approach which can conjugate several polymers onto one protein core, the grafting through approach enables several proteins to connect to one polymer chain due to the multivalent nature of protein. == Application == === Thermoresponsive protein‚Äìpolymer particles === Thermoresponsive conjugates have been exploited for the subsequent separation of proteins from a complex mixture. This method has been utilized to purify polyclonal antibodies in serum samples. This method of purification is rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and could be used to purify various types of antibodies. Thermoresponsive conjugates can also be exploited to mediate bioactivity. One of the utilities of the method is demonstrated temperature control of biotin binding and release. Biotin binding was observed below the LCST, while above the LCST the conjugates aggregated, and the biotin binding affinity was reduced by ~20%. By changing the temperature, the recovery of the biotinylated molecules can be achieved. === Protein‚Äìpolymer particles designed for drug delivery === The absorption of proteins for particles in physiological fluids can greatly affect the subsequent medical performance of particles in vivo. Nonspecific protein adsorption can be controlled in vivo by modifying the nanoparticle surface with a non-toxic, biocompatible protein possessing tolerable antigenic properties such as albumin. The high recognition ability of proteins can enable high delivery efficiency. Protein-polymer particles have potential to deliver drugs to specific regions of the body using the inherent biorecognition property at the protein interface. Additionally, in some cases the presentation of specific proteins on nanoparticle surfaces can be useful for aiding passage through impermeable biological barriers. === Particles designed for other biomedical and biotechnology applications ===  Nanoreactors  Enzyme-catalyzed reactions can be performed at higher temperatures using enzyme-immobilized nanoparticles, in which the presence of multiple proteins at the nanoparticle surface facilitates the retention of water molecules limiting the denaturation of the attached proteins. After modification with poly(amide), protein activity could remain unchanged over 500 min at 50 ‚ÑÉ, while the half-life time of the native lipase at 50 ‚ÑÉ is only 30 min in aqueous solution. Immobilized enzymes on nanoparticles can significantly improve the efficiency of enzyme reactions by increasing tolerance to a wider range of experimental conditions without significantly reducing biological activity. Besides, polymer-protein particles are reported to control the activity of proteins and compartmentalize different enzymes to perform multi-step reactions.  Protein purification and separation  By immobilizing proteins to polymer nanoparticles or polymer/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (such as polymer-stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles), proteins or their affinity ligands can be separated from complex solutions by applying magnetic fields or centrifugation. Lipase attached to iron oxide nanoparticles maintained 85% biological activity after 30 reaction and separation cycles. As the appropriate target is combined with magnetic nanoparticles, the selected target can be magnetically separated directly from natural biological fluids, which offers a fast, gentle, extensible, and easy to automate separation technique. The simplicity of magnetic separation has been applied in a number of disciplines, including mineral processing wastewater treatment, molecular biology, cell sorting, and clinical diagnostics.  Protocells  Microcapsules termed protocells prepared by polymer-protein hybrids are the hotspot of the research area recently, enabling various functions such as bioreactors, cascade system and multiresponsive membranes, etc. \\\\---- == References == Category:Nanomaterials Category:Pharmacology ","title":"Polymer-protein hybrid"},{"id":"63886226","text":"M√°ria Kol√≠kov√° is a Slovak politician who currently serves as the justice minister of Slovakia; she was nominated by Za ƒæud√≠.

This is probably because Herodotus's version of events is not generally accepted by historians and researchers, and unlike in the film, Massagetae are not considered Turkic, but Iranian-speaking people. Criticism came from both the Kazakh and Iranian public. Some observers believed that the film was aimed to make Dariga Nazarbayeva‚Äôs potential presidential bid in the future, the daughter of Kazakhstan‚Äôs former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, more acceptable among ordinary Kazakhs.

Although World War II was going on at the time, Sweden was neutral, though playing sports in wartime did mean that the roster had to be rotated more often than normal. Because Halmstad had just been promoted, they struggled in the Allsvenskan, and they never finished higher than 6th (out of 12) before being relegated in 1946. When Halmstad was relegated, Bengtsonn was transferred to Elfsborg, who had been a strong team, finishing second for three straight seasons between 1942 and 1945. The year Halmstad was relegated, however, they had faltered and finished 7th. After signing Bengtsonn, the rebounded slightly, finishing fourth in 1946-47, but they finished just one point above relegation in 1947-48, and only one place above relegation in 1948-49. Bengtsson was sold to Torino in Italy in 1949, just after the entire team had been killed in the Superga air disaster. He played for one season with the Italian club, who came in sixth that year, scoring ten goals. He went on to play for OGC Nice, with whom he won the Division 1 in 1950-51. He finished as the t-10th top goalscorer with 15 goals. He and his fellow attacker Jean Courteaux scored a total of 42 goals, which was then Nice's most prolific partnership of all time (Herv√© Revelli and Dick van Dijk equalled the record in the 1972-73 season, but it has still never been beaten). The following season, he scored twelve goals, and though he was Nice's top scorer, and Nice won the Division 1 again, he was sold to a mid-table team in Division 2, Toulouse. In the 1952-53 season, Toulouse skyrocketed to the top of the Division 2, but Bengtsson only played slightly more than half their games: He was aging, and he was 31 at the end of the season. Toulouse was promoted to Division 1, but Bengtsson stayed in Division 2, being transferred to Stade Rennais. In his first year at Rennais, he became a star forward for the team, scoring 21 goals in 35 games. The next season, however, he floundered. He played in only half the games, and he scored a mere seven goals. ==After football== Bengtsson retired in 1955.

This worm has been known to cause Thelaziasis in hosts. ==Morphology== As with most Thelazia worms, they are small parasites that average about 12-13 mm long. To differentiate between other members of this genus, T. californiensis has a vulva that opens mid- ventrally, while T. callipaeda has an anterior vulva. ===Hosts=== Similar to Thelazia callipaeda, the worm has definitive hosts in dogs, cats, sheep, and occasionally humans. They also use intermediate hosts to move around, specifically using the lesser house fly (Fannia canicularis). Life cycle The worm starts its life cycle by laying eggs in the tears and tear ducts of the host and the eggs are picked up by the flies. Because the eggs develop into larvae inside the fly, it is a parenthetic host. After developing in the fly, the larvae move so they can easily escape the fly's mouth when it feeds again, starting the cycle over. Symptoms Both the adult and larval stages cause disease in the eye, which can have different levels of pain and discomfort. Some of the problems include keratitis, ulcers, conjunctivitis, and other afflictions. Diagnosis and treatment As with other eyeworms, the course of diagnosis is to exam the eye and spot any worms that are moving around. In some cases, microscopes can be used to look at tear fluid to see eggs or larvae. Treatment consists of pulling the worms out with forceps in humans. Some cases of infection have shown promising results by using ivermectin. == References == Category:Nematodes Category:Parasites ","title":"Thelazia californiensis"},{"id":"63886599","text":"Dennis Vernon Dold Lacey was a South African flying ace of World War II, credited with 5 'kills' and 2 probables.

G√∂k√ßek was arrested on 1 May 2019 and charged with \\"establishing and leading an organisation\\". He joined the ongoing hunger strike of other Grup Yorum members in June 2019.

The following day, mourners taking part in a ceremony in memory of G√∂k√ßek at an Alevi cemevi in the neighbourhood of Sultangazi were halted by the police and dispersed with teargas. The police broke down the gates to the cemevi, detained several members of Grup Yorum, seized the coffin containing G√∂k√ßek corpse. He eventually was buried in Kayseri.

They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in locations within these administrative divisions. Sex trafficking in Mexico is human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and slavery that occurs in the United Mexican States. It is a country of origin, transit, and destination for sex trafficked victims. Sex trafficking victims in the country are from all ethnic groups in Mexico, including the indigenous peoples of Mexico, and foreigners. Mexican citizens, primarily women and girls, are sex trafficked to the different states of Mexico, as well as other countries, namely the United States. Foreign women and girls are also trafficked to and within Mexico. The illegal transporting and sexual assault of migrants from Latin America to the United States is a problem. Children, and people in poverty and with little education are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Perpetrators create fake identification documents, including birth certificates, for underage girls. Sex trafficked victims are deceived or abducted and forced into prostitution and pregnancies. They are guarded or locked up in brothels, bars, hotels, homes, and other locations. They are threatened and physically and psychologically abused. Their family members are sometimes threatened. The babies and children of victims have been held hostage by perpetrators to ensure compliance. Some traffickers impregnate their victims too keep them under their control.Victims contract sexually transmitted diseases from rapes, and often drugged and live in poor living conditions. Victims experience mental health problems. Some women and girls are tortured and or murdered. Sex trafficking and exploitation have permeated all levels of Mexican society. Male and female perpetrators in Mexico come from a wide range of backgrounds and every social class. A number of traffickers are members of or facilitated by cartels and gangs. Some government officials and workers, as well as foreigners, have profited from sex trafficking in Mexico. Police have been complicit. Impunity is a problem. Traffickers use social media and other phone and internet websites and apps to lure victims. Pedophiles traffickers, from the United States and other countries, or men who contact the traffickers target children. They use clothing, toys, and candy to attract children to houses they rent or buy. Some perpetrators are the victims‚Äô family members. Some victims are forced by their captors to be traffickers themselves. The scale of sex trafficking in Mexico is difficult to know because of the lack of data from corruption, poor record keeping, the secretive nature of sex trafficking crimes, the fact that only a small minority of cases are reported to the authorities, and other factors. Local, state, and federal anti-sex trafficking efforts have been criticized for being insufficient. Authorities have been accused of being apathetic. Anti-sex trafficking organizations, as well as victims‚Äô families, in Mexico have received threats. ==Mexican Drug War== Drug cartels and gangs fighting in the Mexican War on Drugs have relied on sex trafficking as an alternative source of profit to finance their organizations, buy weapons, expand their territory, and for other purposes. The cartels and gangs also abduct women to use as their personal sex slaves and force them into unfree labour. ==Non-governmental organization== Justicia para Nuestras Hijas (JPNH) supports victims and investigations of sex and labour trafficking in Mexico.

It is the thirteenth episode overall and originally aired in the United States on NBC on January 19, 2017, immediately following the previous episode, \\"Mindy St. Claire\\". The episode was both written and directed by series creator Michael Schur. In the episode, Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason must decide which two of them will go to the Bad Place to make up for Eleanor and Jason's absence there. They struggle to find a pairing on which they can all agree, and Eleanor realizes why their time in the Good Place has been unusual. In flashbacks, Michael wonders if there is a better way to design neighborhoods in the afterlife. The episode is known for its plot twist, in which the neighborhood is revealed to be the Bad Place in disguise. Schur created the ending when developing the show but kept it secret outside of a few crew members, with the exception of Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, who were told when they signed on as cast members. The episode was seen by 3.93 million Americans in its original broadcast and was acclaimed by critics, with many praising the twist and Danson's performance. For his work on the episode, Schur was nominated for several awards, including the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. == Plot == After Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and Jason (Manny Jacinto) just miss Shawn's (Marc Evan Jackson) deadline to return to the Good Place, Shawn decides the Bad Place is owed two individuals and gives Eleanor, Jason, Chidi (William Jackson Harper), and Tahani (Jameela Jamil) thirty minutes to pick who to send. Eleanor proposes that she and Jason go since they were not supposed to be there in the first place. Jason resists but is eventually convinced. They say their goodbyes, but the \\"real\\" Eleanor (Tiya Sircar) suddenly arrives and announces she's going to the Bad Place, as Chidi, her supposed soulmate, doesn't love her and staying would be painful. This forces the group to reconsider. Shawn tells Michael (Ted Danson) privately that Michael will be in trouble for his mistakes. Flashbacks show Michael receiving his first neighborhood to design and wondering if there is a better way for architects to do their job. As the group discusses who to send now, they quickly descend into arguing. Eleanor has a sudden realization and calls Michael and Shawn back. She proposes sending herself and Chidi, which Michael and Shawn resist. She then explains it is impossible for them to ever leave for the Bad Place, as the \\"Good Place\\" is actually the Bad Place. Despite its appearances, the neighborhood presented challenges designed to torture the four humans: Eleanor is surrounded by people who are better than her, Chidi was forced to struggle with Eleanor and Jason's secrets, Jason was left confused and anxious due to his cover story, and Tahani was often left feeling isolated. Michael, along with the other residents (who are demons working with Michael), created further problems for the humans. In another flashback, Michael pitches his neighborhood as an experiment where humans torture each other without realizing it; Shawn, who is actually Michael's boss, expresses doubts. Eleanor asks how Chidi and Tahani, who seem like good people, ended up in the Bad Place. Tahani realizes her fundraising efforts were tainted by selfish motivations, and Michael explains that Chidi's inability to adapt and make choices made others miserable. To the humans' horror, Michael announces he'll be erasing their memories to fix his mistakes and try again. When Michael steps out to talk to Shawn, Eleanor quickly writes a note and gives it to Janet (D'Arcy Carden), who was stolen from the Good Place and is not working with Michael. Shawn allows Michael to try again but warns that this is his last shot. Michael wipes the humans' memories and reboots the neighborhood. He welcomes Eleanor to the afterlife again and introduces her new \\"soulmate\\", Chris Baker (Luke Guldan). When Chris leaves, Janet appears and gives Eleanor her note, which reads \\"Eleanor ‚Äî Find Chidi\\". == Production == Michael Schur, series creator and writer/director for the episode The episode was written and directed by Michael Schur, the show's creator. It is his second writing credit (after the season premiere) and first directing credit for the series. When developing The Good Place, Schur turned to dramas such as Lost and Breaking Bad, which contained many cliffhangers and, in his words, left viewers \\"so absorbed in something and so intrigued by something that you have to know how it ends.\\" During the development process, he worked with Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof to gather advice and input on the series; Lindelof urged Schur to \\"take the time to think about what you're going to do before you do it.\\" As a result, the entirety of the first season, as well as the start to the second season, was planned out in advance, and Schur and the writing staff would deviate little from this plan during production of the first season. Schur also took some inspiration for the flashbacks from Lost. He noted that the scenes were \\"usually [a] two- or three-beat mini-story, told in distinct beats throughout the episode [and] reflective of the larger question of the episode.\\" Schur told Kristen Bell and Ted Danson about the season's twist ending when they were originally brought on board. He felt it was important for their characters to know what would happen, mainly since Michael orchestrates the scheme and Eleanor is the one to figure it out. He explained, \\"I wanted them to know the whole picture. I thought it would be sort of uncool to Ted Danson to say, 'I want you to play an angel,' and then four months later go, 'Just kidding. You're a devil.'\\" Schur also told the writers about the twist at the beginning in order to ensure the writing would be consistent and set up the finale, but he did not tell the other actors on the show until they were near the end of filming for the season. He later remarked, \\"They gave the most honest and real performance they could give, simply because they didn‚Äôt know.\\" The episode was written and filmed before the show premiered. Originally, the writers had several other ideas for how to have Eleanor tell herself about Michael's scheme, including writing a message on herself in a manner similar to Memento, before deciding on giving Janet the note. To write the note, Eleanor tears a page out of T.M. Scanlon‚Äôs book What We Owe To Each Other. The sinister laugh from Michael after Eleanor figured out his plan was improvised by Danson after several takes and spliced together with other footage. In the rebooted neighborhood, many details, such as the furnishings in Michael's office and the clown paintings in Eleanor's house, were slightly tweaked or rearranged; Schur later explained that this shows how extensive Michael's plan is. While NBC had made previous episodes available to the press early, the network did not release the finale ahead of time, likely to preserve the twist. The network would also renew the series for a 13-episode second season in the wake of the finale. == Reception == === Ratings === \\"Michael's Gambit\\" originally aired on NBC on January 19, 2017, as part of an hour-long block with the previous episode, \\"Mindy St. Claire\\". It was watched by an estimated 3.93 million American viewers, placing third in its time slot behind The Great Indoors and Grey's Anatomy. This marked a 6% increase in total viewers compared to the previous week and was the show's highest viewership since October. The episode also achieved a 1.1/4 in the 18-49 demographic, placing third behind The Great Indoors and Hell's Kitchen. === Reviews === The episode received acclaim from critics. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, calling it \\"a brilliant lie, both on the part of Schur‚Äîand of Michael.\\" He praised Danson's performance in the episode and remarked that \\"the dramatic and comedic possibilities opening up [...] genuinely demand a second season\\". Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire also gave the episode an A. She wrote that \\"[t]he reveal that Chidi and Tahani were also not good enough for 'the good place' is a massive one, but the fact that it ultimately made sense testifies to the depth of character development that Schur and the writers had been able to build into the show.\\" She also praised Danson's \\"beautifully bumbling performance\\" for hiding the twist up until that point and agreed that the show set itself up well for a second season. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10 and said, \\"The Good Place was already a very funny and clever comedy, but this reveal raises the stakes in a big way.\\" He praised the twist and thought that \\"finding out Michael was actually the villain was what really made the whole thing amazing\\"; he also highlighted the humor in the episode, adding that the humans' debate \\"awesomely spotlighted the distinctive personalities of all four of the main characters.\\" Allie Pape of Vulture gave the episode 5 out of 5 stars, remarking that the twist \\"is the sort of move that masterfully adds depth to all the show‚Äôs emotional bonding\\" and praising Danson for \\"utterly nail[ing] the heel turn\\". Writing for Variety, Maureen Ryan compared the episode favorably to Westworld, another plot-heavy show with big twists; she noted that unlike Westworld, The Good Place's twist \\"wasn‚Äôt necessarily easy to figure out, and even if you‚Äôd guessed it, it didn‚Äôt really matter, because the show was a whole lot of fun regardless of what was going on in the main plot.\\" She also called the finale \\"especially crisp and entertaining\\" with \\"the kind of unstoppable momentum that carried [her] past any mild wobbles.\\" Caroline Framke of Vox called the twist \\"a gutsy move\\" that the show landed \\"with ease and a confident grin\\" and likened watching prior episodes in light of the twist to rewatching The Sixth Sense, adding that lines from earlier \\"take on new significance in the best way.\\" Lenika Cruz of The Atlantic noted that unlike other shows blending comedy and drama, \\"The Good Place is, tonally, 100 percent sitcom\\" but has \\"the spine of a twist-y, reality- questioning show like Lost or Westworld\\". She described the reveal as a \\"a Truman Show/No Exit-style nightmare\\" and remarked that the \\"structural sitcomminess‚Äîwhere the show has to revert to the status quo\\" set the foundation for season two nicely. Several critics have made comparisons between the episode and then-current events. In her review, Pape noted that it \\"couldn‚Äôt be a better reflection on the world we‚Äôre about to live in, where Donald Trump is president: One man‚Äôs desire to do something entirely different and to be the envy of his peers leads to hell for many, many other people, who are mostly being punished for the crime of being human.\\" In a retrospective article, Ellen Jones of The Guardian noted that the episode, which aired the day before Trump's inauguration, resonated with many viewers who opposed Trump, with Eleanor's moment of realization that \\"This is the Bad Place!\\" becoming a liberal meme. However, Jones noted that the show also challenged liberal attitudes, with the four humans embodying \\"the traits conservatives most disparage in their defeated foe: Tahani‚Äôs smug condescension; Chidi‚Äôs indecisive idealism; Jason‚Äôs obliviousness; and Eleanor‚Äôs ironic detachment.\\" Schur has denied that the show is about Trump or modern-day America and noted that work on the show began before the 2016 election took place. === Awards === At the 2018 Hugo Awards, the episode was nominated for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form; it ultimately lost to another episode of the show, season 2's \\"The Trolley Problem\\". The episode was also nominated for the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation at the 2017 Nebula Awards; it lost to Get Out. == References == == External links == * \\"Michael's Gambit\\" on NBC.com * \\"Michael's Gambit\\" on IMDb * \\"Michael's Gambit\\" on TV.com Category:2017 American television episodes Category:The Good Place episodes ","title":"Michael's Gambit"},{"id":"63887311","text":"Friedrich Theodor Fr√∂hlich Friedrich Theodor Fr√∂hlich (20 February 1803 - 16 October 1836) was a Swiss early Romantic composer.

Afterwards he wrote several fiction and non-fiction books and undertook other expeditions for the museum. == Biography == James Edwin Baum was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on November 15, 1887. At the age of 14 he ran away from home and freighthopped to Wyoming where he found work as a wrangler. Baum worked as a reporter at the Omaha Daily Bee from 1908 to 1914, apart from a brief period in 1910 when he attended Princeton University. He was afterwards hunting and fishing columnist for the Chicago Daily News and in 1914 worked for an investment firm in Boston. Baum served as a pilot during World War One and afterwards, from 1919 to 1922, was a cattle rancher in Wyoming. He was president of the Chicago Brick Company in 1923 and a reporter at the Chicago Evening Journal until 1925.

The party was established in 1924 but was not popular. It came to power as a result of the December 1926 military coup. From 1927 to 1939, the Council of Ministers included only members of the LTS. In 1936, other parties were officially disbanded leaving LTS the only legal party in the country. In 1930s, the party became increasingly more radical and sympathetic to the Italian Fascism. The party was disestablished after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. The party under the same name (known as the Lithuanian Nationalist and Republican Union since 2017) was reestablished in 1990 and claims to be the successor of interwar LTS. ==History== The party was established during a conference in ≈†iauliai on 17‚Äì19 August 1924 as a merger of the Party of National Progress (established in 1916) and the Lithuanian Farmers' Association (established in 1919). The party did not enjoy popular support and in the May 1926 parliamentary elections won only 3 seats out of 85. However, its leaders Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras were popular and influential public figures. The party was conservative and nationalistic; it stressed the need for a strong army and a strong leader. During the December 1926 coup, the military deposed the democratically elected government and invited Smetona to become the new President of Lithuania and Voldemaras the new Prime Minister. The Nationalists and the Lithuanian Christian Democrats formed a new government. However, the relationship between the two parties soon became tense as Christian Democrats regarded the coup as a temporary measure and wished to hold new elections to the Seimas. In April 1927, Smetona dissolved the Seimas and Christian Democrats resigned from the government in May. New elections to Seimas were not called until 1936. The Nationalists remained the only party in the government until a political crisis after the German ultimatum regarding Klaipƒóda Region forced LTS to admit two members of the opposition to the Council of Ministers. Voldemaras established Iron Wolf (Gele≈æinis Vilkas) as the paramilitary wing of the Nationalists. In September 1929, Smetona removed Voldemaras from the office of prime minister and installed his co-brother-in-law Juozas T≈´belis. The new constitutions of 1928 and 1938 established a presidential dictatorship. Political opponents were suppressed. In preparation for the June 1936 election, other political parties were banned leaving LTS the only legal party in Lithuania. In 1930s, the party became increasingly more radical and sympathetic to the Italian Fascism. Major periodicals published by the party included Lietuvis (1924‚Äì28), Lietuvos aidas (1928‚Äì40), M≈´s≈≥ kra≈°tas (1930‚Äì33), and Vairas (1914‚Äì40). ==Chairmen== The party's chairmen were: * Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius (19 August 1924 ‚Äì 29 June 1925) * Antanas Smetona (29 June 1925 ‚Äì 26 December 1926) * Liudas Noreika (26 December 1926 ‚Äì 4 August 1927) * Vincas Matulaitis (4 August 1927 ‚Äì 1 October 1927) * Aleksandras ≈Ωilinskas (5 October 1927 ‚Äì 1 February 1928) * Liudas Noreika (1 February 1928 ‚Äì 30 May 1928) * Vytautas Vilei≈°is (30 May 1928 ‚Äì 2 October 1929) * Jonas Lapƒónas (2 October 1929 ‚Äì 1 June 1931) * Juozas T≈´belis (1 June 1931 ‚Äì 5 January 1939) * Vladas Mironas (5 January 1939 ‚Äì 2 December 1939) * Domas Ceseviƒçius (2 December 1939 ‚Äì 19 June 1940) ==References== Category:Nationalist parties in Lithuania Category:National conservative parties Category:Political parties in Lithuania Category:Political parties established in 1924 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1940 Category:1924 establishments in Lithuania Category:1940 disestablishments in Lithuania Category:Parties of one-party systems ","title":"Lithuanian Nationalist Union"},{"id":"63887504","text":"East County Park, May 2020 East County Park is a public park in Warren, Somerset County, New Jersey.

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. == Timeline == ===March 2020=== Many schools and businesses in South Ossetia were closed on 20 March. ===April 2020=== Borders between Russia and Georgia were closed on 5 April. ===May 2020=== The first three cases of COVID-19 in South Ossetia were confirmed on 6 May. One of the cases was a retired man from North Ossetia, who arrived in South Ossetia on 20 April, and has been quarantined in a hospital since then. Another case, from Vladikavkaz, was a 14-year-old student of the Suvorov Military School. The third case also came from Vladikavkaz, but further details are unknown. Contact tracing has been conducted for these cases. As of 24 May, there are a total of 37 cases in South Ossetia. == Response == South Ossetia is a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, recognized by Russia and a few other countries as an independent state, but regarded by most of international actors as part of Georgia. Early in the pandemic, senior Georgian government officials called on the WHO and other international organisations to provide support to people living in the two breakaways. They said Georgia would not block movement to and from the regions. Unlike Abkhazia, South Ossetia refused to cooperate with Georgia and blocked movement from or to Tbilisi-controlled territory in February 2020. The South Ossetian authorities refused to admit the specialists from the WHO and other international organisations unless they entered through Russia rather than Georgia although the border with Russia had also been closed in March 2020. According to the International Crisis Group, of the fellow ex-Soviet breakaways, South Ossetia is at greatest risk due to high percent of elderly population (17%), severely under-equipped medical facilities, lack of properly trained medical professionals, and failure to procure significant aid from Russia, which generally provides a majority of the region's needs. ==Footnotes== == References == South Ossetia South Ossetia South Ossetia Category:2020 in South Ossetia ","title":"COVID-19 pandemic in South Ossetia"},{"id":"63887538","text":"Drop 6 is an extended play by British rapper Little Simz.

He was nicknamed \\"Little Giant\\", and graduated from Morgan College Preparatory School. He later received an honorary LLD degree from the school in June 1928. Gibson moved to Philadelphia in 1899. He initially worked in various odd jobs, and had stints peddling meat and caning chairs, before moving into the theatrical world in 1910, when Samuel Reading hired him as a partner in his movie and Vaudeville theatre, The North Pole.

All provinces including the cities of Zamboanga and Isabela have recorded at least a single case. ==Timeline== The first case in the Zamboanga Peninsula was confirmed in Zamboanga City on March 24, 2020. The case was that of 29-year-old male resident who arrived in the city on March 13 after visiting Metro Manila. The province of Zamboanga del Sur announced its first two cases on March 30. The day prior, the provincial government appealed passengers of Philippine Airlines flight PR2889 from Manila-Ozamis on March 14 to go to the nearest health facility if they develop COVID-19 symptoms. No new province reported COVID-19 cases until May 2020. On May 4, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Zamboanga del Norte, that of a case of a 63-year-old Norwegian who arrived in Dipolog on March 2.

The Industrial Group of Zamboanga reported that most of its workers experienced difficulties in reporting to work, despite the company offering free shuttle services, due to the wide presence of checkpoints across barangays. Fish canneries in the city also had to reduce outputs due to the deliverers of fish from Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Norte experiencing difficulties in entering the city, as visitors are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. This prompted most canneries to discourage deliveries. ==Response== The whole of Zamboanga Peninsula has been placed under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) by April 2020.

The virus reached Mimaropa on March 20, 2020, when the first case of the disease was confirmed in Puerto Princesa. ==Timeline== The first COVID-19 case in Mimaropa was confirmed on March 20. The case involved a 26-year-old male Australian tourist in Palawan who had already left the province at the time of confirmation. The tourist arrived in Manila on March 5 before taking a flight to Puerto Princesa. The man stayed for five days in a resort in San Vicente prior to seeking medical consultation after he exhibited symptoms. He was brought to the Palawan Provincial Hospital in Puerto Princesa for sample collection for testing on March 14. The tourist managed to secure clearance after two days to take a \\"mercy flight\\" to get out of the province to Clark after his fever subsided. Marinduque confirmed its first case on March 23, that of a case of resident of Torrijos who came to the province on March 14 from Metro Manila. The first case of Occidental Mindoro was confirmed on March 27 in the town of San Jose which involved a 84-year-old man who died at the San Jose District Hospital on March 22, on the same day the patient was admitted. The first case in Oriental Mindoro on the other hand, that of a 1-year-old girl tested in Calapan, was also confirmed in the same day. Romblon's first case was that of a German national in San Jose, Romblon who had no recent travel history outside the country but has visited Metro Manila. The patient was confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19 on March 28 and was admitted to a hospital in Aklan province in Western Visayas. In June 2020, cases were recorded in Palawan, outside the independent city of Puerto Princesa. Cases have been reported among previously stranded individuals who've since returned to their hometowns in Coron and Sofronio Espa√±ola. ==Impact== The plebiscite to ratify legislation that proposes the partition of Palawan into three smaller provinces scheduled for May 2020 was be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province provincial legislature has called for a special session and is expected to pass a resolution allowing Governor Jose Alvarez to ask the COMELEC to postpone the plebiscite. Anti-partition advocacy group One Palawan has also called for the postponement of the plebiscite reasoning the ($1.6 million) budget allocated for the plebiscite could be used to fund the provincial government's efforts against COVID-19. ==Response== The whole of Mimaropa region was included under the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) imposed on Luzon. Quarantine measure in the region was downgraded to general community quarantine (GCQ) on May 1. However the town of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro remained under ECQ until at least May 15 even as the rest of the province downgraded to GCQ. ==Notes== == References == Mimaropa Category:History of Mimaropa ","title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Mimaropa"},{"id":"63887889","text":"The helmeted worm lizard (Amphisbaena acangaoba) is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

The building, which was designed in the Edwardian Baroque style, was completed in 1898. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Ewell Road; the central section featured an arched doorway with a fanlight on the ground floor; there was a wrought iron balcony and a round-headed window with the borough coat of arms and a pediment above on the first floor; there was a cupola containing a clock at roof level. The building became the headquarters of Municipal Borough of Surbiton when it secured municipal borough status in 1936Frederic A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol I: Southern England, London, 1979 but ceased to be the local seat of government after the creation of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in 1965.

There were concerns in the local community in May 2012 when the Deputy leader of Kingston Council, Liz Green, refused to deny that the council wanted to dispose of the Sessions House along with the adjacent library. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Grade II listed buildings in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1898 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Sessions House, Surbiton"},{"id":"63888006","text":"Amphisbaena mongoyo is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

Renamed in 1940, in August 1941 she was chartered by the US Army to transport supplies to Hawaii. While in passage between Tacoma, Washington and Honolulu on December 7, she was intercepted by the , which sank her with gunfire. Although the commander of the submarine ensured that all of the crew had escaped into boats, none of them was ever found. Cynthia Olson was the first United States Merchant Marine vessel to be sunk after the entry of the United States into World War II. ==Construction== SS Coquina was ordered by the United States Shipping Board during World War I. She was laid down in the late summer of 1918 and being built in prefabricated steel sections, was able to be launched on November 30. Chapter 1 The ship was one of nine Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1044 hulls known as \\"Laker, Manitowoc Type\\" ordered from the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The yard is known to have completed six hulls with Coquina, yard hull number 100, being completed in April 1919 assigned official number 217871 and signal letters LQRK. Ship's characteristics were , changed in the 1920 register to , registered length, beam with a depth of . ==Service== Hostilities having ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918, she was surplus to requirements and on completion, was laid up on Lake Michigan. In December 1919, Coquina was chartered to help export stocks of whisky which had been made unsaleable by the Volstead Act that had introduced prohibition in the United States. There followed another period of lying idle, this time in New York, until she was purchased in 1925 by Pillsbury and Curtis for the West Coast lumber trade. After a conversion and refit, she arrived in San Pedro Bay, California but was again laid up. In 1931, she was sold on again for the sum of $10 to the Los Angeles Steamship Company, which like Pillsbury was a subsidiary of Matson Navigation. In 1933 she was sold on to another Matson subsidiary, the California Steamship Company, and in 1936, was transferred to the parent company and finally began to work on chartered voyages along the West Coast carrying lumber. On January 1, 1940, the Coquina was put up for sale and was purchased by Olson Brothers of San Francisco for $85,000, who renamed her Cynthia Olson. She was bareboat chartered by the US Army Transportation Corps in August 1941. ==Sinking== On December 6, 1941, SS Cynthia Olson was in the Pacific about midway on the great circle between Tacoma, Washington and Honolulu, Hawaii with a cargo of lumber for the US Army. At about 22:00 Hawaii Time, she was spotted by the Japanese submarine I-26 which overtook the Cynthia Olson and conformed to her course while running ahead of her on the surface throughout the night. The submarine's captain, Commander Minoru Yokota, had been ordered not to open hostilities against American vessels until 08:00 on December 7, which was the intended time of the Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the start of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. When zero-hour arrived, I-26 fired a warning shot with the 14 cm deck gun intended to halt the Cynthia Olson but she continued to run on. The submarine then fired a torpedo which missed, but brought the freighter to a halt. Yokota observed the crew taking to the ship's two lifeboats before attempting to sink her with gunfire.Prange 1991, p. 89 Before abandoning ship, the ship's radio operator had managed to broadcast a distress call stating that they were being attacked by a submarine; this was received by the American liner, , which was a considerable distance away bound for San Francisco. Meanwhile, 18 shells had failed to sink the Cynthia Olson, so Yokota dived and fired a second torpedo without a result. Surfacing again, a further 29 shells were fired into the ship, before she finally turned over onto her port side and the I-26 left the scene, some five hours after the start of the engagement. The next day, the gave some food to some of the survivors, but following that, no trace of the 33 crew members and two Army passengers was ever found. Cynthia Olson was the first American flagged merchant vessel to be sunk after the entry of the United States into the war. On the following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt alluded to her loss in his speech to the Joint session of the United States Congress which has become known as the Infamy Speech.Harding 2016, p. 71 ==References== Category:Ships built in Wisconsin Category:1918 ships Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Ships sunk by Japanese submarines Category:Maritime incidents in December 1941 ","title":"SS Cynthia Olson"},{"id":"63888089","text":"Henry Sonnie Torgbor Provencal was a Ghanaian politician. He was a member of parliament and a minister of state during the first republic. He served as the member of parliament for the Accra Central constituency from 1960 to 1965 and the member of parliament for the Gamashie constituency from 1965 to 1966. He also served as the Regional Commissioner for Greater Accra from 1965 to 1966. ==Early life and career== Provencal was born on 24 December 1922. He left school in 1940 to join his uncle, a timber merchant, as his assistant. He worked with his uncle from then until 1946 when he joined his father's corn- mill business. He worked with his father for a period of about three years. In 1950, he was arrested for a political offence and detained for 13 months. Upon his release, he was unemployed and dependent on his father for his needs until the latter period of 1952. In 1953 he was employed as a transport officer for the then Cocoa Purchasing Company. That same year, he was elected member of the Accra Municipal Council. In 1955, Provencal joined his father as an assistant in a sand and stone business of which his father worked as a contractor for the supply. ==Politics== Provencal was appointed Personal Assistant to the then prime minister of Ghana Dr. Kwame Nkrumah in June or July 1957. He served in this capacity until 29 August 1960. Ghana had become a republic in 1960 and the then prime minister Dr. Kwame Nkrumah became the president of Ghana. As head of state, he could no more serve as a member of parliament for his constituency, Accra Central. His seat became vacant and on 30 August 1960, a by-election was held to fill the seat. Provencal contested for the seat on the ticket of the Convention People's Party (CPP) and won polling 11,545 votes to beat Solomon Edmund Odamtten of the United Party (UP) who polled 165 votes. Provencal remained a member of parliament for the Accra Central constituency until 1965. In 1961, he doubled as a Deputy Minister for Interior and he remained in this position until July 1964. A month later, he was appointed Executive Secretary of the Accra Tema Council (now the Accra Metropolitan Assembly) and in 1965 he was elevated to ministerial status when he was appointed Regional Commissioner for Greater Accra. That same year, he became the member of parliament for the Gamashie constituency. Provencal held these appointments until 24 February 1966 when the Nkrumah government was overthrown. Provencal was consequently arrested and incarcerated by the National Liberation Council (NLC) under \\"protective custody\\" at the Ussher Fort Prison for about two and half years. During the Limann administration, Provencal together with Johnny Hansen founded the Kwame Nkrumah Revolutionary Guards (KNRG). The group had its roots in the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) that was founded to contest the 1979 election but later merged with the People's National Party (PNP). He served as General Secretary of the KNRG. ==Death and legacy== Provencal died on 14 September 2007. He is regarded as the first Mayor of Accra. In 1965 he founded the Accra City Guards, which has existed to this day. ==See also== * List of MLAs elected in the 1956 Gold Coast legislative election * List of MPs elected in the 1965 Ghanaian parliamentary election ==References== Category:1922 births Category:Ghanaian MPs 1954‚Äì1956 Category:Ghanaian MPs 1956‚Äì1965 Category:Ghanaian MPs 1965‚Äì1966 Category:Convention People's Party (Ghana) politicians Category:20th-century Ghanaian politicians Category:Ghanaian men Category:2007 deaths ","title":"Henry Sonnie Torgbor Provencal"},{"id":"63888113","text":"\\"I Finally Understand\\" (stylized in lowercase) is a song by Charli XCX, released on 7 May 2020 as the third single from her fourth studio album, How I'm Feeling Now.

The song was first announced on Charli XCX's Twitter on 2 May 2020. ==Composition== \\"I Finally Understand\\" is a UK garage and Baltimore club-influenced electropop song described as an \\"ode to her boyfriend\\". The song has been described as \\"groove-driven\\" and having \\"a more straightforward pop format than 'forever' or 'claws' but with a no less diverse sonic palette.\\" In the lyrics, she also delves into her struggles with mental health with the line \\"My therapist said I hate myself really bad.\\" == Critical reception == Callie Ahlgrim and Courteney Larocca both contributed to an article for Insider. Ahlgrim wrote that the song was \\"super catchy, cleaner and more minimalistic than much of the album, and very strong lyrically\\", while Larcocca found that the track's \\"steady beat throughout [reminded her] of Grimes' 'Oblivion'\\", in addition to \\"[loving] how completely overdramatic Charli is about finding a love so strong\\". Anna Gaca from Pitchfork felt that the song was \\"devoted to sincere, immediate romance and pleasure\\". Stereogum listed the song as the 5th best song of the week of 8 May 2020, praising the song for not being \\"a love song in the stereotypical, classic sense\\", while finding some lyrics \\"sexual as all hell\\", saw \\"raw vulnerability at work\\", concluding that the track was at \\"some level, a dance-pop song, and dance-pop songs almost never get as real as that\\". Josiah Hughes from Exclaim! called the track an \\"excellent tune from her endless catalogue of hits\\" as \\"Charli XCX's seemingly unstoppable pop reign continues\\". Mike Wass from Idolator called the song \\"another flawless banger\\" as the \\"anthem deals with matters of the heart\\", furthermore being \\"another stellar pop song that benefits from being a little rough around the edges\\". Wass soon included the track in top thirty best pop songs of Q2, 2020. Josiah Skallerup, writing for Riff Magazine, called the song \\"one of the most poignant shelter-in-place tunes, built out of a drum-and-bass loop\\", as the \\"song chronicles a myriad of feelings that are likely coming up for many of us‚Äîinsecurity, depression and anxiety‚Äîas well as the potential we all have to break through those feelings to heal by tapping into some personal reflection and growth\\" during quarantine. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. *Charli XCX - lead and backing vocals, songwriting, recording *Benjamin Keating - production, vocal production, songwriting, backing vocals, synthesizer, bass, drums *A.

He was born in Dammartin-sur-Tigeaux and was best known for his three years at Nice, where he was an important part of two title-winning teams. ==Career== Courteaux joined local team RC Paris in around 1948, and in 1949, he made his debut. He played over half the games that season, and was sold to Nice in 1950. In his first year at Nice, he established himself as a skilled striker, scoring 27 goals in the league and finishing second on the list of top goalscorers, one goal behind one of the best strikers in France, Roger Piantoni. Courteaux's exploits helped Nice to win the league for the first time. His partnership with Swede P√§r Bengtsson resulted in 42 goals, which is still tied for Nice's most prolific partnership of all time (Herv√© Revelli and Dick van Dijk equalled the record in the 1972-73 seasonhttps://www.ogcnice.com/en/news/33764/la-trentaine-pour-balotelli-et- plea. The next year, he remained a mainstay in the Nice attack, but failed to make as much of an impression scoring only 11 goals (though this was enough to make him Nice's second-top scorerhttps://www.footballdatabase.eu/fr/club/effectif/40-nice/1951-1952). Nice did win the league that year, and Couteaux stayed on for another year. In the 1952-53 season, Couteaux only scored 7 goals, as Nice finished in the lower half of the table. He was sold to RC Paris, where he started his career, who were now in the Division 2. The lower league proved too easy for Courteaux, as in the 1953-54 season he scored a massive 35 goals in 36 games, almost one goal every gamehttps://www.footballdatabase.eu/fr/joueur/details/68320-jean-courteaux. He unsurprisingly finished that year as the top scorer http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/fran2tops.htmlas RC Paris were promoted in third place. After seeing him do very well in the Division 2, Nice (who had won the Coupe de France but finished mid-table in the league) re-signed Courteaux. Courteaux, however, was largely overshadowed by 22 year old Just Fontaine, and was sold once more to a Division 2 team when the 1954-55 season ended: Stade Fran√ßais. At Stade Fran√ßais, he somewhat returned to goalscoring ways, scoring 11 goals in 26 matches. After that season he moved to tiny Parisian club CA Paris, who were a decidedly lower-half team in Division 2: In 1955-56 they had finished 19th out of 20. In Courteaux's first year, he scored sixteen goals - almost 40% of the team's 41 goals - but couldn't stop CA Paris from once more finishing 19th. The next year, Courteaux, then 31, played in less than half CA Paris' games, though the club did finish in 18th that year out of 22, higher than usual. http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/fran2hist.html ==After football== Courteaux retired from professional football in 1958, and joined amateur club La Voulte. The next year, he hung up his playing boots for good.

Stanley, whose parents were refugees of Nazi Germany, describes strategies employed by fascist regimes, which includes normalizing the \\"intolerable\\". His book is part of a \\"wave of articles, books and op-eds\\" that warn of the \\"return of fascism\\", features of which are already evident, according to Stanley, in the politics of the United States, the Philippines, Brazil, Russia, and Hungary. In September 2020, National Public Radio took another look at fascism, and interviewed Professor Stanley, who explained that the book has been reissued with a new preface because global events have substantiated his concern that fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world. ==Content== Stanley focuses on rhetoric and propaganda. His previous books include Knowledge and Practical Interests, Language in Context, Know How and the award-winning How Propaganda Works. He is a witness to the \\"consequences of fascism\\", his parents having fled Germany during the Holocaust. His maternal aunts, uncles and cousins were killed in eastern Poland in 1941 during Hitler's invasion. Stanley identifies the pillars of fascist politics that deepen the divide between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\"‚Äîdenying equality, using a culture of victimhood, and feeding the sexual anxiety of men. Strategies include undermining journalists and reporters, promoting anti-intellectualism, the use of propaganda, spreading conspiracy theories, letting fear and anger overtake \\"reasoned debate\\", and then calling on \\"law and order\\" solutions. Stanley describes how one of the hallmarks of fascism is the \\"politics of hierarchy\\"‚Äîa belief in a biologically determined superiority‚Äîwhereby fascists strive to recreate a \\"mythic\\" and \\"glorious\\" past by excluding those they believe to be inferior because of their ethnicity, religion, and/or race. ==Reviews== According to a The New York Times review, Stanley's book‚Äîa \\"slim volume\\"‚Äî\\"breezes across decades and continents\\" and says that Donald Trump \\"resembles other purveyors of authoritarian ultranationalism.\\" Overall, the Times gave a mixed review. The New Yorker said that How Fascism Works was popular, even though it was by an \\"academic philosopher\\"‚Äîit \\"prioritized current events over syllogisms\\" and \\"ranged broadly, citing experimental psychology, legal theory, and neo-Nazi blogs.\\" The Guardian's \\"rave review\\" cited Stanley who said that, one of the \\"ironies of fascist politics\\" is that it includes the \\"normalization of the fascist myth\\" so that talk of fascism is made to appear to be \\"outlandish\\". Fascist politics makes us able to \\"tolerate what was once intolerable by making it seem as if this is the way things have always been...By contrast the word 'fascist' has acquired a feeling of the extreme, like 'crying wolf'.\\" The Times Literary Supplement (TLS), which gave the book a mixed review, said that How Fascism Works belongs to a \\"wave of articles, books and op-eds\\" that warn us of the \\"return of fascism\\"‚Äîwhich includes Fascism: A warning by Madeleine Albright, On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder, When The Mob Gets Swayed with contributions by Paul Neuborn, and The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump with contributions by John Gartner.

It encompasses the western group of the Canary Islands ‚Äì La Palma, El Hierro, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria ‚Äì in the Atlantic Ocean. These volcanic islands are an autonomous community of Spain, and lie southwest of the Spanish mainland and west of the North African coast. ==Geography== The ecoregion covers an area of 4,693 km¬≤. The islands are mountainous and volcanic in origin. Teide on Tenerife reaches 3,718 m, Roque de los Muchachos on La Palma 2,426 m, Morro de la Agujereada on Gran Canaria 1,956 m, Pico de Malpaso on El Hierro 1,501 m, and Garajonay on La Gomera 1,487 m. The eastern group of the Canary Islands, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and the nearby islets of the Chinijo Archipelago, are lower, drier, and closer to the African coast. These eastern group islands are part of the Mediterranean Acacia-Argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets ecoregion. The Canary islands are part of Macaronesia, a group of archipelagoes in the Atlantic Ocean which share similar climate and ecology. ==Climate== The islands have a maritime Mediterranean climate. Rain falls mostly in the winter months, and is highest in November and December. Climate varies with elevation and exposure. The mountains intercept moisture- laden winds and create orographic precipitation. Rainfall is higher on the windward northeastern sides of the islands, and lower on the southwestern rain shadow. The highest elevations experience seasonal frosts and snows. ==Flora== The islands' variations in altitude and rainfall support diverse plant communities. Lowlands are principally scrub and open woodland, which extend from sea level to 600‚Äì1000 meters elevation. The Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) is prominent. Laurel forests, or laurisilva, are found at middle elevations, from 500 and 1400 meters elevation. These forests are characterized by evergreen broadleaf trees, including many in the laurel family (Lauraceae) ‚Äì Ocotea foetens, Apollonias barbujana, Laurus novocanariensis, and Persea indica ‚Äì together with Prunus lusitanica, Picconia excelsa, and Ilex canariensis. Pleiomeris canariensis and Heberdenia excelsa occur more rarely. Fayal-brezal heathlands are found from 500 to 1,700 m. The tall shrubs Myrica faya, Erica arborea and Erica scoparia are predominant. Forests of the endemic Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis) can be found close to sea level on the southern sides of the islands, and from 1,200 to 2,400 m on the northern slopes. Montane shrublands inhabit the highest elevations on La Palma and Tenerife. ==Fauna== Birds endemic to the ecoregion include Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii), laurel pigeon (Columba junoniae), Tenerife blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea), western Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis canariensis), and Tenerife goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae). The Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis) is a Macaronesian endemic bat, and Canary big-eared bat (Plecotus teneriffae) is a Canary Islands endemic. ==Protected areas== 2,417 km¬≤, or 52%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Caldera de Taburiente National Park on La Palma (46.9 km¬≤), Garajonay National Park on La Gomera (39.86 km¬≤), and Teide National Park on Tenerife (18.99 km¬≤). ==External links== * ==References== Category:Biota of the Canary Islands Category:Ecoregions of Spain Category:Environment of the Canary Islands Category:Macaronesia Category:Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub Category:Palearctic ecoregions ","title":"Canary Islands dry woodlands and forests"},{"id":"63888281","text":"Kirsty Mepham (born 13 August 1969) is a British equestrian.

Convicted of killing her step-son Willis Cowan in September 1894, Cowan was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent off to the Maine State Prison, where she died a few years later from an unspecified illness. ==Biography== Mary A. Knight was born as one of several children to Jonathan F. Knights, a veteran of the Civil War, and Apphia B. Knights (n√©e Sidelinger). She lived on rural family home in Plymouth until the age of 20, when she married the young farmer Willis W. Bean of nearby Dixmont. The couple had three children: Gracie, Alice and Mabel. At some point during their marriage, Willis expressed a desire to become a physician, a decision encouraged by Mary, who wanted to dabble in it as well. However, the family was poor, and they also had to take care of their infants. In 1884, Gracie was found smothered to death by a neighbor at the family home. When he informed Mary of the matter, she carelessly replied that she was aware of the fact, and that the child had died about half an hour ago. No official investigation was made, but residents of Dixmont suspected that she had killed little Gracie to get rid of her. In the following two years, Alice and Mabel died from peculiar stomach aches, but yet again, no investigation was conducted, and the deaths soon forgotten after the burials at the Plymouth cemetery. Illustration of Cowan's victims Despite these tragedies, Willis still decided to pursue his medical career, enrolling into a dubious institute that sold diplomas for $25. However, this was considered fraudulent, and soon, a state law was passed which prohibited the selling of fake diplomas, right before Bean could acquire it. Unperturbed by this setback, both husband and wife were deadset on getting diplomas, choosing to travel to an out-of-state institution in Ohio to get them. Before their trip, Willis confided to his parents that he would invest money in a farm, in which he would live after returning to Maine. Said farm was purchased and the mortgage given to the elder Bean, but it was never recorded. After borrowing some $200, the couple traveled to Ohio to enroll into an institution. On January 6, 1888, Willis' parents received a letter claiming that their son had died mysteriously, with the cause of death later determined to be stomach pain, similar to the children who died in the previous years. Mary soon returned to stay with her late husband's parents, and soon after, the unrecorded mortgage went missing. Since she had the deed for the farm, and thus owned the land, Mary sold the farm for $2,000. Some time later, Mary married George H. Taylor, a Dixmont laborer who worked at the Lewiston mills, where the newlyweds moved to live. Taylor, who belonged to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, died after four days of acute stomach pain in 1891, in similar circumstances to Mary's former family. Since he was an Odd Fellow, it was supposed that he had a life insurance policy, but since George hadn't paid his dues, it was void. Nevertheless, well-meaning members contributed to a fund amounting several hundreds of dollars as a donation to the supposedly- grieving widow. ===Murder of Willis Cowan and arrest=== A few months after Taylor's death, Mary married Elias Cowan, a widowed farmer with an 8-year-old son, Willis. Not long after their marriage, a full set of farm buildings belonging to Elias mysteriously burned to the ground. According to neighbors who arrived to provide assistance with putting out the fires, they found the family's clothing, dishes and other items tied up in bundles and ready to be carried out. It was also rumored that young Willis was abused by his stepmother, who often beat him for the pettiest of things. On September 14, 1894, Willis was brought down with heavy stomach pains after eating some green apples. A physician was called to the family home, who prescribed some medicine and assured that the young boy would be fine in a few hours. Two days later, the young Cowan died in agonizing pain. Due to Mary's dubious history of similar deaths, and the fact that her husband had also been taken with a similar illness but survived, Willis' body was exhumed and his organs sent for analysis at the Bowdoin College in Brunswick. The autopsy results showed that the body contained heavy amounts of arsenic, enough to kill a full-grown ox. Without wasting their time, policemen quickly arrested Mary Cowan for the murder of her stepson. Until then, she had threatened to pursue legal action if anybody accused her of poisoning, but when lodged in the prison, she started crying. ===Trial and imprisonment=== During her 1895 trial, an ample amount of evidence was presented, pinning Mary as the one who poisoned young Willis. One witness was a little neighborhood girl who had seen Mrs. Cowan putting white powder into the boy's medicine, which had been left by the doctor, but she did not testify per request of her father, who feared for her safety. Despite this, the prosecutor proved that the dose of arsenic present in the body could've only been put deliberately, and after a few days of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict. Cowan stood expressionless while listening to the verdict, with her counsel, J.F. Robinson, announcing that he would file a motion for a retrial. In June, however, it was announced that the proceedings for the retrial had been withdrawn. While in prison, Mary Cowan conducted interviews with reporters and often responded to callers interested in her case. On one occasion, she confided to a reporter that she had hired a private detective who supposedly unearthed evidence in favor or her innocence, and expressed belief that she would be a free woman again one day. Her hopes were dashed on February 19, 1896, when she was officially sentenced to life imprisonment for killing Willis Cowan. Cowan was imprisoned at the Maine State Prison, then in Thomaston, for the following two years. In 1898, her examining physician turned to then-governor Llewellyn Powers with the request of pardoning Mary, as she was in failing health and wished to die peacefully in her Dixmont home. Despite her ailment, Mary gave birth to a child while in prison, but it, along with herself, died soon after. Cowan, by then dubbed 'The Borgia of Maine' by the press, was first interned at Etna, where her parents lived, but her body was then moved to the Sawyer Cemetery in her birthplace of Plymouth, where she was buried on the family plot with her murder victims. ==External links== * Dismissal of appeal by the Supreme Court * Find A Grave article ==References== Category:1863 births Category:1898 deaths Category:19th-century American criminals Category:American female serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Maine Category:Poisoners Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Maine Category:Serial killers who died in prison custody Category:Mariticides Category:Filicides Category:Criminals from Maine Category:People from Penobscot County, Maine ","title":"Mary Cowan"},{"id":"63888338","text":"The National Federation of Education, Culture and Vocational Training (, FNEC FP}}) is a trade union representing education and related staff in France. In 1948, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) suffered a major split, with many members leaving to form Workers' Force (FO). The Federation for National Education (FEN), formerly affiliated to the CGT, voted to leave, but did not join FO. However, it permitted its members to also be affiliated to any national union federation. As a result, in April, supporters of FO formed the FO Federation for National Education. Membership remained low, only 5,000 in 1950, and in 1954, FO decided to ban dual membership with the FEN, effectively ending the union's presence outside teaching colleges and technical education. The union became the National Federation for Education and Culture (FNEC) in 1970, and grew significantly in the early 1980s, when a group of former FEN members joined, arguing that the FEN was not supporting secularism nor opposing parents interfering in state education. The union adopted its current name in 1989. By 1995, it claimed 28,000 members. ==General Secretaries== :1948: Francis Perrin, Gilbert Walusinski and Gaston Pollet :1950: Pierre Giraud :1953: Pierre Galoni :1968: Maurice Mascrier :1983: :1986: Fran√ßois Chaintron :2008: Hubert Raguin :2019: Cl√©ment Poullet ==External links== * ==References== Category:Education trade unions Category:Trade unions established in 1948 Category:Trade unions in France ","title":"National Federation of Education, Culture and Vocational Training"},{"id":"63888350","text":"Stefan Peter (born 10 April 1975) is an Austrian equestrian.

For much of his career he co-produced and co-directed films with his wife, fellow filmmaker Judith MacDougall. In 1972, his first film, To Live with Herds was awarded the Grand Prix \\"Venezia Genti\\" at the Venice Film Festival. He has lived in Australia since 1975, and is currently a professor in the Research School of Humanities & the Arts at Australian National University. MacDougall has produced films covering a wide range of subjects, be it the semi-nomadic Turkana people of Kenya in The Wedding Camels or an elite North Indian boys' boarding school in The Doon School Quintet. Influenced by cin√©ma v√©rit√© and Direct Cinema in the 1960s, he is considered to be one of the pioneers of observational cinema, films that present the observations of an individual filmmaker, whose perspective is shared with the viewer.Grimshaw, Anna; Ravetz, Amanda (2009). Observational Cinema. Indiana University Press. . He has advocated ‚Äúparticipatory cinema‚Äù in which the subjects of documentary films are more fully involved in their creation. He was one of the first ethnographic filmmakers to eschew explanatory narration and employ longer takes, using subtitles to translate the speech of people in other cultures.Loizos, Peter (1993). Innovation in Ethnographic Film: From Innocence to Self-Consciousness 1955-1985. University of Chicago Press. . His films have also explored what he has termed ‚Äúsocial aesthetics,‚Äù the combination of manners, everyday rituals, textures, colors, architectural forms, and material objects that create the distinctive character of a community.Fahey, Johannah; Prosser, Howard; Shaw, Matthew, eds (2016). In the Realm of the Senses: Social Aesthetics and the Sensory Dynamics of Privilege. Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-981-287-350-7 . MacDougall is considered one of the most prominent theorists in visual anthropology. Both Judith and David are considered to be among the most significant anthropological filmmakers in the English-speaking world. In 2013, MacDougall received the Life Achievement Award from the Royal Anthropological Institute in London. ==Early life and education== MacDougall was born on November 12, 1939 in New Hampshire, United States, to a Canadian father and an American mother. He attended Dalton School in New York City until the eighth grade and then The Putney School in Vermont. He went to Harvard University, where he received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in English literature in 1961. After Harvard, he enrolled in the film program at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he participated in the Ethnographic Film Program and received a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1970. ==Career== MacDougall began his career in 1972 when he made his first film To Live with Herds about the semi-nomadic pastoral Jie people in Uganda. It won the Grand Prix \\"Venezia Genti\\" at the 1972 Venice Film Festival. After this, MacDougall, along with his work partner and wife, Judith MacDougall, worked on the Turkana Conversations Trilogy. The series investigated the lives of the Turkana people, semi-nomadic camel herders in Kenya. Lorang's Way, released in 1979, was a portrait of a senior man of the Turkana, and won the first prize at the Cin√©ma du R√©el in Paris in 1979. The second film, The Wedding Camels, looks at the marriage of one of Lorang's daughters, and was awarded the Film Prize of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1980. After Africa, MacDougall's focus shifted to Australia, where he directed, or co-directed with his wife, ten films on Aboriginal Australian communities for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. These include Goodbye Old Man (1977), Takeover (1980), Stockman's Strategy (1984), and Link-Up Diary (1987). After Australia, MacDougall made Photo Wallahs in India in 1991 with Judith. The subject was photographers and photography in the Indian hill town of Mussoorie. MacDougall said in an interview, \\"Our first plan for the film was to look for a place where one photographer served a small community - a town with a resident photographer...Perhaps we were naive in thinking such photographers actually existed. If a town was big enough to have a photographer at all, it had twenty...We ended up making the film in one of the most heterogeneous towns one could imagine, a hill station called Mussoorie.\\" In 1993 he made Tempus de Baristas about mountain shepherds in Sardinia, produced by the Instituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico and the BBC, and awarded the 1995 Earthwatch Film Award. In 2009, his film Gandhi's Children was nominated for Best Documentary Feature Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. The setting of the documentary was a shelter for abandoned, runaway, or orphaned children on the outskirts of New Delhi, where MacDougall lived for several months. ===The Doon School Quintet=== Between 1996 and 2003, MacDougall worked on one of his most ambitious projects, The Doon School Quintet, a five-part ethnographic film series that was a long-term visual study of The Doon School, a boys' boarding school in the North Indian town of Dehradun. The then headmaster, John Mason, gave MacDougall unprecedented access for filming, and he stayed on campus with the boys between 1997 and 2000. From over eighty-five hours of collected material, he produced five documentary films, edited and released between 2000 and 2004. They studied the daily lives of the boys, the social aesthetics of the school, its rituals, traditions, material culture and language. \\"My primary interest in the school was as a crossing place for people from different backgrounds, how they got on with each other across class lines,\\" MacDougall said in an interview. \\"But in the process of working on it, I actually became much more interested in the school as a kind of social organism, a micro-society with its own rules and rituals, and the films ended up being about the experience of students growing up in this kind of institution where they had to learn a whole new game plan, different from their previous lives which had been living within their family.\\" MacDougall went on to make film studies of two further institutions for children in India, the Rishi Valley School in South India and the Prayas Children‚Äôs Home for Boys in New Delhi. From 2011 to 2017 he directed the 6-year ‚ÄúChildhood and Modernity‚Äù project in India in which different groups of children conducted research in their own communities using video cameras. It produced over 20 short films, 12 of which are presented in the DVD production, The Child‚Äôs Eye (2018). ==Honours== In 2013, MacDougall was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Royal Anthropological Institute for his contributions in the field of ethnographic and documentary filmmaking. In Australia, he has held a Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship and a Professorial Fellowship awarded by the Australian Research Council. From 1997 to 2007, he was a Research Fellow at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research at the Australian National University, and is currently a professor in the Research School of Humanities & Arts. ==Books== * * * ==Filmography== * To Live with Herds (1972) * Kenya Boran (1974) (co-directed with James Blue) * Goodbye Old Man (1977) * The Wedding Camels (1977) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) * Lorang's Way (1979) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) * Takeover (1980) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) * A Wife Among Wives (1981) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) * Stockman's Strategy (1984) * Link-Up Diary (1987) * Photo Wallahs (1991) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) * Tempus de Baristas (1993) * The Doon School Quintet: :* Doon School Chronicles (2000) :*With Morning Hearts (2001) :*Karam in Jaipur (2001) :*The New Boys (2003) :*The Age of Reason (2004) * SchoolScapes (2007) * Gandhi‚Äôs Children (2008) * Awareness (2010) (co-directed with Judith MacDougall) *Arnav at Six (2012) * Under the Palace Wall (2014) ==References== ==External links== * Princeton University Press profile * Category:1939 births Category:American anthropologists Category:American documentary film directors Category:Australian National University faculty Category:Cultural anthropologists Category:Documentary filmmakers Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Living people Category:The Putney School alumni Category:Social anthropologists Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Visual anthropologists Category:Writers from New Hampshire ","title":"David MacDougall"},{"id":"63888516","text":"Berenice Owen-Jones, a career officer with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and most recently Director of Studies of the Diplomatic Academy, is the Australian Ambassador to Morocco.

The case remains unsolved, and the investigation remains open. ==Biography== Janet Brown worked as a research nurse at the Public Health and Primary Care department of Oxford University. Her husband, Grahaem Brown, worked in Switzerland as a senior executive at Ciba-Geigy, a pharmaceuticals company. The couple had three children. The family lived in a remote farmhouse, situated on an 11-acre estate in Radnage, Buckinghamshire, valued at ¬£345,000 (1995 prices). Following a spate of local burglaries, Janet Brown had formed the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme. She was known to be security-conscious, and had installed a panic alarm in the house. ==Murder== Janet Brown was at home alone on the evening of the 10 April 1995. Her husband was working in Switzerland, her eldest daughter and son were at university and her youngest daughter was staying at the home of a friend. At some point after 2020 GMT, an intruder or intruders entered the house and handcuffed and gagged Brown, and then beat her across the head with a blunt instrument, possibly a crowbar, until dead. Police described the attack as \\"extremely brutal\\". At some point Brown is believed to have triggered a panic button in her bedroom. Despite the alarm ringing, the killer seemed to have taken his time at the scene, washing his hands of blood and moving around the house. Her body was discovered by builders, who were renovating the house, at the bottom of her stairs at 0811 GMT on the 11 April. ==Investigation== ===Initial investigation=== There was no evidence of sexual assault, and police stated that they remain open-minded regarding the motive. A prominent theory was that the murder was a result of a bungled burglary. The intruder had used glass-cutting equipment on the first panel of the doubled glazed patio door, and then simply smashed the second panel. However, although a television and video recorder were unplugged, nothing had been stolen from the house. Most burglaries take place during the day, when there is less likely to be anyone at home. It is unusual for burglars to target properties where someone is obviously inside, and there were two cars parked outside the house. Detective Superintendent Martin Short, who led the investigation, said, \\"on balance, I don't think the motive was burglary. If a burglar did it, it wasn't a half-decent one.\\" Police were unable to discover any evidence of an extramarital affair, and considered the scenario as unlikely. Other theories, such as industrial espionage, a failed kidnapping or a contract killing were examined and dismissed. Police stated their belief that, due to the isolated location of the murder, the perpetrator was most likely a local man who was familiar with the area. Paul Britton, a forensic psychologist, assisted police with their investigation. Britton posited that although Janet Brown had not been sexually assaulted, the perpetrator may have become aroused by inflicting fear, and dominating his victim, and that this, rather than burglary, may have been his primary motive. Detective Superintendent Martin Short commented: ::There is no theory to explain what happened that night which makes perfect sense. There are aspects of every theory which are contradicted by the facts. And policemen deal in facts. The intruder showed a fair amount of planning. He had an iron bar or truncheon, two types of tape, handcuffs, a glass cutter and probably a torch. I have the gut feeling that it wasn't burglary. He didn't react like a normal burglar. More than 99 percent of burglars would run on hearing an alarm go off. This one not only continued his murderous attack but coolly washed his hands and went upstairs again. We don't know the motive. In most murders, once you've got the motive, then you're a long way to cracking it. There are no indications that Mrs Brown had a boyfriend. Everything points to the fact that she was a respectable woman who doted on her family. Her husband was definitely in Switzerland when she was killed and he had nothing to gain by her death. By the second anniversary of the murder, 2,700 people have been interviewed by the police. ===Developments since 2015=== In 2015 police announced that they had isolated a DNA sample from the crime scene. Almost every male from the surrounding area, over 700 people, were tested, with no match found. Police are now concentrating on the bungled burglary theory. The chief investigating officer in 2015, Peter Beirne, stated, 'my working hypothesis at the moment is that it was a burglar, or burglars, who weren't particularly proficient. They came across Janet, they had control of her because they handcuffed her, and I think she was bludgeoned to death when she pressed the panic alarm.\\" ==References== Category:Unsolved murders in England Category:1995 deaths Category:1944 births Category:English nurses Category:Crime in Buckinghamshire Category:1995 murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Janet Brown (murder victim)"},{"id":"63888566","text":"Hans Nyffeler was a Swiss footballer who played for FC Basel.

She was classed as a lighthouse tender and operated by the United States Lighthouse Service. Elm was launched in 1918 and sold in 1934. ==Construction== The contract for the hull was awarded to Rice Brothers Corporation in East Boothbay, Maine on January 13, 1917. The contract price was $29,400. On July 10, 1917 a fire broke out in the shipyard which destroyed all but four hull frames. Despite the setback, Elm was launched on July 23, 1918. She was placed in commission on July 19, 1919. Her total cost was $93,638. Elm's wooden hull was long with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement at that draft was 318 tons. Elm had a single wooden deck. The ship had a single derrick mast with two booms. These were and long. The mast was located forward on deck, with the booms swinging aft. A small steam engine was used to power the crane hoists. Propulsion was provided by a 150-horsepower kerosine-fueled internal combustion engine. This was a 2-cycle, 3-cylinder engine. The cylinders were in diameter with a stroke of . This engine drove a right-handed, four-blade cast iron propeller in diameter. She had accommodations for a complement of two officers and four men. There was also a spare stateroom, mess, and galley in a deck house aft on the ship. A cargo hold under the deck had a capacity of 70 tons. == Operational history == Elm's first home port was Tompkinsville, on Staten Island, New York. She was assigned to the Third Lighthouse District which had its main depot at Tompkinsville. In July 1919 Elm began work improving aids to navigation in the Hudson River. On November 9, 1922, Elm was at Block Island, Rhode Island where she damaged a dock. In 1930 she was transferred to the Eleventh Lighthouse District and her homeport was changed to Detroit, Michigan. On August 1, 1934 the superintendent of lighthouses in Detroit took sealed bids for Elm. She was sold on August 14, 1934.

He was arrested after running the biggest global animal smuggling ring to be taken down. He founded a reptile export company in the early 1980s and by the end of the decade had established a large network of illegal wildlife trafficking operations from his base in Penang, where wildlife protection laws were weak and rarely enforced. He was targeted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Operation Chameleon from 1995, which eventually saw him extradited to the United States from Mexico to be sentenced to 71 months in prison in June 2001. He resumed his smuggling operations upon his release, before being arrested by the Malaysian authorities in 2010. He was released in 2012 after securing a successful appeal against the length of his sentence. Despite having had many of his animals seized during his recent arrest, he is believed to have once again resumed illegally smuggling wildlife since his release. ==Smuggling career== Wong ran Sungai Rusa Wildlife in Penang, a legal reptile export company founded in the early 1980s. However, as well as legal exports he also smuggled snow leopard pelts, panda bear skins, rhino horns, rare birds, Komodo dragons, chinchillas, gorillas, tigers and elephants from Australia, China, Madagascar, New Zealand, South America, and elsewhere to markets largely in Europe, Japan, and the United States. One species he exported, the Gray's monitor, had been thought to be extinct. With more protected species he exploited his country's weaker wildlife protection laws and easily corruptible customs officials in order to verify the animal's documentation, thereby allowing him to sell the animals elsewhere in the world. From his base in Penang, he boasted to an undercover American agent in March 1997 that \\"I can get anything here from anywhere, nothing can be done to me. I could sell a panda ‚Äî and, nothing. As long as I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm safe.\\" ===United States sting operation=== Wong became a target of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), who set up a sting operation code-named Operation Chameleon. The USFWS set up animal reptile companies and first made contact with Sungai Rusa Wildlife in October 1995, establishing a business relationship. Wong went on to use a corrupt employee in the FedEx facility in Phoenix, Arizona, to express mail protected species such as false gharial and radiated tortoises. He also used an American mule, James Burroughs, to fly from Malaysia with Madagascan radiated tortoises who had their legs taped inside their shells and were bundled in black socks and packed at the bottom of legal reptile shipments. In order to lure Wong out of Malaysia, undercover agents agreed to meet him in Mexico with the promise of a trade in lucrative bear bile. He was arrested immediately after landing in Mexico City, and was extradited to the United States after a two-year court battle. In June 2001, a California court sentenced Wong to 71 months in prison (with credit for 34 months served in Mexico), a $60,000 fine, and banned him from exporting to the United States for three years after his release. In fact, he continued to export wildlife to the United States during his incarceration and immediately after his release via Sungai Rusa Wildlife and a new company he founded with Cheah Bing Shee, CBS Wildlife. ===Release and re-arrest=== Wong returned to Malaysia upon his release and subsequently received funding and land from the Penang government to construct a tiger zoo. High-ranking wildlife protection official Misliah Mohamad Basir explained that the authorities there considered him a legitimate businessman who had been framed by the USFWS. However, an expos√© in National Geographic led to an outcry among the Malaysian public and the funding was revoked, wildlife laws were tightened and Misliah was transferred to a different position. Wong switched to mainly smuggling reptiles as he felt they were not as protected as other species. One relatively minor smuggling operation was discovered at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in summer 2010 when investigators examined a broken lock on a suitcase and found nearly 100 baby boa constrictors, two rhinoceros vipers, and a South American mata mata turtle, all hidden inside. Wong was arrested after he came to collect the suitcase. The Malaysian government then took action to restrict Wong and his activities: business licenses were revoked, his zoo was shut down, and animal collection ‚Äì including his bengal tigers ‚Äì seized. He faced a criminal charge for smuggling the endangered boa constrictors. Wong claimed that he had not applied for a permit simply because the customer was rushing him to get the snakes in time for Eid al-Fitr. In November 2010, a judge sentenced Wong to five years in prison, a strict sentence for animal smuggling by most nation's standards and completely unprecedented in Malaysian legal history. Earlier in 2010 a Malaysian woman had been sentenced to eight months in prison in Madagascar for smuggling critically endangered Angonoka tortoises to Malaysia; Wong was never tried for his alleged involvement. ===Release on appeal=== On 22 February 2012, Wong was freed after the Court of Appeal accepted his appeal to reduce the jail sentence from five years to 17-and-a-half months. Justice Datuk Wira Low Hop Bing noted that \\"It is trite law that Wong's plea of guilt is a mitigating factor. It is trite law that the fact Wong was the first offender is another mitigating factor\\". Speaking in 2015, Daniel Tanuwidjaja, an Indonesian animal smuggler, admitted that he still was regularly dealing with Wong and his wife following Wong's release from prison. Tanuwidjaja said that he paid off wildlife and customs officials in both Indonesia and Malaysia to avoid arrest. A documentary investigatory team discovered a number of shell companies and exotic wildlife in Malaysia linked to Wong, demonstrating the country's continued struggle with corruption and enforcement of its wildlife laws. ==See also== * Operation Chameleon ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Malaysian criminals Category:Smugglers Category:Wildlife smuggling ","title":"Wong Keng Liang"},{"id":"63888701","text":"Stelios Georgousopoulos (born 28 July 1965) is a Greek windsurfer.

She also earned Master of Arts degrees in national security and strategic studies from the Naval War College and in national security strategy from the National Defense University, as well as Master of Business Administration from Webster University. == Career == === Military service === Olson enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1979. She was the first woman to go through flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base and became one of the first female pilots in the Air Force. She served as a squadron commander of the 96th Air Refueling Squadron out of Fairchild Air Force Base, becoming one of only eight female squadron commanders. Olson reached the rank of colonel in 2000, and was assigned to the comptroller's office in The Pentagon in early 2003. In 2003, General Jay Garner, the director of the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, selected Olson to be his executive officer in helping to rebuild Iraq after Operation Iraqi Freedom. Three months into the role, Garner was replaced by Paul Bremer, and the Department of Defense charged Olson with providing improper assistance to a private security firm from South Africa. Though she denies the allegations, Olson accepted a non-judicial punishment rather than face a potential court martial by pleading guilty to minor administrative violations and accepting a reprimand. She was allowed to retire with an honorable discharge without a reduction in rank, which she received in May 2005. After her discharge, Olson founded Grace After Fire, a nonprofit organization that aids female military veterans when they return to civilian life. She also wrote a memoir, Iraq and Back: Inside the War to Win the Peace, which was published in 2006. ===Politics=== In 2007, Olson became the Director of Human Resources for the Dallas Independent School District. That year, she was elected to the school board of the Weatherford Independent School District (WISD), representing Place 3. She resigned her seat, effective September 1, 2011, because she and her husband decided to move out of Weatherford, which made her ineligible to serve on the WISD school board. In the 2018 elections, Olson ran as a Democrat against Sid Miller for Texas Agriculture Commissioner. Miller defeated Olson in a close election. Olson ran for the United States House of Representatives in in the 2020 elections. She advanced to a runoff election against Candace Valenzuela for the Democratic nomination. Olson was defeated by Valenzuela in the runoff. ==Personal life== Olson met her husband, Kent, while they both served as flight instructors for the Air Force in Arizona. They have two daughters, and live on a farm in Mineral Wells, Texas. Olson is a Master Gardener. In 2014, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. ==Bibliography== * ==References== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:People from Mineral Wells, Texas Category:School board members in Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:United States Air Force officers Category:1957 births Category:People from Waukegan, Illinois Category:People from New Hampton, Iowa Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:American gardeners Category:Naval War College alumni Category:National Defense University alumni Category:Webster University alumni ","title":"Kim Olson"},{"id":"63888916","text":"Compartmented seals of eagle, monkey, and goddess, Turkmenistan or northeast Iran, early Bronze Age, c. 2200-1800 BC, bronze - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Anau culture was an ancient agricultural civilization of Central Asia centred in southern Turkmenistan. It started during the Chalcolithic period around 4000 BC, following the Neolithic Jeitun culture. It is named after its main site of Anau, Turkmenistan. Namazga culture was contemporary to the Anau culture. Pottery similar to that of Anau (the earliest Anau IA phase) has been found as far as Shir Ashian Tepe in the Semnan Province of Iran.Shir-e Shian - Encyclopedia Iranica ==Site of Anau== The settlement of Anau started around 4500 BC in the Neolithic period, before copper was used. Thus, it is earlier than Namazga-Tepe, the main site of the Namazga culture. Anau includes two mounds, north and south. Archaeological research here began in 1890. Raphael Pumpelly, Marushchenko, and Khurban Sokhatov were some of the researchers over the years. The lowest layers of the north mound in Anau provide some good evidence for the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic in the area. This archaeological sequence is known as Anau IA. More recent excavations at Monjukli Depe, which also has some Anau culture occupational levels, also helped to establish the regional chronology. The northern mound also presents remains of the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age. Some copper items, as well as imported Lapis lazuli have been found. The southern mound also has the Iron Age remains.Kohl, Philip L.

Plandemic (a portmanteau of \\"plan\\" + \\"pandemic\\") refers to a pair of conspiracy theory videos, the first posted to several social media platforms, on May 4, 2020, and the longer one posted August 18, 2020. Both, produced by conspiracist Mikki Willis, promotes falsehoods and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. They feature Judy Mikovits, a discredited former researcher. Mikovits has been described as an anti-vaccine activist, which she denies. The first video became viral, making it one of the most widespread pieces of COVID-19 misinformation. It was removed by multiple platforms, because of its misleading content and promotion of false medical information. Meanwhile, the second video, Plandemic: Indoctornation, did not get as much attention. The videos were criticized by scientists and health professionals as promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories. Willis's response varies, from being silent to being supportive of Plandemic. == Background == The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared an international health emergency in January 2020, and a pandemic in March. As of 9 October 2020, 36.5 million cases had been confirmed worldwide, and more than 1.06 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. Like many medical topics, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic emerged, spread by all kinds of people, from regular citizens to notable politicians. Notable misinformation focuses on the scale of the pandemic, as well as the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment of the disease. Some think that the virus is a bioweapon to either control the population, doing espionage, or being the effects of 5G networks. Some people have claimed magic or faith- based cures to the disease. ==First video == 247x247px === Summary === The first video, titled Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid-19, promotes the conspiracist claim that vaccines are \\"a money-making enterprise that causes medical harm\\". It takes the form of an interview between Willis and Mikovits in which Mikovits makes numerous unsupported or false claims around coronavirus, and her own controversial history. Fact-checker PolitiFact highlighted eight false or misleading claims made in the video, including: * That Mikovits was held in jail without charge. Mikovits was briefly held on remand after an accusation of theft from her former employer, the Whittemore Peterson Institute, but charges were dropped. There is no evidence to support her claim that notebooks removed from the Institute were \\"planted\\" or that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and its director Anthony Fauci bribed investigators. When asked, both Mikovits and Willis admitted that it was an error to say she had not been charged, and in fact she had meant to say that the charges were dropped, Mikovits saying that \\"I've been confused for a decade\\" and that in future she would try to be more clear when she talks about the criminal charge (\\"I'll try to learn to say it differently.\\"). * That the virus was manipulated. An article in Nature analyses the likely origins and finds that \\"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus\\". * That the virus occurred from SARS-1 within a decade, and this is inconsistent with natural causes. This is incorrect: SARS-CoV-2 is similar but not directly descended from SARS-CoV (SARS-1), with only 79% genetic similarity. * That hospitals receive $13,000 from Medicare if they \\"call it COVID-19\\" when a patient dies. This claim, which had previously been made on The American Spectator and WorldNetDaily, was rated \\"half true\\" by PolitiFact and Snopes: payments are made, but the amount is open to dispute, and there is no evidence that this influences diagnosis, and in fact the evidence suggests that COVID-19 is, if anything, under-diagnosed. * That hydroxychloroquine is \\"effective against these families of viruses\\". This claim originates with work by Didier Raoult, which has subsequently received a \\"statement of concern\\" from the editors of the journal in which it was published. The first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 found no evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. The NIH says that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this use. As of May 7, 2020, other bodies were running additional controlled trials to investigate hydroxychloroquine's safety and efficacy. * That flu vaccines increase the chance of contracting COVID-19 by 36%. This claim is false. The claim misinterprets a disputed article that studied the 2017‚Äî2018 influenza season, predating the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim that the flu vaccine increases the chance of contracting COVID-19 does not appear in the original article at all. The author (Greg G. Wolff) wrote that coronavirus cases increased from 5.8% (non-vaccinated) to 7.8% (vaccinated) with odds ratio of 1.36, with (1.14, 1.63) 95% confidence interval, and the article highlight said: \\"Vaccinated personnel did not have significant odds of respiratory illnesses.\\" The article was referring to seasonal coronaviruses (common cold), but COVID-19 was added by the website disabledveterans.org. * That \\"If you've ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses\\". This has also been debunked, the flu shot contains no coronaviruses. * That \\"Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus. You're getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.\\" This claim is unsupported by evidence. Masks prevent airborne transmission of the virus, especially during the asymptomatic period (up to 14 days), when carriers may not even be aware they have the disease; a virus may be de-activated, but cannot add to one's infection level if it leaves the body even temporarily. Science also repeats some of the points given by PolitiFact, and fact-checked some claims too, where Mikovits and Willis claimed: * That Italy's COVID-19 epidemic has links with influenza vaccines and the presence of coronaviruses in dogs. There is no relation whatsoever between the three. * That SARS-CoV-2 was created \\"between the North Carolina laboratories, Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the Wuhan laboratory.\\" Science says that considering the relations between the US and the Wuhan lab has stopped, the claim is certainly false. * That she is not anti-vaccine. Science gave multiple occasions that hinted Mikovits as one. * That the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \\"colluded and destroyed\\" her reputation, and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did nothing but secreting it. Science responded with \\"Mikovits has presented no direct evidence that HHS heads colluded against her.\\" * That Mikovits's article on Science \\"revealed that the common use of animal and human fetal tissues was unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases,\\" when the article does not reveal anything of the sort. * That Mikovits's Ph.D. thesis Negative Regulation of HIV Expression in Monocytes \\"revolutionized the treatment of HIV/AIDS,\\" when the thesis \\"had no discernible impact on the treatment of HIV/AIDS.\\" Mikovits also alludes to a number of conspiracy theories which claim Bill Gates is implicated in causing the pandemic in order to profit from an eventual vaccine, and makes false and unsupported claims that beaches should remain open, as \\"healing microbes in the saltwater\\" and \\"sequences\\" in the sand can \\"protect against the coronavirus\\". The video claims that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are purposely being misreported in an effort to control people. Willis' previous credits include numerous conspiracy theorist videos, as well as cinematography on Neurons to Nirvana, a film that makes therapeutic claims about psychedelics. === Production === Logo of Elevate, the California-based production company for the first video, which is owned by Willis himself. Willis claimed via the Ojai Valley News that \\"Because of [Mikovits'] direct connection with [those] involved with the pandemic, [...] I reached out to her for advice. We met, had a meeting, and what she revealed to me I knew the world needed to know.‚Äù He also said that shooting took a day, and editing took two weeks. He claimed that he halted continuation in editing a film he made in 2019, that \\"Plandemic was the priority.\\" Initially, he is also unsure whether to make a continuation or not. === Release === The video was released on May 4, 2020. It spreads virally on social media, garnering millions of views, making it one of the most widespread pieces of COVID-19 misinformation. The video was removed by multiple platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo, and Twitter, because of its misleading content and promotion of false medical information. On TikTok, it continued to find popularity via clips excerpted from the full video, part of which were removed by the platform. It was stated to be part of an upcoming \\"documentary feature film.\\" === Reception === Scientists, medical doctors and public health experts condemned the film for promoting misinformation and \\"a hodgepodge of conspiracy theories\\". Physician and comedian Zubin Damania wrote in his commentary: \\"Don't waste your time watching it. Don't waste your time sharing it. Don't waste your time talking about it. I can‚Äôt believe I'm wasting my time doing this. But I just want to stop getting messages about it.\\" Accelerated Urgent Care, whose discredited press conference statements by co-owners Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi were utilized in the video, released an official statement disagreeing with the video's agenda and claiming that the company never gave permission to Willis to utilize their video. Specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring, writing for BBC, worries that its \\"Slick production means videos often look quite credible initially - before promoting totally false claims. That makes them as dangerous - if not more so - than advice with a mix of truth and misleading medical myths.\\" Science journalist Tara Haelle described the video as propaganda and posited that the video \\"has been extremely successful at promoting misinformation for three reasons\\": # it \\"taps into people's uncertainty, anxiety and need for answers\\"; # it \\"is packaged very professionally and uses common conventions people already associate with factual documentaries\\" # it effectively exploits various methods of persuasion, including the use of a seemingly trustworthy and sympathetic narrator, appeals to emotion, the Gish gallop, and \\"sciencey\\" images. Zarine Kharazian, assistant editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, described the response to the removal of the video from Facebook and YouTube as a \\"censorship backfire\\", invoking the Streisand effect.  Mikki Willis' response  ProPublica health care reporter and investigative journalist Marshall Allen contacted Willis; Willis says that Plandemic \\"is not a piece that‚Äôs intended to be perfectly balanced.\\" When asked whether the video would be suffice to be called a propaganda, which is \\"information [...] of a biased or misleading nature\\" as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, he opines that although he thinks there's no misinformation in the video, the definition fits. He also thinks that by the definition, \\"100% of news reporting [related to Plandemic] is propaganda.\\" The Center for Inquiry (CFI), Benjamin Radford and Paul Offit gave WIllis eight questions concerning the accuracy of the claims made in the video, either asking for evidences, clarification, or a general question such as \\"considering that bacteria don‚Äôt kill viruses, how would ‚Äúhealing microbes‚Äù reduce or treat coronavirus infection?\\" While Willis agreed to answer all of the questions, they have not received some kind of reply from him. The CFI reacted on their website: \\"If the claims made [...] in Plandemic are [factual], you‚Äôd think they would be eager to [prove it]. Where are their responses? Why are they suddenly so quiet? Why are they afraid to answer questions? What do they have to hide? ==Plandemic: Indoctornation== Plandemic: Indoctornation's logo The 84-minute version, titled Plandemic: Indoctornation (the word \\"Doctor\\" being highlighted in the logo as an altering of the word indoctrination) was released on August 18, 2020. Willis says that the video is a \\"response video to all the debunkers,\\" interviewing 7,000 doctors as well as attorneys, saying that his goal is to \\"reform our medical systems such that they‚Äôre not under the stranglehold of big pharma.\\" The argumentation presented in the video aims to demonstrate the existence of an worldwide conspiracy seeking to control the entire human population through fear and making money, the COVID-19 pandemic being a key moment in a plan that spans decades. Willis points to actors as various as Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control, Google and the fact-checking agencies it employs, Wikipedia, the Chinese government, and Bill Gates who somehow coordinate with each other. The video's thesis is supported by a number of claims that have been discredited. Experts are satisfied that COVID-19 has not been engineered in a laboratory and a 2019 disaster response exercice could not have been a plan to release an actual virus into the population. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation still funds projects in India and cooperates with the Indian government on several initiative; it does not have technology allowing it to covertly implant an invisible proof of vaccination. === Release === The video was released by an online distributor called London Real, who promotes several discredited theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Because it was promoted in advance, social media platforms were able to prepare ahead of the release, whereas they usually scramble to react to misinformation already circulating on their networks. As part of their policy to counter disinformation about the pandemic, Facebook, Twitter and others took steps to limit the spread of the video as son as it was posted, affixing warnings to links users shared. YouTube removed from its service multiple copies of the video, as well as sixteen clips presenting specific sections. Facebook warned users when clicking the original video link, although no steps of blocking were taken. TikTok and Instagram blacklisted the link. Thus, Plandemic: Indoctornation is not as viral as expected. London Real claimed it was seen 1.2 million times by the end of the first day, but the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab calls it \\"a total flop\\", with much lower levels of social media engagement than the shorter version. Because social media were forewarned during the viral season of the first video, the distribution of Plandemic: Indoctornation was more limited. The Daily Dot says that the only platform were it succeeded in were Facebook with 4,000 views, linking to the video on BitChute, with 40,000 views. Observers said that the producers' initial claim of the first video being a trailer for a feature film were seemingly false, that while the second one picks up on some of the same themes and also features Mikovits, it is noted the most of the \\"trailer\\" isn't actually used in the feature-length film. === Reception === Jane Lytvynenko at BuzzFeed gave it \\"0 stars,\\" saying that while the first video presents a protagonist (Mikovits) and a fairly clear narrative, Plandemic: Indoctornation lacks that focus. The video jumps from one topic to the next without establishing clearly how the various pieces of information presented relate to each other, the result being \\"bloated, confused, and filled with nonsense.\\" Mikovits appears only to respond to criticism about elements of the first video. Mike Rothschild of The Daily Dot calls it \\"not as good.\\" == Sinclair Broadcasting Group == In July 2020, Sinclair Broadcasting Group (SBG) scheduled to air an interview with Judy Mikovits and her lawyer Larry Klayman, conducted by Eric Bolling on the America This Week show. During the interview, Mikovits put forth a baseless claim that Fauci created COVID-19 and sent it to China. Bolling did not argue against Mikovits' allegation or fact-check it on-air, although he claimed that he had indeed argued against Mikovits by calling her allegation \\"hefty.\\" SBG distributed the interview to its local stations, and also released the interview online, with an on-screen graphic of \\"Did Dr. Fauci create COVID-19?\\" After media reports regarding the interview emerged, SBG received substantial criticism, resulting in Sinclair delaying the television release of the interview by around a week. == See also == * House of Numbers: Anatomy of an Epidemic, a 2009 film alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS. * The Other Side of AIDS, a 2004 film also alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and that HIV treatments are harmful. * Vaxxed, a 2016 film by discredited anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield, alleging a cover-up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of a purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism. * The Greater Good, a 2011 film also alleging that vaccines cause autism, sponsored by pseudoscientist Joseph Mercola. == Explanatory notes == ==References== Category:Medical-related conspiracy theories Category:2020 YouTube videos Category:Anti-vaccination media Category:Disinformation operations Category:English-language films Category:Fake news Category:Health fraud Category:Misinformation Category:American propaganda films Category:Films about the COVID-19 pandemic Category:YouTube controversies Category:2020 films Category:Conspiracy theories in the United States ","title":"Plandemic"},{"id":"63889000","text":"Rahul Buddhi (born 20 September 1997) is an Indian cricketer.

Texas, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), was a United States Supreme Court decision clarifying that, in order to comply with Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), courts must use legitimate medical diagnostic criteria when diagnosing mental disabilities in those on death row.Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 19. The Court relied on Atkins, which held that the execution of any individual with a mental disability is unconstitutional, in holding that \\"mild levels of intellectual disability ... nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities ... and States may not execute anyone in the entire category of intellectually disabled offenders.\\"Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 15. Internal quotations and citations omitted. == Background == === Case background === On April 25, 1980, Bobby James Moore and two others committed an armed robbery of Birdsall Super Market in Houston, Texas. Upon arrival at the supermarket, Moore and the two others went to a courtesy booth staffed by two employees, James McCarble and Edna Scott. Once Scott realized that an armed robbery was taking place, she started to scream; Moore then shot McCarble in the head, killing the 70 year-old employee.Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), dissent, slip op. at 2. Moore fled the scene and was arrested 10 days later, upon which arrest Moore was charged with capital murder. A jury sentenced Moore to death. For over the next three decades, Moore was situated within the legal system, appealing his decisions. In 2014, the state habeas court committed to a two- day hearing, in which many witnesses‚Äîincluding Moore's family, mental health professionals and a prison official‚Äîspoke. This court then concluded that Moore had shown an intellectual disability, and suggested to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that he be granted relief. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA), as the final arbiter of habeas in Texas, declined to follow the habeas court's suggestions and began its own hearing. In compliance with Atkins, the Court of Criminal Appeals used Texas precedent in determining whether Moore was mentally disabled or not; this precedent was Ex parte Briseno.Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 2. Briseno uses a test of diagnosing mental disabilities, using the following criteria (called \\"The Briseno Factors\\" by the Court): * Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage‚Äîhis family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities‚Äîthink he was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination? * Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive? * Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others? * Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate, regardless of whether it is socially acceptable? * Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject? * Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others‚Äô interests? * Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital offense, did the commission of that offense require forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?Ex parte Briseno, No. 29819-03, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (2004), at 8-9Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 5 n. 5. Using the Briseno factors, the CCA conducted an I.Q. test in 1989, which he scored a 74 I.Q. on. At the time, as Justice Ginsburg notes, the standard error for the I.Q. test was 5 points in both directions, meaning that Moore had an I.Q. range of 69 to 79. In Atkins, the Court noted that an I.Q. score of 70 or lower was generally indicative of an intellectual disability. While noting the low scoring I.Q., the CCA argued that because Moore had displayed general ability to persevere despite his disability - he had been able to be employed in field work, for example - he was able to be executed while not violating Atkins. === Legal background === In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on a 6-3 decision that executing the mentally disabled violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but that states may define intellectual and mental disability on their own. Twelve years later, in Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), the Court narrowed the discretion under which states may designate those on death penalty as intellectually disabled. In Hall, the Court argued that \\"where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test‚Äôs standard error of measurement.\\"Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 10, internal citations omitted. To this end, because Moore had an I.Q. range of 69‚Äì79, he would be included as having a \\"mild mental disability\\". == Decision == In a 5-3 decision, Associate Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, to which Associate Justices Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan joined. Chief Justice Roberts filed a dissent, to which Associate Justices Thomas and Alito joined. The Court held that because Moore had a mild mental disability, executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment, following precedent set by both Hall and Atkins. The Court further held that the Briseno test employed by Texas courts was insufficient and was not applied meaningfully. Because the State often misused Briseno in areas of diagnosing mental disability in education or employment, and because Briseno was based around \\"lay\\" rather than medical diagnosis and understanding of mental disability, that it could not hold up. To this end, the Court held that using the DSM-V was preferable to using an outdated 1992 precedent. In his dissent, Chief Justice Roberts argued that \\"[t]he Court ... crafts a constitutional holding based solely on what it deems to be medical consensus about intellectual disability. But clinicians, not judges, should determine clinical standards; and judges, not clinicians, should determine the content of the Eighth Amendment. Today‚Äôs opinion confuses those roles, and I respectfully dissent.\\"Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 2 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).

In May 1966, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in mainland China. The Ruijin Massacre took place during the nationwide campaign of \\"Cleansing the Class Ranks\\". In August 1968, Cheng Shiqing, then Committee Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of Jiangxi Province, launched the movement of \\"Three Investigations Movement (‰∏âÊü•ËøêÂä®)\\" throughout the province, attempting to find out traitors, spies and counter-revolutionaries. The movement caused the deaths of over 10,000 people in total, including 5,000 who were forced to commit suicide.

The meeting also stressed the need of making some \\"achievements\\" to celebrate the upcoming National Day of the China on October 1. After the meeting, officials in local communes and production brigades began to kill people at will, without any prior need to establish investigative cases, collect evidence, or receive approvals. == The massacre == The Ruijin massacres were conducted by people's communes and production brigades in Ruijin, together with local militia, targeting members of the Five Black Categories as well as their relatives. From September 23 to early October, 1968, over 1,000 people were killed: over 300 people were killed in Ruijin County, around 270 were killed in Xingguo County, and over 500 in Yudu County.

German musicologist, academic teacher, writer and concert singer (baritone). His main field of research was sacred music of the 16th to 20th century. He served as director of the musicology department at the University of Bonn from 1966 to 1991. He became known beyond academia for his editing and supplementing of the eight- volume encyclopaedia, Das Gro√üe Lexikon der Musik. == Life == === Childhood and youth === Massenkeil was born in Wiesbaden as son of Josef Massenkeil (1891‚Äì1987) and his wife Lotte, n√©e B√∂hlen (1901‚Äì1997). His father came from a Rheingau family of teachers. He taught for many years as a student councillor in Wiesbaden and was a senior government and school councillor and finally director of the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Wiesbaden after the Second World War. He had studied classical philology and newspaper science and was active as a writer, especially in the field of the history of County of Nassau. G√ºnter Massenkeil published a reprint of his father's publications in 2009. Josef Massenkeil was a member of parliament for the Zentrum party in the Hessian municipal parliament until its dissolution in 1933. After the war, he was one of the founders of the CDU in Wiesbaden. Massenkeil was the family's third-born child. The first child died in infancy. The second, Heinz Josef (b. 1925), became a gynaecologist and chief physician in M√∂nchengladbach.Holger Hintzen: Heinz Josef Massenkeil aus M√∂nchengladbach : Ein Arzt ‚Äì und vieles mehr Rheinische Post, 27 January 2020 G√ºnther received piano lessons from his father then later at the music seminar Elisabeth G√ºntzel in his hometown, where he became an accomplished pianist, who would also accompany well-known singers such as the tenor Franz Fehringer. In addition, he received organ lessons and, at age 14, was asked by the Wiesbaden church of St. Kilian to replace the organist who had been drafted for military service. In 1941, the priest of St. Birgid in Wiesbaden-Bierstadt entrusted him with setting the patron saint's hymn, which is still sung there today.G√ºnther Massenkeil: Die Lieder, die wir sangen ‚Äì ein Glaubensbekenntnis junger Christen im \\"Dritten Reich\\" (in German) in: Wort und Ton in christlicher Musik, Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh Due to a serious illness, his military service was deferred, and he was able to complete his schooling at the Humanistisches Gymnasium with the Abitur in 1944. He studied at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt to become an organ builder. In early March 1945, he was drafted to the Wehrmacht but was sent to a military hospital in Sigmaringen due to illness. When the war ended, he was imprisoned as a prisoner of war by the French for two years. At his last prison, the \\"D√©p√¥t de prisonniers de guerre 101 Mutzig\\", he founded a choir and organised concerts, and was given the privilege of being able to leave the camp under guard more often and to play the organ in the church services of nearby Soultz-les-Bains. === Music studies === After his release from war captivity, Massenkeil studied musicology and music pedagogy at the University of Mainz from 1947 to 1951. From 1950, he was a member of the Catholic student fraternity . In order to \\"get to know another side of France\\" he applied for a French government scholarship, which took him to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1951/52. In 1952, he achieved his doctorate in Mainz with a thesis on Giacomo Carissimi (The oratorical art in the Latin histories and oratorios of G. Carissimi). He passed the state examination for the artistic teaching profession of music at secondary schools in 1953. In 1954 he became a scientific assistant in Mainz. In 1961, he was habilitated with a paper on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Untersuchungen zum Problem der Symmetrie in der Instrumentalmusik W. A. Mozarts (Investigations on the problem of symmetry in the instrumental music of W. A. Mozart). === Scientific activity === In 1966 he was appointed professor and director of the musicology department at the University of Bonn, and held the position until 1991. From 1972 to 1974, he was also director of the Bonn Beethoven Archive and, from 1972 to 1998, he was chairman of the board of trustees of the Max-Reger-Institute. From 1975 to 2011, he was head of the section for musicology of the G√∂rres Society, and editor of its Kirchenmusikalischen Jahrbuch (Year book of church music). His main field of research was sacred music of the 16th to 20th century. His works on Carissimi and Marc-Antoine Charpentier are well known, as are those on Mozart and his two-volume work, Oratorium und Passion (Oratorio and Passion). He became known beyond academia for the eight-volume encyclopaedia Das Gro√üe Lexikon der Musik, based on Dictionnaire de la musique (1970‚Äì1976) by Marc Honegger, which he edited and supplemented. === Artistic activity === From 1954, Massenkeil was also active as a singer (bass baritone). In 1975 he perfected his singing skills by studying with Ellen Bosenius at the Musikhochschule K√∂ln and gained international recognition as an oratorio and lieder singer, making numerous radio and disks recordings. The Lieder der Rheinromantik um 1840 were also released on CD. Massenkeil ended his career as a concert singer in 1994. === Private life === In 1954, Massenkeil married Ursula Gross (1928‚Äì2000) with whom he had four children. They lived first in Wiesbaden, moving to Mainz in 1960. Massenkeil traveled frequently, especially to France. One of these trips took him back to Soultz-les-Bains and to the organ of his war captivity. It was not until 2005 that he learned that this was a Silbermann organ. He supported an urgently needed restoration with many actions and personal commitment, and was awarded honorary citizenship of Soultz-les-Bains. In 2008 the organ was put back into use in his presence. Massenkeil continued to work as an writer, lecturer and church musician after his retirement. He died in Bad Honnef at the age of 88. == Honours and awards == * 1991: of the Allgemeiner C√§cilien-Verband f√ºr Deutschland * 2006: Ehrenring of the G√∂rres Society * 2006: Knight of the papal Order of St. Gregory the Great * 2011: Honorary citizenship of Soultz-les-Bains in Alsace == Work == * Die oratorische Kunst in den lateinischen Historien und Oratorien Giacomo Carissimis.Die oratorische Kunst in den lateinischen Historien und Oratorien Giacomo Carissimis. on Worldcat 1952, (Mainz, Universit√§t, Dissertation, 1952, typewritten). * Untersuchungen zum Problem der Symmetrie in der Instrumentalmusik W.

He had left the country after the Salvadoran Civil War, a US-backed military conflict, broke out. In an article on Escobar Mej√≠a's death, Graig Graziosi of The Independent reported on the tragic web of violence that surrounded his life, after \\"US-backed death squads terrorized civilians and were accused of raping and murdering American missionaries\\" while using \\"scorched earth\\" tactics contributed to the scattering of civilian populations. Carlos and his sister Rosa Escobedo Mej√≠a fled to the US to live with their older sister Maribel. His status in the US was undocumented. On May 6, 2020, he was reportedly the first immigrant to die from COVID-19 in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the 11th immigrant to die in government custody in the fiscal year. He died at the Paradise Valley Hospital in National City. == Detention == In January 2020, Escobar Mej√≠a was detained by ICE during an arrest of someone who he had been in a car with. ICE stated he was subject to pending removal proceedings. He was then taken to the Otay Mesa prison run by ICE and CoreCivic, a private prison corporation that operates the facility. People who had been detained in the facility had \\"complained about a lack of masks, cleaning supplies, and gloves to guard against the coronavirus\\" as well as being \\"confined to close quarters and unable to distance themselves from other detainees or guards who moved throughout the jail.\\" A group of women at the immigration jail who had demanded masks \\"were threatened with pepper spray.\\" Escobar Mej√≠a spent days vomiting, complained of being in pain, and even stopped eating entirely at a point as part of a hunger strike in protest of the facility's inhumane conditions. Fellow detainee Erik Mercado who knew Escobar Mej√≠a stated, \\"It was all about his sister. He wanted to get home and help her out.\\" Mercado's sisters stated he was a \\"one-of-a-kind person\\" and lamented his loss while asking \\"why is there so much injustice in this world?\\" Despite the rising concerns over the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, Escobar Mej√≠a was denied bond on April 15 by immigration judge Lee O'Connor. He had been living with hypertension, diabetes, and had undergone multiple surgeries, including an operation which had resulted in the loss of his right foot, before being detained. He was reported as \\"still well\\" at the time of being denied bond. His former lawyer Joan Del Valle stated, \\"On April 15, he had the opportunity to have many more years of life. On April 15, when they denied him every possibility to be released in the middle of a pandemic, knowing how frail he was, they sentenced him to die.\\" Escobar Mej√≠a had health conditions that were known, yet was still denied release. Anne Rios, supervising attorney at Al Otro Lodo, a group working to release detainees from the Otay Mesa prison, emphasized \\"this was 100% avoidable. Immigration detention is civil detention ‚Äî it is discretionary. ICE could've determined that this person who had underlying conditions could and should've been released. They had the discretion to do so and yet they chose not to.\\" == Death == On April 24, he was taken to the Paradise Valley Hospital in National City after showing symptoms of the virus and tested positive. He was taken to the hospital's intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator three days later. He reportedly died from acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia resulting from COVID-19 on May 6. On the day of his death, at least 132 ICE detainees at the Otay Mesa prison had tested positive for coronavirus, the most of any detention center used by the agency. At least 705 immigrants in ICE custody have tested positive for the coronavirus total. More than 48% of the 1,460 people who have been screened for the virus tested positive. ==Reactions== Advocacy groups including Pueblo Sin Fronteras and Otay Mesa Detention Resistance decried the conditions leading to Escobar Mej√≠a's death sent a letter to politicians. Senator Kamala Harris stated that Escobar Mej√≠a's death was \\"likely preventable and there needs to be an investigation, and accountability for any wrongdoing.\\" Representative Juan Vargas stated that there was no way ICE was adhering to proper social distancing measures. Senator Dianne Feinstein called for a federal investigation into the conditions at Otay Mesa. Jesse Melgar, a press secretary for California Governor Gavin Newsom, commented that a thorough investigation into Escobar Mej√≠a's death should take place. He also stated that it's necessary for public health officials need to protect people in federal custody. On May 14, 2020, U.S. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jamie Raskin wrote a letter addressing ICE and the United States Department of Homeland Security criticizing their actions and requesting a briefing and documents regarding the death. In June 2020, people detained in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield, California held a hunger strike in protest of the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Oscar Grant, and Tony McDade, the deaths of \\"Carlos Mejia, who died in ICE custody at Otay Mesa, and Choung Woong Ahn, our friend who died in ICE custody at this detention center\\", and the harmful conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in US immigration detention. == See also == *Deaths of Jakelin Caal and Felipe G√≥mez Alonzo == References == Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in California Category:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Prisoners who died in California detention ","title":"Death of Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mej√≠a"},{"id":"63889450","text":"Yannis Vasilis (born Ibrahim Yaylalƒ±) is a former Turkish ultra-nationalist turned Turkish-Greek pacifist, activist, promoting and defending of Greek heritage in Turkey.

Attracting a crowd of tens of thousands, the festival included acts such as Joey Gregorash, Brother (featuring Bill Wallace and Kurt Winter), Burton Cummings, Sugar 'n' Spice, The Fifth, Billy Graham Jazz Group and many others. The festival was organized to raise money for the Lynne Derksen Oxygenator Fund. Lynne Derksen was a student at Canadian Mennonite Bible College who had fallen from a hayride, resulting in life-threatening injuries, and required the use of an oxygenator. The festival, which had no expenses, was organized by Kurt Winter, Vance Masters, and Harold Wiebe, and raised about eight thousand dollars for the fund. Like Woodstock, the Niverville Pop Festival saw heavy rain and large crowds, many of them hippies who came from Winnipeg.

From the 1980s to 1990s, o huigin primarily wrote children's poetry for Black Moss Press. Of his publications, The Ghost Horse of the Mounties won the 1983 Canada Council Children's Literature Prize in English literature and became the first book of poetry to win this award. In 1986, his poem \\"Acid Rain\\" was made into a short film by the National Film Board of Canada. ==Biography== In 1942, John Higgins was born in Brampton, Ontario. He renamed himself, in all lowercase letters, to sean o huigin as a tribute to Padraig O Broin. In the early 1960s, o huigin began using sound poetry while teaching schoolchildren in North America and Great Britain. After he began writing in the late 1970s, o huigin primarily wrote children's poems for Black Moss Press during the 1980s and 1990s. Of his works, o huigin won the 1983 Canada Council Children's Literature Prize in English literature for The Ghost Horse of the Mounties. Upon winning the award, o huigin was the first person to win the Canada Council Children's Literature Prize with a book of poetry. His poem \\"Acid Rain\\" appeared in Scary Poems for Rotten Kids before it was made into a National Film Board of Canada short film in 1986. Scary Poems for Rotten Kids was later republished in 1988 with illustrations by Scott Hughes and John Fraser. The following year, o huigin released a ten poem collection, Monsters He Mumbled, which included two of his previous works from the mid 1980s. His works during the 1990s included King of the Birds in 1992 and A Dozen Million Spills and Other Disasters in 1993. ==Writing styles and themes== In his children's works, o huigin uses short lines of poetry on scary subject matters while sparsely using capital letters and punctuation. With Blink: A Strange Book for Children, o huigin divided his prose into two separate vertical columns to fit with the poem's theme of seeing separate things with each individual eye. For The Ghost House of the Mounties, o huigin based the story on the frightened horses owned by the Northwest Mounted Police during a 1874 Manitoba storm. He also wrote two books about a real-life stray dog called Pickles who lived in Windsor, Ontario. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Canadian male poets Category:Children's poets Category:Living people ","title":"Sean o huigin"},{"id":"63889524","text":"The 1912 Illinois gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1912.

Becker was medical resident of the mission's hospital, carried out more than 3,000 operations and delivered hundreds of babies each year. He was the first in Equatorial Africa to use electric shock therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and his leprosy village attracted specialists from across the world.

His family were Christian and occasionally suffered from poverty. Becker studied at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia and after being awarded his degree established a medical practice in Boyertown. Although Becker's medical practice was flourishing, he volunteered to serve as a missionary for the Africa Inland Mission in 1929. He and his wife, Marie, left for Africa later that year and in 1934 set up their own mission station among the pgymy peoples of the Ituri Rainforest, Belgian Congo. He served as the only medical resident of the Oicha hospital and performed in excess of 3,000 operations there. Becker delivered hundreds of babies each year and was the first doctor in Equatorial Africa to successfully use electric shock therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Becker specialised in the treatment of leprosy and specialists visited from around the world to study his research and observe his leprosy village that treated 4,000 patients. He continued to respond to emergency medical call-outs up to the age of 70. Becker was also an evangelist preacher and used crudely drawn scenes to teach bible stories in the local villages. He was evacuated from Oicha in 1964 during the Simba rebellion but returned the next year to rebuild his mission, which had been badly damaged by guerilla fighters. A biography of Becker was written in 1967 and the American writer Art Buchwald compared him to the great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer and said that Becker had made the greatest impression on him of any man he met in Africa, while one of his African medical trainees said that \\"Many missionaries had preached Jesus Christ to me, but in the munganga [doctor] I have seen Jesus Christ.\\" Becker retired in 1976 and moved back to the United States with his wife.

Politi was born to nobles but fled to become a monk after his parents arranged his marriage when he was seventeen. He spent the next several decades in a mountain cave and would return to the Basilian convent each weekend for the sacraments before he returned to his cave. He was known for his miracles since his childhood and was venerated as a saint after his death despite his reclusive hermitage. He was canonized as a saint on 7 June 1507. ==Life== Nicol√≤ Politi was born in Adrano on 6 September 1117 as the sole child born to aged parents (Almidoro and Alpina) who were nobles. He received a secular and religious education befitting for a noble and was known for his piousness and his desire to often contemplate on the Passion of Jesus Christ. But Politi was drawn to the consecrated life and wanted to live a life for God alone; his parents decided to arrange his marriage when he turned seventeen in order to further bolster their house's fortunes more so since Politi was the last chance for their lineage to continue. It is said that on 1 December 1116 his parents traveled to Alcara li Fusi to participate in the festivities to be held on 6 December to honor Bishop Saint Nicholas; the couple begged for his intercession to have a child and promised to name their child in the saint's honor. In his childhood his teacher Andrea was amazed at how fast he learnt Greek and Latin. But this marriage provoked a crisis in the adolescent since it clashed with his dream to live a life for God. He fled before the planned wedding and decided to enter a convent to become a monk. It is said that an angel helped him flee the night before the wedding and would return when his parents sent guards to search for him at certain times (he was hiding just outside Etna at the time). Politi later encountered the Basilian monk Lorenzo Ravi da Frazzan√≤ who directed him to the convent (the two would become close friends). He became a Basilian monk after entering their Santa Maria del Rogato convent before he decided to take up his hermitage on Mount Calanna. Politi lived a life of severe asceticism and ventured out of his cave each weekend to return to the convent to receive the Eucharist and to make his confession. In 1162 he met with his old friend Lorenzo and showed him his cave; his friend expressed disbelief at Politi's living conditions but the two meditated together on the Passion and dined on herbs and bread. But Lorenzo told Politi that he had a revelation that he would die on 30 December; on that date he knew his friend died when he smelt roses in his cave. Politi became renowned throughout his life for miracles that were recorded since his childhood. These cases include: * The water used to wash him at birth was thrown but a spring would continue to gush water from the spot where it hit the ground. * As a newborn he refused to eat at certain times that began his lifelong fasting habits. * Used the sign of the Cross to repel wolves from attacking sheep. * Once struck a rock with his staff to receive water. * Once encountered the Devil who attempted to tempt him into secular pleasures; Politi rebuked him and forced the Devil to leave when he affirmed his faith and obedience in God. Politi knew his end was near when the angel appeared to him to warn him about his imminent death. The angel appeared after Politi returned to his cave on 12 August 1167 in a state of exhaustion. The angel said that he would die soon after the feast of the Assumption. This allowed for the hermit to go to the convent on 15 August to receive the Eucharist and make his confession for the last time. He died at dawn on 17 August 1167 holding a crucifix. ==Canonization== His reputation for holiness and his miracles led to Pope Julius II canonizing Politi as a saint on 7 June 1507 in Rome. ==References== ==External links== *Santi e Beati Category:1117 births Category:1167 deaths Category:12th-century Christian monks Category:12th-century Italian people Category:12th-century Roman Catholics Category:12th-century venerated Christians Category:Italian hermits Category:Italian nobility Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:Italian saints Category:People from the Province of Catania Category:Roman Catholic monks Category:Sicilian Christian monks Category:Venerated Catholics ","title":"Nicol√≤ Politi"},{"id":"63889653","text":"A rotation government ( memshelet chilufim) is one of the ways of forming of a government in Israel. It is a government that, during its term, will alternately be headed by a Knesset member who formed the government and another Knesset member. In a number of cases, the alternate prime minister will replace the incumbent prime minister, without a need for the government to resign. ==History== A rotation government in Israel practically took place in 1986, when Yitzhak Shamir became prime minister and replaced Shimon Peres, under a non-binding rotation deal. The idea again took hold during the 2019‚Äì20 Israeli political crisis and the negotiations for the forming of the 35th Israeli government after the elections to the 23rd Knesset, and was included in the coalition agreement between the Likud and Blue and White, but was also made binding under broad changes in the Basic Law: The Government: It obviates the need for the resignation of the incumbent prime minister in order to implement the rotation - the incumbent prime minister's term automatically expires when the rotation time comes, and he swaps positions with the alternate prime minister, without the need of forming a new government. In addition, in the rotation government the status of alternate prime minister is stronger than the position of an Acting prime minister in a rotation deal, and various steps by the prime minister requires the approval of the alternate prime minister. ===Other countries=== After the 2020 Irish general election a rotation government was also agreed between Miche√°l Martin (who will serve as Taoiseach until 2022) and Leo Varadkar.Agreement reached on draft programme for government RT√â News, 2020-06-15. In the campaign for the 2020 North Macedonian parliamentary election, the Democratic Union for Integration made its participation in any coalition contingent on the nominee for Prime Minister being an ethnic Albanian, which both the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia and VMRO-DPMNE have refused. On 18 August, the SDSM and DUI announced that they had reached a deal on a coalition government as well as a compromise on the issue of an ethnic Albanian Prime Minister. Under the deal, SDSM leader Zoran Zaev will be installed as Prime Minister, and will serve in that position until no later than 100 days from the next parliamentary elections. At that time, the BDI will propose an ethnic Albanian candidate for Prime Minister, and if both parties agree on the candidate, that candidate will serve out the remaining term until the elections. ==Characteristics== In the rotation government, the alternate prime minister is a member of the Knesset who is designated to serve as prime minister, and also one who served as the incumbent prime minister and then moved in turn to serve as the alternate prime minister. The incumbent prime minister and alternate prime minister are sworn in together. In the following cases, the alternate prime minister will replace the incumbent prime minister: * the termination of the incumbent prime minister's term. * the resignation of the incumbent prime minister. * the passing of the incumbent prime minister. * the passing of 100 days, in which the incumbent prime minister has been incapacitated for health reasons only. * the resignation of the incumbent prime minister from the Knesset. The law stipulates that \\"the number of ministers identified as having an affinity for the prime minister will be equal to the number of ministers who are identified as having an affinity for the alternate prime minister; However, if the number of ministers shall not be equal, the government will establish a voting mechanism according to which the voting power of all the prime minister-affiliated ministers shall be equal to the voting power of all the alternate-prime minister-affiliated ministers, or rules on how decisions will be taken to ensure such a ratio.\\" The alternate-prime minister shall be acting prime minister. Some of the clauses in the Basic Law: The government dealing with the incumbent prime minister will also apply to the alternate prime minister, including Clause 18 (d), which stipulates that the prime minister's term expires upon his conviction in a final judgment on an offense in which he is infamous. The Basic Law stipulates that when the prime minister is convicted as aforesaid, the alternate prime minister will replace him, and when the alternate prime minister is convicted as aforesaid, the government will not be deemed to have resigned. ==Criticism== The changes in the basic law have attracted public and media criticism, arguing that this is changing the Israeli system of government. The signing of the rotation deal aiming at changing basic laws led to the petitioning of the High Court against the agreement that led to changes in the agreement. The petition was rejected on the grounds that \\"it is not yet time\\" to petition against the agreement before the law is passed. Upon passing the law on second and third reading, the petitions were re-filed. ==References== Category:Politics of Israel Category:Israeli governments ","title":"Rotation government"},{"id":"63889666","text":"Chernihiv Philharmony or the Chernihiv Oblast Philharmonic Centre for Festivals and Concerts () is located just few meters from Krasna Square in the center of Chernihiv, Ukraine.

Her parents were Paddy McDaniel, originally from Sligo, and Lizzie (n√©e Wynne). She had three sisters and two brothers. Soon after her birth, the family returned to Sligo and McDaniel grew up in Garavogue Villas, Sligo. She attended the Sisters of Mercy convent school, and after leaving began her career as a singer. ==Career== Along with her sisters, McDaniel was a successful singer at the local feiseanna and in An T√≥stal in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim in the late 1950s. For her first tour of England, her father booked her gigs at Irish clubs across the country, with the show business impresario George O'Reilly becoming her manager after that initial tour. It was O'Reilly that combined McDaniel with the Fendermen as a backing group, and suggested she take on a country-and-western style. This included wearing a cowgirl outfit, complete with fringed jacket, swing skirt and calf-length white boots. In this new format, the group was an instant success, getting booking five nights a week at pubs, hotels, local festivals, dancehalls, town halls, and temperance halls across Ireland. McDaniel was among the first women artists to have single records, recording with Fontana Records, at first pop ballads and later covers of country singers, as well as local songs. In 1961 she released her first single on Beltona Records, Forty shades of green with the B-side Lovely Armoy, and later the single Christmastide in Ireland with the B-side The old pigsty. Other recordings she made were successful through sales and on the radio with Blackboard of my heart, Roomful of roses, and This song is just for you. She made regular appearances on Radio √âireann programmes, in particular with Maureen Potter. She was a frequent guest on RT√â up until 1964, appearing on Curtain up and Showband show. She went on to present her own programme, Jamboree, the first Irish female country singer to have her own show on television. She also appeared on Ulster Television, and the 1963 Christmas special on Welsh television. In June 1963, she was the guest of honour at the Jim Reeves concert in Sligo. The same year, she was voted number one female singer in Ireland by the readership of the magazine Spotlight. At the peak of her popularity in late 1964, O'Reilly paired her with the up-and-coming band, the Nevada Showband, and planned an intensive tour of the dancehall circuit. On 21 January 1965, after just a few weeks of touring, McDaniel was seriously injured in a car crash near Kells, County Meath on her way to a performance. She had to spend a number of weeks in hospital, and underwent a series of major operations to reconstruct a shattered hipbone over the course of a few years. Eileen Kelley took her place with the Nevada Showband. She also missed out on the Irish heat of the Eurovision Song Contest 1965, as well as a tour of France and Germany. McDaniel had just started to walk again, when she married Fintan Stanley on 22 May 1965. Stanley was an accordion player, who played at clubs and cabaret when the couple moved to England. When she had recovered further, McDaniel joined her husband in cabaret, with O'Reilly convincing them to return to Ireland in 1969. She returned to RT√â television appearing on Hootenanny, and her husband formed the Ramblers, later the Nashville Ramblers. Success was short-lived, and having suffered a number of miscarriages, McDaniel left the band returning to Sligo to recover. The couple bought land, including the house associated with W. B. Yeats, Drumcliffe Rectory. They played locally in clubs and concerts and had one daughter, Lisa, in 1973. The marriage was in difficulties, with her husband moving to Massachusetts, United States in 1976 where he obtained a divorce. ==Later life and death== McDaniel developed alcoholism, leading to a three-week hospitalisation. She joined Alcoholics Anonymous, recovering enough to get a job at a Sligo factory. She had to give up her job two years later because of her damaged hip and involvement in another car accident. The Land Commission compulsorily purchased 15 acres of land McDaniel owned with Stanley in 1970 at Rathcormac, County Sligo, and they sold Drumcliffe in 1977. McDaniel was refused a marriage annulment which led to her not being able to remarry in a church. She lived with her partner, Frank Duskey, leading to the local priest refusing to take her confession. McDaniel and Duskey had issues involving planning control breaches. The couple lived in a mobile home in a field McDaniel owned near Rathcormac, and later Duskey was fined for running a welding business from this site. McDaniel recorded an anthology record of her hits in 1985, but it was not a success. She died suddenly on 28 June 2008 at her home in Yeats Drive, Cranmore, Sligo, where she lived with her partner of 20 years, Tommy McGowan. In 2009, her daughter Lisa Stanley recorded an album of her mother's hits. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2008 deaths Category:20th-century Irish singers Category:20th-century Irish women Category:Irish female singers Category:People from County Sligo Category:20th-century women singers ","title":"Maisie McDaniel"},{"id":"63889689","text":"Venabygd Church is a cross church from 1780 with a tower in the center of the crossChurch Search in Lillehammer municipality, Innlandet county. ==History== The oldest church in this area was built sometime before 1580.

It, created from the cadets of the Mikhailovsky and Konstantinovsky artillery schools, subsequently served as the basis for the Artillery General Markov brigade. With the beginning of the First Kuban Campaign in the village of Olginskaya, the Volunteer Army was reorganized by converting small detachments into larger units. Among the newly formed was the Combined Officer Regiment, which later received the nominal patronage of its first commander, General Markov. During the campaign, the future artillery of the Markovites was also reorganized: the 1st Separate Light Artillery Division was disbanded, and the 1st Officer Battery, which was part of it, after the 4th Battery of the division was included in it, was called the 1st Separate Battery as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade.

The company specialized in the design and manufacture of fiberglass sailboats and became one of the largest producers of sailboats in the United States. The company was founded by Ted Irwin (b.1940-d.2015) in 1966 and went through a succession of bankruptcies and subsequent name changes, before finally closing in 1992. The company produced more than 6,000 boats. Ted Irwin was a competitive sailboat racer, but the company built many of their boats specifically for the cruising market. Many designs were aimed at the Caribbean yacht charter market, including the Irwin 42, 52 and 65. ==History== Irwin was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1940 and developed a passion for sailing at an early age. He built his own Moth and went on to sail it to win the class North American and world championships. He served in the US Coast Guard and also worked for Charley Morgan at Morgan Yachts as a draftsman, illustrator and boat builder. He commenced his first design, the Voodoo in 1963, a boat that took six months to complete. He raced the boat from 1964 to 1966 and won 24 of the 28 races that he competed in. Irwin founded his own company, Irwin Yacht & Marine Corporation, in 1966. He ran the company and was also the chief designer. The first design produced was the Irwin 27, in 1967. To control costs, Irwin bought his supplies in large lots and also owned his factory and the land it was located upon, as well as the production tooling. He also produced everything possible in-house, from the boats' masts, right down to the marketing brochures. The company started out with a factory, but expanded to and employed more than 200 people at its peak. Typical of his cruising boats was the Irwin 41, a blue-water cruiser introduced in 1982.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 364-365. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. In the 1980s, Irwin designed a series of racing boats, all named Razzle Dazzle, that he raced in the Southern Ocean Racing Conference (SORC) in Florida. His 1982 Razzle Dazzle was sold after winning the SORC that year, but the design was the basis for the Irwin 41 Citation, of which four boats were completed. Many years he sold his winning boats, which fetched high prices, using the funds and lessons learned to design better boats for subsequent years. Irwin encouraged other builders, even when they became competitors. In 1974 he traded the molds for the 1970 model Irwin 32 in exchange for a small number of shares in the fledgling Endeavour Yacht Corporation to get founders John Brooks and Rob Valdes started in the boat building business. The company built more cruising sailboats with a length overall of greater than than any other company worldwide, with more than 300 of the Irwin 52, 54, 65 and 68 models completed. Irwin yachts closed in 1992 for the final time. Ted Irwin died in Little Rock, Arkansas on 5 February 2015, from multiple myeloma, at age 74. == Boats == Summary of boats built by Irwin Yachts: *Irwin 27 - 1967 *Irwin 23 - 1968 *Irwin 24 - 1968 *Irwin 31 - 1968 *Irwin 25 - 1969 *Irwin 28 - 1970 *Irwin 32 - 1970 *Irwin 38-1 - 1970 *Irwin 45 - 1970 *Irwin 37-1 - 1971 *Irwin 43 (1971) - 1971 *Irwin 30 Competition - 1972 *Irwin 32.5 - 1972 *Irwin 37 1 Ton - 1972 *Irwin 37 Competition - 1973 *Irwin 28 Mk III - 1974 *Irwin 33 - 1974 *Irwin 10/4 - 1975 *Irwin Avanti 42 - 1975 *Irwin 1/2 Ton - 1976 *Irwin 28 Mk IV - 1976 *Irwin 3/4 Ton - 1976 *Irwin 30 - 1976 *Irwin 33 Mk II - 1976 *Irwin 37-2 - 1976 *Irwin 37-3 - 1976 *Irwin 42 - 1976 *Irwin 52 - 1976 *Irwin 1/2 Ton Mk II - 1977 *Irwin 30 Citation - 1977 *Irwin 37-4 - 1977 *Irwin 40 Citation - 1978 *Irwin Mini-Ton - 1978 *Irwin 34 Citation - 1979 *Irwin 39 Citation - 1979 *Irwin 21 Free Spirit - 1980 *Irwin 46 - 1980 *Irwin 65/68 - 1981 *Irwin 34 - 1982 *Irwin 37-5 -1982 *Irwin 41 - 1982 *Irwin 41 Citation - 1982 *Irwin 52-2 - 1982 *Irwin 31 Citation - 1983 *Irwin 38-2 - 1984 *Irwin 43-CC Mk I - 1984 *Irwin 32 Citation - 1985 *Irwin 43-CC Mk II - 1985 *Irwin 35 Citation - 1986 *Irwin 38 Citation - 1986 *Irwin 43-CC Mk III - 1986 *Irwin 44 - 1987 *Irwin 52-3 - 1987 *Irwin 54 - 1988 ==See also== *List of sailboat designers and manufacturers ==References== Category:Defunct sailboat manufacturers Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1966 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1992 Category:American companies established in 1966 Category:American companies disestablished in 1992 Category:1966 establishments in Florida ","title":"Irwin Yachts"},{"id":"63889797","text":"Henry Fyodorovich Khudyakov (or Ghenrik, Russian: –ì–µ–Ω—Ä–∏—Ö –•—É–¥—è–∫–æ–≤ , 5 December 1930, Chelyabinsk, Russia ‚Äì 10 January 2019, Jersey City, New Jersey) was a Russian-American painter and Poet. He completed high school in Moscow in 1948 and graduated from Leningrad University with a degree in Philology in 1959. He wrote poetry in Soviet Russia as part of the Samizdat movement, creating poems that were both visually and audibly artistic. Henry emigrated to New York City in 1974, where he shifted his creative expression to mixed media on canvas, clothing and other objects. Henry Khudyakov‚Äôs works are part of the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), Center Pompidou in Paris and others. He spent his later years living in Jersey City, New Jersey where he died on January 10, 2019. == Early life == Henry Khudyakov's father worked at a national security sensitive enterprise and his mother was a literature teacher. As a child he showed interest in literature and began writing poetry. He read books on theosophy and anthroposophy and developed an interest in Gnosticism. Henry Khudyakov embarked on a career as an artist in 1959 when as a final year student at the Department of Philology of the Leningrad University he worked on developing theoretical grounding for his visual search as part of his poetic experimentation. After graduating, Khudyakov returned to Moscow where he worked as an art historian at the All- Union Traveling Poster Exhibition. == Poetry and the Samizdat Movement == \\"Winter Morning\\" in Henry Khudyakov's style Katsaveiki 2 In the 1960s Henry Khudyakov released self-published books with poems under the pseudonym Aftograf: * Cats ‚ÄîBears * Third One in addition to the Redundant * Katsaveiki * By Twos of All Flesh * A book with poems in Japanese style titled \\"Haiku\\" Cut off from official publication channels, his handwritten and typewritten books existed as part of the self-publishing movement, samizdat, outside the Soviet printed media, thus using a social ban as an opportunity for creative action. Henry Khudyakov became known in Moscow not only for his poetry, but also for the interpretation of his own work, a new ‚Äúmorphological‚Äù translation of Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù and his highly eccentric behavior. He held exhibitions of his visually innovative poetry in the studios of various Moscow artists as early as the mid-1950s. \\"Koshki-Mishki ili zhe Tretii K Lishnim\\" (Kitty-bears or the Third to the Odd Ball, 1963), one of his early books was typed on carbon paper in ten copies, accompanied by a manifesto and handwritten commentary and copyrighted by his own publishing company. Khudyakov did not own a typewriter, as it was very difficult to obtain one in the Soviet Union, and had to type the book at a secret Moscow aviation institute where he worked as a translator, until he was caught and fired. The book mainly consisted of visual poems, representing a new interpretation of Russian morphology. One of his handwritten books, Katsaveiki (Shot Fur-trimmed Jackets), was reprinted in facsimile in the international edition of SMS, No. 3 by William Copley in 1968. Henry Khudyakov created a new, visual style of poetry to better express the sharp, chaotic peaks of emotion he tried to convey in his poetry -- as he describes in an interview with Victor Tupitsyn: V.T. When did you first begin to use visual imagery? H.K. In fact, from the very beginning: even the poems written in columns are the direct result of a visual approach to the word. Once in 1962 when I wanted to transcribe into a notebook some rhymes an fragments of lines which were scattered over various bits of paper, it turned out that all this looked different than I expected. It turned out that I had substituted wishful thinking for reality: when written in a ‚Äúline,‚Äù the purely verbal composition looked naive, and I sensed this once I had come in contact not just with the ‚Äúideal,‚Äù i.e., the abstract- semantic side of the matter, but with the material side: the paper, ink, letter symbols, etc. Soon I began to love the words around the paper in order to achieve the best layout. Eight months were spend on this, in the course of which I created a system for writing down my things.‚Äúhenry khudyakov,‚Äù interview with Victor Tupitsyn, A-YA (Elancourt) no. 4 (1982):21. The translation in A-YA has been adapted and corrected in several places. As it turns out, the interview has been somewhat altered by A-YA and the original version was subsequently published by Tupitsyn in his collection ‚ÄúDrugoe‚Äù iskusstvo. Besedy s khudozhnikami, kritikami, filosofami: 1980-1995 gg. (Moscow Ad Marginem, 1997), pp. 91-98 == Emigrating to U.S.A. == In 1974, the artist emigrated to the United States where he continued to work in the fields of visual art and experimental poetry, combining various art forms. Although he favored brightly colored painting, collage, and clothing design, these often contain verbal elements, such as his favorite, the ubiquitous logo ‚ÄúI [love] N.Y.‚Äù where the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù is replaced by a heart symbol. The atmosphere of the New York art scene of the 1970s, which was dominated by the East Village movements, naturally provided a basis for Khudyakov‚Äôs further evolution as an artist. The East Village art scene, which brought together beatniks, performance artists, musicians, members of the Fluxus community, as well as gave birth to such celebrities as Jeff Koons, Keith Haring and Jean- Michel Basquiat, in many ways resonated with Henry Khudyakov. During this period, the artist‚Äôs tools were enriched by \\"found objects\\" from the streets of New York. He used them to produce his neckties, shoes, jackets, and shirts which acted as manifestos of his \\"ideal\\" world. Acquiring a new skin, made of badges, bottle caps, foil, adhesive tape, stickers, rhinestones, straws, sponges and toys, he would turn mundane objects into precious artifacts, offering new authenticity and new vision. Henry Khudyakov would sometimes spend 20 years finishing a piece. He would record every addition on the back of the canvas focusing more on the artistic process rather than the finished product. 221x221px 220x220px Amerika, Mixed media on canvas (1982-1994) Front and Back == Exhibitions == * Contemporary Russian Art Center of America directed by Norton Dodge (1982) * Nakhamkin Gallery (1991, New York) * Fine Arts Museum of Long Island (1989, Hempstead, New York) * Tabakman Museum of Contemporary Russian Art (1996, Hudson, New York) * Black and White Gallery, The Last Brainstorm (2015) * Hirschl & Adler Galleries represented Henry Khudyakov at the Outsider Art Fairs in Paris (2015) and New York (2016). * Kollektsia!

He worked as a carpenter from the age of fourteen and continued working as a carpenter until he was twenty. He joined the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (better known as the Komsomol) in 1920. He had three children with his first wife Vera Vasilievna; Victor (b. 1928), Rosa (b. 1929) and Galina (b. 1938). He attended the Sverdlov Communist University from 1932 to 1935. == Political and military career == Kupriyanov served in the Red Army from 1925 to 1927. He also briefly served in the Soviet Army from 1939 to 1940 during the Winter War. With the outbreak of World War II, Kupriyanov joined the Military Council of the 7th Army on June 30, 1941. He also became a member of the Military Council of the Karelian Front on August 23, 1941. He was awarded the rank of Division commander on October 1, 1942. Not to long after, Kupriyanov was awarded the rank of Major general. After the liberation of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944, a few members of the command of the Karelian Front (including General Terenty Shytkov) proposed to deport the indigenous population of the Karelo-Finnish SSR to Siberia and the Kazakh SSR and liquidate the republic. However the mass deportation of the Karelo- Finnish did not happen. Some historians credit Kupriyanov for preventing the mass deportation. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1926, but worked as a social science teacher at Solgalich Secondary School from 1927 to 1929. He became the Head of the Department of Public Education of the Solgalich District Executive Committee in 1929 and remained in the position until 1931. He served as the Head of the Department of Propaganda and Agitation of the Solgalich District Committee of the Communist Party from 1931 to 1932. After returning from university in 1935, Kupriyanov served as the Head of the School Department of the Dzerzhinsky District Committee of the Communist Party. He served as the First Secretary of the Kuybyshevsky District Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1938 in Leningrad. Kupriyanov was elected as the First Secretary of the Karelian Regional Committee of the Communist Party in June 1938 on the recommendation of Andrei Zhdanov to Stalin. As a regional committee's First Secretary, Kupriyanov became part of the NKVD troika in September 1938. During the Winter War, he ordered the construction of the 132 kilometer-long Petrozavodsk- Shuezersk railway; the railway was built in 46 days. With the formation of the Karelo-Finnish SSR in 1940, he became the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic on April 2, 1940. He was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) during the 18th Party Congress. Gennady Kupriyanov and his family were evacuated to Novosibirsk in August 1941 due to World War II. He was removed from his post on January 25, 1950 due to the Leningrad Affair. == Leningrad Affair == Kupriyanov soon became involved in the Leningrad Affair, he was accused of \\"failure to fulfill plans in industry and agriculture, patronage of workers who had compromised themselves, clampdown and lack of collegiality in work\\" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish SSR. He was removed from his post as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish SSR on January 25, 1950. === Arrest and Imprisonment === On March 15, 1950, Kupriyanov was arrested and transferred to Moscow. He was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison two days later. In October 1950, the investigation regarding Kupriyanov was finished and he was sentenced to capital punishment. However, Kupriyanov's execution was postponed due to Stalin's rejection of Malenkov's demand for execution. On January 17, 1952, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced Kupriyanov to 25 years of forced labor with confiscation of all property under Article 58. He was soon sent to the Intalag, but his sentence was changed in July 1952 to imprisonment. On August 18, his sentence was changed to 10 years of imprisonment without confiscation of property. His wife, Vera Vasilievna was sentenced to imprisonment for \\"not informing the authorities about her husband's sabotage\\". Kupriyanov's eldest son and daughter were exiled to Taraz, Kazakh SSR. After the death of Joseph Stalin in the spring of 1953, Kupriyanov's family was allowed to return to Leningrad. === Rehabilitation === Kupriyanov was pardoned on January 18, 1956 by a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. His criminal record was cleared as well. He was rehabilitated on July 31, 1957 which reinstated his Communist Party membership, his military rank of Major general, and his awards. He was also an assigned a personal pension. He lived in Leningrad until his death in 1979. == Death == Kupriyanov died on February 28, 1979.

About 34 were built. ==Design and development== The Phaeton was designed for the sports pilot rather than for commercial use but was able to carry two passengers. It was an equal span, single bay biplane with interchangeable upper and lower wings joined by N-form interplane struts. Shorter N-struts from the upper fuselage provided a central cabane. The wings were strongly staggered by about half chord They were built around twin spars, with plywood covering from the forward spar forming a torsion-resistant D-box. There were externally interconnected slotted ailerons on both wings. The first batch of eight Phaetons, produced in 1929, had Wright R-540 Whirlwind five cylinder radial engines in the nose with cylinders exposed for cooling. Behind the engine mounting the fuselage was a chrome-molybdenum steel tube structure with fabric covering. The passengers sat side by side in an open cockpit midway over the lower wing, with the pilot well behind the upper trailing edge. Dual controls could be rapidly fitted in the forward cockpit. Its blunted tip, triangular tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and was in-flight adjustable, with rounded rectangular elevators separated by a gap for rudder movement. The tailplane was strut-braced to a low, ground-adjustable fin with a curved leading edge that carried a blunted rectangular, balanced rudder. The Phaeton's fixed, split axle undercarriage was conventional with wheels on V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. long, specially made Rosco ring type shock absorber legs reached from the wheels to the upper longerons. The Phaeton's engine mountings were designed to accept a variety of engines including the newer nine cylinder, Wright R-790 Whirlwind and the old but cheap, water-cooled Hispano A and B. In 1929 one clipped-wing Phaeton was tested as a racer, then fitted with nine cylinder R-790 Whirlwind engine. Piloted by Jack Foster, this competed in the 1930 National Air Races, resulting in the sale of another 24 similarly-powered, though full span, Phaetons.

It is located at 220 Winton Road South in Rochester, New York, U.S. The congregation it houses is a member of the Unitarian Universalist Association. The building was described in 1982 as one of \\"the most significant works of religious architecture of this century\\" by Paul Goldberger, a Pulitzer-Prize-winning architectural critic. Its exterior is characterized by deeply folded brick walls created by a series of thin, two-story light hoods that shield windows from direct sunlight. The sanctuary's complex ceiling has light towers in each corner to bring in indirect natural light. The story of the design process that Kahn followed at First Unitarian has been described as \\"almost classic in architectural history and theory\\". Kahn began by creating what he called a Form drawing to represent the essence of what he intended to build. He drew a square to represent the sanctuary, and around the square he drew concentric circles to indicate an ambulatory, a corridor, and the church school. In the center he placed a question mark to represent his understanding that, in his words, \\"the form realization of Unitarian activity was bound around that which is Question. Question eternal of why anything.\\" == Background == The congregation of First Unitarian Church of Rochester voted in January 1959 to sell its existing building in downtown in Rochester, New York with the understanding that they could continue to occupy it until July 1961. Construction activity by the developers who bought it, however, soon weakened the building, forcing the congregation to move in September, 1959. The church held Sunday services at the a temporary location until a new building could be constructed. First Unitarian's previous building was architecturally significant, having been designed by Richard Upjohn, a prominent nineteenth-century architect and the first president of the American Institute of Architects. The church decided to replace it with a building designed \\"by a leading 20th century architect, giving the community a notable example of contemporary architecture.\\" == Choosing an architect == The search committee, formed of church members who were knowledgeable about architecture, decided to focus on prominent architects who had established relatively small offices and did most of the creative work themselves. They contacted six architects. Frank Lloyd Wright expressed little interest and his fees were high. (Wright died shortly afterward at the age of 91.) Eero Saarinen was considered but was unable to take the job because of his time constraints. The committee also met with Paul Rudolph, Walter Gropius, and Carl Koch. They spent a day with Louis Kahn in May 1959 and were impressed by his philosophical approach, the atmosphere in his office, the assurance that he would personally be in charge of the design, his respect for the integrity of materials, and the perception that his architecture, while modern, had an emotional depth and a connection to the past. Robin B. Williams, writing in Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture, says Kahn appealed to them also because of \\"the high compatibility of his philosophy with Unitarian ideas\\". Robert McCarter, one of Kahn's biographers, notes parallels between Kahn's ideas and those in the Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a transcendalist who was an important figure in Unitarian history. Committee members said they were convinced that Kahn was \\"a natural Unitarian.\\" Kahn, who came from a non-observant Jewish background, was spiritual in a way that been described as \\"pan-religious\\" by Carter Wiseman, one of his biographers. When working on projects in India and Bangladesh, for example, he developed an affinity with the spirituality he found there. Kahn's architecture reflected his spirituality. David Rineheart, who worked for Kahn, said, \\"for Lou, every building was a temple. Salk was a temple for science. Dhaka was a temple for government. Exeter was a temple for learning.\\" Kahn's social and political outlook also was compatible with that of the Rochester congregation and its history of concern with social issues. During the Great Depression Kahn worked with labor unions and civic agencies to design inexpensive housing. He worked as assistant architect on the Jersey Homesteads, a project to resettle Jewish garment workers from New York City and Philadelphia to a kibbutz-like rural collective that combined farming and manufacturing. During the presidential election of 1948, Kahn worked with the third-party campaign of Henry A. Wallace, who ran on the Progressive Party ticket. Kahn gave a philosophical presentation of his ideas to a congregational meeting in June 1959, after which the church commissioned him to design their new building. During that same visit Kahn helped choose the site to be purchased for the new building. The church hired Kahn just as his career was entering a new stage that would bring him increased attention. Later that year Kahn was chosen to design the Salk Institute, and in 1962 he was selected to design the National Assembly complex for what would become the capital of the new nation of Bangladesh. == Design process == Sanctuary of First Unitarian Church of Rochester The story of the design process at First Unitarian, including Kahn's creation of what he called a Form drawing, \\"is almost classic in architectural history and theory\\" according to Katrine Lotz, a professor at the School of Architecture of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Kahn's approach was to design each building as if it were the first of its kind. August Komendant, a structural engineer who worked closely with Kahn, said that during the initial design stages Kahn wrestled with questions like \\"How would one design a Unitarian Church? What is the Unitarian religion?\\" and studied Unitarianism thoroughly. The result sometimes confounded expectations. When the completed First Unitarian Church was shown at an architectural exhibition in the Soviet Union, the mayor of Leningrad commented that it did not look like a church. (Kahn jokingly responded, \\"That's why it was chosen for exhibition in the Soviet Union.\\") The church's building committee provided Kahn with information from questionnaires filled out by church members to indicate what they desired from their new building. These questionnaires went beyond normal fact-gathering about functional requirements to include aspects of the Unitarian faith that the building should express. Among other things, they said, the new building should be supportive of the broader community and should express \\"the dignity rather than the depravity of man.\\" The congregation's broad approach to the statement of requirements was similar to Kahn's philosophical approach to architectural design. Kahn explained this approach in Form and Design, an article he wrote while working on this project. Using the First Unitarian Church of Rochester as an example, Kahn said, \\"A great building, in my opinion, must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must be unmeasurable ... But what is unmeasurable is the psychic spirit.\\" Kahn associated the unmeasurable with what he called Form, saying that, \\"Form is not design, not a shape, not a dimension. It is not a material thing.\\" \\"Form ... characterizes a harmony of spaces good for a certain activity of man.\\" When Kahn addressed the congregational meeting that voted to hire him, he explained his approach by creating what he called a Form drawing, which, he said, was not to be understood as an architectural design. He drew a square that represented the sanctuary, and around the square he placed concentric circles representing an ambulatory, a corridor and the church school. In the center of the square he placed a question mark that, he explained on another occasion, represented his understanding that \\"the form realization of Unitarian activity was bound around that which is Question. Question eternal of why anything.\\" Kahn delivered his first design in December 1959, proposing a square building three stories high with four-story towers in each corner. The sanctuary was a square area in the middle of a large twelve- sided room at the center of the building. The remainder of the near-circular room was an ambulatory space that was to be screened from the sanctuary. Kahn said, \\"The ambulatory I felt necessary because the Unitarian Church is made up of people who have had previous beliefs ... So I drew the ambulatory to respect the fact that what is being said or what is felt in a sanctuary was not necessarily something you have to participate in. And so you could walk and feel free to walk away from what is being said.\\" Kahn had developed the idea for this type of ambulatory prior to his work on First Unitarian, referring to it during a talk in 1957 in the context of a university chapel. The central room was to be capped by a complex dome and encircled by a corridor outside its walls that would provide connections to the three-story church school on the periphery of the building. Pupils in the school would be able to observe church services from open spaces above. Prompted by complaints about the cost, which was several times the amount that had been budgeted, Kahn quickly dropped one story from the proposed building. The committee, however, was also unhappy with other aspects of the design, such as its inflexibility and shortage of useful classroom space, the irregularly shaped rooms on the periphery created by the placement of a large, near-circular room within a square building, and the potential for services to be disturbed by children listening above and by people drifting in and out of the sanctuary. In February 1960, Helen Williams, the chair of the building committee, wrote to Kahn saying \\"we are not in any measure happy with the present concept which you have given us,\\" and a week later she wrote, \\"We remain steadfast in the conclusion that we must have an entirely new concept\\". Stating that \\"Kahn has failed us miserably\\", Williams resigned in frustration from the building committee shortly afterward. Kahn agreed to create a new design, much to the relief of the building committee, who feared that he would demand payment for work performed and walk away from the commission. For his new design Kahn proposed a building that was loosely elongated rather than rigidly square. He resisted suggestions to place classrooms in a separate wing to reduce the potential for services to be disturbed by boisterous children, retaining the concept of surrounding the sanctuary with the church school. Kahn eliminated the ambulatory space inside the sanctuary walls but retained the corridor just outside to provide access to the classrooms. This PhD dissertation has useful images from the design process, including the Form diagram. Sanctuary, with choir loft, ceiling structure, and light towers The roof over the sanctuary was one of the last aspects of the design to be completed. One option would have been to span the sanctuary with a steel frame, but Kahn had decided in the early 1950s that he would no longer use such structures, preferring the more monumental appearance he could achieve with materials like concrete and brick. Not entirely satisfied with the roof design he had developed, Kahn asked August Komendant for suggestions. Komendant, his most important collaborator, was a structural engineer and a pioneer in the use of pre- stressed concrete, which can be used to create lighter and more graceful structures than regular concrete. Komendant kept Kahn's general layout of the roof but redesigned it as a folded-plate structure of pre-stressed concrete that would require support only at its edges, eliminating the need for the massive concrete beams that Kahn had been planning to use as supports for the roof structure. During the design process, Kahn and the church developed a relationship of close collaboration. The congregation sometimes contributed to the process at a detailed level. One member built a scale model of the building and used it to conduct photometric studies of light levels in the proposed sanctuary. This link is to Chapter 3, \\"Preliminaries,\\" of Fleming's PhD thesis. The remainder of the thesis is at http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24826 Kahn initially planned to bring natural light into the sanctuary through light slits in an array of concrete caps on the roof, but the building committee calculated that each cap would weigh 33 tons (30,000 kg), creating problems of support. The light towers in Kahn's final design are glazed only on their inner sides, a suggestion that originated with the committee. The committee notified Kahn that their calculations of acoustical resonance in the proposed light shafts indicated the possibility of problems in that area. The new design was overwhelmingly approved by the congregation in August 1960. At the dedication of the new building in December 1962, Kahn talked about the relationship between architecture and religion. Komendant said, \\"He told me that in his speech he described the cathedrals, whose size and height was intended to show God's greatness and might and man's lowness, so that men would be frightened and obey His laws. For this church he used atmosphere and beauty to create respect and understanding for God's aims, kindness, and forgiveness.\\" == Exterior == The exterior of the building is characterized by deeply folded brick walls created by a series of thin, two-story light hoods that help shield windows from direct sunlight. Between the light hoods on the ground floor are projections of the building that enclose bench seats in the interior. Small windows on each side of the bench seats allow additional indirect light into the rooms. These projections impart a dual character to the light hoods, giving the upper part of each the appearance of an object, a light hood, and the lower part the appearance of a void, the space between two projections. The light hoods create a series of shadows on the exterior wall that are reminiscent of a row of columns, their vertical lines adding to the impression of height. The main entrance to the building is not visible to people passing by on the street. Light towers in each of the four corners of the sanctuary rise above the building's outer walls, making the shape of the sanctuary easy to visualize from outside. The impression that Kahn created of the sanctuary imbedded within the larger building is similar to the \\"box within a box\\" approach he used in several other buildings, notably the Phillips Exeter Academy Library. Northwest corner of First Unitarian The building echoes the design of the Scottish castles that fascinated Kahn, particularly Comlongon Castle, whose floor plan is reproduced in two different scholarly discussions of First Unitarian. Comlongon Castle has a single large room in its center surrounded by walls that are thick. Those unusually thick walls made it possible to carve entire secondary rooms from within them, in effect making them inhabited walls. In the case of First Unitarian, the large central room is the sanctuary, and the \\"inhabited walls\\" can be perceived as the surrounding two floors of rooms. The windows of these rooms are recessed so deeply as to be unnoticed when viewed from an angle, and the building's indented corners spaces are windowless, all of which adds to the perception that the sanctuary is surrounded by massive, rugged walls. In Kahn's words, \\"the school became the walls which surrounded the question.\\" The church hired Kahn in 1964 to design an addition, which was completed in 1969. Its exterior is relatively unarticulated, in contrast to the sculpted walls of the original building. Built on a slope, it has two main floors and a lower level at its easternmost end, with complex windows on the two main floors. The building's footprint is . According to scale drawings, the irregularly-shaped building is approximately at its longest and widest points. Of that length, approximately the easternmost is the 1969 addition. == Interior == Instead of a grand entrance at the front of the building leading straight into the sanctuary, entry into First Unitarian is by way of a doorway at the side of the building that requires a right turn past other spaces to reach the sanctuary. The sanctuary is entered beneath the low ceiling of the cantilevered choir loft, creating a sequence from shadow into light. First floor plan. The 1969 addition begins at the left edge of the lobby. The north side of the building is at the bottom. The street is to the right. \\"Civilization is measured by the shape of your ceiling,\\" said Kahn. The complex ceiling of the sanctuary rises above both floors of surrounding rooms and extends over the sanctuary wall to the outer walls of the corridor outside. Light towers in the four corners of the sanctuary bring in indirect natural light from areas that are not typically well lit. The ceiling's layered outer edges and light-filled corners give the room \\"an expansive, boundless character\\", according to Kahn biographer Robert McCarter. Kahn said, \\"If you think about it, you realize that you don't say the same thing in a small room as you do in a large room.\\" Between the light towers is a cruciform concrete roof structure with a shape something like the underside of a ship's hull. Its outer edges do not sit directly on the sanctuary walls but rise above them, relieving what could be a perception of oppressive weightiness, according to Carter Wiseman, one of Kahn's biographers. The massive ceiling structure is partly supported by twelve slender columns embedded in the sanctuary walls, three columns per wall. Square brackets on top of the central column in each wall support the lower folds of the slab. The brackets are split in the middle to allow the fold to be perceived as passing through to the outer corridor walls, which provide much of the ceiling support. Each central column is braced to the columns on either side by horizontal beams. The ceiling is lowest and darkest in the center, the opposite of classic church domes that are highest and brightest in the center. The cruciform shape that Kahn used for the ceiling is one that he had used in previous works, notably the Jewish Community Center of Trenton, New Jersey. The tapestries on the sanctuary walls were designed by Kahn and, like the building itself, contain no literal symbolism. They were woven by Jack Lenor Larsen. At Kahn's request, the panels span the full color spectrum and yet were constructed entirely from one red, one blue, and one yellow yarn, with the remaining shades created with blends of those three yarns. The panels were designed not only for visual effect but also to correct a problem of sound reverberating from the concrete walls. The primary building materials of the interior are concrete block, poured concrete and wood. Kahn left the natural surfaces of these materials exposed rather than applying an additional finish. This was Kahn's first extensive use of concrete and wood together, a combination he used in most of his later projects. The sanctuary walls are thick and are built of concrete blocks. Hollow spaces within the walls function as ventilation ducts. The roof support columns embedded in the sanctuary walls are made of poured concrete, as is the roof and the outer walls of the corridor around the sanctuary. Left visible are patterns made by the thin strips of wood that composed the forms into which the concrete was poured. Kahn procured unusually long strips of wood to construct the forms for the sanctuary ceiling. As he had done earlier with the main stairwell in the Yale University Art Gallery, Kahn also left visible the pattern of circular holes created by the devices that held the forms together while concrete was being poured for the walls, letting the marks of construction serve as the \\"basis for ornament\\". Sherri Geldin, writing of Kahn in the prologue to Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture, said: \\"He attached almost mythic significance to the 'meeting place,' to any setting where communal interaction occurs ... His religious buildings and projects ... aspire to evoke a state of grace that is without dogma or sectarian distinctions, underscoring instead that which is universal and transcendent.\\" During the initial design discussions, Kahn asked Komendant, \\"What is most important in a church?\\" and then answered that question himself by saying \\"the essence of atmosphere for a church is silence and light. Light and Silence!\\" Silence and Light later became the name of an essay that Kahn wrote in 1968 in which he explained concepts crucial to his philosophy. Robert Twombly, an editor of Kahn's writings, said that by silence, Kahn meant \\"the desire ... of every person to create, which for Kahn was the same thing as being alive ... To the silence of humanity's innate urge to create comes the sun's life-supporting power, giving to silence the ability to act.\\" Architectural historian Vincent Scully said of the church, \\"You can really feel the silence he talked about, thrumming as with the presence of divinity, when the cinder block is washed silver by the light that floods down upon it, while the heavy, heavy slab is lifted overhead.\\" In the classrooms, bench seats with small side windows are placed in projections of the outer walls. These spaces create the impression of little rooms carved from the outer walls, and, according to Robert McCarter, they continue Kahn's architectural theme of the classrooms themselves appearing as rooms imbedded within thick, castle-like walls. In the 1969 addition, the rectangular gallery on the first floor is designed so that it can be used either as an extension of the lobby or separated into smaller rooms by massive doors. Church offices are located on both sides of the gallery. The second floor has a loose arrangement of spaces that can be combined into a large room or used separately. The two main floors of the addition have fireplaces at the end nearest the sanctuary and large windows at the far end that reveal the natural world outside. == Monumentality and authenticity == Sarah Williams Goldhagen, author of Louis Kahn's Situated Modernism, says that Kahn was troubled by the socially corrosive aspects of modern society. He believed, in her words, that \\"architecture must foster people's ethical formation. People who are anchored in their community, morally obligated and psychologically connected to the people surrounding them, make for better citizens.\\" Because his social agenda was compatible with Unitarian ideals, he was in a good position to manifest his vision of community in architectural form at the Rochester church. According to Goldhagen, Kahn used two architectural approaches to situate his buildings' users both in society and in themselves. One is monumentality, which anchors people socially and promotes a feeling of community. The other is authenticity, which fosters self-awareness and promotes individual responsibility. Kahn's first major essay as sole author, published in 1944, was called \\"Monumentality,\\" a concept he defined as \\"a spiritual quality inherent in a structure which conveys the feeling of its eternity\\". Sonit Bafna says that in the early 1950s Kahn \\"had begun to develop a distinctive approach to architecture. An overriding concern for him from this period on was to instill a sense of permanence into his buildings, so that his work could match the dignity and poise of the ruins he had seen in Italy and southern Europe.\\" Goldhagen says that Kahn used monumentality to strengthen the sense of community among those who used his buildings: the massiveness of a Kahn building instills the feeling that both the building and the institution it houses will last for a very long time. At First Unitarian, says Goldhagen, the column-like rhythms of light that Kahn sculpted across the facade are among the devices that increase the impression of massiveness and give the building an air of monumentality. Secondly, according to Goldhagen, Kahn strove for \\"an architecture of authenticity.\\" Authenticity is a concept popularized by the existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who, in Goldhagen's words, believed that \\"To live authentically, one has to strive for a heightened awareness not only of oneself but also of one's place in a specific historical moment and place. This requires acute perception of one's social and physical environment, which is difficult because a person tends to apprehend the objects and buildings that surround her as instruments\\". Authenticity encourages people to focus \\"not on the instrumentality of the everyday world but rather on an object's shape, texture, and materiality.\\" In contrast to other modern architects like Mies van der Rohe, Kahn shunned \\"the diaphanous and the transparent so that he could press the viewer up against materiality, substance and weight.\\" Goldhagen notes that \\"It is all but impossible to enter one of Kahn's buildings and not to notice it, not to inspect it or look intently at it.\\" Kahn strove for an aesthetic of authenticity at First Unitarian, says Goldhagen, by designing with a blunt honesty of materials and by laying bare the process of construction. Kahn said, \\"I believe in frank architecture. A building is a struggle, not a miracle, and the architect should acknowledge this.\\" Kahn had partially achieved these two aspirations in earlier works, according to Goldhagen. The Yale University Art Gallery, for example, with its emphasis on process over finish, promotes authenticity, situating people in themselves, while the Richards Medical Research Laboratories were designed to reinforce group cooperation. Goldhagen says that it was with First Unitarian that Kahn first succeeded in situating his building's users both in themselves and in society, an agenda that he was later able to develop more fully at the Salk Institute and National Assembly Complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which had much larger budgets. == Importance to Kahn's career == According to Goldhagen, the First Unitarian Church of Rochester was \\"the first building Kahn built that gave an indication of his mature style\\". Vincent Scully, in his Modern Architecture and Other Essays, similarly says \\"the experience of designing the church at Rochester seems to have brought Kahn to a confident maturity and confirmed him in his method of design.\\" Kahn worked primarily for institutions that advanced the public good, including schools, museums, research institutes, government bodies, and religious organizations. Goldhagen says that at First Unitarian Kahn developed a philosophy for creating architecture for such organizations: \\"Kahn's philosophy of the 'architecture of institutions,' developed while designing the First Unitarian Church in Rochester, stipulated that the architect's first and highest duty was to develop an idealized vision of an institution's 'way of life' and then to give that vision form‚Äîor, as he would have put it, Form.\\" Robin B. Williams, writing in Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture, says the design approach that Kahn followed at First Unitarian, particularly the introduction of his Form drawing, was important to the development of his process for transforming an intangible architectural idea into an actual building: > Kahn made his enthusiasm for the First Unitarian Church evident even before > it received final approval from the building committee. As early as October > 1960, in a lecture in California, he had chosen it to illustrate a pair of > terms‚Äî\\"form\\" and \\"design\\"‚Äîthat were becoming key tenets of his philosophy. > He used these words to describe his conception of architecture‚Äîand in > particular his design procedure‚Äîas the translation of the intangible into > the real. It was at this time that Kahn mythologized the way the design of > the church had evolved, composing an account (accompanied by the now-famous > diagram) that, since its publication in April 1961, has been seen as the > clearest illustration of his design approach. Kahn worked on this lecture for several months and published it as an essay called Form and Design. A colleague described it as the best embodiment of his ideas at that time and said that when people requested examples of Kahn's publications, he most often sent this essay. == Recognition == *Paul Goldberger, Pulitzer-Prize-winning architectural critic for The New York Times, described the First Unitarian Church of Rochester in 1982 as one of \\"the greatest religious structures of this century\\" along with Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, France, by Le Corbusier; Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, by Frank Lloyd Wright; and the Christian Science Church in Berkeley, California, by Bernard Maybeck. *The First Unitarian Church of Rochester is used as a case study in Artist's Work/Artist's Voice: Louis I.

Salas is an American medical doctor who is Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the Yerby Fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Salas leads efforts to make physicians and hospitals become more active in their response to climate change. == Early life and education == In 2004, Salas was in the first group of students to be accepted by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine in its inaugural year. She was awarded a Master's of Science in Clinical Research at Case Western Reserve University. After graduating, Salas joined the University of Cincinnati where she specialised in emergency medicine. Sales started a fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2013. As part of her fellowship she attended a lecture on climate change, where she first heard that climate change would be the next public health emergency. Up until that point she had never considered that climate change would impact her patients. This lecture made her reconsider her career, shifting her research focus to climate change and its impact on public health. She eventually earned a master's degree in public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. == Research and career == When asked about the impact of climate change on the medical system, Salas remarked, \\"...A climate lens must be added to every aspect of our practice. Speaking as an emergency medicine physician, that includes everything from ambulance and triage protocols to the screening tools we use. It also impacts how we treat patients, the discharge instructions we provide, and the follow-up plans\\". She started to identify evidence of climate change inside her clinic, including heat stress and air pollution problems. During a heat wave in 2018 the power failed at Mount Auburn Hospital, forcing firefighters to move patients from the hot rooms at the top of the building. Despite the clear risks that global warming presents to human health, in a survey conducted by the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations, it was revealed that only 16% of medical schools included climate change on their curriculum. She founded the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine special interest group in Climate Change and Health Interest Group. In 2015 Salas was awarded a wilderness medicine fellowship and worked as a physician for the Himalayan Rescue Association in the Everest base camp. She was one of very few medical doctors in the vicinity when the 2016 Imphal earthquake struck Nepal, and worked to save the lives of the Sherpas and adventurers. In 2018 Salas was appointed a Burke Fellow. She was the 2018 US lead for The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change. In February 2020 Salas started an effort to make clinicians and hospitals to take on a more active role in responding to climate change. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Salas became concerned that the United States was unprepared for both coronavirus disease and climate change. She wrote an opinion article for The BMJ calling for the lessons learned from the pandemic to become a blueprint for the climate crisis. == Selected publications == * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American women academics Category:American women physicians Category:Women physicians Category:Coronavirus researchers Category:Emergency medicine Category:Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine alumni Category:Harvard School of Public Health alumni ","title":"Renee Salas"},{"id":"63890010","text":"Nahuel Pereyra (born 18 December 1991) is an Argentinean footballer who now plays for Estudiantes de Buenos Aires in his home country.Firm√≥ Nahuel Pereyra Club Atl√©tico Estudiantes ==Career== Pereyra started his senior career with Club Atl√©tico Brown.

He is the founder of the Sea Ranger Service and was named European Young Leader in 2020. ==Early life== Van der Werf grew up in Utrecht, The Netherlands, and was a nature enthusiast from a young age. Being installed by the local mayor of Nieuwegein as a youth ranger in 1992, he started his conservation career at the age of 9. Initial work activities included bird counting and forestry work. ==Environmental activism== From the age of 15, Van der Werf became involved in environmental activism and later moved to the UK where he worked with groups such as the Climate Camp and The Mischief Makers, the art-activist collective which he co- founded in 2004. He served with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society on multiple Antarctica expeditions before founding the marine conservation NGO The Black Fish, as part of which he led numerous investigations into illegal fishing around the Mediterranean Sea. Van der Werf has since distanced himself from direct activism, instead pursuing a social entrepreneurial approach to ocean conservation. ==Sea Ranger Service== Van der Werf founded the Sea Ranger Service in 2016 as a social enterprise which trains young people as Sea Rangers and deploys special sailing work ships to carry out marine management tasks in direct cooperation with governments. Sea Ranger tasks include maritime surveillance, wildlife monitoring, underwater photography and surveys, sea water sampling, restoration of underwater seagrass meadows and general offshore inspections tasks but excludes any enforcement activities. The current operational area for the Sea Rangers is the North Sea yet the Sea Ranger Service has announced plans to scale its approach internationally, through a social franchising model which it has developed in collaboration with PwC and IKEA. In May 2019 the Sea Ranger Service was awarded the Medal of Honour by the Enkhuizen Maritime College and the Dutch Commercial Sailing Board for operating the first commercial sailing vessel in the offshore industry . ==Conservation philosophy== Van der Werf has stated the inspiration for the Sea Ranger Service has originated from the Civilian Conservation Corps, a programme launched by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 to alleviate poverty and unemployment during the Great Depression whilst simultaneously carrying out large scale landscape restoration and conservation work. The Sea Ranger Service follows a similar approach for ocean conservation. It trains young people (partly long-term unemployed youth) with the help of veterans as Sea Rangers. After their one-year deployment as Sea Rangers, in which they carry out conservation tasks at sea, the Sea Rangers transition into maritime employment. Van der Werf advocates extensively on the benefits of social approaches to conservation and has gathered growing political support for his work. In December 2018 four Dutch government ministers signed the Green Deal Sea Ranger Service to improve environmental conservation of the North Sea through social pilots run by the Sea Ranger Service. ==Personal life== Van der Werf lives in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

On the basketball court, he was a two-time All-State selection, District 23-3A Most Valuable Player and named of the top 15 basketball players in Texas. During his freshman year, former NFL player Frank Middleton, who was an assistant coach, convinced him to join the football team. Arnold ended up becoming an All-State selection at cornerback, in addition to earning District Offensive MVP honors as a quarterback and wide receiver. He was a three-star prospect and committed to Baylor. ==College career== Arnold had nine tackles in a win against Boise State in the 2016 Cactus Bowl. As a freshman at Baylor in 2016, Arnold started four of 11 games and tallied 20 tackles and four pass breakups. His sophomore season was hampered due to a broken arm which forced him to miss several games. He finished the season with 35 tackles, seven pass break ups and an interception. As a junior in 2018, Arnold also suffered an ankle injury which ended the season after four games, forcing him to redshirt. He was named Big 12 Special Teams player of the week in week two of the 2019 season. In 2019, Arnold ranked second in the Big 12 with six interceptions, and also recorded 46 total tackles, 2.5 tackles for a loss and two pass breakups.

These dispersal barriers can be physical, climatic, or biological and can include bodies of water or ice, land features like mountains, climate zones, or competition between species. Biotic interchange has been documented to occur in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. == Causes == The general cause of a biotic interchange is the disappearance of a barrier that had been previously blocking the dispersal of species from two distinct biotas. The disappearance of a barrier could be from the closing of a sea, connecting two previously unconnected continents; the melting of glaciers, allowing for migration across newly exposed areas that had been covered by ice;from sea level change, covering a land bridge would allow for marine interchange, while revealing a land bridge would allow for terrestrial interchange; and, it could also be from changing ocean currents, allowing for larval dispersal to new territories. dispersal barrier. Humans have also become a vector of biotic interchange. They have fragmented species habitat by blocking interchange in some regions. Yet, humans have also intentionally and unintentionally spread many non-native species around the globe. Climate change may also be impacting the effectiveness of natural dispersal barriers. == Effects == Sometimes an interchange can result in the extinction of some species. These species may go extinct due to the introduction of a predator that they are not adapted to, or due to more successful competition by invading species. However, invading species can coexist with native species for millions of years after an invasion. Sometimes invading species can also improve biodiversity by increasing genetic diversity. Another effect of biotic interchange is homogenization. This occurs when many invading species from both biotas become established, creating one similar biota. == Asymmetry == Many of the biotic interchanges studied have shown an asymmetry in the sharing of species between two biotas. Typically there is a donator biota and a recipient biota, with the donator biota sharing more species than the recipient biota. As an example, when the Suez Canal connected the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea, most new species in the Mediterranean originated in the Red Sea (91 molluscs, 15 crabs, and 41 fish). Fewer species travelled from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea (3 molluscs, 0 crabs, and 6 fish). Invading species from the donator biota are often only a small percent of the potential invaders available within that biota. That is to say, that not all species that could invade another biota do invade. For example, only about 4.3% of the total fish species in the Red Sea have actually invaded the Mediterranean. === Hypotheses === There are many hypothesis that attempt to explain the asymmetry and general processes involved in biotic interchange: * The null hypothesis suggests that the number of species invading a recipient biota should be proportional to the number of species available in the donator biota. However, comparisons of many biotic interchanges reveal that this is not true. * The hypothesis of ecological opportunity suggests that the number of species invading a recipient biota should be proportional to the number of species that go extinct in the recipient biota. * The biogeographic superiority hypothesis suggests that over time the species in one region would evolve superiority over species in a different region, and would thus be better at invading. * The universal trade off hypothesis suggests that species with similar life habits separated for long periods of geologic time may still be able to coexist if brought back together due to the presence of similar evolutionary pressures affecting their past adaptation to their surroundings. == Past == This map shows the Bering land bridge that allowed for the hypothesized invasion of humans from Asia into North America. It also shows the reestablishment of the Bering Strait after the glaciation, allowing for the interchange of marine organisms between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. During the Trans-Arctic Interchange (, Early Pliocene) sea levels rose, submerging the Bering Strait, and allowing marine organisms from the North Pacific and North Atlantic/Arctic Ocean to come into contact with each other. During the Great American Interchange (, Pliocene) tectonic forces pushed North and South America together, allowing for the formation of the Panamanian land bridge linking the two continents together. This event has been extensively studied. The Indian Subcontinent and Mainland Asia Interchange (Eocene) was the collision of the Indian Plate with mainland Asia allowing for biotic interchange mainly from mainland Asia onto the Indian subcontinent. Bering Land Bridge Interchange (late Cenozoic) was an interchange between Asian and North American land species across the Bering land bridge. The African and Eurasian Interchange (, early Miocene) occurred between Africa and Eurasia through the Middle East after the Tethys sea closed. == Present == The Trans-Suez Interchange is a human-induced biotic interchange between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea due to the construction of the Suez canal. Another human-induced biotic interchange, the Japan‚ÄìNorth American Interchange, is between marine species off the coast of Japan and North America. These species are transported as larvae in ships' ballast. The Panama Canal Interchange between the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans through the Panama Canal.

Over time it received some $21 million of venture capital funding. Parallel Computers was part of a wave of technology companies that were based in that area during the 1980s, the Santa Cruz Operation being the most well-known of them. Parallel Computers was also one of a number of new companies focusing on fault-tolerant solutions that were inspired by the success of Tandem Computers. Other such companies included Stratus Computer, Tolerant Systems, Sequoia Systems, Synapse Computer, Auragen Systems, No Halt Computers, Corinthian Systems, Enmasse, and Computer Consoles Inc. Parallel Computers made systems that featured redundant hardware elements from processors and storage to power supplies, and that self-detected error situations. Their systems fit into the supermicrocomputer to minicomputer ranges in size. The difficulties of building fault-tolerant systems were considerable, however, including the unsuitability of Unix in that era for that purpose, and Parallel Systems like the other new companies in the space severely underestimated the engineering tasks involved. Significant product delays resulted as a consequence, as did layoffs, and Parallel Computers changed its chief executive during 1984. By 1986 Parallel had some $6 million in annual sales and employed 40 people. However it had made fewer than a hundred sales, and one industry analyst surmised that the small business marketplace Parallel was targeting was often not sophisticated enough to recognize the value of fault-tolerant solutions. Moreover, the company's sales force was too small to scale up and its manufacturing capabilities were limited. Parallel had OEM agreements with the likes of Scientific Games Corporation, and used resellers in the United Kingdom such as Systime Computers Ltd, but sales were few through these channels as well. Accordingly, Parallel's management decided the company was not viable on its own, and Parallel Computers was sold to General Automation in 1987, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary. It was then sold again in 1988, to the British computer manufacturing firm Integrated Micro Products (IMP), following disappointing sales of the Parallel product. Following that, the Parallel Computers production facility in Los Gatos, California was shut down and all manufacturing was moved to the north of England. IMP, by then focusing on telecommunications equipment, was eventually acquired by Sun Microsystems in March 1996 for $96 million. ==References== Category:Defunct computer companies based in California Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Companies based in Santa Cruz, California Category:American companies established in 1983 Category:Computer companies established in 1983 Category:Technology companies established in 1983 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1983 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1988 Category:1983 establishments in California Category:1988 disestablishments in California Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"Parallel Computers, Inc."},{"id":"63890438","text":"Cr√©mines-Zoo railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Cr√©mines, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

In his native Cuba, Echemendia was a two-time Senior National medalist, a U23 National champion and a five-time Age-Group National champion (two titles as a junior and three as a cadet). Since his arrival to the US, he has won the Fargo Junior Nationals in both, freestyle and Greco- Roman and an AIA state title in folkstyle. He is an incoming freshman at 141 pounds for the Ohio State Buckeyes. == Early life and career in Cuba == Echemend√≠a was born in Cabaig√∫an in Cuba. He started training gymnastics when he was 4 years old but ended up leaving the sport at the age of 8, following his father and brother‚Äôs steps to start wrestling instead. He attended and won his first Cadet National Tournament at the age of 12 in 2012 and won two more titles (13' and 14') before bumping up to the junior division. Despite a runner-up finish at the 15' Junior Nationals, Echemendia racked up the 16' title and in 2017 he placed at the Senior Nationals, won a U23 National title and also claimed his last age-group National championship. In 2018, he reached the finals of the Senior National Tournament and then while preparing for the Junior Nationals and Pan-Ams with the Cuban Junior Pan American team in Guatemala, Echemend√≠a defected from Cuba, sneaking away from his coaches and teammates to cross Guatemala, Belize and Mexico and finally get to the United States late in the year. == Folkstyle == === High School === When Echemend√≠a arrived to Tucson, Arizona in late 2018, he was able to attend Sunnyside High School as a senior for one semester with the help of one of his Cuban coaches' friend Fernando Villaescusa. He started competing in folkstyle shortly after the arrival and dominated on his way to a Division II state title at 152 pounds compiling an unbeaten record of 26 wins and no losses. He graduated as a 2018-19 student. === College === After he won the Freestyle Junior Nationals in 2019, a lot of Division I coaches started reaching him out. In September, he announced that he had committed to the Iowa State Cyclones. However, it was later reported that he hadn't signed an NLI and a whirlwind recruitment started after that. He then visited Ohio State University, Arizona State University and finally University of Iowa. He ended up officially committing to the Ohio State Buckeyes.  2020-21  Freshman: Echemend√≠a is expected to compete at 141 pounds in this upcoming season. == Freestyle career == === Youth Level ===  2019  In April, he competed at the junior level US Open at 65 kilograms. He defeated two opponents on points before injury defaulting out of the tournament. While it is not confirmed why he did so, Echemend√≠a affirms that he was kicked out due to legal issues with his ID and that it had nothing to do with his health. A few weeks later, Echemend√≠a participated and won the AZ freestyle tournament, which qualified him for the USA Wrestling Nationals (Fargo). In July, he completely dominated Fargo in both international styles at 145 pounds. In freestyle, he won by technical fall in his first five matches and won by points in the semis and finals, claiming the championship. In Greco-Roman, he teched everyone on his way to the quarterfinals, where he won by points and same in the semifinals. In the finals, he once again teched his opponent to crown himself as a National double-champion. This huge accomplishment made him a sensation across the United States. In October, he competed at 65 kilograms and faced three-time MSHSAA champion Josh Saunders at Who's Number One.

It is located just east of its Downtown Spokane and is home to a number of higher education institutions and their surrounding neighborhoods. It is approximately bounded by Sharp Avenue to the north, the Spokane River and the SR-290 spur to the east, Interstate 90 to the south, and the Division Street/Browne Street couplet to the west. The district is primarily home to Gonzaga University, Washington State University's Health Sciences Spokane campus, and the Spokane campus of Eastern Washington University. Other institutions, such as the Community Colleges of Spokane, Whitworth University, and the University of Washington also have branch operations in the University District. ==History== Though now also referred to as a local area in Spokane, the University District was created as a 770-acre tax-increment financing district to promote and support land, economic, and educational development at the universities that lie within the district and the areas that surround them. ==Areas== The University District spans across parts of four Spokane neighborhoods Riverside, East Central, Logan, and Emerson/Garfield and comprises three main areas. ===Gonzaga University=== The northern portion of the University District is home to Gonzaga University. ===WSU Health Sciences Spokane campus, formerly Riverpoint Campus=== The middle portions of the University District are home to Washington State University Spokane, Eastern Washington University Spokane, and various other academic institutions. The campus was originally established in 1990 as the Riverpoint Higher Education Park, later renamed the Riverpoint Campus. ===South University District=== The south portion of the University District is a target development area for academic expansion, housing, and other business incubators. The South University District is situated along Sprague Avenue and is connected to the WSU Health Sciences Spokane campus via the University District Gateway Bridge, a pedestrian and bicycle-only cable-stayed suspension bridge that opened in December 2018. ==Initiatives== ===Smart city=== The University District is home to a smart city initiative named Urbanova, which is the first smart city project of its kind in the State of Washington. The project was launched in 2016 by founding partners Avista Utilities, Itron, Washington State University, McKinstry, the University District Development Association, and the City of Spokane. Additional partners include Gallup and Verizon. Current projects include smart and connected street lights and a shared energy economy model. The project also has support from Washington State University's Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture, based at WSU's main Pullman campus, to develop a framework that can monitor, predict, and control energy usage and air quality, and also record the resulting health impacts, in the University District. The shared energy economy model pilot received a $7 million grant from the Washington Department of Commerce's Clean Energy Fund to study also distributed energy by creating a microgrid of solar arrays, battery storage, and building energy management systems. ==References== ==External links== * University District Category:Spokane, Washington ","title":"University District (Spokane, Washington)"},{"id":"63890577","text":"Ali Akbar is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Dinajpur-4. ==Career== Ahmed was elected to parliament from Dinajpur-4 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973. ==References== Category:Awami League politicians Category:Living people Category:1st Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ali Akbar (Bangladeshi politician)"},{"id":"63890594","text":"European army or EU army are terms for a hypothetical army of the European Union which would supersede the Common Security and Defence Policy and would go beyond the proposed European Defence Union. Currently, there is no such army, and defence is a matter for the member states. ==Background== The idea of a European army was first discussed in 1950. It was proposed by France and would have consisted of the \\"Inner Six\\" countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany), in order to strengthen defence against the Soviet threat without directly rearming Germany in the wake of World War II. In 1952 the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community was signed but not ratified by the signatories. However, during the Cold War, Western Europe relied on NATO for defence, precluding the development of European cooperation. Immediately after the \\"fall of communism\\", the defence apparatus was preoccupied by NATO expansion into the former Soviet bloc. The idea of a European army gained popularity after the September 11 attacks and NATO's involvement in conflicts outside of Europe. In a phenomenon dubbed diversification of European security, NATO has come to be responsible for \\"hard\\" threats while the European Union has taken a greater role in \\"soft\\" threats, including peacekeeping in the western Balkans. The 2007 Treaty of Lisbon also has furthered defence integration within the EU. This has led to support for a European Defence Union, which would be a step higher in collaboration than the current Common Security and Defence Policy. In 2019, Germany and the Netherlands activated 414 Tank Battalion, the first that included soldiers from two EU countries. The battalion was created because Germany did not have enough soldiers, while the Netherlands lacked tank capability. This was described as a step towards a European army. The Franco- German Brigade in Alsace has been less successful due to greater linguistic and cultural differences. Under the current arrangement, there is no EU army and defence is reserved for the member states. ==Characteristics== The term \\"European army\\" is vague and it is not entirely clear what it would entail. Increasing integration would make security more efficient and less expensive for member states. ==Support and opposition== French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have both expressed their support for a joint European army. Macron endorsed the idea in 2018, after the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and in light of American President Donald Trump's scepticism of Atlanticism. Other European politicians who have expressed support include former French prime minister Alain Jupp√© (in 1996), former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, former Czech prime ministers Milo≈° Zeman and Bohuslav Sobotka, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. European army is on the official programme of the European People‚Äôs Party. Dutch deputy prime minister Kajsa Ollongren supports the idea while defence minister Ank Bijleveld opposes it. Donald Trump, who criticized Macron's endorsement as \\"insulting\\", and Nigel Farage both criticized proposals to create a European army. It is also opposed by Eurosceptic politicians in the EU, such as Ryszard Legutko. NATO has been described as the \\"biggest obstacle\\" to a European army. According to NATO officials, the alliance has discouraged independent European defence capabilities, both as an attempt to avoid duplication and as a moral hazard effect from US defence subsidies prompting less military spending by European countries. The United States ambassador to NATO also expressed opposition to any European protectionism in developing its own defence industry. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the European Union could not defend itself without NATO and should not try to form a European army. A 2019 survey found that 37% of Dutch citizens \\"approved the idea of a European army\\" while 30% are opposed to formation of an army of all EU members. ==See also== *Permanent Structured Cooperation *European Defence Agency *414 Tank Battalion ==References== Category:Military of the European Union Category:Proposals in Europe ","title":"European army"},{"id":"63890609","text":"This is a list of people with the given name Stephen or Steven: ==Saints== * Saint Stephen (died c. 35), with the title of Protomartyr (lit. \\"first martyr\\") due to his distinct fate among the early Christians * Stephen, one of the pair of Christian saints and martyrs Socrates and Stephen * Stephen the Younger (ca. 715‚Äì765), Byzantine iconodule martyr * Stephen I of Hungary (c. 965‚Äì1038), canonized in 1083 * Stephen of Obazine (1085‚Äì1154), Cistercian, first Abbot of Obazine Abbey, France * Stephen Harding (died 1134), English, one of the founders of the Cistercian Order; Catholic saint * Stephen III of Moldavia or Stephen the Great and Holy (c. 1432‚Äì1504) ==Royalty== * Stephen, Prefect of Amalfi (died 898) * Stephen of Armenia (died 1165), marshal, son of Leo I * Stephen √Åkos, influential baron in the Kingdom of Hungary in the late 13th century and the early 14th century * King Stephen of England or Stephen of Blois (c. 1096‚Äì1154), grandson of William the Conqueror * Stephen I of Hungary (c. 965‚Äì1038), Grand Prince of the Magyars, first king of Hungary * Stephen II of Hungary (1101‚Äì1131), elder son of King Coloman * Stephen III of Hungary (1147‚Äì1172), eldest son of King Geza II * Stephen IV of Hungary (c.1133‚Äì1165), third son of King B√©la II * Stephen V of Hungary (1239‚Äì1272), elder son of King B√©la IV * Stephen, Count Palatine of Simmern-Zweibr√ºcken (1385‚Äì1459), son of King Rupert of Germany * Stephen I of Moldavia (1394‚Äì1399), son of Costea * Stephen II of Moldavia (died 1447), prince, son of Alexandru cel Bun * Stephen III of Moldavia or Stephen the Great and Holy (c.1432‚Äì1504), son of Bogdan II * Stephen B√°thory of Poland (1533‚Äì1586), prince of Transylvania, king consort of Poland, grand duke consort of Lithuania * Stephen Uro≈° I of Serbia (died 1277), son of Stefan Nemanjiƒá * Stjepan Dr≈æislav of Croatia (died 997), king 969‚Äì997 * Stjepan I of Croatia (died 1058), king 1030‚Äì1058 * Stjepan II of Croatia (died 1091), king 1089‚Äì1091, last member of the Trpimiroviƒá dynasty * Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria (died after 1343), tsar 1330‚Äì1331 * Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá of Bosnia (died 1463), last sovereign from the Bosnian Kotromaniƒá dynasty ==Church figures (Stephen or Stephanus)== * Pope Stephen I (died 257), Bishop of Rome 254‚Äì257 * Pope- elect Stephen (died 752), elected Pope but died before being ordained * Pope Stephen II (died 757), pope 752‚Äì757 * Pope Stephen III (720‚Äì772), pope 768‚Äì772 * Pope Stephen IV (died 817), pope 816‚Äì817 * Pope Stephen V (died 891), pope 885‚Äì891 * Pope Stephen VI (died 897), pope 896‚Äì897 * Pope Stephen VII (died 931), pope 929‚Äì931 * Pope Stephen VIII (died 942), German, pope 939‚Äì942 * Pope Stephen IX (c. 1020‚Äì1058), pope 1057‚Äì1058 * Esteban, bishop of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zaragoza, Spain, 1128 to 1130 * Ecumenical Patriarch Stephen I of Constantinople (867‚Äì893), patriarch 886 to 893 * Ecumenical Patriarch Stephen II of Constantinople, from Amasea, patriarch 925 to 928 * Stephanus I, Archbishop of Aquileia, Italy, c. 515 * Stephanus II, Patriarch of Grado, Italy, c. 670 *Bishop Stephanos, bishop of Malankara eparchy of USA and Canada == Others == * Stephen (son of Kalomaria) (fl. 886‚Äì921), a relative of Empress Theodora and a high-ranking courtier in the Byzantine court * Stephen, pen name of Dom Orejudos (1933‚Äì1991), American erotic artist, dancer, and choreographer * Stephanus of Byzantium, 6th century author of Ethnica, a geographical dictionary * Stephanus, a pupil of Pasiteles ( 33 BCE), sculptor in the time of Caesar Augustus === A === * Stephen Adekolu (born 1989), Canadian football player * Stephen Amell (born 1981), Canadian actor * Steven \\"Steve\\" Angello (born 1982), Greek-Swedish DJ, record producer, remixer and record label owner, also a member of electronic music band Swedish House Mafia * Steven \\"Steve\\" Aoki (born 1977), Japanese musician, DJ, remixer and record producer * Stephen Arigbabu (born 1972), German basketball coach and former player * Stephen F.

Serving as the head coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team since 1988, he is the longest active tenured coach in men's lacrosse at the Division I level. ==Personal life== Corrigan was born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1958 to an athletic family; his father, Gene Corrigan, and three brothers are all former lacrosse players and coaches. His cousins Lee and Booker Corrigan are also involved in the sport; Lee was the head coach of the Maryland Roughriders and Booker works as an announcer for ESPN. Corrigan and his wife have three children together; including a son who played lacrosse for Notre Dame under Corrigan's guidance before becoming an assistant coach at Washington and Lee University. ==Career== ===Playing career=== Corrigan played high school lacrosse at Western Albemarle High School before attending the University of Virginia. While playing as a midfielder for three seasons, he recorded five goals and six assists. ===Coaching career=== Upon graduating from the University of Virginia, Corrigan was hired to coach his high school's lacrosse team before accepting an assistant coaching position with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team. Following his one-year stint, he agreed to coach the NCAA Division III lacrosse team at Randolph‚ÄìMacon College. He returned to his alma mater under head coach Jim Adams before accepting a promotion to Head Coach at the University of Notre Dame. In his first few years at Notre Dame, the team played a mostly NCAA Division III schedule and lacked funding. Therefore, he recruited graduate assistants to work as security guards and the team travelled solely by bus. During his first season as Head coach, he led the team to a 6‚Äì7 record. In spite of their lack of success, every senior player during Corrigan's tenure at Notre Dame has graduated. By 1990, Corrigan's Notre Dame program earned their first United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) national ranking and invitation to the NCAA Championship. Through the mid 1990s, Corrigan's Notre Dame program had moved up to the NCAA Division I level and competed in 10 NCAA tournaments. As a result of his success, Corrigan was tapped as a potential replacement for Dick Edell with the Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse team, alongside Dave Cottle and Gary Gait. He chose to stay at Notre Dame, however, and was the recipient of the 2001 Great Western Lacrosse League Coach of the Year award. In 2009, he received the Frenchy Julien Service Award from the USILA for \\"outstanding and continuous service to the sport.\\" In 2015, John Baumer and his wife donated $3 million for the University of Notre Dame to endow the head coaching position of the Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team. In his endowed role, Corrigan became the longest active tenured coach in men's lacrosse at the Division I level.

Their focus is on developing polyculture practices for farming shellfish and seaweeds and kelps. These practices include using many layers of the water column, emulating high activity water ecosystems like reefs, to increase productivity and biomass. The organization focuses on developing globally accessible techniques for this kind of farming. As of 2019, they had a waitlist of over 4,000 farmers in 20 countries needing support in starting such farms. Starting such a farm usually costs between US$20‚Äì50,000. The nonprofit was created by Bren Smith to spread methods first developed on his Thimble Island Ocean Farm in Long Island Sound. In 2015, the organization's 3D ocean farming method won the Buckminster Fuller Institute's Fuller Challenge.
