Col. Joseph William Torrey, Rajah of Ambong and Marudu, (April 22, 1828 in Bath, Maine; ‚Äì June 22, 1885 in Boston) was an American merchant, president of the American Trading Company of Borneo and co-founder of the American colony \\"Ellena\\" (in present-day Kimanis) together with Thomas Bradley Harris on the island of Borneo. He was known as \\"Yankee Rajah\\" and served as a U.S. vice-consul to Siam. == Early life == Torrey was born on April 22, 1828 in the American small town of Bath in Maine. He was the son of Joseph Gendall Torrey and Emily Houghton. His father practiced the craft of a printer and was also the founder of the Maine Gazette, which is the town first newspaper. In 1834, the family moved to Roxbury, a district of Boston. Torrey graduated from the Boston High School under Rev. Dr. Leach. At first, he also learned the printing business and worked for several years in the company of his father, which brought him into contact with the satirical magazine, Carpet Bag by Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber. Torrey served in several companies and was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Boston. However, the authenticity of his military grade \\"Colonel\\" is questioned. == Further career == In 1853, he left Boston and went to Melbourne, Australia, where he worked as a clerk at Caldwell, Train & Co., Commission Merchants and Steam Packet Agents. He was also a member of Torrey & Foodrich and Company, Discharging Clerks. In addition to his work, he began studying law; although it was not known if he received an academic degree in law. In Melbourne, he joined the Masonic lodge and later became the Grand Master. On September 22, 1854, during his time in Australia, he married his first wife, Eliza Lydia Ewer in Victoria. The couple had two children, Emiline Eliza (born in 1856) and Cordelia Grace (born in 1858). One year after the birth of their second children, Eliza however died young after battling with a short illness at the age of 27 years. Torrey returned with his two children to Roxbury in 1860, where they grew up with their grandparents. In 1860, Torrey moved to British Hong Kong, where he became the editor of The China Mail, the first British daily newspaper in Hong Kong. He later took over the publication of the Hong Kong Times. In 1862, he joined Montgomery & Parker as a ship broker and commissioner. In 1863, Torrey married again. His second wife, the first fifteen-year-old Charlotte Ann \\"Lemon\\" Mills, bore him a son Joseph Gendall (born on September 16, 1864) and a daughter named Elena Charlotte (born in 1867). He later bought his own ship from the ship broker company, which he baptized as Ellen - probably named after his newest youngest daughter.  Foundation of the Ellena Colony  Thomas Bradley Harris (standing left) and Torrey (sitting right). In August 1865, the American consul in Brunei, Charles Lee Moses concluded a 10-year lease with the Sultan Abdul Momin and his successor, Pengiran Temenggung who guaranteed land rights in various areas in the north of Borneo. Looking for a quick profit, the consul immediately sought buyers for his concessions following the signing of the lease. Moses bid raised the interest among his countrymen including Torrey himself and Thomas Bradley Harris. Blessed with exuberant reports of a land rich in gold, diamonds, precious stones, spices and treasures waiting to be delivered to the markets of Hong Kong and China, they bought the concessions of Moses in September 1865. In October 1865, Torrey and Harris, together with Chinese lenders Lee Assing and Pong Ampong under the American Trading Company of Borneo decided to build a colony in the area of today's Kimanis. Taking note of the fact that the acquisition of the concession of Moses was also recognized by the Sultan of Brunei, Torrey made a new concession letter drawn up on November 24, 1865 at the Brunei Palace provided with the seals of the Sultan and three of his ministers. The document confirms his concession acquisition which is not only guaranteed for Torrey to be the ruler of life and death, but the Sultan even gave him the title of \\"Rajah of Ambong and Marudu\\". Page 2 of the concession of Torrey with his appointment as Rajah by the Sultan of Brunei. In December 1865, Torrey with 12 Americans and 60 Chinese founded the colony of \\"Ellena\\" and appointed himself as the governor, and Harris as vice-governor. His plans to make Ellena attractive to further settlers by cultivating sugarcane, tobacco and rice failed soon after. This was mainly caused by the unfortunate choice of the position of Ellenas; in the mouth of the sluggish Kimanis River which favored the outbreak of malaria and other diseases. The colony also lacked a solid financial base which meant that Torrey was forced to temporarily leave his own colony to his deputy, Harris to look for investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai. While Torrey desperately tried to raise additional funds in Hong Kong for his colony in Borneo, his friend Harris died of malaria on May 22, 1866. Torrey buried his business partner on the top of a nearby hill in his colony area in Borneo, now known as Governor's Hill. Torrey made the following inscription to his tombstone: { cellpadding=\\"4\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #999; border-collapse:collapse; margin:1em 0\\"  In Memory of Thomas Bradley Harris, Hon. Chief Secretary of the Colony of Ambong and Maroodu. By Birth a Citizen of the U.S.A. Died 22nd May, 1866. Aged 40 Years. Erected by the Rajah. A Tribute of Respect to the Memory of An Old, Faithful and Esteemed Friend. ‚ÄúAfter Life‚Äôs Fitful Fever, He Sleeps Well.‚Äù } As early as 1866, the American colony was abandoned because of a lack of capital, a lack of labor, riots among the workers and serious diseases. The end of Ellena left Torrey penniless. Driven on the one hand by the predominantly Chinese investors, unlike Charles Lee Moses who was still waiting for the payment of the purchase price, he tried to continue selling his rights profitably. However, only nine years later, just before the ten- year term expired, Torrey succeeded in selling all rights to Baron von Overbeck from Germany in January 1876 in Hong Kong. The purchase price of $15,000 was linked to the condition that within nine months it was necessary to obtain an extension of the concessions from the ruler of Brunei.  Diplomatic service  From 1877 to 1880, Torrey was a vice-consul at the U.S. Consulate in Siam (present-day Thailand). In his capacity as a vice-consul, he also belonged to the American delegation who accompanied ex-President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to meet Chulalongkorn, the king of Siam. It seems, however, that Torrey presence was not well-liked by all, as he could not arrange with his superior. After his resignation as vice-consul, he remained a member of the American Legation in Bangkok. == Later life and death == Torrey returned to America in 1883. A few days before his death, the news from the King of Siam reached him, telling that he should be appointed as the king's chief adviser. Before he decided whether to take office or not, Torrey died suddenly on June 22, 1885, at his home on Wabon Street in Roxbury. Although he already died, he still recognized by the government for representing his lost kingdom as his body was dressed in the uniform of a high oriental dignitary for three days before his black coffin of walnut wood was taken to the St. James Episcopal Church. A large crown of flowers in the colors of the flag of Ellenas-yellow and red-formed the central view, a half-moon with thirteen stripes on a blue background, and thirteen stars which testified the American origin of the rajah. He was buried at the Torrey Family Cemetery of the Forest Hills Cemetery. == Miscellaneous == Torrey, \\"the only American Rajah\\" also got his entry on the title page of the January issue of Ripley's Believe It or Not! in the year of 1950. == Notes  Literature == * Joseph William Torrey: American Trading Company of Borneo Organized Under Special Concession from His Highness the Sultan of Borneo, and the General Laws of the State of New York. 1868 == References == Category:Borneo Category:History of Sabah Category:1828 births Category:1885 deaths ","title":"Joseph William Torrey"},{"id":"54091757","text":"Linda Hunter (born 10 December 1963) is a Zimbabwean long-distance runner.

He attended school at the Lyc√©e Chaptal in Paris, and then went on to study teaching. Between 1954 and 1960 Pen taught for periods at Bayeux, √âtr√©ham, and Nonant (all in the Calvados department of Normandy). He moved to Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1960 to teach at the Lyc√©e-Coll√®ge d'√âtat √âmile Letournel.

He was also elected mayor of Saint-Pierre in 1971. At the 1968 legislative elections Pen was elected to the Senate for the Union of Democrats for the Republic, defeating Henri Claireaux of the Christian Democratic Party. Somewhat of a maverick, he left the UDR in 1969 to sit as an independent, and then in 1974 joined the Socialist Party. He left the Socialist caucus in 1977 to protest a lack of Overseas French representation at its national conference, but eventually rejoined. He would frequently vote against his own party, however, especially on issues relating to his constituency. In 1981 Pen left the Senate to switch to the National Assembly, effectively swapping places with Marc Plantegenest. He returned to the Senate in 1986, remaining as a senator until being defeated by Victor Reux (UPM) at the 1995 elections. Pen strongly opposed the French government position on the Canada‚ÄìFrance Maritime Boundary Case, which saw Saint Pierre and Miquelon lose much of its claimed exclusive economic zone to Canada. ==References== *Official Website of the Senate Category:1931 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Category:Canadian people of Breton descent Category:French people of Breton descent Category:Saint Pierre and Miquelon politicians Category:Union of Democrats for the Republic politicians Category:Socialist Party (France) politicians Category:French Senators of the Fifth Republic Category:Senators of Saint Pierre and Miquelon Category:Deputies of the 7th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 8th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Saint Pierre and Miquelon educators ","title":"Albert Pen"},{"id":"54091968","text":"Troy Trepanier is an American automobile designer and builder.

His father changed his surname to \\"Serblin\\" after immigrating to Trieste. Franco was born in Vicenza and was the youngest of seven brothers. Passionate about audio, he decided to do his best to make a high-fidelity and attractive acoustic speaker. Months of practice culminated in 1980, when he built his first acoustic speaker: the \\"Snail project\\", of which only ten were made. In the same period, he produced furniture for some Cizek speaker models, in particular the KA-1, KA-18, and KA-20 systems. After this period, the production of them moved from the United States of America to Italy. On March 14, 1983, Franco founded Sonus Faber, a high-fidelity speaker company. The distinctive aesthetic style of Sonus Faber, a smooth, blur-like form was conceived by Franco. It is imitated today by various loudspeaker manufacturers. In 2006, after 33 years at the business he founded, he left Sonus Faber to pursue more boutique loud speaker design. He devoted himself to the design of Kt√™ma, a new speaker that was released only five years later. Currently the Kt√™ma speaker is still in production with Serblin's latest \\"Agreement\\" and is being marketed in 18 countries around the world.

Moffie and Fisher both graduated from the university, where they met through Order of Angell, a senior honor society at the university. The two decided to name the company after an intersection in Ann Arbor, in honor of the town. Prior to founding, Moffie played professional ice hockey for the Denver Cutthroats and the South Carolina Stingrays following his four-year varsity letter (2009‚Äì13) with the Michigan Wolverines Ice Hockey under Red Berenson. Fisher‚Äôs background lies in business data analytics and complex systems, leading a data analytics initiative for the Detroit Tigers and working on various other projects for startups and larger organizations as a consultant. The idea for State & Liberty originated with Moffie and Fisher believing men with an athletic build wearing off-the-rack dress shirts lacked a professional look. Inspired by Lulu Lemon and athleisure apparel trends that stray away from traditional cotton fabric, the duo prototyped hundreds of fabrics and dress shirt fits on professional hockey players to accommodate their ‚ÄòV-shaped‚Äô body type. Eventually, they settled with their athletic fitting dress shirt made from Athletic Performance Fabric (APF). State and Liberty started as a fully self-funded small business. The company's product line includes athletic-fitting, moisture-wicking, and wrinkle-free dress shirts. In October 2016, State & Liberty launched a partnership with the Professional Hockey Players' Association. In 2017, the company introduced multiple products, including a polo shirt, a long sleeve polo shirt, and an overcoat. State and Liberty opened two pop-up locations in late 2017, one on Newbury Street in Boston, Massachusetts and one in Georgetown, Washington D.C. ==Philanthropy== State & Liberty supports Autism Speaks, sponsored by James van Riemsdyk, an NHL left winger for the Toronto Maple Leafs, by donating a portion of proceeds to the foundation. In mid-2016, State & Liberty launched \\"The Morgan\\" shirt to benefit the Jordan Morgan Foundation.

Rolf Ingvar Nerl√∂v (January 4, 1940 - June 27, 2015) was a Swedish sculptor, painter and stonemason. He was born in Malm√∂, in Southern Sweden. Nerl√∂v's intense interest in art began at a very early age. When he was 11, he became the apprentice of renowned sculptor Thure Th√∂rn and was tutored by him until he was around 19 years old. He was educated in Copenhagen, at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts 1960 - 1964, under Gottfred Eickhoff. Nerl√∂v's artistic work was mostly focused on post-impressionist sculpture - portraiture, human figures, animal figures - and poignant scenes from human life, such as the Church Yard and Lonesome. During the 1990s, he also started painting oil pastels, again focusing on post-impressionism. He had art exhibitions for example at Galerie Holm, Galleri Loftet, Galleri Str√∂get, Galleri Konstn√§rscentrum in Malm√∂, and Galleri M√•sen in Sm√•land.

The development gave rise to major development of the region. ==Background== After the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in the 1880s geologists knew that the main reef spread to the east and west, but did so at great depth. At that period the technology to prospect or mine at such depth was not yet available. In the 1930s, new geophysical prospecting methods determined that deep gold reefs could be discovered. The mines in the Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom areas were started thanks to the success of these new methods. ==The Free State== In the 1890s the trader Gustav Furst had a small shop on the farm Zoeten Inval. It was 13km from where Odendaalrus stands today. Furst showed the prospector Archibald Megson a quartzite vein. Megson and his partners Donaldson and Haines sank an adit and found gold. However, it was in insufficient volumes to attract financiers. Donaldson and Haines took samples with them to London on the ship Drummond Castle. On 16 June 1896 the ship when down at Ushant, signaling the end of the initiative and Furst disappeared from the scene. In the early 1930s Megson managed to interest Allan Roberts, an amateur geologist and dental technician, in the reef and entrance adit. Megson was bought out by Roberts who founded \\"Wit Extensions\\". In 1933 Roberts bored a hole of 1 263m near to the adit on the farm Aandenk. It yielded nothing and the venture came to naught. This effort was followed by others, eg: Western Holdings and a company owned by Hans Merensky. Using new technology and instruments he developed himself, the Hungarian geologist, Oscar Weiss, identified a place on the farm St. Helena. In April 1938 he drilled into gold at a depth of 737m. The estimation was more than a half ounce per ton of processed ore. Unfortunately the Second World War broke out thereafter and prospecting work came to a halt. After the Second World War various mining companies flooded Odendaalsrus and within a year over 50 holes were bored. On 16 April 1946 the great discovery was made on the farm Geduld. With the thirteenth hole he had drilled, a drill operator called \\"Lucky\\" Hamilton, struck gold at a depth of 1 200 m. The sample from the drill core yielded 62oz of gold per ton of processed ore, making it one of the richest reefs in the world. One of the companies found the hole drilled by Allan Roberts, cleaned it out and drilled deeper striking the same reef a further 122m on. ==Impacts== The discovery of the reef led to the establishment of the city of Welkom and the town of Riebeeckstad whilst towns such as Odendalsrus, Allanridge and Virginia enjoyed unbelievable growth. Water was supplied into the region from the Vaal Dam and new roads and railway lines laid in order to service it. Mines that were established were: * Beatrix * Erfdeel-Dankbaarheid * Free State Geduld * Jeanette * Loraine * Oryx * President Brand * President Steyn * St. Helena * Welkom * Western Holdings ==The region== The following towns are part of the Free State Goldfields: * Allanridge * Hennenman * Odendaalsrus * Riebeeckstad * Virginia, Free State * Welkom == References == * Based on the original article in Afrikaans. * Ensiklopedie van Suidelike Afrika.

It was codenamed Blue Lion during its development. It builds on OS/2 Warp 4.52 by adding support for new hardware, fixing defects and limitations in the operating system, and by including new applications and tools.Blue Lion Announcement at Warpstock 2015 It is targeted at professional users who need to run their OS/2 applications on new hardware, as well as personal users of OS/2. As with OS/2 Warp, ArcaOS is a 32-bit single user, multiprocessing, preemptive multitasking operating system for the x86 architecture. It is supported on both physical hardware and virtual machine hypervisors. ==Features== Hardware compatibility ArcaOS supports symmetric multiprocessing systems with up to 64 processor cores, although it is recommended to disable hyperthreading. As of version 5.0.6, ArcaOS is ACPI 6.1-compliant and includes the 20200717 release of ACPICA. While ArcaOS is a 32-bit operating system, it has limited PAE support which allows it to use RAM in excess of 4GB as a RAM disk. ArcaOS supports being run as a virtual machine guest inside VirtualBox, VMware ESXi and VMWare Workstation. In addition to the drivers included with OS/2 Warp 4, ArcaOS includes a variety of drivers developed by Arca Noae, and various third parties: * Network adapters are supported either with Arca Noae's MultiMacArca Noae wiki: MultiMac NIC Drivers technology, which employs FreeBSD driver code, or a selection of GenMACProject: Generic MAC Wrapper Driver (GenMac) drivers. Support for wireless networking is somewhat limited, though MultiMac support for additional chipsets is planned for ArcaOS 5.1. * ArcaOS replaces the 16-bit IBM OS/2 USB driver with a new 32-bit driver capable of supporting USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 controllers. * Audio support utilizes the Uniaud generic audio driver, now maintained by Arca Noae. Uniaud is based on ALSA. In addition, a selection of device-specific drivers are included with ArcaOS. A new audio driver is planned for ArcaOS 5.1, based on FreeBSD audio drivers. * Video support is provided by PanoramaArca Noae wiki: Panorama Video Driver generic unaccelerated VESA driver, or SNAPArca Noae wiki: Arca Noae SNAP Graphics for OS/2 accelerated video driver. Features such as acceleration and multi-head are supported for a limited number of graphics chipsets. Support for these features in additional chipsets, such as the Intel HD series, is planned. * Storage drivers are available for IDE and AHCI, and a select number of SCSI adapters are supported. An NVMe driver is under development. * Support for printers is provided by the eCups project, which is based on the open source CUPS printing system for Unix. Software An ArcaOS desktop showing some of the included applications - Firefox, Lucide, 4OS2, PMDCalc Plus In addition to the software bundled with OS/2 Warp 4, ArcaOS includes some further software, such as: * Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird * Apache OpenOffice * Lucide, an open source document viewer * XWorkplace, a set of open source enhancements to the Workplace Shell * 4OS2 * OpenJDK 6 * Qt 4 and 5 * Samba 4 * Heimdal Kerberos * VirtualBox Guest Additions As of 2020, a project is underway to port QtWebEngine (based on Chromium) to OS/2 and ArcaOS in order to support the Falkon browser. This has been prompted by the increasing complexity of the Firefox codebase, and use of the Rust programming language in newer versions of Firefox - whose compiler is unlikely to be supported on the OS/2 platform. Cross-platform compatibility Bash shell (bottom left), QBASIC in a DOS window (middle), and the Windows 3.1 Program Manager (top right) ArcaOS includes a number of software components which allow it to directly run software developed for other operating systems, and to simplify the process of porting software to ArcaOS: * ArcaOS includes OS/2's VDM and WIN-OS/2, allowing ArcaOS to run 16-bit MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 applications natively. ArcaOS features some improvements to these subsystems which are not found in OS/2, such as the ability to access volumes greater than 2GB from Windows and DOS, as well as ongoing work which will allow 16-bit Windows and DOS software to run on UEFI systems which do not have a traditional BIOS. * ArcaOS includes Odin, based on Wine, which provides a subset of the Win32 API. Odin can be used to run certain Win32 applications directly, and certain applications, such as OpenJDK, have used the Odin API to simplify porting. * ArcaOS provides a Unix compatibility layer named kLIBC which facilitates porting open source Linux applications to ArcaOS. A variety of linux tools ship with ArcaOS such as the Bash shell and the GNU coreutils, while others are available through the ArcaOS package manager, such as GCC. * A port of OpenJDK is included, which allows ArcaOS to run Java applications which do not have platform-specific dependencies. Filesystems ArcaOS's default filesystem is JFS, although HPFS is also supported for backwards compatibility. ArcaOS may be installed to and booted from either filesystem. FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 are also supported using either the kernel's own FAT driver, or a new Arca Noae-developed FAT32 IFS driver, included in ArcaOS since version 5.0.3. ArcaOS includes support for optical disc filesystems such as ISO 9660 and UDF. ArcaOS supports serving and accessing CIFS/SMB shares using the open source Samba project, and provides a graphical utility named ArcaMapper to manage configuration. NetDrive for OS/2 provides access to a variety of additional filesystems such as NTFS and NFS via its own IFS driver. The ArcaOS distribution includes a limited license version of NetDrive but the fully licensed version is capable of mounting a number of other local, native, and foreign file systems. Installation and updates The hardware configuration screen from the ArcaOS installer ArcaOS features a new graphical installer which replaces the old IBM installer used in OS/2 Warp. Unlike OS/2, the ArcaOS installation process does not require a boot floppy, and instead the installer can be booted directly from optical media, or from a USB flash drive. The installer also provides an update feature, which allows ArcaOS to updated to the latest release without reinstalling the entire operating system. Installation and updates of individual software packages is provided through the Arca Noae Package Manager (ANPM), which consists of a native OS/2 graphical frontend on top of RPM and YUM. Software is provided through a mixture of freely available, and subscription only RPM repositories. Planned features Some features planned for inclusion into future versions of the operating system include: * Support for booting on UEFI-only systems without a Compatibility Support Module (CSM). This involves providing emulation of certain BIOS functionality which the operating system depends on (particularly interrupts INT 10H and INT 13H). As of 2020, Arca Noae have demonstrated ArcaOS installing onto a UEFI system and booting with the CSM disabled. Support for disks using GPT partition tables is under development, which will disks larger than 2TB to be supported. * Support for localization, known as National Language Version (NLV) support, is planned for ArcaOS 5.1 and later. Planned languages include German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Dutch. This involves augmenting the localization in OS/2 Warp 4 with translations for the new software added in ArcaOS, such as the installer and XWorkplace. * A migration facility to allow in-place migration of OS/2 Warp 4 and eComStation to ArcaOS without requiring the existing operating system installation to be removed first. * Desktop search functionality based on the open-source Recoll project. Hardware requirements The minimum hardware requirements for ArcaOS 5.0.x are as follows: {  - ! Processor  Intel Pentium Pro or AMD K6 - ! Memory (RAM)  512MB minimum 2GB recommended - ! Graphics Card  VGA video card with VBE 2.0 support - ! Storage space  2GB of available disk space - ! Removable media  Installation requires DVD-ROM drive or USB flash drive - ! Firmware  Traditional BIOS, or UEFI with CSM enabled - ! Input devices  PS/2 or USB keyboard and mouse } ==History== Origins ArcaOS was formally announced on October 23, 2015, at the Warpstock 2015 event (an OS/2 and eComStation user group event) under the code name \\"Blue Lion\\" by Arca Noae's Managing Member, Lewis Rosenthal.OS/2: Blue Lion to be the next distro of the 28-year-old OS Some of the planned features for Blue Lion announced at the time were: * new SMP kernel * new pre-boot menu * new OS installer with support for installation from USB memory stick and across a network * device drivers already produced by Arca Noae as part of their Drivers & Software SubscriptionIs the world ready for a bare-metal OS/2 rebirth? * the latest Workplace Shell enhancements * updated CUPS print subsystem * updated PostScript printer driver pack * localization in several languages besides EnglishOS/2 comes back from the dead At the time of the announcement, the initial release was projected for late third quarter of 2016, but Arca Noae also stated that no actual release date had been set. The name \\"ArcaOS\\" was first published in a Tech Republic articleOS/2 resurrected: Blue Lion becomes ArcaOS, details emerge for upcoming release on May 26, 2016, while the arcaos.com domain was registered December 20, 2015. In the same Tech Republic article, Lewis Rosenthal was quoted as saying that the first release of ArcaOS would be version 5.0, as it follows onto the last release of OS/2 Warp from IBM, which was 4.52 (also known as Merlin Convenience Pack 2, or MCP2). He also stated that ArcaOS 5.1 will provide French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Dutch versions of the operating system. ArcaOS 5.0 was released May 15, 2017.ArcaOS 5.0 release announcement The Register published an article about the release on May 19th, 2017. There were two editions released: a commercial edition, intended for enterprise use (including 12 months of upgraded/prioritized technical support), and a personal edition, targeted at non-business users (including six months of standard technical support) at a reduced price. Pricing was listed as $229 per license for the commercial edition, and $129 per license for the personal edition, with $99 promotional price in effect for the first 90 days following release.

Its primary goal is to pressure the Israeli government into achieving a \\"bilaterally acceptable political agreement\\" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a target date of 2018. == Origin == While originally started by Israeli women, the movement has worked to build connections with Palestinian women, also reaching out to both women and men of many other local regions and religious backgrounds. It was inspired by similar women's movements in Northern Ireland and Liberia, where women of different faiths had united to help resolve violent conflicts. Inspiration also came from the Four Mothers movement, established in 1997, which ultimately influenced Israel's military withdrawal from South Lebanon. The movement has its basis on two main objectives: # To encourage peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority # To urge the enforcement of UN resolution 1325 which \\"reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts\\" == Membership == As of May 2017, Women Wage Peace had more than 20,000 members and supporters. == Activities ==  2015 Israel General Election  In March 2015, members of the movement protested outside the Israel Parliament building in Jerusalem, calling for politicians to put more priority on peace talks in the general election debates. 2015 Operation Protective Fast In 2015, from July 8 to August 26, Women Wage Peace staged a collective fast outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's formal residence, timing their symbolic 50-day \\"Operation Protective Fast\\" to coincide with the anniversary of Operation Protective Edge in Gaza the previous year. Approximately 300 women and men participated, joining the protest in shifts. In early September, a week after the hunger strike had concluded, four members of the movement were invited to a formal meeting with Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of renewing peace talks with Palestine. 2016 March for Peace In October 2016, over 3000 Israeli and Palestinian women participated in a Women Wage Peace march from Northern Israel to Jerusalem, ending with a rally in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's formal residence. Among the speakers at the rally was Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian peace activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate known for helping to end the Second Liberian Civil War. Following the march, Canadian- Israeli singer and activist Yael Deckelbaum of Habanot Nechama collaborated with Women Wage Peace to create the song \\"Prayer of the Mothers\\", which included clips of a speech by Gbowee. As of May 2017, the music video had received over 3 million views on YouTube. 2017 activities The movement has continued to remain active, building pressure and awareness around the need for peaceful conflict resolution. In March 2017, at an International Women's Day reception in Tel Aviv, more than a dozen foreign female ambassadors pledged their support for the Women Wage Peace movement. On May 13, 2017, the Israeli music network Constant Culture announced that they had created an EDM compilation album in support of peace, with all proceeds going to Women Wage Peace. On May 18, 2017, members of Women Wage Peace met in Tel Aviv in advance of U.S. President Donald Trump's first visit to Israel, creating a human chain that spelled out \\"ready for peace\\". == References External links== * Category:Peace organizations based in Israel Category:Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process ","title":"Women Wage Peace"},{"id":"54092557","text":"Dr. Jung Kong Lee (; December 1924 ‚Äì 31 January 1990) was a Hong Kong-born US- educated chemist and politician.

He worked at the Children's Hospital of Michigan for 35 years, where he oversaw a large amount of pediatric research, particularly in the field of hematology. He received the John Howland Award in 1985. ==Early life== Zuelzer was born in Berlin in 1909 to George and Edith Zuelzer. His father was a physician who pioneered anti-diabetic therapies and came from a strongly medical family. His mother, meanwhile, was a pianist whose parents were also accomplished musicians. After graduating from gymnasium he studied philosophy and Romance languages at Heidelberg University. In 1928, he was selected to undertake a fellowship at the University of Paris, where he became fluent in French and was introduced to French literature. He returned to Germany in 1929 and began a doctorate in French literature, but six months before he was due to complete his PhD, he decided to study medicine instead. He completed his preclinical studies at the University of Bonn and moved to Berlin in 1932 to finish his clinical training. When Hitler came to power, however, Zuelzer decided to leave Nazi Germany to finish his medical studies at the German University in Prague, graduating in 1935. ==Career== Zuelzer migrated to the United States in August 1935. After working briefly at the Cambridge City Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he was appointed a house officer in the pediatric department of the Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1938, he began volunteering at the Boston Children's Hospital with Sidney Farber, the country's first pediatric pathologist. He was a resident pathologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago for two-and-a-half years before moving to Detroit to take up a position that was created specifically for him, as a professor of pediatric research at Wayne State University and director of the laboratories at the Children's Hospital of Michigan. He was a temporary chairman of the hospital's pediatric department in 1946 and was appointed director of the Child Research Center of Michigan in 1955. He worked at the Child Research Center and Children's Hospital of Michigan for 35 years; during that time, he oversaw research in numerous fields of pediatrics and published over 250 research articles. Zuelzer's research was particularly influential in the field of hematology, particularly regarding hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemias and sickle cell anemia.

Rogers' theory is predicated on an individual's innate capacity to decide his/her own best directions in life, provided his/her circumstances are conducive to this, based on the organism's \\"universal need to drive or self-maintain, flourish, self-enhance and self-protect\\". Counsellors Keith Tudor and Mike Worrall proposed that analogues of the actualizing tendency can be found in texts by various writers from antiquity onward, such as Aristotle, Lucretius, Spinoza, S√°ndor Ferenczi, Jessie Taft, and Eric Berne. Tudor, K and Worrall, M (2006) Person-centred therapy: a clinical philosophy. London: Routledge. == Development of the concept == Rogers based his notion of the actualizing tendency on his deductive observation that whenever a person is free to choose their goals they select \\"positive and constructive pathways\\". Levitt, B. E. (2005) Embracing non-directivity: reassessing person-centered theory and practice in the 21st century. Ross-on-Wye. p. 136. Rogers found that: \\"it is our experience in therapy which has brought us to the point of giving this proposition a central place\\", Rogers, C. R. (1951) Client-centred therapy. London: Robinson. and eventually named this theoretical construct the actualizing tendency. The individual: \\"has one basic tendency and striving ‚Äì to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism\\". In 1980 he elucidated further: \\"...life is an active process, not a passive one. Whether the stimulus arises from within or without, whether the environment is favourable or unfavourable, the behaviours of an organisms can be counted on to be in the direction of maintaining, enhancing, and reproducing itself. This is the very nature of the process we call life.\\" Fundamentally, therefore, actualization is not something that an organism does, or has, but what it is. In his \\"theory of personality and behaviour\\", published in 1951, Rogers presented 19 propositions, the fourth of which holds that: \\"The organism has one basic tendency and striving ‚Äì to actualize, maintain, and enhance the experiencing organism\\". Rogers regarded the actualizing tendency as the fundamental motivational driver of all human development, emotion and behaviour: \\"Rather than many needs and motives, it seems entirely possible that organic and psychological needs may be described as partial aspects of this one fundamental need.\\" Rogers, C. R. (1980) A way of being. New York: Houghton Mifflin Books pp. 487‚Äì8. To illustrate the universal nature of the actualization of an individual organism's life cycle Rogers wrote of how potatoes had sprouted and grown in his parent's dark basement: \\"They would never become plants, never mature, never fulfil their real potential. But under the most adverse circumstances, they were striving to become. Life would not give up, even if it could not flourish.\\" Nathaniel Raskin, a long-term collaborator with Carl Rogers, wrote in 2000 that the actualizing tendency > ...is a central tenet in the writings of Kurt Goldstein, Hobart Mowrer, > Harry Stack Sullivan, Karen Horney, and Andras Angyal, to name just a few. > The child's painful struggle to learn to walk is an example. It is Rogers' > belief, and the belief of most other personality theorists that, given a > free choice and in the absence of external force, individuals prefer to be > healthy rather than sick, to be independent rather than dependent, and in > general to further the optimal development of the total organism.Raskin, M. > (2004) Contributions to client-centered therapy and the person-centered > approach. Ross-on-Wye: PCCS Books. p.260. Actualization of the self (self-actualization) occurs alongside the actualization of all other life functions and organs. It is important to note the difference between self-actualization as conceptualised by Carl Rogers and the more widely known self-actualization of Abraham Maslow. == Application to psychotherapy == Actualization is never the goal for therapy, but the actualizing tendency ‚Äì the client's \\"native wisdom\\"Worsley, R. (2009) Process work in person-centred therapy. 2nd ed. London: Palgrave Macmillan. p.40. is the \\"engine that makes psychotherapy work\\",Cooper, M., O'Hara, M., Schmid, P. and Bohart, A. (Ed) (2013) The handbook of person-centred psychotherapy and counseling. 2nd ed. London: Palgrave Macmillan. allowing clients to become more \\"fully functioning\\". Self-actualization in person-centred personality theory is the ongoing, adaptive process of \\"maintaining and enhancing that portion of the phenomenal field [i.e. experiencing] which is the 'self'\\". This self is continually adapting and modifying itself in response to experience in response to external and internal stimuli. Often misinterpreted as na√Øvely implying an innate goodness in humans, or alternatively as encouraging an autonomy based on selfish, narcissistic individuality, Rogers' self- actualization is biological, value-neutral and promotes the self-regulated interdependence of a valued member of society, rather than a purely selfish attitude. \\"Suppose we turn to the animal world and ask ourselves what is the basic nature of the lion, or the sheep, or the dog, or the mouse. To say that any one or all of these are basically hostile or antisocial or carnal seems to be ridiculous.\\"Rogers, C. R. (1957) A note on the 'nature of man'. Journal of Counseling Psychology. Vol. 4, No. 3, 1957. p.200. Rogers built his theory around the idea that this adaptive homeostasis is exactly the process that can either optimise or pathologize the process of self-actualisation: \\"In nature the actualizing tendency shows surprising efficiency. The organism makes errors, to be sure, but these are corrected on the basis of feedback.\\"Mearns, D. and Thorne, M. (2000) Person-centred therapy today: new frontiers in theory and practice. London: Sage. p. 185. While the organism might make errors, much depends on the individual's environment during development: \\"Those who were fortunate enough to have a loving and supportive environment during their early years would receive the necessary reinforcement to guarantee the nourishment of the actualizing tendency. They would ... be affirmed in their ability to trust their own thoughts and feelings and to make decisions in accordance with their own perceptions and desires\\"Mearns, D. and Thorne, B. (2007/2008) Person-centred counselling in action. 3rd ed. London: Sage. p.9. in accordance with their personal organismic valuing process (OVP). In PCT the process of self-actualization is what does the healing, and the therapist must remain non-directive and \\"sustain the conviction that each person is attempting to actualize himself: do not try to change anyone\\". Bohart (2013) cites evidence for the idea that people can be surprisingly \\"self-righting\\" following psychological distress, including trauma, and that it is this capacity that facilitates effective therapy.  Characteristics of the actualizing tendency  Brodley (1999)Brodley, B. (1999) The actualizing tendency concept in client-centred therapy. The person-centered journal. Vol. 6. Issue 2 has identified a number of major characteristics of the actualizing tendency in human beings:  It is individual and universal  As a fundamental biological process, actualization is both as individual and as universal as the genome of any individual organism. All living things utilise energy, maintain homeostasis (sometimes in very complex, adaptive, or opportunistic ways), grow, respond to stimuli, adapt, and reproduce. Each of these functions is compelled and constrained in a distinctive manner by the individual's unique mix of genes and environmental factors. Actualization arises from the tension at the interface of gene and environment.Merry, T. (2002) Learning and being in person-centred counselling. 2nd ed. Ross-on-Wye: PCCS Books. p.69.  It is holistic  The actualizing tendency applies to all aspects of the organism such that effort towards its development and behaviours are holistically coordinated.  It is ubiquitous and constant  The actualizing tendency applies to all of the organism's systems, and at all times during its life-cycle.  It is directional  There are two aspects to the actualizing tendency's directionality: a drive towards the maintenance of organization and a drive towards realization of potential throughout the life cycle.  It is primarily tension-increasing  An organism's behaviour is governed by feedback processes, in which \\"tension reduction is a secondary, corrective reaction\\" (Brodley, 1999): the organismic valuing process (OVP) regulates behaviour via motivational anxieties and associated \\"pleasurable tensions\\".Koch, Sigmund, ed. Psychology: a study of a science. study 1, Volume 3: formulations of the person and the social context, London: McGraw-Hill, 1959. p. 196.  It tends towards greater autonomy  A maturing organism is increasingly driven towards autonomous behaviours. In humans this involves increased self-regulation and self-determination, and towards a socially negotiated degree of interdependence that the individual is comfortable with. This implies issues related to power: the capacity to assist, resist, or compel, others.  It involves self-actualization (in humans)  As a subset of the overall organism, the sense of self is always in a state of actualization. A well-functioning human mind is free to continually reflect upon and reinterpret its experience, and to restructure and reinvent itself, allows the individual to adapt in sophisticated ways to complex aspects of its current and predicted environment.  It is pro- sociality  Brodley (1999) identifies characteristics of sociability that she considers likely to be universal: \\"the capacity for identification leading to feelings of sympathy for other persons, capacity for empathy, affiliative tendencies, tendencies toward attachment, communication, social cooperation and collaboration, capacities for forming moral or ethical rules, and tendencies to engage in struggles to live according to moral or ethical rules\\" (Brodley, 1999). Rogers had noted the importance of others in an individual's actualization, which: \\"...inevitably involves the enhancement of other selves as well... the self-actualization of the organism appears to be in the direction of socialization, broadly defined\\" (Rogers, 1951).  It is channelled through the reflective consciousness  Humans have a far more developed consciousness / self-awareness than other animals, and in a well- functioning individual there will be conscious awareness of their organismic needs and motivations. The actualizing tendency, however, is only partially available to the individual's phenomenal field, and is not always fully subject to conscious reflection and effective symbolisation (the process by which an individual makes meaning from their experience). ==Criticism== Psychologist Les Greenberg said: \\"I disagree with Rogers and client-centered theory with regard to the inborn nature of the actualizing tendency and what it is in therapy that releases the growth tendency.\\"Greenberg, L. S. (1996) The power of empathic exploration: a process-experiential/gestalt perspective on the case of Jim Brown. In Farber, B. A., Brink, D., & Raskin, P. M. (eds.), The psychotherapy of Carl Rogers: cases and commentary (pp. 251‚Äì260). New York: Guilford Press. Greenberg and Richard van Balen explained that instead of the idea of the actualizing tendency, they preferred the idea of a \\"development tendency oriented toward increased complexity via exploration, and differentiation and integration of functioning, that results in greater adaptive flexibility\\".Greenberg, L. S. & van Balen, R. (1998) The theory of experience-centered therapies. In Greenberg, L. S., Watson, J. C., & Lietaer, G. (eds.), Handbook of experiential psychotherapy (pp. 28‚Äì57). New York: Guilford Press. The general aim of therapy, in Greenberg and van Balen's view, is to help clients to become \\"viable in a given environment rather than to actualize potential or become all one can be\\", and such development \\"is based more on a set of values than on a biological tendency\\". Greenberg and van Balen noted that basic organismic experience itself, far from being an expression of an actualizing tendency, sometimes needs therapeutic change: \\"For example, in posttraumatic stress syndrome the emotion system often signals an alarm when no danger is present. Similarly abuse or poor attachment histories can lead to maladaptive experience of, or mistrust of, interpersonal closeness, or a desire for relational experiences that are not in one's best interest.\\" Greenberg and van Balen wrote: \\"People in our view are often struggling and confused.

The first team on the south side reached the top on May 15. By early June, reports from Nepal indicated that 445 people had made it to the summit from the Nepali side. Reports indicate 160‚Äì200 summits on the north side, with 600‚Äì660 summiters overall for early 2017. This year had a roughly 50% success rate on that side for visiting climbers, which was down from other years. By 2018, the figure for the number of summiters of Everest was refined to 648. This includes 449 which summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side). Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck died in a fall during a warm-up climb on Nuptse, which he was conducting in preparation for his Everest-Lhotse summit bid. By May 22, 2017, five climbers had died, and one trekker to base camp died earlier in the year. Several climbers summited twice this season, including Kilian Jornet and Anshu Jamsenpa. ==Mountaineering season== {  style=\\"float:right; margin- right: 0; margin-left: 1em;\\" +Years in review summary - !Year !Summiters !Reference(s) - 2012 547  - efefef;\\" 2013 658  - 2014 106  - efefef;\\" 2015 0  - 2016 641  - 2017 648  } { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width:300px\\" + Typical Nepal camp altitudes ! scope=col  Location ! scope=col colspan=2  Altitude (km) - !

Winter Spanish mountaineer Alex Txikon with Pakistani mountaineer Muhammad Ali Sadpara attempted to summit Everest in winter without supplemental oxygen. Txikon reached up to Camp 4 at approximately 7,950 meters on 31st January, 2018 before being turned back by bad weather conditions.. Spring The Mount Everest summit season was set to be the largest climbing season in the modern history of the mountain with 365 people on 39 teams from around the world, just on the south/Nepal side. The Nepal Department of Tourism said they had issued the most permits this year since this process began. By May 3, there were 371 permits for climbers, and with their guides, around 800 could summit Everest from the south. By April 23, the route to Mount Everest's South Col area had been opened. The south side was expected to become a \\"global village\\" for about two months as hundreds of people from around the world undertake expeditions to the mountain. On the north side were roughly 200 mountaineers planning to climb Everest from Tibet. A few dozen climbers from both sides made it the top in mid-May before the weather turned again. In late May, the window before the monsoon season hits was predicted to open and the bulk of the expeditions began their summit bid. In early April, it was reported that at least 250 climbers on 27 expeditions were headed for Mount Everest. This grew to 289 climbers from 34 groups by April 20. All permits purchased for the spring season of 2015 were extended for two years, allowing those who had been unable to climb due to the earthquake and subsequent avalanches to return. 70 people returned in 2017 under this program. The first joint military exercise between the People's Republic of China and Nepal, called Sagarmatha Friendship-2017, took place April 16‚Äì25. The exercise focused on combating terrorism in the region and disaster-response management. China announced plans to build hotels, restaurants, and ski resorts on the Tibet side of Everest, having completed a new asphalt road to Everest in 2016. China has had a reputation for being more difficult with permits than Nepal, but has taken steps to improve access to the north side. British DJ Paul Oakenfold hosted \\"the highest party on Earth\\" in April at the Everest base camp, which was attended by over 100 people. An international collaboration between India and Nepal celebrating the 250th anniversary of the survey of India sought to re-measure the height of Everest. Everest's height was measured by Survey of India in 1855 and 1957, however there is concern that the April 2015 Nepal earthquake and avalanches may have changed the height of the mountain. The highest- altitude restaurant in the world opened in April at the Nepal base camp. Cleanup from previous years continued, with a special operation to remove trash beginning in March. The Nepal government and Everest expeditions worked together to distribute trash bags to remove debris from this season and from previous years, when people had to evacuate. Collected trash will be removed by helicopters, which usually return empty after delivering supplies. Sherpas were paid for carrying rubbish down the mountain on their return trips. A French-backed expedition called Everest Green went on an independent waste- retrieval mission, collecting about five tonnes of garbage from the Nepal base camp up to the South Col area. Of that, three tonnes were able to be recycled, and the mission ran for 40 days between April 13 and May 23. May Looking up along the southern ridgeline, the face of the Hillary Step is visible. The face in shadow on the left is the south-west face, and to the right is the top of the east/Kangshung face. The extent of change to the step, caused by the 2015 earthquake, has been debated (2010 photo) Closer view of the Step in 2010 On May 13, the first mountaineers climbed Everest from the Chinese Tibet route, with 16 reaching the top. The group consisted of 6 climbers from India and 10 Sherpa helpers. Ropes had been laid two days earlier, and there was a window of good weather. The ascent opened what one reporter called \\"the summit blitz\\". In the early morning of Monday, May 15, 14 members of the Gurkha Everest Expedition summited from the Nepal side. Expedition organizers predicted that 150 would try for the summit in the following days. By May 15, at least 35 more climbers from around the world had summitted. By May 25, an estimated 300‚Äì400 people had summited Mount Everest from the Nepal side, and another 120 or so from the Chinese Tibet side. It was discovered that the 2015 earthquake had altered the famed Hillary Step. The 40-foot climb is thought to have been reduced to a gentle rock slope. Various mountaineers confirmed in 2017 the news that the rocks of Everest had been altered. The extent of the destruction has been disputed. A South African filmmaker who tried to climb Everest without a permit was apprehended and arrested in May. The man faces a fine and may be banned from climbing mountains in Nepal for up to 10 years. Records On May 27, 2017, Kami Rita Sherpa, climbing with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, reached the summit for the 21st time. Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa are the only other people who have done so. Kilian Jornet completed an unassisted speed climb from base camp to the summit in 26 hours without bottled oxygen or fixed ropes, setting a new record. The complete climb, including return to base camp, took under 40 hours, and included a vertical ascent. A standard climb using a typical route takes approximately four days from North base camp to the summit. Jornet summited again on May 28, 2017, achieving two summits in less than a week. This climb, which began at advanced base camp, took 17 hours. Jornet's speed climb was one of fastest since Hans Kammerlander completed the normal Tibet-side route in 16 hours 45 minutes in 1996, setting the official Guinness World Record. In 2005, Christian Stangl reached the top of Everest from advanced base camp in 16 hours and 42 minutes. Famed Nepali- American mountaineer Lhakpa Sherpa attained her 8th Mount Everest summit, enhancing the world record for most times to the top for a woman. On May 21, 2017, Anshu Jamsenpa became the first woman to summit Everest twice within a week, doing so in five days, and became the first Indian woman to climb Mount Everest for the fifth time. Also on May 21, Vilborg Arna Gissurard√≥ttir became the first Icelandic woman to summit Everest, and Ada Tsang became the first Hong Kong woman to summit Everest. She completed the climb on her third attempt, together with a physiotherapist and mountaineer, Elton Ng. On May 22, Yusrina Ya'akob became the first female Malay Singaporean to summit Everest. The second blind man to summit Everest, Andy Holzer of Austria, reached the top on May 21 from the north, making him the first blind summiter since 2001. On May 22, 2017, Chris Bombardier became the first person with hemophilia to reach the top of Everest.

In the four years before 2017, 46 people died, with higher numbers due to avalanches. Some of the biggest dangers come from the cold, falls, avalanches, and high altitude, which can trigger altitude sickness. On April 30, Ueli Steck, described as the greatest climber of his time, was warming up for an Everest-Lhotse summit attempt with a solo climb on Nuptse when he fell over 3000 feet. He had previously survived a fall off Annapurna when trying to solo climb it alpine style. Steck was famous for modern alpine accomplishments including holding the speed record on the Matterhorn's north face, and summiting every peak over 4000 meters in the Alps in 61 days (1 day short of the record). A trekker to base camp died of altitude sickness in March. 85-year-old Min Bahadur Sherchan died on May 6 at Everest base camp in Nepal. He became the oldest man to summit Mount Everest in 2008 at the age of 76, a record that stood until 2013. He returned in 2017 to summit the mountain again. One of his goals in doing this was to inspire and encourage people as they get older. The weekend of May 19‚Äì21 claimed four more climbers from various causes. The climbers came from India, Australia, the United States, and Slovakia. Goth Kubir Rai, a Nepali porter, died at base camp in May. There were reports of four bodies found in a tent in May, which were later found to be false. Corpse retrievals The bodies of two people who died the previous year, Goutam Ghosh and Paresh Nath, were removed in 2017. The two had been unable to be retrieved previously because of inclement weather. The body of Ueli Steck was recovered near Nuptse, where he had fallen. A recovery operation took place for the body of Vladimir Strba, who died at Camp IV (Nepal-side) in May. At the end of May, the body of Ravi Kumar was recovered from above 8000 meters and without loss of additional life. Kumar's body had fallen into a crevasse and the effort to recover it was described as \\"the most complex recovery mission to ever be attempted on Everest\\". There was a strong push to recover the body before the window of good weather closed, as the monsoon season to the south grew in force. ==Medical science== The Xtreme Everest project continued its multi-year mission to study how the body adapts to high altitude and the physiological changes that occur. ==See also== * 2015 Mount Everest avalanche * Lhotse ==ReferencesExternal links== *EverestER report Category:Mount Everest Category:2017 in Nepal Category:History of mountaineering ","title":"Mount Everest in 2017"},{"id":"54092876","text":"Eucithara macteola is a small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.WoRMS (2009).

However, the student hierarchy in this school is not determined by academic performance or athletic ability, but rather by gambling. Students are ranked by their monetary contributions to the student council, which fuels an intricate gambling system where students freely bet their fortunes against one another after class. Those who win earn popularity, prestige and connections, while those who lose and fall into debt become \\"house pets\\" slaves to the whims of the remainder of the student body, nicknamed \\"Doggy\\" or \\"Kitty\\" (‚ÄúFido‚Äù or ‚ÄúMittens‚Äù in the dub) depending on gender and identified with a collar-like tag around their necks. Pets who are unable to clear their debts by the graduation receive \\"Life Schedules\\" which dictate their futures as they pay their debts with their lives. Plot Second-year transfer student Yumeko Jabami is a beautiful, cheerful and intelligent high school girl at first glance, but deep inside she is a compulsive gambler who gambles for the thrill of it, unlike students that do so for financial or social gain.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by co-executive producer Robert Hull and directed by Rob Bailey. It was first broadcast on June 5, 2017. The episode marks the introduction of Solomon Grundy to the show. ==Plot== Bruce withdraws the sword from Alfred's chest, spurning Ra's al Ghul's crowning as his heir. Ra's indicates Bruce to use the Lazarus Pit to heal Alfred and leaves. Bruce takes water from the Pit and pours it on Alfred's wound, waking him up. He then takes him to the hospital. Selina arrives later on, having heard about Alfred's condition, but is dismissed by Bruce for her flippancy. She counters that her actions have been based on what she considers surviving in Gotham, and that unlike Bruce, she's accepted who she is. In the GCPD, Gordon receives a call from Lee, who is planning on leaving Gotham and wants him to join her. Gordon decides to leave with her in order to stay together. Nygma and Barbara begin to send demands to the mayor's office in exchange for the antidote, demanding Cobblepot in return. Gordon and Bullock then take Cobblepot out of his cell in order to bargain with them but Nygma has taken Tetch, planning on killing Cobblepot once and for all. Gordon and Bullock take Cobblepot to a factory where Nygma holds Tetch with a bomb connected to him in order to kill him if the deal goes awry. The meeting is interrupted by Barbara, Tabitha and Butch who try to retrieve Tetch. Cobblepot breaks free, knocks out Nygma and escapes in the police cruiser with him in the backseat. Seeing they cannot escape in time, Gordon cuts Tetch's throat to retrieve his blood for the antidote and he and Bullock return to the GCPD to develop the cure. Unfortunately, Gordon finally succumbs to the virus and leaves the precinct. He tries to inject Lee with the antidote but he fails multiple times. While he and Lee escape through the train station, Bullock intercepts them but Gordon attacks him while Lee boards the train. Harvey urges him to remember his calling, and affirms his friendship with Jim before giving him his badge back with another vial of the antidote on the back. In the train, Gordon injects himself and Lee, freeing them from the virus. Barbara confronts Butch about the betrayal and shoots him in the head. She then confronts Tabitha in one of their safe houses and ends up fighting, culminating in Tabitha using her whip to cause an electroshock that kills Barbara. Nygma breaks free of Cobblepot's handcuffs and apparently goads him into returning to the port where he shot Cobblepot. However, this is part of Cobblepot's plan, having emptied Nygma's gun and reveals that Ivy and Fries followed them in order to complete his task: to contain Nygma as a reminder to never let love weaken him again. Cobblepot then has Fries freeze Nygma as he comes after him in indignant fury. Alfred finally wakes up from the coma and comforts Bruce, urging him to forge his destiny based on what he loves. Wanting to find security and influence, Selina goes to The Sirens and gains mentorship under Tabitha, even testing her whip. Gordon receives a letter from Lee, stating that she is leaving Gotham but that she believes in him. Cobblepot and Ivy display Nygma's frozen body as a new sculpture for their new club: the Iceberg Lounge. Butch's body is revealed to be on life support in the hospital and the doctors find that his birth name was changed from Cyrus Gold. In the final scene, a young girl and her family wander through Crime Alley when they are assaulted by a mugger. Suddenly, a vigilante is shown attacking the mugger and escaping to a building rooftop. The vigilante is revealed to be Bruce. ==Production== Development In March 2017, Drew Powell announced that the twenty-second and final episode of the season would be titled \\"Heavydirtysoul\\" and was to be written by Robert Hull and directed by Rob Bailey. The episode is named after the Twenty One Pilots song of the same name. Writing In August 2016, the producers talked about introducing Harley Quinn into the series despite the character's success in the film Suicide Squad. Executive producer John Stephens explained that they would rather see a \\"proto-version\\" of Harley Quinn possibly in the third or fourth season. He also added introducing \\"proto-versions\\" of Killer Croc and Solomon Grundy in the show. In January 2017, the producers began to hint about Quinn's appearance in the third season finale with Stephens claiming that \\"we might see her in episode 22\\" and that the character would be the \\"launching point\\" for the central plot of season 4 and finally a few days before the episode, David Mazouz claimed the character would appear in the episode; consequently, a young girl (played by Meggie Vilcina) whose family Bruce Wayne rescues in the final moments of the episode is dressed in the color scheme of Quinn. In a June 2017 TVLine article, it was confirmed that there were no further plans at that time to feature Quinn on the show. The episode also confirmed Solomon Grundy's debut in the series, revealing that Butch Gilzean was in fact born with the name \\"Cyrus Gold\\", the alter ego of Grundy. According to Drew Powell, he discovered about the revelation shortly after season 3 stated filming. Casting During Gotham second season, media began to speculate that James Frain's character in the show would, in fact, be Ra's al Ghul, citing many similarities between the characters but the speculation ended when the character was killed off. However, on March 2, 2017, Alexander Siddig was cast to portray Ra's al Ghul. He was described as being the leader behind the Court of Owls and also the leader of the League of Shadows. Chris Chalk and Michael Chiklis don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In May 2017, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Jada Pinkett Smith as Fish Mooney, Alexander Siddig as Ra's al Ghul, Camila Perez as Bridgit Pike/Firefly, Nathan Darrow as Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze, and B. D. Wong as Hugo Strange. ==Reception== Viewers Airing back to back with the previous episode, the episode was watched by 3.03 million viewers with a 0.9/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49.

The episode received a rating of 100% with an average score of 8.07 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.2 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gothams never been able to land their finales quite right, and this giant, sprawling attempt to include and incorporate the show's entire ensemble wasn't any different really - but it was still the best finale to date after three years. Perhaps it's because we are getting closer to the end and Bruce is already dabbling in nocturnal vigilantism and Catwoman's ready to become less neutral good and more neutral evil.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"With exception to my one little quibble, the finale of Gotham proved to be a launching point toward the Batman story. It was emotional, it was action-packed and intense, and left little to be desired. I'm already excited for the show to premiere in the fall.\\" Amanda Bell of EW gave the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote, \\"This half of Gothams third season has been filled with so many moving parts that, at times, it's been a bit dizzying to keep track of who wants to kill whom and why. But tonight's two-part finale sews up those dangling threads rather seamlessly and presents a new and, dare I say, optimistic vision for the future of this city.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of Collider wrote, \\"Gothams two-part Season 3 finale took the series' most significant step forward, even offering up a proto-Dark Knight, in an effort to merge who these characters are with the figures they become. Like all great Batman stories, it did so by circling back to my original question, and attempting to show the true face of Gotham City itself.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Gotham finished off its third season with a two-hour finale that was mind-blowing in every way possible. It was a thrilling end that took us places we never thought Gotham would go.\\" Robert Yanis, Jr. of Screenrant wrote, \\"The two-part finale -- consisting of \\"Destiny Calling\\" and \\"Heavydirtysoul\\"‚Äîmanaged to both tie up loose ends of the season 3 arc and reinvigorate the series as it heads into season 4 later this year.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek wrote, \\"It feels like a new chapter in this show is starting -- one that may finally see Gotham's heroes given the same narrative chances as its villains.\\" Megan Vick of TV Guide wrote, \\"For an ending, it's a promising beginning to the show's upcoming fourth season.\\" Accolades Sean Pertwee was named as honorable mention for TVLine's \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of June 4, 2017, for his performance in this episode. The site states, \\"Sean Pertwee made us feel the latter's fight to lure his ward away from the darkness, and toward a destiny as, you know, the Dark Knight.\\" The episode also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in a Supporting Role. ==References External links == * * Category:Gotham (season 3) episodes Category:2017 American television episodes ","title":"Heavydirtysoul (Gotham)"},{"id":"54092986","text":"Lukas Daschner (born 1 October 1998) is a German professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for FC St. Pauli. ==Career== Daschner signed his first professional contract with MSV Duisburg in April 2017.

In addition the artist Araz and J's sister, Lauren are marrying so Araz can get residency documents to live in the United States. Araz's parents cannot come to the United States and wish to see him, but Araz fears that if he comes to Iran, he will never return to the U.S. The ending is deliberately left unclear. ==Cast== * Rhys Fehrenbacher as J * Koohyar Hosseini as Araz * Nicole Coffineau as Lauren * Norma Moruzzi as Mom * Diana Torres as Diana ==Production== At the time of production, Rhys Fehrenbacher, portraying J, was in the process of transitioning as a trans man; Ghazvinizadeh met Fehrenbacher in Chicago while researching the transgender population in that city. The recording of the dialog took place after the production of the film; on many occasions the faces and mouths of the actors are off screen or obscured while they speak. Nick Schager of Variety stated that \\"While one would like to give the film the benefit of the doubt and say that the audio/video disconnect is another reflection of J‚Äôs internal divide, it mostly feels like a technical miscalculation\\". According to Baughan, \\"the film‚Äôs enigmatic aesthetic\\" makes it obvious that the director learned under Abbas Kiarostami. ==Accolades== Ghazvinizadeh received the George C. Lin Emerging Filmmaker Award at the San Diego Asian Film Festival 2017. ==Reception== Schager stated that They \\"is far too airless and artificial to make much theatrical headway after its Cannes premiere\\"; he cited the \\"performances [that] are as wooden as the dialogue\\" and the director being \\"determined to attune her material to J‚Äôs stuck-in-the- middle unease\\" to the point that They \\"prevents any empathetic engagement with her protagonist‚Äôs dilemma.\\" Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter praised \\"dream-like visual style\\" and \\"its treatment of a subject that has rarely been seen on screen\\", while he argued that the \\"naturalistic performances [...] are not always up to the par\\". Mintzer stated that the transition from the focus on J to the focus on the Iranian Americans \\"slightly deepen[s] our interest\\" in the Iranian boyfriend but \\"[pushes] J out of the picture\\", and that their conflict was less interesting than that of J. In regards to the actors, he stated \\"soft-spoken and endearing Fehrenbacher brings some emotional depth to the proceedings\\" but \\"neither Coffineau or Hosseini comes across as very captivating performers\\". Nikki Baughan of Screen Daily stated that \\"They is a remarkable multi-layered debut which inspires further investigation\\" and that Fehrenbacher's performance was \\"achingly naturalistic\\" due to his real-life gender transitioning. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:2017 directorial debut films Category:Iranian-American culture Category:Transgender in the United States Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:2017 LGBT-related films Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Transgender-related films ","title":"They (2017 film)"},{"id":"54093064","text":"Brucknell may refer to: *Brucknell, Victoria, town in Australia *Kitty Brucknell, singer-songwriter ","title":"Brucknell"},{"id":"54093081","text":"The Stroud and District Combination Bill Adams Cup is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organised by the Stroud and District Combination ‚Äì one of the five bodies that make up the Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union.

First flown in 1925, it was built in small numbers. ==Design and development== The Standard J-1 military trainer had been built in large numbers at the end of World War I. With many surplus after the war, it was a natural choice for adaptation by several manufacturers. Ariel Service, with the experienced designer Harvey Mummert who was an early collaborator with Glenn Curtiss, produced the Mercury Standard 6W-3 by combining a completely new wing with a Standard J fuselage and empennage, modified to accommodate four passengers rather than a student and with a new and more powerful engine. The Standard 6W-3 was a single bay biplane with constant chord, straight-edged wings swept at 5¬∞ and with a more modern, thicker airfoil than most of those used during WWI. Its upper wing was flat but the lower one had 1.5¬∞ of dihedral. There were balanced ailerons on the upper wing. Both wings were wooden structures based on twin spruce box spars with the lower wing attached to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper wing braced to it. without stagger, by a pair of vertical interplane struts on each side between the spars. The narrow centre section, where the chord was reduced to improve the pilot's upward field of view, was supported over the fuselage with pairs of N-form cabane struts. Its modified Standard fuselage, with new longerons and covering, now housed a six-cylinder, water-cooled inline Curtiss C-6 engine with a honeycomb radiator in front of it and a fuel tank in the upper wing. Immediately behind it a new, large, under-wing cockpit with seats for four passengers, two in aft-facing side-by-side seats and two more opposite them. The seats were easily replaceable, allowing the 6W-3 to act as a mailplane. The pilot was in a separate cockpit behind the passengers with a large fairing behind his head. The empennage was conventional, with a low aspect ratio tailplane and generous elevators mounted on top of the fuselage. The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder. The 6W-3 had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear with wheels on a single axle held by twin V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons. Rubber cord shock absorbers were fitted. The first flight was in 1925. Fewer than ten were built. ==Specifications == Mercury Standard 6W-3 3-view drawing from Les Ailes February 18,1926 ==References== Category:1920s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1925 ","title":"Aerial Engineering Corporation Standard 6W-3"},{"id":"54093222","text":"Tang Huo-shen (; born 29 October 1956) is a Taiwanese politician.

He has criticized the Executive Yuan for funding civic groups that enable former government officials to collect an income in addition to their pensions. During his legislative tenure, Tang has repeatedly drawn attention to the increasing personnel costs of the Republic of China Armed Forces, maintaining that he favors military spending to be focused on weaponry and research instead. As a legislator, Tang participated in many discussions about the state of Taiwan's military. He has frequently proposed that the government purchase military equipment from other nations.

The Jew clause () is in the vernacular name of the second paragraph of the Constitution of Norway from 1814 to 1851. The clause, in its original form, banned Jews from entering Norway, and also forbade Jesuits and monastic orders. An exception was made for so-called Portuguese Jews. The penultimate sentence of the same paragraph is known as the Jesuit clause (). The clause roughly translates as: Christian Magnus Falsen, Georg Sverdrup and Nicolai Wergeland were the central delegates behind the wording of the section's final paragraph. The wording was adopted on May 4, 1814. This paragraph was finalized in Constitutional Committee and adopted after discussion, but without changes in the plenary. On June 13, 1851, after tireless efforts by the poet Henrik Wergeland (the son of the clause's architect Nicolai Wergeland), as well as politician Peder Jensen Fauchald, school principal Hans Holmboe, and others, the Norwegian parliament deleted the article from the constitution, and thereby lifted the ban against Jews, who were thus awarded religious rights on par with Christian dissenters. ==See also== * History of the Jews in Norway ==References== Category:Jewish Norwegian history Category:Expulsions of Jews Category:Constitution of Norway Category:1814 in Norway Category:Religious expulsion orders ","title":"Jew clause"},{"id":"54093383","text":"Ed Park (born 1970 in Buffalo, New York) is an American journalist and novelist.

She batted and threw right handed.Annie Gosbee ‚Äì Profile / Biography. All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Retrieved 2019-04-10. Annie Gosbee played the last two seasons of the All American League with two different clubs and was a member of the 1953 AAGPBL championship team. A native of Essex, Massachusetts, Annie was one of six children born to Roy and Maude Gosbee. She had two brothers and three sisters. Since an early age, Annie interested in baseball and enjoyed catching for her elder brother Billy, who wanted to be a pitcher and made her his catcher. They would practice regularly after school and whenever school was not in session. Besides, she would play sandlot ball with the local boys after school in a field near the Essex River. Gosbee attended Rufus Choate Elementary School in Essex, where she played for the school baseball team and was the only girl on it. She also played in the girls‚Äô basketball team for four years, eventually being named its captain in her senior year. At the time, the only organized sport open to women was the rifle team competition, and she excelled at that. As a teenager, she played second base on the Essex Legion team in the Cape Ann Junior League Conference, becoming just one of two girls to play on junior league baseball teams in the area. Avis Ruth Murray, a member of the Gloucester team, was the other. In addition, Annie extended her talents as an all-around woman in golf, tennis and volleyball. But Gosbee pursued her love of baseball by playing on a professional league and attended an All American League tryout held in Everett in 1950, even though she did not succeed in her attempt to join the league. Nevertheless, she tried out again in 1953 during her senior year of high school. She then earned money for the trip west to Michigan by washing dishes in a local restaurant before her high school graduation. In her 1953 yearbook, Gosbee had listed three characteristic interests: to play in the All American League, to own the Boston Red Sox, and Babe Zaharias; a prominent athlete who achieved a great deal of success in golf, basketball, baseball and track and field. Finally, Gosbee joined the All American League tryout and broke into the Grand Rapids Chicks team roster in 1953. She was used by manager Woody English primarily as a backup at second base for Alma Ziegler.Madden, W. C. (2000) All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book. McFarland & Company. Moreover, she represented her team in the All-Star Game as a shortstop replacement. At the end of the season, Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs and beat the Rockford Peaches in the best-of-three series first round, 2‚Äì1. The Chicks later swept the Kalamazoo Lassies in the final series, 2‚Äì0, to win the championship. Afterwards, Gosbee returned to Essex to complete her high school graduation requirements. In 1954, she split her time between Grand Rapids and Rockford, during what turned out to be the All-American League's final season. In a 75-game career, Annie posted an average of .136 (16-for-118) with 22 runs scored and seven RBI while stealing one base. She went 0-for-1 in the playoffs. At the field, she recorded 89 putouts with 87 assists and turned 17 double plays, while committing 15 errors in 191 total chances for a combined .922 fielding average. After the league folded, Gosbee moved to California, where two of her siblings lived. She then attended Los Angeles City College and continued her involvement in sports, while teaching classes and playing nonprofessional basketball. Additionally, she went to work as a library technician in the area. She died in 1976 in an automobile accident in Glendale, California, after being hit by a car while trying to cross a street. She was 40 year old. In 1988, Annie Gosbee received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.Before A League of Their Own.

He served as a Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand from 1733 until his death in 1751. He was one of the most diligent and conscientious bishops in the era of state-run pietism during the 1700s in Denmark-Norway under King Christian VI. ==Personal life== Jacob K√¶rup was born on 13 September 1682 in the village of Nakskov on the island of Lolland in southern Denmark. He was born to the merchant and local leader Peder K√¶rup and his wife Margrete Jacobsdatter, who was the daughter of a priest. He was married in Copenhagen in 1712 to Helene Cathrine Brinch, the widow of the Danish priest Hans Hansen Hagerup (1682-1711). He died on 29 August 1751 in Christianssand in Norway. ==Education and career== Jacob K√¶rup was educated at the Latin school at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1701. In 1703, he received his Baccalaureate degree and continued his studies at Borchs Kollegium in Copenhagen. After some time as a teacher, he defended his theological thesis and in 1707 became a student under the Bishop of Copenhagen, Henrik Bornemann. He took his theological exam in 1711 in Copenhagen and in 1712, he got his Master of Philosophy degree. After all of his studying, he was hired in 1711 to work as the resident chaplain at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. After seventeen years there, he was promoted to head parish priest and dean there in 1728. On 27 April 1733, he was appointed by the King of Denmark-Norway to be the Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand in southern Norway. The year after he became bishop, there was a major fire, burning two-thirds of the city of Christianssand including the church and school. This led to much poverty and lack of resources for his people. His time as bishop was during a time of state pietism whereby the King endorsed legislation that sought to make all of his subjects behave like good Christians and Bishop K√¶rup did what he could to carry out those laws. In particular, he sought to put in place a good educational system in his diocese to allow the people of the diocese to become more educated, especially after the 1736 law which made Confirmation mandatory. He served as bishop until his death in 1751 at the age of 69. He was described by Mich. Tyrholm as a good bishop having \\"the zeal of faith, thorough teaching, godly living, right- mindedness, a humble walk, and unremitting haste.\\" ==References== Category:1682 births Category:1751 deaths Category:Bishops of Agder og Telemark Category:18th-century Lutheran bishops ","title":"Jacob K√¶rup"},{"id":"54093834","text":"Corporate is a 2017 French movie written and directed by Nicolas Silhol.Allocin√© note == Plot == √âmilie Tesson-Hansen is an ambitious HR manager working in a big company.

According to Don Stine, president of the Asbury Park Historical Society, there was an integration of races, cultures, and musical styles at the Upstage. Up to that point in Asbury's history, Black bands did not play the boardwalk clubs, and it was rare for white musicians to perform in the African-American music scene of Springwood Avenue on the West Side. Garry Tallent, future E Street Band bassist, was an exception. In 1969, Clarence Clemons joined Norman Seldin's Joyful Noyze, and eventually, musicians of all colors were jamming at the Upstage.

Dennis Farnon was born in 1923 in Toronto, Canada as John Denis Farnon to Robert and Elsie Farnon (n√©e Menzies). He grew up in a musical family, and learned to play the trumpet at age 12. Through his older brother Robert, he enlisted into the Canadian Army Band, also travelling to Europe to entertain the Allied troops during the last years of the war. In his mid-20s, he moved to Chicago where he played in jazz clubs and pursued studies in conducting, arranging, and orchestration, strongly influenced by the works of Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, B√©la Bart√≥k and Sergey Prokofiev. Several years later, he accepted an invitation to Hollywood as musical director for singer Johnny Holiday, and he stayed, continuing to compose, conduct and arrange. In 1956, he was tapped by RCA Records to head their West Coast A & R and signed on as producer, arranger and recording artist. During that time, the Dennis Farnon Orchestra recorded numerous albums, including Magoo in Hi-Fi, over 10 episodes of Mr Magoo cartoon shorts, Chet Atkins in Hollywood, Velvet Carpet ‚Äì The George Shearing's Quintet, The Enchanted Woods, Songs From The Motion Picture Gigi with singers Gogi Grant and Tony Martin (American singer), and Caution! Men Swinging. In 1957, he was one of the five founding members (along with Paul Weston, Lloyd Dunn, Jesse Kaye, and Sonny Burke) of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (now known as The Recording Academy) \\\\- the organisation which bestows the annual Grammy Awards. In the early 1960s he moved to London, where he learnt about library music and signed up with a number of publishing companies such as Boosey and Hawkes, KPM (now EMI) and Chappell Music. Over the course of the next 20 years, he went on to compose and publish a large volume of library music licensed for film, television, radio and other media. The styles ranged from jazz, funk, drama and romantic to his personal favourite, comedy music, which more recently has appeared in The Ren and Stimpy Show and SpongeBob SquarePants. His movie credits include the score for the 1966 Tony Curtis film Arrivederci, Baby!. For television, he composed music for some episodes of the British children‚Äôs series Follyfoot (1971) and wrote the theme for the London Weekend Television production Bouquet of Barbed Wire (1976). As with his brothers Brian and Robert, Dennis Farnon specialised in light music and orchestral arrangements of well-known standards, sometimes writing under the pseudonyms of Paul Gerard and John Dennis. Farnon resided for a short time in Cascais, Portugal, where he worked with various Portuguese composers-singers including Fernando Tordo, Carlos do Carmo and S√©rgio Borges. In 1979 he moved again and settled in the Netherlands. He continued writing, producing solo and chamber pieces with the classical guitarist Yves Storms and composing various short piano pieces. In the mid-1990s he was invited to the Hilversum recording studios to work with the celebrated Dutch Metropole Orchestra on a digitally recorded version of the Mother Magoo Suite. The films Reversal of Fortune (1990), Fever Pitch (2005) and numerous popular television series such as Spiderman, Doctor Who, Sons and Daughters, Prisoner (TV series) and Flying Doctors also carry credits for his work. He continued to write short piano compositions right up until his death, always favouring lighthearted comical tunes to make people laugh, with titles such as The Camel with the Wooden Leg, Two Doves on a Chimneypot, Grass Valley and Friend, Ms. Penguin and Twinkletoes and Me.

Built in 1868, it is the only surviving district school building in the town. Now a local museum, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. ==Description and history== The Sandy Pond School is located at the northwest corner of the threeway junction of Westford, Sandy Pond, and Willow Streets in eastern Ayer. It is a single-story brick building, with a small shingled wood-frame ell attached. It is covered by a gabled roof, and is oriented facing roughly south. Its main facade is symmetrical, with sash windows flanking the entrance, and another sash window in the gable above. The entrance is recessed under a segmented arch. The interior has tongue-and-groove flooring, beadboard, wainscoting with blackboards and plastering above. The school was built in 1868, when the area was part of Groton. It served as Groton's district 11 school until 1871, when Ayer was incorporated. Local parents resisted consolidation of the school into a graded elementary school until 1906, when streetcar service was introduced on Sandy Pond Road. The school was closed in that year, and has been owned by a local nonprofit organization since then. It has housed reunions of school attendees, community meetings, dances, and other social events. The ell was added in the 1910s to provide a kitchen space for these types of events. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Schools in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Ayer, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ","title":"Sandy Pond School"},{"id":"54093986","text":"\\"I Only Lie When I Love You\\" is a song by English hard rock band Royal Blood, released as the second overall single from their second studio album How Did We Get So Dark? on June 8, 2017.

He was born at Kensington and died at Westminster, both in London. Crocker was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was played as a lower-order batsman and a second-line bowler in his first-class matches, though it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed, nor what style of bowler he was. He was one of the successes of the 1894 freshmen's cricket trial at Cambridge, taking six wickets for 66 runs in the first innings. His second match for the university in 1894 was his best: against a side raised by A. J. Webbe, he made scores of 29 and 16 and took two wickets in the first innings, though he was not among the eight bowlers used in the Webbe XI's second innings. But he did not succeed in subsequent matches and dropped out of the Cambridge team without being awarded a Blue. He played for Hertfordshire in the year before the Minor Counties Championship was instituted, but never played in a Minor Counties match. Crocker graduated from Cambridge University in 1897 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and went into business. He served with the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) and the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) in the First World War and saw action in France, Egypt and at Gallipoli. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1874 births Category:1944 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge ","title":"Jonathan Crocker"},{"id":"54094028","text":"Sabrina Mar (born ) is an American gymnast.

Together with the bull Decet Romanum pontificem of 1622, it formed the canonical basis for papal elections until the 20th century. The bull brought about many reforms to the papal election system, created structured rules, and sought to decrease the influence of organized factions within the College of Cardinals during the conclave as well as decrease the influence of secular monarchs on papal elections. It established general rules for the conclave process, while the later bull Decet Romanum pontificem addressed the ceremonial aspects of papal elections. ==Background== Pope Gregory XV issued the bull Conclave reform had been a topic that most popes since Pope Julius II had been engaged in, but to little impact because most often the pope would die before being able to issue a bull containing reforms. Contemporary sources present Aeterni Patris Filius as being the culmination of reforms started by Julius with his constitution Cum tam divino in 1505 and continued by other popes, but more recent scholarship has questioned whether there is full continuity between the various conclave reform efforts. Gregory sought wide input from the reforms, and heard arguments from Robert Bellarmine and Federico Borromeo, who advocated for an end to election by acclamation because it made it impossible to determine how many votes were cast and prevented secrecy in the elections. Other more radical reforms were suggested, including a plan where the conclave would take place in front of the deceased pope's body, and only the top six candidates from the first round could be voted on in future scrutinies with a successive candidate being dropped each day if a pope was not elected. While this plan was seen as having an advantage of lasting at most a week, Gregory ultimately rejected it as being too radical. ==Reforms== Gregory instituted the rule that to win election by scrutiny, a candidate must secure two-thirds of the votes of the electors in the conclave in a secret ballot. This reform decreased the power of the leaders of individual factions in the conclave and angered many Catholic monarchs. Gregory did not eliminate election by acclamation as Bellarmine and Borromeo sought, but he did make it impossible without first taking a secret ballot, and the rules set forth in the bull anticipated election by a written secret ballot. Before casting their votes, cardinals were required to take an oath swearing to vote for an individual they believed to be worthy of the papacy and to write their votes on pieces of paper that contained the words \\"I choose as Supreme Pontiff my Lord Cardinal...\\" These oaths were intended to prevent cardinals from voting for their friends or casting joke ballots, while the wording of the paper ballots set the expectation that the next pope would be a cardinal, even though Aeterni Patris Filius did not explicitly prohibit the electors from voting for individuals who were not members of the College. These reforms, together with Gregory's 1622 bull Decet Romanum pontificem, formed the basis of papal elections until the 20th century, when every pope except Benedict XV and John Paul I made changes to the rules governing papal elections. ==See also== * Romano Pontifici eligendo * Universi Dominici gregis ==References== Category:17th- century papal bulls Category:1622 works Category:Latin texts ","title":"Aeterni Patris Filius"},{"id":"54094034","text":"John Luther Boatright (1923-2006) was an American painter, primarily known for his use of light-filled atmospheres and shadow in landscapes with expansive cloud formations.

Looking north-west from within the chancel. Part of the brightly decorated, higher, chancel screen is visible beyond A parclose screen is a screen or railing used to enclose or separate-off a chantry chapel, tomb or manorial chapel, from public areas of a church, for example from the nave or chancel. It should be distinguished from the chancel screen which separates the chancel from the nave, in order to restrict access to the former to clerics and other select persons. ==Location== As many chantry chapels and manorial chapels were situated at the east end (closest to the holy city of Jerusalem) of the north or south aisles, next to the chancel, frequently they lay within the area enclosed by the chancel screen. ==Function== The parclose screen is designed to restrict physical access to those unauthorised to enter, yet still to allow a good view into the restricted area and the entry of sunlight, and also, most importantly, to allow for communication with the high altar in the chancel during the elevation of the host at mass. This is usually achieved by the use of tracery to form the screen. Where a solid masonry wall is used instead of a screen, a hagioscope or squint is required to serve the same purpose. Parclose screens are made of stone or wood and are often decoratively carved, frequently featuring the coats of arms of the family concerned. ==Etymology== The word derives from the French noun parcloseCollins Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Edition, London, 1986, p.1116 (f), from the Latin verb claudo, \\"to close\\" plus the preposition per, \\"through, along, over\\". Larousse, Dictionnaire de la langue francise, \\"Lexis\\", Paris, 1979, pp.1332,1327,361; Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, pp.102,400 ==History== In England, the use of parclose screens was largely discontinued in the 16th century after the Reformation, and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries when chantries were dissolved. There was therefore no further need to have several altars in the same church, each serving a separate private chantry chapel. The concept of the manorial chapel was also discontinued a few centuries after, when burials inside churches and manorial chapels were discontinued. The manorial pew, not screened-off from the congregation, replaced the screened-off manorial chapel. Many fine examples of mediaeval parclose screens survive in the parish churches and cathedrals of England. ==References== Category:Architectural elements Category:Church architecture Category:Catholic liturgy Category:Screens (partitions) ","title":"Parclose screen"},{"id":"54094123","text":"Isaiah Turner (born August 7, 1998) is an American Internet entrepreneur and software engineer.

They also have less chance of tangling the filament while it unwinds from the spool. Additionally, they reduce the mass of the extrusion carriage because it doesn't have to hold a stepper motor. This allows for faster changes in print head movement direction, increased print speed, increased accuracy, and decreased instances of artifacting or ghosting along the x and y axes. ==Disadvantages== Because Bowden extruders push filament through a long and curved tube, more friction must be overcome compared with direct drive extruders. To partially mitigate these friction forces, the tube is made of PTFE, which has a low coefficient of friction. Flexible filaments do not print well because the filament flexes inside the tube and clogs up the machine. ==References== Category:Fused filament fabrication Category:3D printing ","title":"Bowden extruder"},{"id":"54094164","text":"The 1st Golden Melody Awards ceremony () was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei on 6 January 1990.http://isrc.ncl.edu.tw/kinglist.aspx ==Winners== { class= style=\\"width=100%\\" - !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Song of the Year !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Lyricist -  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"I Want A Home\\" ‚Äì Pan Mei-chen  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"Threads of Love\\" ‚Äì Chang Ching-chou - !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Composer !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Arrangement -  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"About the Past\\" ‚Äì Cheng Chen-ming  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"Love to the High\\" ‚Äì Chen Yang - !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Music Video !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Music Video Director -  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"The Story Of Youngest\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  * \\"The Story Of Youngest\\" ‚Äì Chang Ta-lung - !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Male Vocalist !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Female Vocalist -  valign=\\"top\\"  * Johnny Yin  valign=\\"top\\"  * Jody Chiang - !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best Vocal Collaboration !style=\\"width=50%\\"  Best New Artist -  valign=\\"top\\"  * Zhi Ji Er Chong Chang  valign=\\"top\\"  * Sky Wu - !style=\\"width=50%\\" Special Contribution Award !style=\\"width=50%\\"  -  valign=\\"top\\"  * Chen Ta-ju * Zhuang Nu  valign=\\"top\\"  } ==ReferencesExternal links== * 1st Golden Melody Awards nominees * 1st Golden Melody Awards winners Category:Golden Melody Awards Golden Melody Awards Category:1990 music awards ","title":"1st Golden Melody Awards"},{"id":"54094167","text":"The 14th Annual Premios Juventud (Youth Awards) were broadcast by Univision on July 6, 2017.

He served as a Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand from 1720 until his death in 1733. ==Personal life== Christopher Nyrop was born on 29 March 1680 in L√∏dingen, Norway. His parents were the priest Hans Nyrop and his wife Benedicte Mikkelsdatter Storm. Nyrop was married in 1706 to Malene Glad, but she died about a year later. He then married Elisabeth Kirstine Hiort. Both wives were daughters of priests. Christopher Nyrop died on his 53rd birthday, 29 March 1733 in Christianssand, Norway. ==Education and career== Nyrop attended school in Bergen, graduating in 1697 and completing his exams in 1700. In 1705, he was hired as a chaplain in the parish of Eid, based in Nordfjordeid. It was here that he met his first wife, she was the daughter of the parish priest for Eid, Poul Glad. In 1708, he was sentenced for document forgery, so he left Norway and moved to Copenhagen. He got a job in 1710 as a ship's priest. In 1711, he was hired as the parish priest of Herrested on the island of Fyn. In 1714, he was hired as the parish priest in the nearby city of Nyborg, the same year, he earned his master's degree. On 21 June 1720, he was named to the office of Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand back in Norway. He was described as a wise leader, who was clever and eloquent and was like a father to his priests. He was also authoritative and orthodox, resisting the pietist movement that was beginning during his time as bishop. He held that position until his death on 29 March 1733 in Christianssand, Norway. ==References== Category:1680 births Category:1733 deaths Category:People from L√∏dingen Category:Bishops of Agder og Telemark Category:18th-century Lutheran bishops ","title":"Christopher Nyrop"},{"id":"54094193","text":"The 2nd Golden Melody Awards ceremony () was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei, on 27 October 1990. ==ReferencesExternal links== * 2nd Golden Melody Awards nominees * 2nd Golden Melody Awards winners Category:Golden Melody Awards Golden Melody Awards Category:1990 music awards ","title":"2nd Golden Melody Awards"},{"id":"54094199","text":"Chernow is a surname.

The data were collected in farmers' fields.H.J. Nijland and S. El Guindy, Crop yields, watertable depth and soil salinity in the Nile Delta, Egypt. In: Annual report 1983, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Salt tolerance of crops is the maximum salt level a crop tolerates without losing its productivity while it is affected negatively at higher levels. The salt level is often taken as the soil salinity or the salinity of the irrigation water. Salt tolerance is of importance in irrigated lands in (semi)arid regions where the soil salinity problem can be extensive as a result of the salinization occurring here. It concerns hundreds of millions of hectares.R.Brinkman, 1980. Saline and sodic soils. In: Land reclamation and water management, p. 62‚Äì68. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. A regional distribution of the 3,230,000 km¬≤ of saline land worldwide is shown in salt affected area based on the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World. Additionally, in areas where sprinkler irrigation is practiced, salty sprinkler water can cause considerable damage by leaf burning, whether the soil is saline or not.Government of Western Australia, Department of Agriculture and Food. Water salinity and plant irrigation. ==History== One of the first studies made on soil salinity and plant response was published in the USDA Agriculture Handbook No. 60 , 1954.L. A. Richards, Editor, 1954, Diagnosis and Improvement of saline and alkali soil, Agriculture Handbook No. 60, USDA More than 20 years later Maas and Hoffman published the results of an extensive study on salt tolerance.Maas EV, Hoffman GJ, 1977. Crop salt tolerance-current assessment. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers 103: 115‚Äì134. In 2001, a Canadian study provided a substantial amount of additional data.Alberta Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2001, Salt Tolerance of Plants A comprehensive survey of tolerances reported world wide was made by the FAO in 2002.Tanji KK, Kielen NC. 2002. Agricultural drainage water management in arid and semi-arid areas. FAO irrigation and drainage paper 61. FAO, Rome. Most studies were made with pot or drum experiments or in lysimeters under controlled conditions. The collection of field data under farmers' conditions was rare, probably due to the greater efforts and higher costs involved, the lack of control of plant growing conditions other than soil salinity, and the larger random variation in crop yields and soil salinity. Yet, with statistical methods, it is possible to detect the tolerance level from field data.D.P. Sharma, K.N. Singh and K.V.G.K Rao (1990), Crop Production and soil salinity: evaluation of field data from India. Paper published in Proceedings of the Symposium on Land Drainage for Salinity Control in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions, February 25th to March 2nd, 1990, Cairo, Egypt, Vol. 3, Session V, p. 373 ‚Äì 383.

Maas‚ÄìHoffman model for wheat production and soil salinity in farmland. The salt tolerance (breakpoint, threshold) is about ECe = 3.3 dS/m ==Classification== Soil and water salinity can be expressed in various ways. The most common parameter used in soil salinity is the electric conductivity of the extract (ECe) of a saturated soil paste in units of deciSiemens per metre (dS/m) (previously measured in millimhos per centimeter (mmho/cm)). Bernstein presented the following soil classification based on ECe in dS/m:Bernstein, L., 1964. Salt tolerance of plants. In: Agric. Inf. Bulletin. no. 283, USDA ECe 0‚Äì2 non-saline soil ECe 2‚Äì4 slightly saline, yield of sensitive crops reduced ECe 4‚Äì8 moderately saline, yield reduction of many crops ECe 8‚Äì16 saline, normal yield for salt tolerant crops only ECe > 16 reasonable crop yields only for very tolerant crops Van Genuchten‚ÄìGupta model for carrot production and soil salinity in the field Logistic sigmoid model for carrot production and soil salinity in the field Method for sigmoidal (S-curve) regression ==Modeling== A common way to present crop ‚Äì salinity data is according to the Maas‚ÄìHoffman model (see above figure): initially a horizontal line connected to a downward sloping line. The breakpoint is also called threshold or tolerance. For field data with random variation the tolerance level can be found with segmented regression.A method for segmented regression As the Maas-Hoffman model is fitted to the data by the method of least squares, the data at the tail-end influence the position of the breakpoint. Another method was described by Van Genuchten and Gupta.Van Genuchten M.Th and S.K.Gupta. 1993. A reassessment of the crop tolerance response function. Journal of the Indian Society of Soil Science, Vol. 41, No. 4, pp 730‚Äì737 It uses an inverted S-curve as shown in the left-hand figure. This model recognizes that the tail-end may have a flatter slope than the middle part. It does not provide a sharp tolerance level. Using the Maas‚ÄìHoffman model in situations with a flat trend in the tail-end may lead to a breakpoint with a low ECe value, owing to the employment of the condition to minimize the deviations of the model values from the observed values over the entire domain (i.e. including the tail-end). Using the logistic sigmoid function for the same data applied in the van Genuchten-Gupta model, the curvature becomes more pronounced and a better fit is obtained. A third model is based on the method of partial regression, whereby one finds the longest horizontal stretch (the range of no effect) of the yield-ECe relation while beyond that stretch the yield decline sets in (figure below). With this method the trend at the tail-end plays no role. As a result the tolerance level (breakpoint, threshold) is larger (4.9 dS/m) than according to the Maas- Hoffman model (3.3 dS/m, see the second figure above with the same data). Also a better fit is achieved. Various authors, Crop Yield and soil salinity in farmers' fields; data form Egypt, India and Pakistan used to find salt tolerance of crops measured in farmers' fields Partial regression is used to detect the maximum range of no influence in wheat fields. Tolerance is about ECe=5 dS/m ==Augmenting tolerance== Presently a considerable amount of research is undertaken to develop agricultural crops with a higher salt tolerance to enhance crop cultivation in salinity stricken regions. ==Leaf damage== In Australia the following classification of sprinkler irrigation water salinity was developed: {  ! Sensitivity  Chloride (mg/l)Sodium (mg/l) Affected crop -  Sensitive  <178  <114  Almond, apricot, citrus, plum -  Moderately Sensitive  178‚Äì355  114‚Äì229  Capsicum, grape, potato, tomato -  Moderately tolerant  355‚Äì710  229‚Äì458  Barley, cucumber, sweetcorn -  Tolerant  >710  >458  Cauliflower, cotton, safflower, sesame, sorghum, sunflower } ==See also== *Biosalinity *Halotolerance *Crop tolerance to seawater ==References== Category:Soil science Category:Crops ","title":"Salt tolerance of crops"},{"id":"54094317","text":"The Cathedral of our Lady of Sorrows, also called Cathedral of Mary Mother of Sorrows, is a Chaldean Catholic cathedral located in Baghdad, Iraq, dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows.

Unusually independent for a female journalist of the time, unusual altogether as a female war correspondent, she was a trailblazer for better- known female war correspondents covering later conflicts. Harper arrived in St. Petersburg via Siberia on a long slow and dirty train. Dividing her time between staff hospitals on the front line and St. Petersburg, she witnessed first hand the February revolution in St. Petersburg in 1917 and later events in July, before leaving for the U.K. in August, departing on the same boat as Emmeline Pankhurst. With war photographer Donald Thomson she created the photo book Bloodstained Russia and From Tsar to Kaiser: The betrayal of Russia. In 1918 she published Runaway Russia, describing events at greater length. After leaving Russia, she continued to report on the effects of the Revolution from Finland. Her testimony has been widely quoted in several later works covering the early stages of the revolution, for instance in Caught in the revolution by Helen Rappaport, but she is less well known than other trailblazing female journalists of the time, such as Louise Bryant who covered the October Revolution of the same year but who was arguably less independent, traveling out with her husband John Reed and arriving at around the time Harper was leaving St. Petersburg.

As a member of the Finns Party, she has represented Satakunta in the Parliament of Finland from April 2015 to July 2019. She was the Finns Party candidate for the 2018 Finnish presidential election. In 2019 Huhtasaari was elected to the European Parliament with 92,760 votes == Life and career == Huhtasaari graduated as Master of Education in 2004. She has worked as an elementary teacher and a special education teacher. She was elected to the City Council of Pori with 1,064 votes in 2012 and again with 2,566 votes in 2017. She stood in the 2014 European Parliament election and received 9,132 votes but was not elected. In 2015 Huhtasaari was elected to the Parliament with 9,259 votes. In the Parliament, she is currently member of the Legal Affairs Committee, the Education and Culture Committee and the Finnish Delegation to the Nordic Council. Huhtasaari endorsed Jussi Halla-aho for president of the Finns Party. She was elected first vice president of the Finns Party on 10 June 2017, the same day when Halla-aho was elected president. On 4 August 2017, Huhtasaari was chosen as the presidential candidate of the Finns Party. In the election, Huhtasaari placed third with 6.9 percent of the votes, while the incumbent president Sauli Niinist√∂ went on to secure his second term with a majority of votes. == Views == Huhtasaari believes that the European Union is going to collapse and Finland should leave it. She also suggest for Finland to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty and Paris Agreement especially to ban Islam from the country. Huhtasaari opposes Finland becoming a member of NATO, but supports developing cooperation with the alliance. Huhtasaari is a supporter of United States President Donald Trump.Finland‚Äôs Marine Le Pen. POLITICO. Author - Reid Standish. Published 26 January 2018. Updated 29 January 2018. Retrieved 31 March 2018. Huhtasaari is a creationist and has stated that the theory of evolution is a 'totally impossible theory'. She has also said that Finland could reject international agreements in order to prevent economic migrants from migrating to Finland. ==Thesis plagiarism== During the 2018 presidential election campaign, Huhtasaari was accused of plagiarising parts of her 2003 M.Sc. thesis. The matter was investigated by her alma mater, the University of Jyv√§skyl√§, with the conclusion that only 10 per cent of the thesis was plagiariased, and that the plagiarism was not particularly serious considering the policies of the university at the time. However, in May 2018, Finland's national public broadcasting company YLE reported that approximately 30 per cent of the thesis was plagiarised, after an YLE journalist identified a previously unknown source for the text in Huhtasaari's thesis.Yle report: Finns Party presidential candidate's master's thesis \\"systematically plagiarised\\" YLE 11.5.2018 Huhtasaari responded by claiming to have written the dissertation in good faith, relying on any shortcomings being detected during the review process. She also claimed to have followed the university's own guidance regarding citing of earlier theses, namely that such citations were (allegedly) advised against, as dissertations could not be guaranteed to be of sufficiently high academic standards. To defend her integrity, Huhtasaari published a positive employment certificate for her 1-year-tenure as a second-grade teacher at an elementary school in the Marshall islands from April 2000. The University of Jyv√§skyl√§ released its detailed report in August 2018, finding serious plagiarism and disregard for the scientific method throughout Huhtasaari's thesis. As the statute of limitations had passed, the university will not pursue further action. ==Elections contested== Presidential elections {  + ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Votes ! rowspan=\\"1\\" % ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Result - ! 2018 align=right align=right 6.9 align=center 3rd - } Parliamentary elections {  + ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Constituency ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Votes ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Result - ! 2011  Satakunta align=right align=center Backup - ! 2015  Satakunta align=right align=center Elected - !2019 Satakunta 12,986 Elected - } European Parliament elections {  + ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Constituency ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Votes ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Result - ! 2014  Finland align=right align=center Not elected - !2019 Finland 92,760 Elected - } Municipal elections {  + ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Municipality ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Constituency ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Votes ! rowspan=\\"1\\" Result - ! 2012  Pori  Satakunta align=right align=center Elected - ! 2017  Pori  Satakunta align=right align=center Elected - } == References  External links == * Official website Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Critics of Islamism Category:People from M√§ntt√§-Vilppula Category:Finnish Lutherans Category:Finns Party politicians Category:Members of the Parliament of Finland (2015‚Äì19) Category:Members of the Parliament of Finland (2019‚Äì23) Category:MEPs for Finland 2019‚Äì2024 Category:Candidates for President of Finland Category:Women members of the Parliament of Finland Category:21st-century Finnish women politicians Category:Christian creationists Category:University of Jyv√§skyl√§ alumni ","title":"Laura Huhtasaari"},{"id":"54094501","text":"The nineteenth season of the One Piece anime series was produced by Toei Animation, and directed by Toshinori Fukuzawa. The season began broadcasting in Japan on Fuji Television on April 9, 2017. Like the rest of the series, it follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates. It contains two story arcs. The first story arc, called \\"Whole Cake Island\\", adapts material from the rest of the 82nd volume to the beginning of the 90th volume of the manga by Eiichiro Oda. It deals with Luffy and his small team rescuing Sanji from his arranged marriage to finalize a political alliance between his own family, the Vinsmoke's, and Big Mom's family. The second story arc, called \\"Reverie\\", adapts material from the rest of the 90th volume. It deals with the royals from across the globe gathering for the Reverie, a seven day conference to discuss matters that could affect the world. As of October 2018, three pieces of theme music are used for this season. The opening themes are by Kishidan and Hiroshi Kitadani for episodes 783 to 806, \\"Hope\\" by Namie Amuro for episodes 807 to 855, and \\"Super Powers\\" by V6 for episodes 856 to 889. __TOC__ ==Episode list== \\"Whole Cake Island\\" \\"Reverie\\" ==Reception== Writing for Anime News Network, Sam Leach awarded the first two Reverie episodes a \\"B-\\" and \\"B\\" rating; Leach praised the character interactions, but described the lengthy flashback sequences as \\"disposable\\" and argued that at times the anime's pacing was not sympathetic to the manga material it adapted. ==Home releases== Japanese {  style=\\"text-align: center; width: 98%;\\" + Avex Pictures (Japan, Region 2/A) - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Volume !

He is responsible for the expansion and internationalization process of JBS S.A., the largest meat-packing company in the world, and one of the main agribusiness companies in Brazil, and J&F; Investimentos which he shares with his wife, Flora, and five children. He was listed in 2016 among the 70 main billionaires of Brazil by Forbes magazine. ==Corruption and influence peddling== Batista and his company are involved and pled guilty in several allegations of bribery. From September 2017 to October 2018, the Brazilian court kept Batista on remand for illegal profit on the financial market. Operation Car-Wash In July 2016, Batista was included as a suspect in the investigations of Operation Car Wash. The Brazilian Federal Police (in Portuguese, Pol√≠cia Federal or PF) charged him for alleged bribes made by his company, JBS S.A., to the former president of the Brazilian parliament Eduardo Cunha. The bribes were paid for the liberation of resources from the (FI-FGTS). Temer bribery On 17 May 2017, the newspaper O Globo published news that Batista provided recordings made on 7 March 2017 of a dialogue between him and the Brazilian president Michel Temer, where Batista represents that he was paying for the silence of Eduardo Cunha, who is currently in jail, and former target in the investigation. The news resulted in some protests and calls for Temer's resignation, with the Brazilian stock market also facing a drop. On 19 May 2017, JBS admitted to paying bribes to the three Brazilian presidents Michel Temer, Dilma Rousseff and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, spanning the previous 14 years. All three presidents denied accepting bribes. However, an audio recording appears to catching Temer green- lighting the Batistas to pay a monthly allowance to former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha in exchange for his silence.Brazil‚Äôs President caught on tape greenlighting bribes to former House Speaker, says newspaper Will Michel Temer be impeached? by \\"plus55\\" (2017) JBS told prosecutors they had paid a total of $123 million in bribes to Brazilian politicians in recent years. Batista was also rumoured to have recorded senator and former presidential candidate A√©cio Neves of PSDB, one of the biggest political parties at the time, requesting two million reais in bribes. The PF filmed the payment passing to the senator's cousin. The money was then tracked to the bank account of a company belonging to Zeze Perrella, a PSDB senator from Minas Gerais.Brazil: explosive recordings implicate President Michel Temer in bribery by Jonathan Watts, published in The Guardian (2017) The former head of the Securities Commission (CVM) referred to testimony that asserted JBS had bribed 1,829 politicians. Temer alleged that JBS doctored the recording of him talking to Batista about trading shares, and accused the Batista of insider trading. JBS denied illegal trades. Batista and JBS allegedly obtained funding from the BNDES as a result of this bribe of over R$10 billion at below-market interest rates. In return for his help making the recording, the PF set Batista, his brother and other directors of JBS S.A. free, with a penalty of R$225 million. Batista thereupon decided to move to the US. The agreement obtained by the Batista brothers applies only to their physical persons. The Brazilian authorities are still negotiating the penalty to be applied to J&F;, the holding company superior to JBS S.A.. Prior negotiations suggested that a penalty close to R$11 billion, an amount that was refused by Batista. As of 22 May CVM was demanding $3.4 billion from JBS as part of a promised leniency deal, according to the press. In May 2017, JBS retained law firm Baker McKenzie to negotiate possible criminal charges with the United States Department of Justice under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Insider trading investigation Prior to the release of the recordings, Batista and his brother Wesley Batista sold several shares of JBS S.A. and bought over USD 1 billion. The release of the recordings resulted in substantial reduction of the stock price of JBS S.A. shares and in the reduction of the value in the Brazilian Real. The CVM is investigating the Batista brothers for insider trading. Prison On 10 September 2017 he was temporarily arrested by the PF at the request of Attorney General Rodrigo Janot. The request was accepted by Federal Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin.Joesley Batista and Ricardo Saud surrender to justice On 13 September 2017, he had the remand ordered by the 6th Criminal Federal Court of S√£o Paulo by the use of insider information to profit in the financial market between April and 17 May 2017, the date of disclosure of information relating to the collaboration agreement signed between J&F; executives and the Attorney General's Office.Federal Police arrest Wesley Batista in SP On 9 March 2018, Mr. Batista was released from the Federal Police's jail in Sao Paulo, but he is not allowed to leave the country and his passport is retained by the Federal Police.Federal Judge releases Joesley Batista; he must hand over his passport to the authorities ==Family== Batista is married to Flora Mendon√ßa.

It was released on January 15, 2015 for free download. The mix is an eleven-song musical score Arca performed at Hood by Air's show at the Pitti Uomo 87 fashion event in Florence, Italy. ==Background and release== Sheep was released a few weeks after Arca's cover of Shakira's \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" for Dazed after being placed at #3 on the Dazed 100, a list of the hundred most influential people shaping youth culture. On the same week of the mix's release, it was revealed that Arca would be co-producing Bj√∂rk's Vulnicura record. The mix served as the soundtrack to the 2015 Hood By Air fashion show for Pitti Uomo 87 in Florence, Italy. She shared the mix on SoundCloud after performing it at the event. In an early press release, \\"Sifter\\" was titled \\"Faggot\\", but was renamed \\"Sifter\\" on the final track list. Similarly, downloading Sheep reveals that the file is titled \\"Pity the Homo\\". Arca confirmed via Twitter that these were her working titles, and that she changed them herself to be \\"more subtle.\\" Some of the tracks on Sheep were later reprised on to Arca's second studio album Mutant, which was released later that year. == Critical reception == Sheep was featured as Pitchforks \\"Best New Track\\", stating that \\"Arca is still setting the trends.\\" Tiny Mix Tapes wrote: \\"The mix splendidly downplays the melodic nuances that worked so well on Xen; those interjecting high tones and bass- heavy counterpoints bleed into each other here to provide an unwavering soundscape. It's like a scrapbook of equally lavish and boisterous ideas that leap out of the page; though not fully formed, they make up a remarkable whole. These ideas bridge each \\"stage\\" in a fashion so dissimilar to the clearly defined &&&&& or anything at all from the Stretch EPs, forcing Arca's aesthetic to sound more debauched than ever. Sheep works as a platform (or even a catwalk), then, for Arca to celebrate [her] most off-kilter preferences.\\" Sputnikmusic said that \\"Sheep is fascinating in that it makes a complete stylistic detour from Xen while retaining the latter's core- aesthetic, manipulating it in such a way that the two become polar opposites, atmospherically. The extra-terrestrial vibe that appears to be something of a signature for Arca remains, but [her] characteristically warm, endearing, nonchalant approach has shifted towards something more deliberate and maddening.\\" Consequence of Sound said \\"the mix runs the sonic and emotional gamut, from moments of pounding aggression and galactic wooziness to pulsating sensuality and even hymnal meditation.\\" Dummy Mag said the mix \\"builds and releases in waves of terrifying and angelic sounds.\\" == Track listing == Sample credits * \\"Sifter\\" contains a sample of \\"Yayo Ha /W Lana Del Rey\\" by Beek. * \\"At Last I am Free (interlude)\\" contains a sample of \\"At Last I Am Free\\" by Robert Wyatt. * \\"Immortal\\" contains a sample of \\"Enjoy\\" by Bj√∂rk. ==Personnel== * Arca ‚Äì production * Matt Colton ‚Äì mastering * Jesse Kanda ‚Äì artwork ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2015 mixtape albums Category:Arca (musician) albums Category:Albums produced by Arca (musician) Category:Self-released albums Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner ","title":"Sheep (mixtape)"},{"id":"54094582","text":"Jackie Robinson Park is a public park in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York.

Stimson has over 220 scientific publications mainly on social and health aspects of illicit drug use, including HIV infection. He has sat on numerous editorial boards including AIDS, Addiction, and European Addiction Research, and with Tim Rhodes he was the co-editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Drug Policy from 2000 to 2016. He is one of the global leaders for research on and later advocacy for harm reduction. == Contribution to the social understanding of health behaviour == Gerry Stimson studied social science and social psychology at the London School of Economics in the 1960s, and did his research training at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, joining the Addiction Research Unit there when it was first established in 1967. He was among a cohort of new social scientists working in what was then called 'medical sociology' and later the 'sociology of health and illness' which established the significance of the social sciences for understanding health behaviour, and in particular the importance of the perspective of the patient. His 1975 work on doctor-patient interaction, Going to see the doctor, influenced medical school courses on communicating with patients. He was a founder of the journal Sociology of Health and Illness. He taught courses on the sociology of health and illness at Goldsmiths College London, where he was head of the Sociology Department from 1980 to 1983. == Research on drug use and drug policy == Whilst at the Addiction Research Unit he conducted research on the prescribing of heroin at London drug dependency clinics, which became a long term follow-up study of people dependent on heroin, blending quantitative and qualitative research and a historical analysis of drug policy. The research provides insights into drug treatment and addiction from the personal view of people who were addicted to heroin. == Work on HIV prevention and harm reduction == From the mid-1980s he became increasingly involved in the application of social science to public health issues, linked to his research on drug use and the risks of HIV infection. In 1987 whilst at Goldsmiths' College he was commissioned by the UK government to undertake the evaluation of the experimental needle and syringe exchange programme in England and Scotland. He established (in 1990) and directed (until 2004) The Centre for Research on Drugs and Health Behaviour at Imperial College. His work there developed multi-methods research on illicit drug use and alcohol. His team pioneered consumer engagement in research by including drug users on research advisory panels and as fieldworkers. His work at the Centre for Research on Drugs and Health Behaviour mapped social-behavioural aspects of injecting drug use, the epidemiology of HIV infection, and the impact of needle exchange schemes and methadone treatment for people who inject drugs. He viewed the UK response to HIV among people who inject drugs as a public health success. The introduction of drugs harm reduction led the UK to have one of the lowest rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in the world. Stimson has been a critic of the UK Government's drug policy. In 1997 he established the Department of Social Science and Medicine at Imperial College within the then new Division of Primary Care and Population Health Sciences. He was a member of the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) from 1984 until 1999 and a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs Working Group on AIDS and Drug Misuse. Soon after the HIV antibody test was introduced in 1985 high prevalence of HIV infection had been identified in some groups of heroin injectors in Scotland. The ACMD concluded that \\"The spread of HIV is a greater danger to individual and public health than drug misuse [...] We must therefore [‚Ä¶] work with those who continue to misuse drugs to help them reduce the risk involved in doing so, and above all the risk of acquiring or spreading HIV.\\" The report is described as \\"a key step along the road to the development of harm reduction as a distinct area of professional practice\\". Stimson, writing in 1990, described what was seen as a new paradigm for those working in the drugs field, that focussed on the prevention of drug harms rather than on drug use itself. Harm reduction had a significant impact on UK drug policy over the next ten years including the expansion of needle exchange programmes and methadone treatment. In 2004 Stimson left academic work and became Executive Director of the International Harm Reduction Association (IHRA) (now Harm Reduction International) and developed a programme of work linking public health and human rights approaches to harm reduction. His team at IHRA identified human rights abuses of drug users, and established within the UN system that access to harm reduction resources was part of the state's obligations to promote the right to health. He worked with international organisations including the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria to persuade them to incorporate harm reduction into their policies and strategies. He was the inspiration for the biennial Global State of Harm Reduction report which maps progress towards the adoption of drugs harm reduction. With others at IHRA he produced a definition and description of harm reduction (What is harm reduction?) which is now available in twelve languages. He encouraged consumer engagement in public health and drug policy by helping establish drug user advocacy groups and national and regional harm reduction associations including the United Kingdom Harm Reduction Association, Action on Hepatitis C, the Middle-East and North Africa Harm Reduction Association, and the International Network of People who Use Drugs. == Tobacco harm reduction == From 2010 Stimson applied his interest in harm reduction to the prevention of tobacco smoking-related diseases and is a proponent of the use of safer nicotine products as alternatives to smoking. He is the co-founder, with Paddy Costall, of the Global Forum on Nicotine. He is an advocate of vaping and e-cigarettes as agents of tobacco harm reduction. Stimson argues that although nicotine is addictive, it is \\"almost harmless to health\\", and that it is the tobacco smoke that is harmful, and that e-cigarettes have \\"negligible risk to health\\". From 2012-14 he was a member of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines Development Group on Tobacco Harm Reduction. In 2018 he published No Fire, No Smoke: The Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction which maps the uptake of safer nicotine products and the regulatory responses to these products. The production of this report was funded by a grant from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. He is a director of Knowledge-Action-Change which is a private sector agency working in the field of public health and harm reduction and which states that its aim is to promote health through harm reduction. KAC runs the Tobacco Harm Reduction Scholarship Programme. These scholarships are funded by a grant from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. He is a director of KAC Communications which organises the Global Forum on Nicotine. Between 2016 and 2018 Stimson was involved in a case brought before the UK High Court and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to challenge the ban on the sale of snus within the European Union (except Sweden). The case was brought by Swedish Match, and the New Nicotine Alliance (NNA) joined the case as an intervenor. Stimson was chair of the NNA. The NNA's legal argument was that the evidence from Norway and Sweden indicated that snus protects against smoking and that smokers have a right under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to have access to a safer alternative to smoking. The legal challenge was rejected by the ECJ in November 2018. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Academics of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Category:Medical journal editors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Gerry Stimson"},{"id":"54094714","text":"Clash of the Gods may refer to: * Clash of the Gods (TV series), a 2009 television series on the History channel * Clash of the Gods (album), a 2012 album by Grave Digger ","title":"Clash of the Gods"},{"id":"54094830","text":"Oreella is a genus of tardigrades in the family Oreellidae.

Bred and owned by the Aga Khan an trained by John Oxx she was unraced as a two-year-old in 1996 but quickly established herself as a very promising filly in the following spring with an emphatic win on her racecourse debut followed by a narrow defeat in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. After finishing sixth in The Oaks she won the Irish Oaks and ended her season with a six length win in the Prix Royal-Oak. She remained in training as a four-year- old but failed to win in three races although she did finish third in a strong renewal of the Coronation Cup. After her retirement from racing she had considerable success as a dam of winners. ==Background== Ebadiyla was a bay mare with a white star bred in Ireland by her owner Aga Khan IV. She was trained in Ireland by John Oxx and ridden in all but one of her races by Johnny Murtagh. She was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 and went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. She was the first foal of her dam Ebaziya, who won four races including the Ballysax Stakes in 1992 and later became an outstanding broodmare whose other foals included Enzeli, Estimate and Edabiya. She was descended from Marcel Boussac's broodmare Tourzima, the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Acamas and Darshaan ==Racing career== 1997: three-year-old season Ebadiyla made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over ten furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse on 12 April 1997. Starting at odds of 9/2 in a field of eleven colts and fillies she won by four lengths from Dr Johnson. The filly was again matched against male opposition when she was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown Racecourse on 11 May over the same distance . She was made the 2/1 favourite but lost out in a three-way photo finish to the colts Ashley Park and Casey Tibbs. John Oxx later commented \\"She was a bit green that day, but when she got going she finished very strongly and we were very happy with her. It was a competitive, well-run race at a distance short of her best\\". On 6 June at Epsom Racecourse Ebadiyla started the 15/2 third favourite in a twelve-runner field for the 218th running of the Oaks Stakes. She led the field approaching the final quarter mile but was then overtaken and finished sixth behind Reams of Verse having been hampered in the last furlong. In the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 11 July the filly started the 9/2 second choice in the betting behind the Henry Cecil-trained Yashmak who had finished fourth in the Epsom Oaks before winning the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. The other nine runners included the French-trained Brilliance (winner of the Prix Saint-Alary), Strawberry Roan (runner-up in the Irish 1,000 Guineas) and Etoile (fifth in the Epsom Oaks). After tracking the leaders until the final turn, Murtagh made a forward move on the inside in the straight. Ebadiyla overtook Yashmak approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by three lengths from the favourite with Brilliance a head away in third. Following the race Johnny Murtagh commented \\"Ebadiyla loves to see a bit of daylight and once I got her in the clear on the inner two furlongs down she picked up well and went about her business\\". After her win at the Curragh, Ebadiyla was off the track for twelve weeks before returning in Europe's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. She started a 54/1 outsider in an eighteen- runner field and finished twelfth behind Peintre Celebre. Three weeks later the filly returned to Longchamp for the Prix Royal-Oak over 3200 metres. Her ten opponents included Further Flight, Oscar Schindler (Irish St. Leger), Bahamian Knight (Derby Italiano), Grey Shot (Goodwood Cup), Double Eclipse (Prix Vicomtesse Vigier), Stetarez (Prix Vicomtesse Vigier), Camporese (Prix Corrida) and Nothin' Leica Dane (Victoria Derby). Ridden by Gerald Mosse she was restrained towards the rear of the field before turning into the straight in sixth place. She took the lead 200 metres from the finish and accelerated clear of her rivals to win by six lengths from Snow Princess. Following the filly's second Group 1 win Oxx said \\"She was a bit rusty for the Arc after a long break but that break seems to have put her right for today.\\" Mosse commented \\"Ebadiyla is clearly a very good filly The going here was more congenial for her than in the Arc.\\" 1998: four-year-old season Ebadiyla began her third campaign in the Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 24 May and ran poorly, finishing last of the five runners behind Daylami. She produced a much better effort in the Coronation Cup at Epsom on 5 June when she finished third behind Silver Patriarch and Swain, beaten a length and a half by the winner. On what proved to be her final start Ebadiyla was dropped in class for the Listed Ballycullen Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Leopardstown on 23 August. She started the odds-on favourite but was beaten into second place by the three-year-old filly On Call. The filly was entered in the Irish St. Leger but was withdrawn shortly before the start of the race after showing signs of bleeding. An intended second run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe did not materialise and she was retired from racing at the end of the year. ==Breeding record== After being retired from racing Ebadiyla became a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud. She produced twelve foals and ten winners between 2000 and 2013: *Ebatana, a bay filly, foaled in 2000, sired by Rainbow Quest. Failed to win in four races. *Ebaziyan, grey colt (later gelded), 2001, by Daylami.

It is situated in the neighborhood of Savamala, between the incoming and outgoing platforms of the Belgrade Main Bus Station. It is located in the municipality of Savski Venac. == Location == The park is bounded by the streets of Karaƒëorƒëeva on the east, Had≈æi Nikole ≈Ωivkoviƒáa on the north and ≈Ωelezniƒçka on the west. Across the street on the southern side is the Belgrade Main Bus Station and its outgoing platforms. In the entire eastern section, the streets of Had≈æi Nikole ≈Ωivkoviƒáa and ≈Ωelezniƒçka are turned into the incoming platforms and the access street to it. To the east, across the Karaƒëorƒëeva street, is the location of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics and another park, Park Luka ƒÜeloviƒá. North of the park is the hotel \\"Bristol\\". == Name and history == Predecessor of the park was a garden planted by Luka ƒÜeloviƒá. He was one of the richest and most influential Serbs in the early 20th century, head of the Belgrade Cooperative, a merchant and a major philanthropist. He managed to obtain a permit from the city authorities to plant a European-style garden on his land. He planted roses, ornamental plants and trees and personally took care of the garden for years. Young park is already visible on the 1910 postcard from Belgrade, which makes it one of the oldest in the city. Park was fully developed in the 1910s and 1920s, but the author of the project is not known. The park was originally called Nikoljski (Saint Nicholas' park after the nearby Svetonikolski trg (Square of the Saint Nicholas), but in time, the name was replaced with Bristol, after the Hotel Bristol which is right next to the park. Originally, the park stretched from the hotel to the Belgrade Main railway station, including the area occupied today by the Main Bus Station. When Germans built the Old Sava Bridge in 1942, they also constructed the access street to it which split the park in half. Section of the park which remained close to the railway station was demolished to make place for the new bus station. When the station was expanded in 1984, last remnants of that section were destroyed, leaving only one plane tree and the part of the steps towards the Karaƒëorƒëeva street. Even though Luka ƒÜeloviƒá built the Bristol park, in 2004 city government named the park across it in his honor, \\"Park Luka ƒÜeloviƒá\\", which historically has nothing to do with ƒÜeloviƒá. It was the location of a school which was destroyed during the bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. The park which was built later was unofficially known for decades as the \\"Park at the Economics Faculty\\". == Characteristics == Southwest entrance into the park, Old Sava Bridge in the distance The Bristol Park covers an area of and was renovated in 2004. Due to its location, all the visitors who come to Belgrade by bus, must pass by or through the park. In the section close to the hotel, there is a plane tree which is thought to be planted when the park was originally formed. As of 2017, it would make it over 110 years old. The landmark of the park is the \\"Cross from the Mali Pijac\\". It was erected in 1862 by the merchant ƒÜira Hristiƒá and placed at the Mali Pijac section of Savamala (Little Marketplace). Situated in front of the former hotel \\"Bosna\\", it was dedicated to the Karaƒëorƒëe's rebels, who liberated Belgrade from the Turks in 1806, but conceptually it was a symbol of Christian victory over the Turks in general. Since the hotel was close to it, when ƒÜeloviƒá built the building of the Belgrade Cooperative from 1905 to 1907, he moved the cross to the Bristol Park. The cross is made of the reddish stone, rosso ammonitico, imported from Hungary. Together with the Vozarev Cross, it is one of the oldest monuments in Belgrade. In 1987 it was declared a cultural monument. Since 2015 and the European migrant crisis, being close to the both main traffic stations, the Bristol Park is periodically occupied by the migrants, who sleep there in tents or in the open, then the government resettles them to the shelters but the new migrants keep occupying the park again. == References == Category:Parks in Belgrade Category:Savski Venac ","title":"Park Bristol"},{"id":"54094955","text":"Stepan Falkovsky (; born 18 December 1996) is a Belarusian professional ice hockey defenceman playing on a try-out basis with HC Dinamo Minsk organization of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

Cloud Computing was bred in Kentucky by Hill 'n' Dale Equine Holdings and Stretch Run Ventures. He is from the first foal crop sired by Maclean's Music, a son of Distorted Humor. Maclean's Music was an impressive winner by lengths in his only start, a 2011 race for three-year-old maiden horses. and based upon the performances of his first crop of foals, exceeded expectations as a sire. Cloud Computing's dam is Quick Temper, a multiple stakes-placed daughter of A.P. Indy. Cloud Computing was purchased as a yearling at the 2015 Keeneland Sales for $200,000 by Seth Klarman, the owner of Klaravich Stables, and William Lawrence. Introduced by mutual friends in 2004, the two typically buy about 50‚Äì60 horses a year. Both hedge fund managers, they chose his name based upon their pattern of using terms from the finance industry to name their horses, other examples being graded stakes winners Takeover Target and Currency Swap. He is trained by Chad C. Brown. ==Racing career== Cloud Computing prior to the Preakness Cloud Computing did not make his racing debut until February 11, 2017, when, as a three-year-old, he won a maiden special weight at Aqueduct Racetrack. He then finished second to J Boys Echo in the Gotham Stakes and third behind winner Irish War Cry in the Wood Memorial. He earned enough points from these races to qualify on the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby. However, his connections elected to bypass the race, instead starting their Champagne Stakes winner, Practical Joke, who finished fifth. Cloud Computing was one of the more highly regarded \\"new shooters\\" for the Preakness Stakes, a race which is typically won by horses who had earlier raced in the Kentucky Derby. The two favorites in the Preakness, Always Dreaming and Classic Empire, had finished first and fourth respectively in the Derby. These two went to an early lead and set a solid pace while Cloud Computing rated a few lengths behind in third. Around the final turn, Classic Empire surged to the front and Always Dreaming dropped back. In mid-stretch, Classic Empire had a three-length lead and looked the likely winner before Cloud Computing angled out from traffic and started closing ground rapidly. Classic Empire tried to rally but could not hold off Cloud Computing, who won by a head. Cloud Computing (on the outside) closes ground on Classic Empire as they near the finish line Cloud Computing became just the fourth horse in the last 34 years to win the Preakness after not having raced in the Derby. The last horse to do so was the filly Rachel Alexandra in 2009. It was the first win of a Triple Crown race for his trainer Chad Brown and the second for jockey Javier Castellano, who was riding the colt for the first time. \\"I'm not going to dispute the fact that I brought in a fresh horse as part of our strategy\\", said Brown. \\"Classic Empire and Always Dreaming are two outstanding horses and our strategy was, if we were going to ever beat them, let's take them on two weeks' rest when we have six, and it worked.\\" \\"It's incredibly special\\", said Klarman. \\"He's a great horse. I have the best trainer and the best jockey going for me. I never imagined it, but I'm thrilled.\\" Klarman had grown up in Baltimore just a few blocks away from Pimlico and attended many runnings of the Preakness including Secretariat's win in 1973. Cloud Computing was then given some time off before finishing fifth in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga on July 29. He followed up with a ninth-place finish in the Travers Stakes on August 26. ==Statistics== { class = \\" sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:90%\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Date ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4\\"  Age ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Distance ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Race ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Grade ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Track ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Odds ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Field ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Finish ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Winning Time ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Margin Win/(Loss) ! scope=\\"col\\" dacaa4;\\"  Jockey ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" dacaa4;\\" Ref - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  6 furlongs  Maiden Special Weight  Maiden  Aqueduct Racetrack  1.15  5  1  1:11.31  lengths  Manuel Franco  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  miles  Gotham Stakes  III  Aqueduct Racetrack  7.90  7  2  1:46.34  ( lengths)  Manuel Franco  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  miles  Wood Memorial  II  Aqueduct Racetrack  2.40  8  3  1:50.91  (7 lengths)  Irad Ortiz Jr.  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  miles  Preakness Stakes  I  Pimlico Racetrack  13.40  10  1  1:55.98  Head  Javier Castellano  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  miles  Jim Dandy Stakes  II  Saratoga  1.20  5  5  1:50.69  ( lengths)  Javier Castellano  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;\\"   3  miles  Travers Stakes  I  Saratoga  10.90  12  8  2:01.19  ( lengths)  Javier Castellano  - } ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 8-g Category:Preakness Stakes winners Category:American Grade 1 Stakes winners ","title":"Cloud Computing (horse)"},{"id":"54095128","text":"Foresite Capital is an American venture capital and growth equity firm.

In 2017, she played for the Sydney Metro Blues in the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League in Australia. ==Biography== Courtney Anne Ryan was born in San Diego, California, on 21 September 1990, the daughter of Kevin and Patti Ryan. She has a brother, Chris, and a sister, Caitlin. She attended Coronado High School, where she played soccer. She was Coronado's Rookie of the Year in 2007 as a junior, and as an education the following year was a first team All-Western League performer, was named to the all-section team, and was Most Valuable Player. In 2008, she entered Metropolitan State University of Denver, where she played soccer for its team, the Roadrunners. As a freshman, she played 25 games, in which she scored one goal and was credited with seven assists. In 2009, she played 24 games as a defender. She was named first team All-America and first team All-Central Region, and set a school record for defenders with 15 assists on the season. Ryan played only five games in 2010. During the fifth, against Colorado Mesa University on 8 October 2010, she was tackled from behind and fell on her back. A blood clot developed that burst and leaked into her spinal cord, leaving her paralysed from the waist down. She stayed at Metro for the 2011 spring semester, then returned to San Diego. She became involved with the Challenged Athletes Foundation, and took up wheelchair basketball. Pete Hughes, the head coach of the University of Arizona Wildcats women's wheelchair basketball team saw her play a game in which she sank a game- winning buzzer-beater. After the game, he offered her a scholarship. She entered the University of Arizona in the fall of 2012. She enrolled in its college of education, majoring in special education, with an emphasis in rehabilitation, planning to earn a Master's Degree in rehabilitation counselling or disability studies. Hughes was sufficiently impressed with Ryan's attitude, ability and performance that he wrote a letter of recommendation to Stephanie Wheeler, the head coach of the USA national women's wheelchair basketball team. Two weeks later, she was one on 30 players invited to try out for the national teams at tryouts held in Birmingham, Alabama. In April, she was selected for the team, making her international debut in eight games against the German national team. She played with the national team at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto in 2014. The United States came fourth. In 2017, Ryan played for the Sydney Metro Blues in the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League in Australia. The Blues went on to win the league championship.

The musical component of the project serves as Bannon's second album under the Wear Your Wounds moniker, while the physical mediums were compiled into a companion art book titled Dunedevil: An Artistic Journey Into Abstraction and Isolation. Both pieces were created during a seven-day excursion to Dune Shacks of Peaked Hill Bars Historic District and self-released on May 19, 2017‚Äîonly one month after Wear Your Wounds' debut album, WYW. == Background and creation == One of the many Dune Shacks of Peaked Hill Bars Historic District in Massachusetts. Jacob Bannon spent a week creating music and art in a shack much like this one. After nearly 30 years of creating music for Converge, Supermachiner and Irons, in addition to creating artwork not limited to album covers for dozens of bands, Jacob Bannon had an epiphany. \\"I've had a lot of things going on in my life in the past couple of years that have made me realize that time is not infinite. The songs that you create, the art that you create, needs to go to the public if that is the intention.\\" Over his career, Bannon created music that was never publicly released, but started to change his mind about these methods. \\"When I kept writing songs and filing them away and not sharing them with people, that was doing me a disservice creatively, so I'm now at a point in my life where I just want to get it out to people.\\" For one week during winter 2016, Bannon rented out one of the Dune Shacks of Peaked Hill Bars Historic District located outside of Provincetown, Massachusetts (Bannon's home state), a part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. Specifically, he stayed in the C-Scape Dune Shack (formerly known as the Cohen Shack). Scattered throughout the National Park, these shacks were originally built by the United States Life-Saving Service in the 1920s for shipwrecked sailors to seek refuge. Some were made from pieces of debris that has washed ashore, and none have been modernized with running water or electricity. Over the last century, many famous artists have spent time in the Dune Shacks for creative inspiration, including: playwright Eugene O'Neill (A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman), poet and abolitionist Henry David Thoreau (Walden, Civil Disobedience), abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock (Mural on Indian Red Ground, No. 5, 1948) and iconoclast novelist Jack Kerouac (The Town and the City, Big Sur). During each one of the seven days Bannon spent at C-Scape Dune Shack, he wrote and recorded a piano-driven track through a portable and solar-powered setup. After he returned home, The Red Chord's Mike McKenzie recorded additional guitars for the final track, \\"Be Still My Heart\\". The musical pieces he recorded during the seven-day excursion were compiled into the Dunedevil album, while the visual pieces (journal entries, paintings and photographs) were compiled into the nearly 300-page Dunedevil book. Commenting on the spontaneity of the project, Bannon said: \\"I didn't go out there with the intention to make a book, I went there with the intention to make stuff, but I like what I did so I'm going to share it with people.\\" == Track listing == # \\"Invitation\\" ‚Äì 4:55 # \\"Great White\\" ‚Äì 4:48 # \\"Insects\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Outsiders\\" ‚Äì 2:26 # \\"Relic\\" ‚Äì 5:07 # \\"Steps\\" ‚Äì 4:48 # \\"Be Still My Heart\\" ‚Äì 4:30 == Personnel == Dunedevil album personnel adapted from LP liner notes. * Jacob Bannon ‚Äì guitar, vocals, electronics, recording and artwork * Mike McKenzie (The Red Chord) ‚Äì additional guitar on \\"Be Still My Heart\\" * Brad Boatright ‚Äì mastering == Dunedevil book == Dunedevil: An Artistic Journey Into Abstraction and Isolation is an art book and journal by Jacob Bannon.

The diary entries detail his daily activities, which also helps to illustrate the context behind the album's track titles. In an excerpt from \\"Day 2\\" he wrote: \\"I crawled into bed and read news of a great white shark seen just four feet from the beach today. Likely it was preying on the seals that have been keeping me company.\\" The book primarily features the work of Bannon, but also includes a foreword written by tattoo artist Thomas Hooper and additional photography by Reid Haithcock and his wife Janelle Bannon. == References  External links == * Dunedevil on Bandcamp Category:2017 albums Category:2017 non-fiction books ","title":"Dunedevil"},{"id":"54095207","text":"UACES, or the academic association for Contemporary European Studies, is a membership organisation for academics, students and practitioners in all fields of contemporary European studies and the study of the European Union.

After Head VI, it is the second of Bacon's long series of paintings influenced by Diego Vel√°zquez's 1650 Portrait of Innocent X. The panel shows a full length view of the pope, engulfed in vertical folds that may be either the linings of a curtain or the bars of a cage. The folds serve to emphasise the figure's isolation, and were drawn from devices used by Edgar Degas in the late 19th century, which Bacon described as \\"shuttering\\". He said that, to him the device meant that the \\"sensation doesn't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently across\\".Dawson (2000), 53 The painting was intended as part of a series of Popes for an exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in September 1950. Following a crises of confidence, Bacon withdrew and destroyed the canvasses he had been working on.

The Verano de Esc√°ndalo event has been a regular summer event for AAA since 1997, only skipping the event in 2012, 2013 and 2016. 2017 marked the 18th time AAA has used that name for an event. In the main event of the show three teams, Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr., El Nuevo Poder del Norte (Carta Brava Jr. and Soul Rocker) and Monster Clown and Murder Clown, put their mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match where the losing team was forced to unmask after the match. In the end Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. defeated Carta Brava Jr. and Soul Rocker, while Monster Clown and Murder Clown survived the match without having to unmask. The show alsod feature an additional Lucha de Apuestas as Pimpinela Escarlata defeated Mamba, forcing Mamba to have all his hair shaved off after the loss. Dark Cuervo and Dark Escoria regained the AAA World Tag Team Championship from El Mes√≠as and Pagano in a match that also included the teams of Aero Star/Drago and Australian Suicide/Bengala. ==Production== Background In September 1997 Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n, later known as \\"AAA\\", or Triple A and then Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide added a new major event to their schedule as they held the first ever Verano de Esc√°ndalo (\\"Summer of Scandal\\") show on September 14, 1997. The Verano de Esc√°ndalo show became an annual event from 1997 until 2011, usually held in September, with few exceptions. In 2012 AAA changed their major event schedule as they pushed Tripleman√≠a XX to August instead of holding the show in June or July as had been the case up until 2012. With the change to the schedule AAA did not hold a Verano de Esc√°ndalo show in 2012 and 2013. In 2014 the show was put back on the schedule, but held in June instead, filling the void left when Tripleman√≠a was moved. AAA did not hold a Verano de Esc√°ndalo in 2016, instead holding the Lucha Libre World Cup in June. The 2017 Verano de Esc√°ndalo show will be the 18th show in the series. Storylines The Verano de Esc√°ndalo show will featured a number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The top storyline in AAA leading up to Verano de Esc√°ndalo began in August 2016 at Tripleman√≠a XXIV, during the main event match between the tecnico Psycho Clown and rudo Pagano, Dr. Wagner Jr. came to the ring, looking like he was going to save Psycho Clown from outside interference. Moments later he hit Psycho Clown below the belt to help Pagano out. In the end Psycho Clown overcame the odds and pinned Pagano to win the match. Afterwards Dr. Wagner Jr. challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line at the following year's Tripleman√≠a XXV show, a challenge that was immediately accepted. At the next AAA super show, H√©roes Inmortales X, Dr. Wagner Jr. defeated Psycho Clown and Pagano in a three-way match when Psycho Clown's partners in Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown and Murder Clown) turned on him and sided with Dr. Wagner Jr. instead. The two rivals would later officially sign the contract for the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\". During an AAA show in mid December Psycho Clown's sister Goya Kong, would also turn on her brother, as she hit him with a steel chair as AAA continued to stack to the odds against Psycho Clown towards the Tripleman√≠a XXV. In early 2017 Monster Clown and Murder Clown turned on Dr. Wagner Jr. as well, leading to a match at the 2017 Rey de Reyes show where rivals Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown reluctantly teamed up to face Monster Clown and Murder Clown. After the odd pairing won the match, Soul Rocker, Carta Brava Jr. and Mocho Cota Jr. attacked both Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown only moments after the team had won their match. After the attack the trio stole the mask of Dr. Wagner Jr. At a subsequent AAA show the trio, now dubbed El Nuevo Poder del Norte were wrestling against the trio of Australian Suicide, Lanzeloth and M√°scara de Bronce when Dr. Wagner Jr and Psycho Clown entered the ring to attack them. Moments later Murder Clown and Monster Clown came to the ring to even the sides, leading to the match becoming a 5-on-5 tag team match instead. Dr. Wagner Jr. pinned Mocho Cota Jr. but was left without his mask once more after the match was over. During the AAA show on April 14 Dr. Wagner Jr. was slated to face Psycho Clown in the main event, but the two were attacked by El Nuevo Poder del Norte, leading to a tag team match where Soul Rocker and Carta Brava Jr. defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown. Following their victory Soul Rocker and Carta Brava Jr. challenged their opponents to put their masks on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas. Both Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown verbally accepted the match but no official date for the match was announced. A week later El Nuevo Poder del Norte demanded a match for the AAA World Trios Championship as part of the show. Faby Apache came out, but without her championship partners Mari Apache and El Apache. Moments later Faby Apache brought out Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown as her replacement partners for a match against El Nuevo Poder del Norte. El Nuevo Poder del Norte won the match by pinning Faby Apache, making them the new champions. ==ResultsReferences== Category:2017 in professional wrestling Category:2017 in Mexico Category:June 2017 events in Mexico Category:Verano de Esc√°ndalo ","title":"Verano de Esc√°ndalo (2017)"},{"id":"54095430","text":"In music, Op. 23 stands for Opus number 23.

In this role he was responsible for tax compliance of private group businesses and High Wealth Individuals. He was also responsible for tax crime including offshore tax evasion, dealing with Project Wickenby and the Panama Papers. Cranston worked on and chaired the OECD Taskforce on Tax Crimes in Paris from 2012 to 2017. == Tax raids == During 2015, Cranston (who was not directly involved in the operation) was the Deputy Commissioner at the time of a major operation which led to 100 tax officers raiding the Sydney premises of 12 firms, including lawyers, accountants and liquidators.Daily Telegraph June 10, 2015. ATO raids 12 major firms for fraud evidence. The 12 firms were suspected of involvement in phoenix operations, whereby companies run up tax liabilities, fail to pay the tax liabilities, and money or assets disappear or are stripped from the companies before the companies are deliberately bankrupted by the proprietors. The same proprietors then establish new but similar companies, and the whole process is repeated, systematically. The bankrupted companies are liquidated, with the intention of leaving creditors and the tax office empty-handed or short-changed. == Alleged Plutus Payroll tax fraud == In 2017, it emerged that Cranston's family, a son Adam and a daughter Lauren, were alleged to be central characters in Australia's alleged largest tax fraud involving phoenixing. The alleged estimated amount of money involved in the fraud, according to the investigating authorities, has been reported in the media at figures ranging from $130 million to $160 million. Parts of the evidence were gathered using phone taps of conversations between the various suspects and phone conversations between two members of the Cranston family.https://www.theguardian.com/australia- news/2017/jun/23/michael-cranstons-wife-allegedly-received-payments-company- linked-to-taxSydney Morning Herald 21 June 2017 Michael Cranston captured in phone taps on $144m ATO tax fraud In May 2017, the police didn't believe Cranston was part of the conspiracy,\\"The AFP says Michael Cranston was not part of the criminal syndicate but acted on his son‚Äôs request to seek information about the activities of Plutus Payroll.\\" and it was not believed that Cranston was aware of the fraud,\\"While father Michael had no knowledge of the fraud, he allegedly looked up restricted information on garnishee orders and audits as the net closed in on his son.\\" though Cranston did access restricted information. Later in 2017, Cranston resigned from the ATO after he was formally charged with abusing his position as a public servant. Cranston's trial was conducted in January and February 2019. On 15 February 2019, after nearly three weeks on trial before NSW District Court judge Robyn Tupman, a jury took less than six hours deliberation to find the 40-year ATO veteran not guilty of dishonestly obtaining information in his capacity as a senior public servant to benefit Adam Cranston, as well as a charge of using his influence to improperly obtain a benefit for his son. == Partner, Waterhouse Lawyers == Cranston is now a partner at Waterhouse Tax Lawyers.

She held the WBC female super-middleweight title from 2013 to 2017. ==Amateur career== At the age of 15, Nikki Adler, then still Nikolina Orloviƒá, started kickboxing. There she quickly showed her great talent, so that she could successfully fight her first fight after only a few weeks. This was followed by two third places at the German Championships and the Bavarian Championships. At the same time, she took part in the German boxing championship in 2004, which she was able to decide immediately. Nikki Adler then completed an education at Deutsche Post AG alongside her amateur career. In 2007, the left-back took the boxing training again and, after a short training period, again took part in the German Championships, which she was able to win. For Croatia, from then on, she has been an international player since she was not a German national. Under the former Ukrainian nationalist Borys Raytman she developed steadily further. She regularly took part in German, European and World Championships. After receiving the German nationality, she was suspended by the AIBA for 3 years, which prevented a start in the German national team and finally led her to decide for a career with the pros. Amateur boxing record: 30 fights, 24 wins, 1 draw Amateurs: World Championships 2008 (5th place), European Union Championship 2008 (3rd place), International German Champion (2004,2007,2008,2009,2010), Croatian Champion 2008 In the final of the German championship 2008, she defeated future middleweight boxing world champion, Christina Hammer. ==Professional career== In 2010, Adler became a professional at the Wiking Box Team in Berlin. Under coach Hartmut Schr√∂der, she became German champion in May 2011 by a knockout victory in the second round against Danijela Bickei and already in November of the same year, the European champion of the WIBF by a point victory after 10 rounds against the Karlsruherin Pia Porter. In 2012 the cooperation with Wiking ended. She then coached the coaches team Thommy Wiedemann and Bernd Fernengel in Ulm until 2014. In January 2013, she became WIBA world champion by a unanimous point win against Edita Karabeg. In May 2013, with a victory over Zane Brige from Latvia, the second World Championship title followed, this time after the WBF version. The fight took place in Volgodonsk, Russia. She won the WBC title in November 2013 in a fight against Zane Brige over 10 rounds after unanimous decision in Grozny. It was the first women's boxing match in Chechnya. In May 2014, Nikki Adler defended her WIBA title in Krasnodar, Russia against Gifty Amanua Ankrah. In September 2014, Adler again celebrated a victory in Holzminden by K.O. against Rita Kenessey. In 2015 Adler focused on the defense of her WBC title in a gripping battle against Szilvia Szabados in the MHP Arena Ludwigsburg. Adler won by a unanimous decision. Her next challenger was Elene Sikmashvili. Adler defeated the Georgian in Saarbr√ºcken in July 2016 by knockout and remains the reigning and undefeated world champion in the super middleweight division.

Built in 1876, it was home to a prominent regional manufacturer of loom parts supplied to the area's textile manufacturers. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. As of 2017, it is vacant and owned by the city, which is considering adaptive reuse for the property. ==Description and history== The American Supply Company Building is located in northern Central Falls, on the west side of Broad Street on the south bank of the Blackstone River. It is across the street from the historic Valley Falls Mill. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, finished in vinyl siding laid over original wooden clapboards. It is covered by a gabled roof with continuous shed-roof dormers. Its western elevation consists of protective plywood, due to the c. 2000 demolition of a large ell. The interior of the building is basically intact, although there is no longer any manufacturing equipment in it. It does retain elements of a late 19th-century freight elevator powered by water or steam. The American Supply Company was founded in 1883 by the merger of three businesses involved in the manufacture of parts for large textile weaving looms. Myron Fish founded one of these companies in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1860s, and was lured to Central Falls by the offer of manufacturing space in the Valley Falls complex. In 1876, Fish contracted with the Valley Falls Company to lease space across Broad Street for the construction of a dedicated manufacturing space. Fish specialized in manufacturing belts, but also made other parts. He merged in 1883 with John Kendrick, a manufacturer of similar specialty parts for looms, who was based in Providence. The new company was called the American Supply Company. In 1890 it greatly expanded the facility on Broad Street, building an ell that dwarfed the size of the original building; this was demolished about 2000, along with a boiler house and shed that also stood on the property. The American Supply Company was harmed by New England's decline as a textile center, and closed in 1961. The building was used from 1963 to 1991 by a rug manufacturer, and has been owned by the city or state for most of the time since 1995. As of 2017, the city owns the property and is considering adaptive uses suitable for its riverfront location. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence County, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Central Falls, Rhode Island Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Providence County, Rhode Island ","title":"American Supply Company Building"},{"id":"54095569","text":"The 1978 NCAA Division II football rankings are from the Associated Press.

It was released as the album's fourth single on September 15, 2013, through the iTunes Store in the Scandinavian countries, and was offered on the same platform as the single of the week for free in Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It was well received by critics, who commended its production and lyrics. The track charted on Billboards Christian Rock songs chart, peaking at number 21 and spending five weeks on it. It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 500,000 units sold in the country. The band performed \\"Fake You Out\\" during their Quiet Is Violent World Tour (2014), as part of a medley with a cover version of \\"Summertime Sadness\\" by American singer Lana Del Rey. == Production and release == After signing a record deal with Fueled by Ramen in 2012, Twenty One Pilots started working on their label debut record alongside producer Greg Wells, who had previously collaborated with Adele and Katy Perry. Vessel, their third studio album and first under the label, was released in January 2013, and included new songs as well as re-recorded versions of tracks from the duo's previous album, Regional At Best (2011). \\"Fake You Out\\", alongside the rest of Vessel, was recorded and mixed at Rocket Carousel Studio in Los Angeles, California. The track was written by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph and produced by Greg Wells. Band member Josh Dun played the drums and the auxiliary percussion. Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg mastered the song at Howie Weinberg Mastering in Los Angeles, California.

Twenty One Pilots. iTunes Store. Fueled by Ramen. 2013. The song has a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Joseph stated that he was excited while writing the track, since he implemented on it many elements that he had not heard on music before. During the verses, he sings in falsetto; regarding this, he called this part one of his favorite melodies because he wanted to write a song that had verses as infectious as the chorus: \\"I feel like writers slack on verses when it comes to melody... I've always felt like why not have the verses‚Äîthe melody of the verses be just as infectious as the chorus? So I'm proud of this song in that way\\". The vocalist also expressed that he tried to implement many musical genres in the song; he elaborated: \\"Also, it does the whole mash-up genre thing that everyone is freaking out about. Truly, I just didn't know that there were rules to songwriting and, you know, so I just worked on transitioning from one genre to the next. I wanted to hear a song that did that. I've never heard a song do that before, I wanna hear that, so I made that\\".Vessel [Commentary Version]. Twenty One Pilots. Spotify. Fueled by Ramen. 2013. Concerning the meaning of the lyrics, Joseph stated: Maria Sherman of Fuse compared the track to the music of American band The Killers \\"with a purposeful-youth tinge\\", while describing the beat of the bridge as \\"pulsing\\". Additionally, Jacob Testa of Mind Equals Blown compared it with the works of bands Passion Pit and The Darkness. Adam R. Holz of Plugged In opined that \\"Fake You Out\\" talks about \\"how hard it is to tell people the truth about ourselves, even those to whom we're supposedly the closest\\" and pointed out references to suicide. Laura Coulter stated that the lyrics, especially the rap verse, talk about depression. Some publications noted a contrast between the song's lyrics and melody. Craig Roxburgh of Mind Equals Blown commented that the track \\"does as the title says and fakes happiness with its beat, when it is in fact a rather sad song lyrically\\". == Reception and live performances == Shelby Lum of The Lantern opined that Joseph's vocals \\"truly shined\\" on the track and stated that he reached \\"higher octaves\\" and pushed \\"the limits of his rapping\\" in the track. Laura Coulter wrote that: \\"For such a serious song, the layered vocals and electronic instruments make for a fun chorus.\\" Jacob Testa of Mind Equals Blown wrote that the track had \\"a heaping portion of hook, momentary injections of synth-pop and sharp rapping, sprinkles of record scratches and screams, and 100% uniqueness\\". He also said that it was \\"a true culmination of the artists, synthesizing a variety of inputs and outputting something individually expressive\\". Fred Thomas of AllMusic selected \\"Fake You Out\\" as an album pick and called it as a \\"banging tune\\" with \\"a take on the parts of indie rock that appeal to a mass market\\". A reviewer of Teen Ink described it as \\"an upbeat and fun song, despite its heavy lyrics\\". An editor of website Mezzic opined that the track was both quirky and brutal. \\"Fake You Out\\" charted on Billboards Christian Rock songs chart during 2015, peaking at number 21 and spending five weeks on it.

The Minutemen are one of the ACHA's premier programs, having qualified for 16 of the 20 ACHA National Tournaments held for women's teams (within 18 years of total ACHA membership), a number second to Michigan State for the all-time lead. Additionally, UMass has won four ECWHL playoff titles (a conference championship total that trails only rival Rhode Island nationally) and has been the home of two Zo√´ M. Harris Award winners (Maura Grainger in 2008‚Äì09 and Brittani Lanzilli in 2015‚Äì16), one of five ACHA D1 programs to produce multiple recipients of the honor. Bill Wright has been the team's head coach since 2012 and has led the Minutemen to their only ACHA championship game appearance (2014). ==History== Early seasons (2002‚Äì07) UMass began play in the ACHA for the 2002‚Äì03 season and almost immediately joined soon-to-be archrival Rhode Island as one of the northeastern United States' two dominant ACHA programs, a status that has continued to the present day with only rare interruption. Under head coach Bill Finn, and featuring early stars like three-time All-American Aleta Mills, Jacqui Phillips, Samatha Louras and goalie Becky Trudel, the Minutemen finished second in the East Region and received an autobid to the third-ever ACHA National Tournament, in Muskegon, Michigan. UMass performed well at nationals, finishing second in their four-team group after wins over Northern Michigan and St. Cloud State. While that outcome would have meant a trip to the semifinals under subsequent formats, in 2003 it meant that the Minutemen were dumped in the third-place game, where they dropped a decision to West Los Angeles College. Despite the disappointing finish, the program had announced its arrival in a way few have, before or since. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw UMass contribute to two notable pieces of history. That season, the program helped start the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League, with Rhode Island, Penn State, Buffalo and Boston University as the other founding members. From January 16‚Äì19, 2004, UMass hosted an event dubbed the \\"UMass White Out Tournament,\\" the first mid-season showcase event held within the ACHA's women's divisions. Invited teams included new conference opponents Rhode Island and Buffalo, along with West LA College, Robert Morris (IL) (the eventual champion) and Colorado. Louras, meanwhile, finished that year with 37 points, good enough to place ninth on the ACHA's top scorers list and become the first documented Minuteman to rank in the top ten. The Minutemen made it to the ECWHL championship game to close each of the league's first three seasons, but as was the pattern of the time, lost each to URI (the Rams were the circuit's dominant team early on and would not lose an ECWHL playoff game until 2011). The maroon and white did, however, fire off back-to-back ACHA National Tournament bids in 2005 and 2006. The first was the stronger of the two runs, thanks to a 3‚Äì1 pool win over Michigan, powered by Emily Slotnick's game-winning goal and two assists, that sent UMass through to the quarterfinals. The Great Lakes State got the best of the Bay State when given another chance though, as Michigan State upended the Minutemen 2‚Äì1 on the way to a second-place finish. Beginning in the mid-2000s, UMass continued to grow its program by aggressively pursuing scheduling against NCAA varsity opposition, including Castleton State, MIT, Sacred Heart and Holy Cross. The team hosted the ACHA National Tournament at the Mullins Center to close 2006‚Äì07, a tournament notable as the first in association history to include two women's divisions, as ACHA Women's Division 2 began play that season. St. Scholastica won the inaugural D2 title, while Robert Morris (IL) took the crown in the Minutemen's D1. UMass, meanwhile, was somewhat fortunate to receive an automatic hosting bid to the tourney that year - that final season's ranking of 15th was its lowest ever and one that wouldn't have otherwise earned a spot a nationals. The Minutemen did outperform their seed, thanks to a 4‚Äì0 upset of No. 8 Michigan in the pool round that advanced UMass to the quarterfinals, however a 1‚Äì0 loss to Rhode Island there ended the run. Rise to prominence (2007‚Äì12) Mullins Center banner marking UMass' first trip to the ACHA semifinals in 2008 The 2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09 seasons were notable as UMass' first serious foray into the national championship discussion, thanks to new head coach Chris Cobb and a sudden talent infusion led by Maura Grainger and URI transfer Cara Murphy. Grainger, who began her collegiate career with Providence College's NCAA Division I program, fired home 44 goals and 74 points during her first season in Amherst (the latter number a program record), and would go on to win UMass' first Zo√´ M. Harris Award the following year. Murphy, for her part, totaled 88 points in just 50 games over her two seasons. The Minutemen entered the 2008 ACHA National Tournament as the number four seed and battered Michigan State and Nichols by identical 5‚Äì2 scorelines to win Pool D, then topped Wisconsin (Pool C's second-place team) 4‚Äì1 in the quarterfinals. Things went down from there however, as Lindenwood (which was then in the heart of a streak of five consecutive title game appearances with four wins) knocked UMass off of the championship track in the semifinals. Rhode Island, with the stakes much lower than in the previous tournament, then defeated the Minutemen by a 3‚Äì1 count in the third place game. A follow-up effort in 2009's championships in Rochester, New York saw UMass fall one round earlier - in the quarterfinals - yet arguably closer to a title. Thanks to some unfortunate pool placement, largely due to eventual runner-up Robert Morris (IL) underachieving during the regular season and ranking fifth, the fourth-seeded Minutemen drew the Eagles in their pool, where they dropped a 5‚Äì2 result. While UMass still advanced to the quarterfinals, it did so as second in its pool as was therefore paired up with a pool winner in the form of Lindenwood, a team on the way to the second of three consecutive national championships. The Bay Staters did push the Lions like few teams of that era could though, in taking an early lead before LU tied things up late, then won in double overtime on an Alexandra Johansson goal. Still, 2008‚Äì09 did see one unprecedented success: UMass finally broke through and finished first in the ECWHL standings to take the regular season league title, the first time since the ECWHL's founding that Rhode Island did not win both the regular season and playoff crowns. URI managed to save face by quadrupling a Caitlin Scannell goal in a 4‚Äì1 win for that year's playoff title. Grainger's departure for 2009‚Äì10, along with the loss of other stars like Murphy, Jill Clark and standout goalie Christen Eulian, signaled a bit of a transition period for the program. Even UMass' customary spot in the top two of ECWHL was no longer safe thanks to Northeastern, which won the ACHA Division 2 national championship in 2009‚Äì10, then immediately moved up to Division 1. The Huskies emphatically announced their arrival by winning both ECWHL titles in 2010‚Äì11. Even with less conference success than had become customary, the Minutemen did continue to qualify for nationals - albeit narrowly, as the 8th, 7th and 8th seed in the eight-team fields of 2010, 2011 and 2012, with their 2012 inclusion ahead of an ECWHL regular season champion Penn State squad seen as controversial in some corners. However, the 2010‚Äì11 and 2011‚Äì12 seasons saw UMass stockpile much of the core that would lead to the team's next substantial ACHA title run, including Sarah Oteri, Chelsea Corell, Amanda Abromson, Sam Gouin, Meghan Crosby, Caleigh Labossiere and Chelsea and Raschelle Br√§m. The high ceiling of that group began to show during the 2012 ACHA National Tournament, when UMass silenced doubters with a shocking run to the semifinals thanks to pool round ties against the first and third seeds (Robert Morris (IL) and Rhode Island), then a win over sixth- ranked Michigan to sneak ahead of URI into second place in the group. That set up an unlikely semifinal pairing between the two lowest-seeded teams in the tournament: the Minutemen and No. 7 Northeastern. However, the Huskies took the all-Massachusetts tilt 4‚Äì0 and went on to win the title behind tournament MVP goalie Chelsea Dietz, who conceded just three goals in five tournament games. UMass scored a historic 4‚Äì3 victory over three-time defending national champion Lindenwood on January 22, 2011, thanks to Rachel Gantt's late power play winner and 47 saves by Kelsey Magrane. The Lions lost just 26 times in eight ACHA seasons before moving to NCAA Division I following that 2010‚Äì11 season, and although they were missing six players due to the 2011 World University Games tournament, the squad remaining stateside went 4‚Äì0 against other opponents during the tournament, including a pair of wins against contender Robert Morris (IL). Bill Wright era (2012‚Äìpresent) The Mullins Center Community Rink, UMass' home ice throughout its history 2012‚Äì13 The Minutewomen got a new head coach in 2012‚Äì13 when Bill Wright took over for Chris Cobb, who had taken a coaching job in NCAA Division III with Williams College. Wright inherited a strong team that already included the aforementioned stars, along with key freshmen Ally Perdios and Jess Greenwood, and Penn State transfer Paige Harrington. By the end of the regular season, were ranked second only to Liberty. That bit of history was made possible by another: UMass' first-ever ECWHL tournament title, thanks to a 2‚Äì1 title game win over defending ACHA national champion Northeastern. An impressive journey at the ACHA National Tournament in Ashburn, Virginia followed, with an opening 3‚Äì2 win over 2011 national champ Michigan State, as second-period goals from Oteri, Labossiere and Chelsea Br√§m turned around an early 2‚Äì0 deficit. Although Northeastern took an ECWHL final rematch in the day one nightcap (the first day of the tournament involved two pool games played by each team at the time), two more Oteri goals delivered a vital 2‚Äì1 victory over Robert Morris (IL) that, along with tiebreaker help, sent UMass through to the semifinals for the third time in program history. Once there, however, eventual champ Minnesota jumped on the Minutemen for three goals in the first ten minutes of the contest en route to a 5‚Äì1 result. 2013‚Äì14 After coming off of a pair of ACHA semifinal appearances and beginning fifth in the rankings, the Minutemen put together a 20‚Äì6‚Äì1 regular season to climb into the second seed for ACHAs, just three voting points ahead of Rhode Island in third. The URI side likely felt that they deserved better thanks to their 2‚Äì0 shutout of UMass to recapture the ECWHL playoff title, although the Minutemen would be able to point to their sweep of Rhody by identical 4‚Äì1 scores just two weeks prior to that in reply. Away from the ACHA (and the Western Hempishere, for that matter), Abromson, Corell, Harrington, Labossiere and Oteri were selected for the 2013 U.S. National University Team that competed at the 2013 World University Games, eventually winning bronze medals in Trentino, Italy in December 2013. The pool round at the ACHA National Tournament in Newark, Delaware was a tight-checking, nail-biting two days. An upstart Liberty team (the runners-up from 2013, but only seeded seventh in 2014) gave the Minutemen all the trouble they wanted before a Chelsea Br√§m goal with 5:02 remaining squeaked out a 2‚Äì1 victory. That evening, UMass survived another close call, as Labossiere buried Adrian in overtime by a 2‚Äì1 count after the Bulldogs tied things late. After those two wins secured a spot in the semifinals - and results early on the second day of the tournament clinched first place in the pool - Robert Morris (IL) overcame two Harrington goals with five in the second period, as the Eagles picked up what amounted to a consolation win by a 6‚Äì4 count. The contest was notable as a meeting of future Buffalo Beauts teammates Harrington and Hayley Williams (who grabbed an assist), and as a World University Games reunion of sorts - in addition to the five Minutemen and Williams, RMU's Jessica Merritt and Ramey Weaver were also on Team USA, with the latter both its captain and leading scorer. In the semifinals, UMass and Rhode Island played one of the most significant chapters of the many in their storied rivalry. Corell and URI's Kayla DiLorenzo, two of the ACHA's best goalies, traded big saves with 29 and 23 stops, respectively, but early goals from Labossiere and Raschelle Br√§m were just enough for a 2‚Äì1 victory. The Minutemen fell one win short of their intended destination though, as Miami University formally launched a dynasty that would eventually grab three national titles in four years with a 3‚Äì1 championship game win. Siobhan Elvin scored a shorthanded goal for UMass to make the score 2‚Äì1 early in the second period, but Kaley Mooney answered quickly for the RedHawks and penalty trouble down the stretch doomed a comeback attempt. Nevertheless, the second-place finish remains the program's high water mark. 2014‚Äì15 and 2015‚Äì16 Although the next two years didn't produce much success at nationals (UMass failed to win a game at the tournament in both 2015 and 2016), particularly compared to the three straight final four runs of 2012 through 2014, they were marked by gains in other areas. For example, after a lengthy stretch of Rhode Island dominance from 2003‚Äì10 and heavily contested outcomes from 2010‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15 more or less kicked off UMass' tenure as the rulers of the ECWHL. A 15‚Äì3‚Äì0 league record was good enough to edge URI for the regular season title, and the Minutemen followed that up by shelling the Rams 7‚Äì2 in the playoff championship game behind two goals each from Mallory O'Brien and Brittani Lanzilli. That win set off a run of three straight league title game wins for the Minutemen through the 2016‚Äì17 season, each over URI, as UMass gained the upper hand in the storied rivalry. On October 11, 2014, UMass had the opportunity to play in the 8,387-seat main arena of the Mullins Center for the first time during Wright's tenure, a rarity as the team typically practices and plays in the adjacent Community Rink. Although the game was delayed for 45 minutes due to ice conditions (the UMass men's team tore up the ice just prior to the scheduled game time while being bag skated following their 8‚Äì1 defeat to Jack Eichel and Boston University the night before), UMass topped Penn State 1‚Äì0 on a second-period Michaela Tosone goal and a Kasey Zegel shutout. During the 2015‚Äì16 season Lanzilli, then a sophomore, became UMass' second Zo√´ M. Harris Award winner after topping ACHA Division 1 in scoring with 49 goals and 68 points in just 29 games. Early in the 2016‚Äì17 season, the former Medford High School star passed Grainger to become the program's all-time leading scorer. She also became the third Minuteman to earn First or Second Team ACHA All-American status multiple times, following Mills and Angela Rufo. 2016‚Äì17 While the 2016‚Äì17 campaign was similar to the previous two in some ways (a dual ECWHL championship, an ACHA tournament bid), it was also different in others. Beyond his typically-stout freshman class, Wright picked up three key transfers, including goaltender Amber Greene (via Penn State's NCAA Division I team), swing player Sonja Klumpp (who led the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference in scoring as a freshman at Maryland) and Olivia Knight (another NCAA player, from Division III's Nichols College). Thus bolstered, the Minutemen wasted no time in picking up the key non-conference win that had proven somewhat elusive in recent seasons: a wild 5‚Äì4 outcome over then-second-ranked Liberty, an affair that saw UMass go from up 3‚Äì0 after the first period to down 4‚Äì3 early in the third, before goals from Tatum Schulz and Joanna Olson pulled the tilt back. Other key non-conference results included a subsequent tie against the Flames, another with No. 1 Miami, still another with No. 5 Grand Valley State and a rout of No. 9 Michigan. Meanwhile, the Minutewomen flexed an unprecedented amount of muscle within the ECWHL, as a late-season tie with Rhode Island was the only blemish on the squad's league record over 14 regular season games and a pair of playoff matches, including the third straight championship game win over URI. UMass' quest at the ACHA National Tournament - never in doubt, as the team was not ranked lower than fifth after the Liberty win and finished in fourth - got off to a catastrophic start when the Minutemen had to forfeit the first game of a best-of-three quarterfinal series against fifth-seeded Lindenwood‚ÄìBelleville (under a new tournament format introduced that season) thanks to Winter Storm Stella and related travel difficulties to Columbus, Ohio. The squad, however, arrived in time for game two and proceeded to overcome the unfortunate series deficit with consecutive wins over the Lynx to return to the semifinals. Lanzilli (who would go on to an all-tournament selection and once again led the nation in scoring) and linemate Olson led the way through the 7‚Äì3 and 4‚Äì2 wins with a combined six goals and four assists. Top-seeded Liberty abruptly ended things in the final four by handing the Minutemen a 1‚Äì0 defeat, thanks to a second- period Chelsey Greenwood goal. 2017‚Äì18 In 2017‚Äì18, UMass showed early promise when an Olson overtime goal boosted the Minutemen over a national- title-contending Michigan State team, as part of a solid start to the year. However, the team was decimated with several key injuries by November, including Lanzilli, Kelly Dolan, and Courtney Sullivan, while another notable player, Katy Turner, studied in Hawai'i during the first half of the year. The remaining skaters, particularly Olson, UMass' leading scorer for most of Lanzilli's absence, managed to keep things afloat for the most part, although one casualty of the situation was the ECWHL championship. With the league reduced to three teams, thanks to the departures of Vermont and Northeastern after the 2016‚Äì17 season, it did not conduct a playoff, instead declaring its regular season winner the overall champion. While still affected by injuries, the Minutemen dropped their series to Rhode Island with a 1‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in games played during December and January, and the Rams would go on to win the crown after both they and UMass went 4‚Äì0‚Äì0 against Penn State, the third remaining ECWHL member. Nationally, a 1‚Äì2‚Äì0 weekend at a Robert Morris-hosted showcase in early November (including a come-from-ahead loss to the hosts on a late Emily Urban goal) dropped Massachusetts from 5th to 8th in the rankings, and the Minutemen would spend the remainder of the year on the bubble for the eight-team ACHA National Tournament. A strong finish to the regular season, particularly a key sweep of eventual Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League champion Colorado in February, ultimately locked down an ACHA-best 15th nationals bid for the program. However, second-seeded Adrian made short work of No. 7 UMass at the tournament, sweeping their best-of-three quarterfinal series. 2018‚Äì19 and 2019‚Äì20 A large chunk of UMass' core from that run of success graduated in 2018 (Lanzilli, Dolan, Greene, Schulz, Meredith Gallagher and Sam Baturin was that year's senior class) and 2019 (which featured an eight-player class including Olson, Knight, Courtney Sullivan, Hannah Sullivan and Meghan Lawler), forcing Wright to execute a reload quickly. While eventual captain Juliana Dolan remained to bridge the generation gap, the next generation of Minutemen stars included Kat Nikolopoulos, who scored 30 points in each of her first two seasons in Amherst, explosive swing player Holly Russell, Minnesotan Sandra Bienkowski, and goaltender Casey Marshall, a product of the esteemed New Jersey Rockets program. The team got off to a 5‚Äì1‚Äì0 start in 2018‚Äì19, but then lost to Michigan State by a 4‚Äì3 count on November 2, 2018 and (somewhat inexplicably, as MSU is a perennial top ten team) tumbled from 4th to 8th in the rankings. UMass dropped to 9th the next week after a 1‚Äì2‚Äì0 weekend at the Robert Morris University Showcase and would not make it back into the top eight for the rest of the season, missing the ACHA National Tournament for the first time since 2004 (a streak of 14 appearances in a row). The Minutemen, as usual, performed strongly within the ECWHL, winning the regular season (which has served as the only league championship since 2018), but were ultimately doomed by a 6‚Äì7‚Äì0 mark against a tough out-of-conference schedule including powerhouses like the Spartans, Liberty, Lindenwood‚ÄìBelleville, and McKendree. Juliana Dolan's overtime goal against URI on February 8, 2019 gave Wright his 100th win as head coach. After that hiccup, 2019‚Äì20 saw a return to UMass' more typical form including just six losses all season, four of which came against two-time defending national champion Liberty. Season sweeps of ECWHL opponents Rhode Island and Penn State helped the team stay in the 5th or 6th spot in the rankings all year long, but the Minutemen truly announced themselves as a contender on January 18, 2020 with a 2‚Äì0 victory against No. 3 Lindenwood‚ÄìBelleville fueled by a 32-save Marshall shutout and goals from Nikolopoulos and Dolan. UMass qualified for their 16th ACHA National Tournament as the fifth seed and were scheduled to take on fourth-seeded Adrian in the quarterfinals, however the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, Wright was honored as the ACHA Division 1 coach of the year on the heels of the bounceback season. ==Recent season by season results== {  bgcolor=\\"#ffeeaa\\"Won Championship bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\"Lost Championship bgcolor=\\"#d0e7ff\\"Regular Season Conference Champions } {  - align=\\"center\\" 881c1c;color:#ffffff;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"80px\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"120px\\"  Coach ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\"  W  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" L  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" T ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"80px\\" Conference ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" Conf.

A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014‚Äì15, then discontinued in 2018‚Äì19 when the ACHA switched to an entirely computer-based ranking. Beginning with the 2016‚Äì17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games. {  style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"25\\"Ranking - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"Pre !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"1 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"2 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"3 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"4 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"5 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"6 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"7 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"8 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"9 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"10 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"11 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"12 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"13 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"14 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"15 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"16 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"17 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" !

The inaugural 2000‚Äì01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03 (the latter being UMass' first ACHA season), the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003‚Äì04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004‚Äì05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions - Northeast, Southeast, Central and West - although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007‚Äì08. The 2009‚Äì10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings. {  style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"25\\"Ranking - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"1 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"2 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"3 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"4 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"5 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2000‚Äì01 bgcolor=FFFFFF colspan=\\"5\\" Not an ACHA member - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2001‚Äì02 bgcolor=FFFFFF colspan=\\"5\\" Not an ACHA member - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2002‚Äì03 bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=D8FFEB2E bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2003‚Äì04 bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2004‚Äì05 bgcolor=FFFFFF3NE bgcolor=FFFFFF3NE bgcolor=FFFFFF3NE bgcolor=D8FFEB2NE bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2005‚Äì06 bgcolor=FFFFFF2NE bgcolor=FFE6E63NE bgcolor=FFFFFF3NE bgcolor=FFFFFF3NE bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2006‚Äì07 bgcolor=FFFFFF‚Äì bgcolor=D8FFEB4NE bgcolor=FFE6E65NE bgcolor=FFFFFF5NE bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2007‚Äì08 bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2008‚Äì09 bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=D8FFEB1E bgcolor=FFE6E62E bgcolor=FFFFFF2E bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2009‚Äì10 bgcolor=FFFFFF4E bgcolor=D8FFEB3E bgcolor=FFFFFF3E bgcolor=F2F2F2 bgcolor=F2F2F2 } ==ACHA national honors== Annual awards All-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008‚Äì09.

Photo: almaty2017.com Since 2011, the ACHA has supplied players for the U.S. National University Select Women's Team, which competes at the World University Games women's hockey tournament, held biennially and as part of the multi-sport event for college and university student-athletes. UMass has been among the ACHA's top-contributing programs to the WUG effort, including a total of eight different players selected for Team USA 11 times. Minutemen have generally been far more than passengers when selected. Paige Harrington served as an alternate captain both times she was a member of Team USA, including for the 2013 event in Trentino, Italy, which saw Harrington and four other Minutemen win bronze medals. It was a historic finish as a first medal for any American team in the modern era (USA Hockey resumed its participation in the WUG on the men's side in 2001 after a lengthy hiatus) and just the second overall, following the U.S. men in 1972 (who \\"earned\\" bronze medals by finishing third in a three-team tournament). Amanda Abromson led the 2013 UMass delegation in scoring with a pair of goals and an assist, including a go-ahead marker in the semifinals against Russia, while goalie Chelsea Corell appeared in three contests, including a preliminary-round shutout of Spain. Three Minutemen from the 2013 team - Harrington, Abromson and Caleigh Labossiere - returned to play at the 2015 World University Games and were joined by newcomer Vicki Bortolussi. Although Team USA dropped out of medal contention quickly, the UMass players combined for 12 points over five tournament games. One of the points, an assist by Labossiere, set up Emily Ford's overtime goal in a come-from-behind victory against Kazakhstan that helped clinch fifth place. The 2017 edition of the squad, which included Brittani Lanzilli and Amber Greene, repeated 2013's trip to the podium by again winning the bronze medal. Greene, Team USA's starting goalie, excelled throughout the tournament, finishing third among all netminders in both goals against average (3.00) and save percentage (0.929). She made 32 saves on 34 Japan shots in a key 3‚Äì2 U.S. pool round win that (eventually) allowed the team to advance to the semifinals, and then delivered a 28-save shutout of China in the bronze medal match. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"180px\\"  Location ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"180px\\"  Player ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"110px\\"  Result -  rowspan=\\"5\\"  2013  rowspan=\\"5\\"  Trentino, Italy  Amanda Abromson  rowspan=\\"5\\"  Bronze Medal -  Chelsea Corell -  Paige Harrington -  Caleigh Labossiere -  Sarah Oteri -  rowspan=\\"4\\"  2015http://www.usawomenshockey.com/news_article/show/456032?referrer_id=1362963  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Granada, Spain  Amanda Abromson  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Fifth Place -  Vicki Bortolussi -  Paige Harrington -  Caleigh Labossiere -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2017http://teamusa.usahockey.com/news_article/show/740061?referrer_id=2890555  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Almaty, Kazakhstan  Amber Greene  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Bronze Medal -  Brittani Lanzilli } 2010 ACHA women's select team As a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and M√©ribel, France during April 2010. The team included Brittany Resendes as UMass' sole player representative, while Minutemen head coach Chris Cobb was an assistant to Rhode Island's Beth McCann. Its final record overseas was 2‚Äì2‚Äì0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams. ==Professional players== UMass has, by most measures, been the ACHA's most successful program in terms of advancing players to women's professional hockey leagues. The group is headlined by Paige Harrington, who signed a one-year, $10,000 contract with the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League for the team and circuit's inaugural 2015‚Äì16 season. After re-signing for a second season, Harrington helped the Beauts to the 2017 Isobel Cup through a 3‚Äì2 title-game upset of the Boston Pride, avenging a championship game loss to the Pride to end the previous year. That July, Harrington signed with the Pride - the closest NWHL team to her hometown of Mansfield, Massachusetts - for the 2017‚Äì18 campaign, her last as a pro. Chelsea and Raschelle Br√§m played for SC Reinach in Switzerland from their 2014 graduations through the 2019‚Äì20 season. They have been teammates with several notable Swiss players during their careers including Florence Schelling and Julia Marty, both of whom won bronze medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics. SC Reinach struggled in 2016‚Äì17, but the twins were vital in a relegation series win against SC Weinfelden, combining for four goals and seven points to save their squad's top-flight status. Of particular importance among those points were Raschelle's goal and assist and Chelsea's goal in a 4‚Äì0 fourth-game win to force a decisive fifth contest. SC Reinach then bounced back in 2017‚Äì18 to qualify for the playoffs, in part thanks to Raschelle's career-best ten points, and has been a fixture there since. On May 6, 2020, the Br√§ms switched teams and signed with ZSC Lions, citing a desire to move to Z√ºrich. {  - !

The two teams were founding members of the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League in 2003‚Äì04, and are the only two to remain in the league through its entire existence. No fewer than 10 times in the 14 seasons where an ECWHL playoff has been held, the title game has been a UMass-URI contest, with the Rams enjoying a 7‚Äì3 advantage in those games (although the Minutemen have won the last three). Among the more memorable ECWHL championship games were two overtime contests, both won by URI, including a 5‚Äì4 result in 2005. Three years later, Rhode Island stormed out to a 3‚Äì0 lead after the first period, only to see UMass reply with four unanswered to take the lead in the third period. However, the Rams forced overtime with a late equalizer, allowing URI's Justine Ducie to win the trophy in the sixth minute of the third extra period. Most recently, Amber Greene's 26-save shutout allowed second-period goals by Brittani Lanzilli, Lanzilli again and Michaela Tosone to produce a 3‚Äì0 win on February 26, 2017. Even when not competing head to head, the league nearly always runs through at least one of the teams, as there have been only three regular season or playoff titles in ECWHL history won by anyone else (Northeastern won the regular season and playoff championships in 2010‚Äì11, Penn State took the regular season in 2011‚Äì12). Not surprisingly, the northeast's two dominant programs are also frequent factors in the bigger picture, as both programs rank in the top five nationally in the number of ACHA National Tournament appearances. Since 2002‚Äì03, one of the two has been among the ACHA's final four to end 12 of 17 seasons in which a tournament was contested. Somewhat surprisingly, given all of that, UMass has only run into Rhode Island five times at nationals, and only three times with something other than bragging rights attached (two meetings, both URI wins, were the 2008 third-place game and a 2016 pool round meeting after both teams had already been eliminated). In 2007, the Rams edged UMass 1‚Äì0 at the Mullins Center to end the bottom-seeded Minutemen's chances in the quarterfinals. A 2012 pool round game ended in a 1‚Äì1 tie as Sarah Oteri and Johanna Leskinen traded goals while Chelsea Corell and Kayla DiLorenzo traded saves, although the Minutemen ultimately advanced to the tournament semifinals ahead of Rhode Island. In 2014, the biggest game of the group took place, in the national semifinals. Corell and DiLorenzo (both of whom ended the year among the national top five in goals against average, save percentage and shutouts) engaged in another goaltending duel, but first-period markers from Caleigh Labossiere and Raschelle Br√§m proved decisive in a 2‚Äì1 UMass victory. That 2013‚Äì14 season was a defining one of the rivalry in several ways, even prior to the semifinal tilt, as each team presented one of the most talented rosters in their respective storied histories. They combined to contribute eight players - more than one-third of the roster - to the 2013 World University Games bronze medal effort, including Lauren Hillberg, Alisha Difilippo and Cassie Catlow on the URI side. Back in the U.S., the Rams and Minutemen jockeyed at the top of the ACHA and ECWHL as usual, with neither ranked lower than fifth all year long. Rhode Island won the conference bragging rights with a 2‚Äì0 ECWHL championship game win to follow up the regular season title. However, the Minutemen edged out the Rams to finish second in the rankings thanks to a sweep just before the ECWHL playoffs and, of course, would go on to win the head-to-head matchup in the ACHA semifinals. Immediately after 2013‚Äì14, UMass went on a run of three consecutive ECWHL playoff championship game wins over URI, along with four of the next six regular season titles. The Rams did manage the regular season and overall title in 2017‚Äì18, as well as the 2015‚Äì16 regular-season crown. The series, beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 season, is 20‚Äì9‚Äì3 in UMass' favor. One other significant event in the rivalry's history took place in 2007, when Cara Murphy transferred from URI to UMass. Murphy had been a second-team All- American twice with the Rams, while leading the team in scoring during the 2006‚Äì07 season. She finished her career in the Bay Staters' colors with another pair of All-American seasons. Penn State While UMass' rivalry with Penn State pales in comparison to the one with URI, it has nevertheless been a consistent presence throughout Minutemen program history as PSU, like UMass and URI, was a founding member of the ECWHL and has been in the league for all but two of its 14 seasons. The teams have met four times at the ECWHL playoffs (a scheduled fifth was nixed by a 2010 snowstorm), with UMass enjoying a 3‚Äì1‚Äì0 advantage in those games. None were better than the contest that took place on February 28, 2004 at Rhode Island's Brad Boss Arena. The wild affair saw Aleta Mills and Samantha Louras each score four times - yet it wasn't quite enough, as the Lady Icers' Katie King scored four of her own on the way to an 8‚Äì8 tie after regulation, where neither team ever led by more than two and with only three stretches of more than 5:00 without a goal being scored. In the second overtime, Mills' fifth tally sent the Minutemen to the first-ever league championship game. The Minutemen have faced Penn State once at the ACHA National Tournament. In that game, a pool round meeting on March 5, 2015, PSU ran out to a 3‚Äì1 lead after two periods but UMass rallied for a 3‚Äì3 tie after Amanda Abromson scored with 1:04 left in regulation. Similarly to the Rhode Island rivalry with respect to Cara Murphy, UMass has also poached some of its all-time greats from Penn State. Future NWHL player Paige Harrington began her career at PSU in 2011‚Äì12, where she helped the Lady Icers go 2‚Äì0‚Äì1 against the Minutemen, including a win in the ECWHL semifinals. The Mansfield, Massachusetts native subsequently returned home and would go 3‚Äì1‚Äì1 against Penn State over the rest of her career. Goaltender and 2017 World University Games hero Amber Greene also began her collegiate career at Penn State, although as a member of the school's separate NCAA Division I team. Since the ECWHL's founding, the Minutemen are 37‚Äì12‚Äì2 against Penn State, through the 2019‚Äì20 season. ==Players== Notable alumni *Sarah Oteri (2010‚Äì14) ‚Äì Head coach of three-time state semifinalist co-op girls hockey team representing Methuen High School and Tewksbury Memorial High School, and 2017‚Äì18 Boston Globe coach of the year *Bailey Ingalls (2013‚Äì17) ‚Äì Student at Harvard Medical School, graduated in the top ten of UMass' class of 2017 ==See also== *American Collegiate Hockey Association *Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League *UMass Minutemen ice hockey *William D.

Beirut Pride takes place over several days in many venues in Beirut that vary every year, and runs a number of events such as panel discussions, seminars, debates, workshops, cultural and sports events, art and fashion exhibitions, theatre and performance, film screenings, literary events, community hang outs, food gatherings, parties and celebrations. The program is open to the public, with most events free of charge. It attracts and welcomes participants from various backgrounds: citizens, expats residing in the country, members of the Lebanese diaspora, visitors, media, tourists, academics, and people of all genders, ethnicities, sexualities and races. To accommodate the multilingual city, most communication happens in Arabic, English and French. Since its inception in 2017, Beirut Pride has been the first and only LGBTIQ+ pride in the arabophone world, and its largest LGBTIQ+ event. It has been the topic of two MA theses, one post-doctoral research and six documentaries, so far covered in 17 languages in 350 articles. Its first installment gathered 4,000 persons, and 2,700 people participated in the first three days of its 2018 edition, before the police cracked it down and arrested its founder Hadi Damien. The next day, the prosecutor of Beirut suspended the scheduled activities, and initiated criminal proceedings against Hadi for organizing events ‚Äúthat incite to debauchery‚Äù. Nevertheless, its third edition is scheduled for September/October 2019. Beirut Pride is a way forward, a celebration of achievements and a commemoration of legacy. It builds on the work of admirable first-timers who paved the way by making themselves visible in much more challenging times. Beirut Pride honors them, and raises its voice for queer people bullied at school, in college, in the workspace, in hospitals, within their family, by the State, or queers victim of hate crimes.https://stepfeed.com/we-talked-to-the-organizer-behind-lebanon-s-first- pride-week-7381 == The Lebanese Context ==  LGBTIQ+ & the Law  Lebanon plays host to Helem, the first LGBT non-profit organisation in the arabophone world, and has been witnessing, since the 2000s, a mushrooming of various NGO that work on LGBT issues. The polyglot capital Beirut has a reputation of a tolerant, open-minded city, and has been the location of ACID, the first gay club in the region.http://www.newnownext.com/first-ever-pride-celebration- held-in-lebanon/05/2017/ LGBT activists have often raised rainbow flags during national protests, sports events and concerts, and organisations many times called to protest police brutality, humiliation of LGBT people, and to demand the cancellation of Article 534 from the Lebanese Criminal Code. The latter stipulates that ‚Äúintercourse against nature is punishable with up to one year in jail‚Äù. Even though courts don‚Äôt imprison LGBT people for homosexuality, several humiliations and abuses take place in detention centers such as the ‚Äúegg test‚Äù, a practice that consists for the investigators to introduce an egg-shaped metal in the rectum of ‚Äúsuspected homosexuals‚Äù to prove anal intercourse. This medically unfounded test has been decried by human rights organisations and was associated to torture. While no more egg practices have been communicated since 2014, ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù undergo lengthy, expensive and invasive trials that conclude with a fine to pay, and the registration of the criminal offence ‚Äúpervert‚Äù or ‚Äúsexual deviant‚Äù or ‚Äúsodomite‚Äù for ten years on their police record - a humiliating reality that dehumanizes, breaches privacy, and hinders employment opportunities. LGBT institutionalized harassment is ongoing, and several LGBT events have been recently cracked down by the police: law enforcement officers consider other sections from the criminal code to halt LGBT events on the grounds of disruption of public order, immorality or incitement to debauchery. Trans* individuals are often considered sex workers, and are subjected to prosecution for behavior ‚Äúthat is against nature‚Äù.  A Decriminalization in Progress  Beirut Pride works for the full decriminalization of homosexuality, which means dissociating homosexuality from punitive texts and their interpretations. It doesn‚Äôt only call for the abrogation of Section 534, as other texts are also used against homosexuality, and non-heterosexual, non-procreative practice between consenting adults in private. Decriminalization stretches beyond the law and concerns police officers awareness and education. Eight judiciary decisions have been so far taken in favor of the decriminalization, with magistrates acquitting individuals brought before them on the grounds of Article 534 and its manifold interpretations. The first ruling was issued on December 2, 2009 by judge Mounir Sleiman in Batroun. It concerned two young men, arrested while kissing and caressing in a car, without engaging in a sexual act. The second judgement was ruled on January 28, 2014 by Magistrate Naji al-Dahdah in Metn. He did not criminalize a transgender woman who admitted to having sex with men, and who was prosecuted on the basis of Article 534. On May 5, 2016, Judge Hisham Qantar issued a ruling that halted the investigation of a Syrian citizen, arrested for wearing women‚Äôs clothing given his feminine leanings since childhood. On January 26, 2017, Judge Rabih Maalouf ruled that homosexuality was not a crime, only for prosecutors to appeal his decision.https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/02/lebanon-edges-closer- decriminalizing-same-sex-conduct On July 12, 2018, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Mount Lebanon confirmed his verdict that consensual sex between people of the same sex is not unlawful.https://en.annahar.com/article/835231-gay-rights-in-lebanon-a- positive-step-in-the-right- directionhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/19/lebanon-same-sex-relations-not- illegal It was the first time that a higher court ruled against the criminalisation of homosexuality. On November 14, 2018, the Court of Appeal in Beirut refused to prosecute three men for homosexuality. On 23 November 2018, a Beiruti court issued a ruling about an armed robbery of two gay men without prosecuting them based on Article 534. On 31 March 2019, military prosecutor Judge Peter Germanos refused to initiate criminal proceedings against four soldiers who were brought to him on the grounds of homosexual conduct.https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/News/2019/3/30/Lebanon-acquits-gay- soldiers-ruling-homosexuality-not-a-crime While people used to be interrogated for homosexuality on the simple ground of their fashion look, their feminine gesture or on the ground of an information that police officers receive, such practices have become less rampant. Prosecutors have started to refuse initiating criminal proceedings for homosexuality, and judges of lower and higher courts acquit individuals. Many other rulings were made in this sense, but parties did not wish to make their case public. However, power abuses still exist, organizing is constantly challenged, LGBT events are halted, and hate-speech is ongoing. == Beirut Pride Emerges == The global advances on the LGBT file and the momentum they created were the incentive for then 28-year old Hadi Damien to start planning Beirut Pride in August 2016. Acknowledging the need for a communications platform that stretches on several consecutive days, that speaks several languages, that taps into the universality of the creative sector, and that is structured, visible, loud and collaborative, Hadi approached friends and LGBT NGOs, gathering a group of dedicated people to reflect and to communicate on the LGBTIQ+ file in Lebanon. Beirut Pride has since been committed to decriminalizing homosexuality, fighting homophobia, bringing visibility to sexual minorities, raising awareness about HIV/AIDS, promoting social equality in general, and drawing attention to the problems faced by LGBT persons, for it is only through visibility that we deconstruct myths, lies and prejudice that surround the LGBT file. == Beirut Pride 2017 == The first edition of Beirut Pride took place May 14‚Äì21, 2017 to coincide with the International Day Against Homophobia. It drew four thousand people who participated in an exhibition of gender-fluid garments and its roundtable, a 101 drag workshop, a lip-synching performance, an LGBT storytelling night, NGO open doors, film screenings, a roundtable about LGBT persons in Lebanese movies and TV series, several parties, a legal talk, the launching of 3 t-shirts designed by Bashar Assaf x Marwan Kaabour, a drag show, and a party in Mar Mkhayel, the trendiest nightlife street in Beirut, where 18 bars flew the rainbow flag.https://www.executive-magazine.com/special-report/design-and- gender-identity-in- lebanonhttps://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/05/26/529687842/at-beiruts- first-pride-week-a-chance-to-celebrate-and-take-stock-of-challenges A march was scheduled for May 21, 2017, but in the days building to it, the intents for participation exceeded all expectations, and therefore, the planned logistics were insufficient to properly accompany the march. Therefore, organizers booked a large mountain land overlooking the Mediterranean, where participants indulged in barbecue, beer, live music, organic food, games, tanning and dancing. In support of Beirut Pride, several embassies flew the rainbow flag.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/21/beirut-pride-week- goes-ahead-despite-islamist-threats/ This edition was troubled when NGOs Proud Lebanon and Helem suffered from a call for boycott from religious organisations who called on to the authorities to stop both events. Each organization had planned a full conference day with performances, talks and screenings. The hotel that Proud Lebanon had booked cancelled the reservation, and Helem turned its event into a closed conference, broadcast on social media in an attempt to avoid violent escalation that would endanger the safety of participants.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/21/beirut-pride-week- goes-ahead-despite-islamist- threats/https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2017/06/6-pride-events-went-face-violent- threats/ From May 14 to 21, 2017, four thousand persons participated in the activities of Beirut Pride. The Beirut Pride 2017 bracelets were distributed for free, and the media coverage surpassed all expectations. 80 volunteers were part of the organization effort. == Beirut Pride 2018 == The second edition of Beirut Pride was scheduled for May 12‚Äì20, 2018. It started with a brunch in honor of the parents who did not kick their LGBT children from the family house because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The opening party brought 800 persons who sang and cheered to the performance of Lebanese singer and dancer Khansa, acclaimed Sudanese Brooklyn-based music band ‚ÄúAlsarah and the Nubatones‚Äù, and danced to the disco music until the early morning hours.https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1115571/beyrouth-se- met-aux-couleurs-de-la-gay- pride.htmlhttps://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1113607/khansa-pour-travestir- les-regles-du-jeu.html A Sunday brunch at the independent art incubator ‚ÄúHaven for Artists‚Äù featured a talk about trans-identity, followed by a talk with migrant workers about masculinity and femininity, before the massive Beirut Grand Ball. Additionally, Beirut Pride announced the Corporate Pledge project it was developing: a policy for corporations not to discriminate against staff and clients based on their sexuality and identity. Moreover, performances, talks, a gender-fluid fashion show and parties were programmed, a podcast and a magazine were ready to be launched. However, on the third night, Monday, May 14, 2018, Beirut Pride was raided following the dissemination of a homophobic, sensational, fabricated programme that was attributed to Beirut Pride. The police arrested the organiser of Beirut Pride, and despite the interrogation proving the falsity of the accusations, the general prosecutor of Beirut ordered the suspension of the scheduled activities before initiating criminal proceedings against Hadi Damien for organizing events ‚Äúthat incite to debauchery‚Äù.https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1115857/le-coordinateur-de- la-beirut-pride-detenu-puis-libere-sous-condition.html Following the crackdown, Beirut Pride witnessed a surge in support with hundreds of people calling, sending messages and offering assistance. A media frenzy surrounded the event, and condemnations poured from international organisations, foreign governments, Lebanese parliamentarians, InterPride, and other prides such as Marseille Pride and Copenhagen Pride.https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/beirut-prides-hadi-damien-qa- lebanons-lgbt-movement-growinghttps://lepetitjournal.com/beyrouth/hadi-damien- les-lendemains-de-la-beirut-pride-sont-brillants-245054 == Beirut Pride 2019 == The third edition was announced for September 28 - October 6, 2019.https://perspective-daily.de/article/809/probiere The year 2019 also marks the 50th commemoration of the Stonewall riots. The opening ceremony that was supposed to be held in Aresco center 3 \\"The Palace\\" in Al Hamra, got postponed after the mufti of the republic asked to stop the festival's activities accusing them of \\"violating moralities\\". It had already lost the support of the community after a transwoman came out about her negative experience with the founder and people questioned how the event was managed. == Beirut Pride Initiatives == For Beirut Pride to sustainably grow, organizers went beyond Pride Days and started working on some LGBTIQ+ files. Beirut Pride opened channels of communication with all religious authorities and political parties. It lobbied during the Parliamentary elections of May 2018 for the decriminalization of homosexuality, which the Kataeb Party and some independent candidates endorsed from the civil society and from the traditional parties.https://www.beirutpride.org/elections2018-en Contributing to the fight against homophobia, Beirut Pride collaborated with the American University of Beirut and with the Lebanese American University. It maintained its media presence, and worked with journalists and reporters on several LGBTIQ+ coverage. Beirut Pride facilitated several shootings in Lebanon about LGBTIQ+ thematics, and initiated the Arabic script #TypeWithPride based on the Gilbert Color Bold typeface, currently in development with designer Ghiya Haidar and Fontself. Through a regular presence on the international scene, participating to local and global talks, conferences and panels, expanding philanthropy and assistance, Beirut Pride constantly builds its reputation which positions it in the LGBTIQ+ global narrative.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Life/Lubnan/2019/Feb-02/475711-beirut- takes-part-in-french-institutes-global-night-of- ideas.ashxhttps://www.frontrunnersmarseille.org/media/uploaded/sites/13027/document/5b23b0cfd95a6_PrideMarseille2018Programmeweb.pdf  HIV/AIDS  For World AIDS Day, Beirut Pride launched a three-day event focusing on HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Organizers got the rights to adapt the UNAIDS World AIDS Day campaign of 2017, and renewed this collaboration in 2018. Beirut Pride also issued the trilingual HIV Multi- Sectorial Framework in Lebanon, before revisiting and augmenting a parliament bill that frames the rights of people living with HIV, emphasizes on national prevention outreach and criminalises discrimination against seropositive people.https://www.beirutpride.org/wad/campaignhttps://www.beirutpride.org/wad ==See also== * Pride parade * LGBT rights in Lebanon * Human rights in Lebanon * LGBT in the Middle East * List of LGBT events * List of LGBT awareness days ==ReferencesExternal links== *Beirut Pride website Category:Festivals in Lebanon Category:Pride parades Category:LGBT in Lebanon Category:Culture in Beirut Category:Annual events in Lebanon Category:2017 in Lebanon Category:2018 in Lebanon Category:2010s in Beirut Category:Events in Beirut Category:Recurring events established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in Lebanon Category:LGBT culture in the Middle East Category:LGBT culture in the Arab world ","title":"Beirut Pride"},{"id":"54095732","text":"On May 20, 2017, U.S. President Trump and Saudi Arabia's Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud signed a series of letters of intent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling US$110 billion immediately, and $350 billion over 10 years. The intended purchases include tanks, combat ships, missile defense systems, as well as radar, communications and cybersecurity technology. The transfer was widely seen as a counterbalance against the influence of Iran in the region and a \\"significant\\" and \\"historic\\" expansion of United States relations with Saudi Arabia. == Background == Saudi Arabia is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's security forces have relied on U.S. equipment, training, and service support for decades, officially as a counterbalance to Iranian military influence in the region, and to help protect the Kingdom from extremist attacks. Between 2011 and 2015, Saudi Arabia was the destination for nearly 10% of all U.S. arms exports. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals worth $115 billion, including warships, helicopters, and maintenance. However, some parts of this deal were blocked by the administration in December 2016 after Saudi Arabia's airstrikes and targeting procedures in neighboring Yemen drew controversy. After Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people, the Obama administration announced its intention to review U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia.\\"America 'agrees to stop selling some arms' to Saudi Arabia\\".

The 2017 deal was partially created with the help of Jared Kushner, son- in-law of and senior advisor to President Trump; Kushner had cultivated relationships with Saudi royalty during the transition and personally contacted Lockheed Martin during the deal-making process. == Details == The signing occurred at the Riyadh Summit, and was part of Trump's 2017 series of visits to the Vatican, Saudi Arabia and Israel. It also was related to a $20 billion investment in mostly American infrastructure. Saudi Arabia signed billions of dollars of deals with U.S. companies in the arms industry and petroleum industry, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton, Honeywell, McDermott International, Jacobs Engineering Group, National Oilwell Varco, Nabors Industries, Weatherford International, Schlumberger and Dow Chemical.\\"Factbox: Deals signed by U.S. companies in Saudi Arabia\\".

Saudi Arabia joined The Blackstone Group in May 2017 in a $40 billion fund to invest in stateside infrastructure projects. == American and Saudi Arabian government statements == The White House hailed the deal as a \\"significant expansion\\" of the two nations' \\"security relationships\\". The United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described the deal as \\"historic\\" and said that it would counter Iran, and urged them to halt support of destabilizing forces in the Middle East, although he hinted the United States would be open to discussions. In December 2018, the Senators in the US voted to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia‚Äôs war in Yemen. The 56-to-41 vote came after the controversial killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and thousands of civilian casualties in Yemen. Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-wrote the resolution, said it is the first time Congress had used the law to make clear ‚Äúthat the constitutional responsibility for making war rests with the United States Congress, not the White House. Today, we tell the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventurism.‚Äù On 24 September 2020, the Democratic Party introduced a legislation to control the United States foreign arms sales. The legislation was introduced while Trump administration was in discussions, led by Jared Kushner, about the possible sale of F-35s to the UAE. In the past the Trump administration has sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, during their active involvement in the Yemen civil war. == Reception ==  Domestic response  Tulsi Gabbard‚Äîa Democratic Representative from Hawaii‚Äîcriticized the move, saying that \\"Saudi Arabia is a country with a devastating record of human rights violations at home and abroad and has a long history of providing support to terrorist organizations that threaten the American people\\". Rand Paul introduced a bill to try to block the plan calling it a \\"travesty\\". US defense stocks reached all-time highs after the announcement. Senator John McCain told Al Jazeera: \\"The Saudis are in a war in Yemen and they need weapons. You want to win, you need weapons. We are in a war.\\" According to Senator Chris Murphy, \\"That $110 billion is a mix of old sales and future prospective sales that have not been announced or signed.\\"  International response  - Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called Saudi Arabia a \\"cow being milked\\" by the United States. - Yuval Steinitz, Minister of National Infrastructures, Energy, and Water Resources, expressed \\"concern\\". - The Government of Saudi Arabia praised the deal, and it stated that it is a turning point in Saudi‚ÄìAmerican relations. - More than 10,000 Yemeni people protested the deal in Sana'a. Houthis fired a ballistic missile toward the Saudi capital Riyadh. == Impact == Code Pink protesting senators supporting Saudi arms deal, December 2017 On June 5, 2017, Bruce Reidel of the Brookings Institution wrote that the arms deal consisted of \\"a bunch of letters of interest or intent, but not contracts.\\" On June 13, the United States Senate narrowly rejected an effort to block part of deal and approved the sale of $500 million worth of American weapons. The approval of the deal was opposed by various lawmakers, including GOP Senators Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Todd Young and Dean Heller, along with most Democrat Senators who voted to advance the measure in order to block the sale, citing the human rights violations by Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni Civil War and human rights violations at home. Among the senators who voted against moving the measure to block the sale were Democratics Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson, Joe Manchin and Mark Warner along with Republicans including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker and John McCain. In August 2018, a laser-guided Mark 82 bomb sold by the U.S. and built by Lockheed Martin was used in the Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a school bus in Yemen, which killed 51 people, including 40 children. Following the civilian casualties in Yemen by the airstrikes conducted by Saudi Arabia, the U.S. suggested putting gun cameras on Saudi and Emirati warplanes to see how strikes were being conducted, but the proposal was rejected by both the Saudis and the UAE. U.S. military officials posted at the coalition war room in Riyadh brought to notice that inexperienced Saudi pilots were flying the warplanes at high altitude to avoid enemy fire, but in turn were putting civilians in danger due to inaccurate bombings. Through October 2018, the Saudi government had purchased $14.5 billion of arms. During 2018, Trump made several assertions of how many American jobs the deal would create, including as many as 1,000,000.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whitehouse/ap-fact-check- trump-inflates-jobs-impact-of-saudi-arms- deal/2018/10/20/198f0b06-d46e-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html == See also == *US‚ÄìSaudi Arabia AWACS Sale *United States Military Training Mission *Al- Yamamah arms deal == References == 2017 arms deal Saudi Arabia arms deal Saudi Arabia arms deal 2017 United States-Saudi Arabia arms deal Category:2017 in international relations Saudi Arabia arms deal Category:2017 in Saudi Arabia ","title":"2017 United States‚ÄìSaudi Arabia arms deal"},{"id":"54095746","text":"Richard Barker (born 21 March 1981) is a British former professional tennis player. ==Biography== Barker was a doubles specialist, often partnering with twin brother William. The brothers were born in the West Midlands town of Solihull and went to King Edward's School in Birmingham. At the age of 12, Barker was the British 12 and Under singles champion, but soon after the twins decided to focus on education and stayed away from tennis for four years. In order to pursue both academia and tennis, they opted to move to the United States and attend Rice University. In their junior year the pair put together a streak of 35 consecutive wins, a run which ended in the semifinals of the NCAA Division I Championships. For their performances that season they were named the ITA's \\"doubles team of the year\\". He graduated with a degree in mathematical analysis and began competing professionally in the second half of 2004. In 2005 the twins were runners-up at the Surbiton Challenger, played in the main draw of the Nottingham Open and competed at the Wimbledon Championships. At Wimbledon they entered the draw as wildcards and were eliminated in the first round by the tournament's top seeds, Jonas Bj√∂rkman and Max Mirnyi. Straight after his Wimbledon appearance, Barker won a Challenger title at Forest Hills, partnering American Huntley Montgomery, after which he attained his career best ranking of 161. This was however to be his final professional tournament. Both brothers retired from tennis, as they didn't see a future for the doubles format. To counter this, they were the driving force behind a class-action lawsuit which sought an injection to stop the ATP's planned changes to doubles. The lawsuit, which gained support from several high profile doubles players including the Bryan brothers, was filed in a U.S. District Court in Houston during the 2005 US Open. At the end of the year the ATP announced that the third set would be replaced by a first-to-10 tiebreak while also removing ad-scoring.

The Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls was the only secular reformatory institution in the state where delinquent and neglected girls could make a home. In 1875, an act was passed providing for the establishment of industrial schools for criminal, vagrant, and deserted children. The children would be committed by the courts. Plans were made for the \\"Milwaukee Industrial School\\". The Legislature of 1878 authorised $15,000 for the erection of a school building and the city supplied an site worth $16,000 at 465 Lake Drive overlooking the Bay of Milwaukee. The school was named the Milwaukee Industrial School; but as it received inmates from every part of the state the name was changed to the Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls. Boys under the age of ten years, only, were admitted. The school's purpose was the prevention of crime and pauperism of unfortunate girls; and the restoration of those who had fallen into bad habits, or inherited vicious tendencies. The system of discipline and education was adapted to the condition and needs of the pupils. ==History== Establishment The necessity of establishing an industrial school, which should have for its aim and object the reformation of vagrant children, and children who were permitted to wander in the streets as beggars, and those whose condition would naturally lead to vice and crime, had been a matter of much thought to the ladies of the city of Milwaukee for many months, and various plans had been proposed and discussed for the accomplishment of that object when the winter of 1874 set in. The unusual severity of that winter and the depression of business whereby so many men and women were thrown out of employment, had the effect to increase largely the number of vagrant children in the streets of Milwaukee, and proved to be the occasion for adopting active and decisive measures. In February, 1875, a meeting of the women of Milwaukee was called to discuss the feasibility of establishing an industrial school similar to others in operation in the U.S. and other countries. An organization was created, but was soon found to be of little practical benefit, owing to the want of cooperative legislative action on the subject. To meet this need, a bill was introduced into the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled \\"An act authorizing Industrial Schools,\\" which passed both houses, was duly approved by the governor, and became a law on April 5, 1875. The organization which had instituted this work immediately took steps to organize in pursuance of the law, and became a corporation in April of the same year. A building and lot were rented at once, in a central part of the city, and preparations were made to enable the corporation to carry out the purpose of the law. Scarcely, however, had it received into its care some of the children for whose reformation and protection the law was intended, when certain parties not in sympathy with the movement claimed that the law was unconstitutional, and took steps to test its validity. The question of the validity of the law arose in this way: Certain children were taken from the poor house of Milwaukee County, by virtue of the law and the order of the court, and were placed in the custody and under the control of the Industrial School. A bill was presented to the board of supervisors of Milwaukee County for payment of the expenses of caring for such children. The board of supervisors declined to pay the bill, on the ground that the law was unconstitutional. Thereupon an application was made by the corporation for a writ of mandamus against the board of supervisors, to compel the payment of the bill as rendered. The counsel of the corporation think there is no doubt of the validity of the law, and that the board of supervisors will be ordered by the court to pay the bill. Should that feature of the law, however, which requires the board of supervisors to pay the expenses of children taken from the poor house, be declared invalid, it will not, as the corporation is advised, impair or affect other provisions of the law. Industrial school for boys in Waukesha, picture published 1893 The Milwaukee Industrial School was the only reformatory institution for girls in the state. It looked not only to the people of Milwaukee, but to the state at large, for the necessary means to carry out successfully the purpose of its organization. An Industrial School for Boys was already established in the state, in which boys 10 years old and upwards were received. There was a steady increase in the number of resident inmates of the Milwaukee Industrial School, and the demand for accommodation already began to tax the capabilities of the building. The corporation was largely dependent upon voluntary contributions, and was in need of state aid. Fifty-nine children were received into the institution during the first 10 months of its existence. In 1876, the cash receipts have amounted to three thousand, five hundred and thirty-seven dollars, and the disbursements have been three thousand and sixty-two dollars. Move to Oregon State funding was intermittent over the years and the managers often felt it inadequate. By 1917 the buildings in Milwaukee were deteriorating and considered a fire hazard, so the state took over, but the legislature was reluctant to sink more money into the old buildings. Ten years later, in 1928, the legislature finally approved $400,000 for a new facility. After considering various sites, the Board of Control bought a 405 acre farm near Oregon, ten miles south of Madison. This was felt a good site because of nearby medical and educational facilities in Madison and because the farm would provide wholesome activities for the girls and allow them to produce some of their own food, reducing operating costs. With The new facility was designed as a \\"cottage\\" institution, where instead of a massive dormitory, the residents lived in smaller cottages, closer to traditional homes. Each cottage housed 21 girls in their own rooms and four matrons who would oversee them, with a kitchen, a dining room, a laundry, a sewing room, and a cloths room. Exterior walls were clad in lannon stone and roofs were covered with red clay tile. Floors were terrazzo. By 1932 ten of these cottages were built on the farm at Oregon, but funds had been exhausted. As the country slid into the Depression the state couldn't allocate more money. The new facility sat largely idle until 1939, when Frank Klode rejoined the Board of Control and pushed for completion of the facility at Oregon. The state legislature funded enough to build a functioning facility scaled down from the original plan: the administration and assembly buildings were combined and one of the existing cottages was made into a receiving building and infirmary. In June of 1941 the old school in Milwaukee closed and 94 girls and the staff moved to the new facility in Oregon. Soon after, the school's name was changed to The Wisconsin School for Girls. In following years, the facility served older girls, and their stays became shorter. In 1973 boys were included to provide a more normal social environment. But the 1970s also saw a trend of moving people from institutions out into the community, and occupancy declined making the facility less efficient. In 1976 all juveniles were transferred to other facilities, and the school at Oregon was converted to Oakhill Correctional Institute - a minimum- security prison for men. ==Student restrictions== Girls were eligible to attend the schools if they met the following qualifications: * Girls under 18 years of age, who were beggars, vagrants, ragpickers or wanderers, or were destitute because of orphanage, or abandonment, or having a parent undergoing imprisonment, or otherwise without means of support. * Girls under the above age who were found in circumstances of manifest danger of falling into habits of vice, or who had fallen. * The form of commitment should be considered a civil rather than a criminal process. Parents, guardians, supervisors or grand jurors could present a formal complaint to a judge of probate, or of the criminal or municipal court of any city or county, or to any justice of the peace of the town where the child was found, who thereupon took cognizance of and determined the case. * In addition to the girls sent by legal process, the school received, boarded and taught girls for parents or guardians, on their paying the same sum as was paid by the counties for those committed by the courts. ==Notable people== Mary Blanchard Lynde (1819 -1897), president, was the founder. She was known for her belief that science could solve society's problems. She had founded the local Ladies' Benevolent Society and in the 1860s she founded the Soldiers Aid Society. She was married to William Pitt Lynde who was a politician and she would use the name \\"Mrs Wm. P. Lynde\\". The officers of the corporation were: Mrs. Wm. P. Lynde, President; Miss Mary Mortimer, 1st Vice President; Mrs. E. P. Allis, 2d Vice President; Mrs. Edward Sanderson, 3d Vice President; Mrs. C. D. Adsit, Treasurer; Mrs. H. M. Finch, Secretary. The Executive Committee was composed of Mrs. Joseph E. Follett, Mrs. A. C. May, Mrs. W. G. Benedict. The board of managers consisted entirely of women who volunteered to assist with managing the school. The staff consisted of the matron, a teacher and two assistants. ==Architecture== The form of the main building at Milwaukee was a parallelogram, exclusive of an extension at each end in octagonal form, measuring , and a one-story addition in the rear for laundry and cellar purposes, . It was three stories high above the basement. The building afforded ample accommodation for 200 pupils, plus teachers, resident officers, and assistants. The house was well ventilated, and provision was made for warming it. It was substantially built of Milwaukee brick upon a limestone foundation. The facilities enabled the managers to provide the inmates with an education, full knowledge of housekeeping, and industrial training in order to earn a living. The buildings were designated as the Main Building, Russell Cottage, Lynde Cottage, Cottage Annex, Merrill Model Home, Assembly Hall, Steward's Home, Steam Heating Plant and Barn. The Main Home was for incorrigible girls, and young girls who needed the care and protection of the school. The cottages were entirely separate buildings affording restraint and influence over unchaste girls. The Merrill Model Home was for those girls who attained the Honor Grade. In this department special training was given to prepare for parole or dismissal on majority. ==References== Attribution * * * Category:Defunct girls' schools in the United States Category:Boarding schools in Wisconsin Category:Defunct schools in Wisconsin Category:Schools in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Category:Industrial schools Category:Defunct boarding schools ","title":"Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls"},{"id":"54095859","text":"Rubin Seigers (born 11 January 1998) is a Belgian football player who plays as defender for Beerschot-Wilrijk on loan from Belgian First Division A club K.R.C.

It has 795 beds and 20 departments. It serves as the main clinical base for 15 departments and advanced courses of the Nicolae Testemi»õanu State University of Medicine and Pharmacy. It is named after former Health Minister and the hospital's longest-tenured director Timofei Mo»ôneaga, who led the institution for over forty years. ==History== Initially, the facility had the status of a municipal hospital. It was the first medical institution in Bessarabia and was built with the support of sponsors and citizens of Chisinau. The hospital opened on December 26, 1817. The first building had one and a half levels, housing five wards with 36 beds, where patients with therapeutic, surgical and gynecological problems were treated. The medical staff provided paramedicine services. In 1842, another building was built. It had specialized units of therapy, surgery, ophthalmology and sexually transmissible diseases. In 1860, the staff consisted of one medical doctor (also the manager), a senior medical assistant, 3 junior medical assistants, 27 nurses, a linen mistress, a clerk, a copyist and a priest. A pharmacy operated on hospital premises. In 1870, the institution was transferred to the Gubernskoe Zemstvo (the provincial government) and its name changed to Gubernial Hospital. The facility consisted of 100 beds, with a staff of 13 medical doctors and 40 medical assistants. The need for medical staff, especially medical assistants and midwives, became more and more pressing. In 1872 the School of Medical Assistants and Midwives was founded. The first class of 17 students finished school in 1873 and remained to work at the hospital. In 1876, special units for microscopy, morph-pathology and animal testing opened. In order to stop the spread of infectious diseases, a unit for vaccination against smallpox was formed. Over the years, the Gubernatorial Hospital was considered an important center for the education and continuous training of doctors from the cities and districts of Bessarabia. The two World Wars gravely affected the activity of the Gubernial Hospital. Bombings left its buildings in ruins. It had to be rebuilt and reequipped. Its name became Republican Clinical Hospital. The institution eventually became the clinical base for the Chisinau Institute of Medicine. In 1967, when the hospital was celebrating its 150th anniversary, it had 10 units for stationary treatment, a consulting polyclinic for the inhabitants of rural areas, an AVIASAN (sanitary aviation) department and numerous labs and diagnostic rooms, fitted with modern equipment. Units included anesthesiology, endocrinology, cardiothoracic and maxillofacial surgery. The artificial kidney unit opened there and was among the first in the Soviet Union. Clinical methods included laparoscopy, splenetic portography, phlebography, electro- chemiography and others. Extracorporeal dialysis and cardiac defibrillation were applied, new methods of anesthesia were added and the laboratory of nuclear medicine was created. In 1961, the first successful heart surgery took place. By 1966, 10,000 patients had received medical care. In 1977 the RCH moved to new premises. This facility permitted a significant rise in quality and efficiency and helped to improve and diversify the diagnostic methods and activity of labs and specialized units. Over 200 new diagnostics and treatments were implemented. == Staff == Between 1966‚Äì1996, 50 medical doctors were awarded PhDs in medicine, while 5 earned a M.D. degree. These specialists took part in international congresses, symposia and conferences. During the first period of transition to a free market economy, the hospital faced a difficult situation, which improved with the 2004 implementation of medical insurance. == Operation == The hospital operates on the basis of a contract with the National Company for Medical Insurance (NCMI), which provides regular financing. The contract protects drug supply, provides modern medical equipment, new medical services and treatment methods. Rural inhabitants represent more than 85% of the patients. The Timofei Mo»ôneaga Republican Clinical Hospital has 795 beds and 20 units, cared for by 1300 qualified specialists. It is the clinical base of 15 departments of the Nicolae Testemi»õanu State University of Medicine and Pharmacy and of its training program. == Directors == * Nicolae Testemi»õanu (1955 - 1958) * Iulian Kaspersky (1958 - 1960) * Timofei Mo»ôneaga (1960 - 2003) * Mihai Ou»ô (2003 - 2010) * Andrei Usat√Æi (2010 - 2011) * Anatol Ciubotaru (2015‚Äì2020) * Andrei Uncu»õa (present) == External links == * Official website *Official YouTube channel * Category:Hospitals in Moldova ","title":"Timofei Mo»ôneaga Republican Clinical Hospital"},{"id":"54095879","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; text-align: left; font-size: 90%; vertical-align: middle;\\" + List of awards won by Netflix  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Total number of wins and nominations -   colspan=\\"2\\" width=50 -   colspan=\\"2\\" width=50 - d9e8ff;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-size: smaller; text- align:center;\\" References } Netflix has received multiple Golden Globe Award wins and nominations since 2014. ==Film== Noah Baumbach, 2020 nominee for Marriage Story Alfonso Cuar√≥n, 2019 winner for Roma Martin Scorsese, 2020 nominee for The Irishman Best Director { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:80%;\\" - bfd7ff;\\"  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Best Director - ebf5ff;\\" !

It mixed band and solo performances of both original songs and blues/rock covers, showcasing McIlwaine's dynamic slide guitar work and powerful voice, and it featured several songs which became closely associated with her, including her iconic slide guitar version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\", and the fan favourite \\"The Secret In This Lady's Heart\\", which was reputedly written about her meeting with Jimi Hendrix. McIlwaine's distinctive version of the gospel medley \\"Up In Heaven Shouting/I Am So Glad\\" featured the singer performing the vocal in 'normal' fashion in the first half of the song, followed by a section which sounds as if the tape of the vocal has been reversed, but was in fact achieved by McIlwaine listening to a reversed tape of the song and learning to sing the lyrics 'backwards'. The album also continued McIlwaine's interest in the music of Jack Bruce and featured the Jack Bruce/Pete Brown song \\"He The Richmond\\", originally recorded on Bruce's debut solo album Songs for a Tailor, and the blues standard Born Under A Bad Sign, which Bruce had performed with Cream. ==Track listing== Side One 1\\\\.

Many traits in humans and other species are highly polygenic, i.e., affected by standing genetic variation at hundreds or thousands of loci. Under normal conditions, the genetic variation underlying such traits is governed by stabilizing selection, in which natural selection acts to hold the population close to an optimal phenotype. However, if the phenotypic optimum changes, then the population can adapt by small directional shifts in allele frequencies spread across all the variants that affect the trait. Polygenic adaptation can occur relatively quickly (as described in the breeder's equation), however it is difficult to detect from genomic data because the changes in allele frequencies at individual loci are very small. Polygenic adaptation represents an alternative to adaptation by selective sweeps. In classic selective sweep models, a single new mutation sweeps through a population to fixation, purging variation from a region of linkage around the selected site. More recent models have focused on partial sweeps, and on soft sweeps \\\\- i.e., sweeps that start from standing variation or comprise multiple sweeping variants at the same locus. All of these models focus on adaptation through genetic changes at a single locus and they generally assume large changes in allele frequencies. The concept of polygenic adaptation is related to classical models from quantitative genetics. However, traditional models in quantitative genetics usually abstract away the contributions of individual loci by focusing instead on means and variances of genetic scores. In contrast, population genetics models and data analysis have generally emphasized models of adaptation through sweeps at individual loci. The modern formulation of polygenic adaptation in population genetics was developed in a pair of 2010 review articles. == Examples of polygenic adaptation == Polygenic adaptation is presumed to be the dominant mode of adaptation in artificial selection, when plants or animals undergo rapid responses to selective pressures. However, in most cases the actual genetic loci involved are not yet known (but see e.g.,). At present the best-understood examples of polygenic adaptation are in humans, and particularly for height, a trait that can be interpreted using data from genome-wide association studies. In a 2012 paper, Joel Hirschhorn and colleagues showed that there was a consistent tendency for the \\"tall\\" alleles at genome-wide significant loci to be at higher frequencies in northern Europeans than in southern Europeans. They interpreted this observation to indicate that the difference in average height between northern and southern Europeans is at least partly genetic (as opposed to environmental) and that it was driven by selection. This result has been replicated by subsequent studies, however the environmental factor driving the selection remains unclear. A study of recent polygenic adaptation in the English has shown that selection on height has had small effects on allele frequencies (<1%) across most of the genome, and found evidence for polygenic adaptation in a wide variety of other traits as well including selection for increased infant birth size and increased female hip and waist size. ==References== Category:Population statistics Category:Genetics ","title":"Polygenic adaptation"},{"id":"54096004","text":"The Reddick Hotel-Ophir LDS Meetinghouse in Ophir, Utah, also known as Reddick Boarding House and as Howard's Shop, was built in 1903‚Äì1904.

He was drafted by Richmond in the second round of the 2016 draft and made his debut in round 9 of the 2017 season, as the club's youngest debutant in nine years. In 2018 he won the VFL's Mark and Goal of the Year awards while playing reserves grade football. During his breakout 2019 season, Bolton received a rising Star nomination and was an AFL premiership player. ==Junior football and early life== Bolton was born in Katanning, Western Australia and grew up in the southern Perth suburb of Forrestdale before spending his teenage years in Mandurah. He comes from strong footballing stocks, with father Darren a former Fremantle player and Peel Thunder best & fairest winner and his uncle Allistair Pickett a two-time Sandover Medalist. In 2013 Bolton entered the elite talent pathway when he joined the Flying Boomerangs Indigenous Academy. He began playing underage football with WAFL club South Fremantle the following year. Bolton was sidelined for much of his 2015 season however after suffering stress fractures in his back. In his final season (2016) at the club he averaged 17 disposals and two goals per game, including a seven-goal performance against East Perth. He represented Western Australia at the 2016 AFL Under 18 Championships, kicking five goals in the tournament. Bolton attended high school at Wesley College in Perth, leaving after completing his year 11 studies to focus on football. Prior to the 2016 national draft, Bolton was praised for his \\"blazing speed\\" and \\"natural instinct for the game\\". He impressed recruiters in October's pre-draft All Stars game at Punt Road Oval, recording 16 disposals, seven inside 50s and a goal. He placed second in the running vertical jump test at the national draft combine that year. ==AFL career== 2017 season Bolton was drafted by with the club's first pick and the 29th selection overall in the 2016 national draft. Before the season had even officially began, Bolton was charged with striking Tom Williamson in a VFL practice match against the Northern Blues. He subsequently accepted a one-match ban. Bolton made his AFL debut in round 9, 2017 in a match against at Spotless Stadium and taking the place of the injured Dan Butler in the Richmond forward-line. At 18 years and 163 days, he was the youngest player to debut for Richmond since captain Trent Cotchin in the 2008 season. He was thought to have kicked a match-winning goal in the final two minutes of the match, before an automatic review overturned the umpire's on-field decision and ruled the kick touched off the boot. Bolton played in each of the next two matches before Richmond's bye week in round 12. To that point he ranked fourth in the AFL for forward half pressure. In round 13 Bolton turned in an impressive first half against , racking up 12 disposals and two goals to half time. Though he did not finish strongly, it was nevertheless an \\"impressive\\" performance. His 8 'crumbs' in that match also tied the record for the four-year old stat set by Sydney's Josh Kennedy in 2016. He was rested from the club's AFL side in round 15 however, after backing up that match with a four disposal game against . Bolton returned to senior football in round 19 when he replaced the injured Jack Riewoldt, creating a forward-line without a recognised tall forward. He was dropped after just one match however, returning to the VFL to play out his season with the reserves. His performances at this level were labelled \\"above the level\\" by coach Craig McRae with media pundits suggesting he was close to a call-up to senior level during the AFL finals series. Despite this talk he would remain in the reserves, playing in each of the team's three victories as well as in their losing grand final against Port Melbourne. Champion Data figures released at the end of September showed Bolton as the second quickest player at Richmond and one of the 15 quickest in the AFL, after he set a top speed of 34.8 kilometres per hour in an in-match sprint during the season. Bolton finished the 2017 season having played six matches and kicked three goals at senior level. He also played 14 matches in the reserves and kicked 23 goals, good for the fourth most at the club. 2018 season Bolton kicks during play in round 13, 2017 With premiership small forward Daniel Rioli still recovering from a serious foot injury, Bolton came out of a fitness-building off-season and straight into Richmond's senior forward line. He played in both of the club's official pre-season matches, including a three-goal tally in that series' first match against . On the back of those performances he was selected to play in the round 1 season-opener against . Bolton was relatively ineffectual over the season's first two matches however, recording only three tackles and one goal in total and was subsequently dropped from Richmond's round 3 side. Despite his inability to impact at senior level, Bolton was immediately impressive in his first reserves match of the season, kicking three goals in Richmond's VFL win over Port Melbourne. He remained at the lower level for a further six weeks until suffering a match-ending corked quad in the third quarter of a VFL win over in late May. The club was cautious with Bolton's injury, resting him from match play for one week. Upon his return to VFL football he recorded 17 disposals while being trialed in limited midfield minutes. The following week Bolton kicked two goals against but was most notable for a spectacular mark that saw him earn the VFL's Mark of the Year award at season's end. He would also earn the competition's Goal of the Year when he scored from the forward pocket after repeatedly shrugging tackles during a match against the reserves in early July. The goal, along with 22 disposals and eight tackles recorded in that win saw Bolton earn a second chance at AFL football in 2018. It would last just one match however, with Bolton immediately dropped back to VFL level following a goalless nine disposal performance in the round 17 loss to . In his first two matches back at VFL level he was tried successfully in a half-back role, collecting 24 disposals while also rotating through the midfield in the second match of that short stretch. The experiment would not last long however, with Bolton sustaining a minor knee injury while training with the club in late July. Continued soreness in the joint saw Bolton undergo an arthroscope procedure, including a clean-up of the tissue around his meniscus. Bolton did not return to football in 2018, despite club officials earlier stating that he was likely to return in time for the VFL finals series. He finished the year having played three matches at AFL level and a further 13 with the club's reserves side in the VFL. 2019 season Bolton in the 2019 AFL Grand Final Parade Bolton signed a new one-year contract with Richmond in the month following the end of the 2018 season, re-committing despite having previously put contract negotiations on hold during the season itself. He spent the off-season completing extensive personal fitness training, leading AFL Media and the Herald Sun to label Bolton likely to be one of Richmond's breakout players that season in a new role that would include playing time in the midfield and on the wing. He began the year playing that role in VFL practice matches in March, including a key role with two goals in the club's final pre-season match against . Bolton's clearance work was fantastic as an inside midfielder in the VFL in early April, earning him a call up to his first AFL match of the year in round 4's match against . He played as a forward in that and one further match at AFL level, before being dropped back to the VFL. It was to be a short stint however, with Bolton turning in a best on ground performance with 25 disposals, 11 tackles and a goal that saw him returned to AFL level in round 7. While he recorded a then career-best 17 disposals in that match, Bolton saved his breakout performance for the following week, where he kicked four goals and was among Richmond's best players in a five-goal win over . For that performance he was also named in AFL Media's Team of the Week. Bolton kicked just one goal and averaged less than 11 disposals in the three weeks that followed, resulting in him being dropped to VFL level in the first week of June. He was immediately prolific at that level, playing as an inside midfielder and turning in two consecutive best afield performances in which he held averages of eight tackles, 30 disposals, nine clearances and a goal. Bolton was recalled to AFL level following those two matches and the club's mid-season bye, kicking one goal in a round 15 win over . In round 16 he seized an opportunity to play as an inside midfielder for the first time at AFL level, recording 26 disposal, nine marks and two goals as one of his side's best players in a 92-point demolition of . At the point he ranked number one among the league's Rising Star eligible players for score involvements per game. Bolton kicked a goal and set a new career-best with 29 disposals while repeating his role as an inside midfielder in round 17's win over . That effort earned him five Coaches award votes (equal 3rd best on ground), selection to AFL Media's Team of the Week and a nomination for the league's Rising Star award. He played one more game with significant midfield minutes, before being named by AFL Media as one of the club's best players in round 19's win over while playing his early-season role as a forward. Bolton played largely as a forward with limited midfield time for the final month of the season before making the 40-man squad but ultimately being passed over for final selection in the league's 22Under22 team which recognises the best young players in the league. In the opening match of the club's finals campaign Bolton kicked one goal, had three goal assists and took a spectacular mark on top of Lions midfielder Lachie Neale in what would prove a 47-point qualifying final victory over the at The Gabba. In the week that followed, Bolton signed a new two-year contract extension with Richmond, reportedly rejecting outside interest from home town side . Bolton followed his first finals effort with a considerably smaller output in the club's preliminary final victory over , kicking just a single behind and failing to lay a tackle in that match. In the grand final, Bolton helped his side to an AFL premiership by recording 11 disposals, kicking one goal and applying immense forward-half pressure in what AFL Media labelled a \\"solid\\" game. Bolton led the club for total goal assists (five) during the finals series while placing second at the club and equal 12th among all players in the competition by the same measure across the entirety of 2019. He finished what The Age and the Australian Associated Press labelled a \\"breakout\\" season by winning an AFL premiership, receiving five Brownlow Medal votes (fifth most among Richmond players) and placing 18th in the club's best and fairest count. 2020 season Bolton received Richmond life membership in 2019/20 off-season for his contribution to the club's 2019 premiership win, but also underwent minor shoulder surgery that saw him on a non-contact pre-season training program through mid-February 2020. He resumed his place in the club's best 22 in two pre-season matches against and in March before kicking an equal team-high three goals in a round 1 win over . He also recorded 13 disposals in that match, which was played without a crowd in attendance due to public health prohibitions on large gatherings imposed as a result of the rapid progression of the coronavirus pandemic into Australia. It was the first match of a reduced 17-round season, which was also played with quarter lengths reduced by one fifth in order to reduce the physical load on players who would be expected to play multiple matches with short breaks in the second half of the year. Just three days later, the AFL Commission suspended the season for an indefinite period after multiple states enforced quarantine conditions on their borders that effectively ruled out the possibility of continuing the season as planned. Bolton contributed one goal when the season resumed in June after an 11-week hiatus, before adding a further three goals across rounds 3 and 4 to lead all Richmond players with seven goals so far that season. With the news that the club would soon be relocated to the Gold Coast in response to a virus outbreak in Melbourne, and with the knowledge that senior midfielder Shane Edwards would not travel with his teammates, the club opted to send Bolton to the reserves level during the weekend of round 5 to play as an inside midfielder in preparation to play the role at senior level. Bolton was prolific in that unofficial scratch match against 's reserves, earning a recall as an AFL midfielder in the following week's match against on Richmond's new home of the Gold Coast. The Herald Sun labelled Bolton one of his side's best with 14 disposals and a goal in that game, and one week later he received six Coaches Association Award votes for an equal-second-best on ground performance that included 19 disposals and five clearances. Bolton continued to be among his side's best players over the next month, adding hauls of four, two and eight coaches votes for midfield contributions in rounds 8, 9 and 10 respectively. After round 11, Bolton ranked first among all players in the league that season for total inside-50s (48) and first at Richmond for centre clearances (18) and score involvements (58). In round 13, Bolton was best on ground in Richmond's Dreamtime in Darwin win over while the team wore an Indigenous artwork guernsey he had designed with the help of his family. He received the Yiooken Award for a performance, which included a then-equal career-high 29 disposals, along with five clearances and a goal. ==Player profile== Bolton plays as an inside midfielder and rests as a small forward, after playing most of his first three seasons at AFL level exclusively as a small forward. He is notable for his explosive athletic attributes and creativity in contested ball situations. ==Statistics== :Statistics are correct to the end of round 15, 2020 - - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\"   2017 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  29  6  3  4  26  25  51  12  15  0.5  0.7  4.3  4.2  8.5  2.0  2.5 -  scope=\\"row\\"   2018 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  29  3  1  1  11  14  25  6  4  0.3  0.3  3.7  4.7  8.3  2.0  1.3 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2019 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  29  19  15  12  143  123  266  58  65  0.8  0.6  7.5  6.5  14.0  3.1  3.4 -  scope=\\"row\\"   2020 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  29  14  12  6  135  89  224  43  38  0.9  0.4  9.6  6.4  16.0  3.1  2.7 - - scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA; font-weight:bold; text-align: center; width:2em\\" class=\\"sortbottom\\"  colspan=3 Career  42  31  23  315  251  566  119  122  0.7  0.5  7.5  6.0  13.5  2.8  2.9 } Notes ==Honours and achievements== Team * AFL premiership player (): 2019 * McClelland Trophy (): 2018 Individual * AFL Rising Star nominee: 2019 VFL * Goal of the Year: 2018 * Mark of the Year: 2018 ==Personal life== Bolton is an Indigenous Australian of the Noongar people.

Camp Siegfried was one of many such camps in the US in the 1930s, including Camp Hindenberg in Grafton, Wisconsin, Camp Nordland in Andover, New Jersey, Deutschhorst Country Club in Sellersville, Pennsylvania, and a camp in Windham, New York. ==Description and history== Camp Siegfried had a pool, archery competitions, hikes through the woods, a Youth Camp on the other side of Upper Lake, oom-pah bands and Oktoberfest celebrations; women in German peasant outfits greeted visitors at the gate. Weekend-morning Long Island Railroad trains called \\"Camp Siegfried Specials\\" ran from Penn Station in New York City to Yaphank for the convenience of the camp's guests, many of whom came out from the German-American Manhattan neighborhood of Yorkville to spend time at what appeared to be a family- oriented summer retreat.Wesselhoeft, Conrad (March 25, 1984) \\"Where L.I.

In 1680, he was hired as a parish priest in Kalundborg. In 1686, he was called to be the dean in Christiania. In 1694, he was appointed to be the Bishop of the Diocese of Christianssand. He accepted the position, but he also received a royal promise that when the bishop's seat in Christiania became vacant, he would get to transfer there. In 1699, that seat became vacant upon the death of Hans Rosing, and Munch was transferred there to serve as the Bishop of the Diocese of Christiania. He was present for the coronation of the new King Frederik IV in 1700. The same year, he received his doctor of theology degree. During his time as a bishop, he maintained his duties, but did not excel. In 1704, the King came to Christiania and he gave a sermon for the King, but it was characterized as a sermon of a country citizen, but not of a bishop. The only time he showed real zeal as a bishop was one time when he expelled a Quaker priest from London who had been traveling through the diocese preaching.

However, these dreams were crushed following his being stricken with osteomyelitis (OM), an infection of the bones, at age 11. It was necessary for him to be in a full-body cast for a year, and he was told that he would never be able to play competitive sports again. Out of boredom he picked up a guitar and began to learn, and then the piano, giving him a new set of musical aspirations. Batdorf's musical career began in 1967 after moving to Los Angeles. He joined with Mark Rodney in 1971 to form the duo Batdorf & Rodney. Their biggest hit was \\"Somewhere in the Night\\" (U.S. #69, 1975). Following their breakup in 1975, he formed the group Silver, with whom he had his biggest hit, \\"Wham Bam\\" (U.S. #16, 1976).Billboard Charts Archive, Hot 100 - 1976 He sings lead on the song, which was their only hit. \\"Wham Bam\\" was revived by appearing in 2017‚Äôs blockbuster movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and had nearly 8 million plays on YouTube. Batdorf has also enjoyed success as a film and TV composer with credits from Touched by an Angel, Promised Land, Book Of Days and The Best Two Years, session vocalist on several hit records and commercials, and songwriter for Kim Carnes, England Dan and America.Airplay Direct: John Batdorf-Next Stop, Willoughby In 1997 he formed Batdorf & McLean with Michael McLean, with whom he had collaborated earlier as arranger and vocalist, and they released an album, Don't You Know.

It is only found on Banks Peninsula in New Zealand. ==Description== Veronica strictissima is a randomly branching shrub, small to medium in size, growing to a height of 2 metres. Its name in Latin, strictus, means erect and this refers to the plants erect branches. Its branchlets are often glabrous or have tiny oppositely arranged hairs. These branchlets can be slightly red. The leaves are narrow and oblong 2‚Äì4.5 cm x 6-8mm, they are light green in colour, glabrous, with an entire margin and the lamina ending as a tip. The leaf margin can sometimes have minute hairs lining it. The leaves are simple and arranged oppositely with pairs alternating at 90 degrees along the branch (decussate). The leaf bud has no gap at the base. The flowers are white, in a raceme spike up to 11 cm long. The flowers can be hermaphrodite or female. The pedicels are 1-4mm in length and are covered in minute hairs. The calyx is 1.5 ‚Äì 2 mm long oval in shape and blunt. The corolla tube is hairy inside. Hermaphrodite corolla have dimensions of 1.4‚Äì2.4 x 1.3‚Äì1.7mm they are slightly longer than the calyx the female corolla tube is 1.3‚Äì1.8mm making it equal to or slightly longer than the calyx. The corolla lobes can vary greatly and can be circular, elliptic, oblong obtuse, suberect or recurved. V. strictissima is a gynodioecious plant meaning that some plants are hermaphroditic and other plants are female plants. The reproductive structures are stamen and the style. The stamen is 3-5mm the anthers are purple in colour, sterile anthers are light brown in colour they 1.2‚Äì1.8mm. The style is 2.3-6mm. The capsules containing multiple tiny seeds. Its branches are obtuse are 2.9‚Äì4 x 2.2‚Äì2.6mm they can be hairy with three calyx lobes. Seeds are flat and brown; they are 1‚Äì1.6 x 0.9‚Äì1.3mm.  Natural global range  Veronica strictissima is native to New Zealand and endemic to the Banks Peninsula, Canterbury. It is not naturally found in other places unless it has been planted intentionally.  New Zealand range  Veronica strictissima is native and endemic to the Port Hills and Akaroa regions of Banks Peninsula. And all natural findings of this species have been in these areas with multiple separate populations.  Habitat preferences  The genus Veronica are fast growing and thrive in sunny open areas, such as scrubland, steep banks and bluffs. V. strictissima, is found only on Banks Peninsula, which has different climatic conditions to the rest of Canterbury area. V. strictissima has been found to grow at an altitude of around 500m but go from the coast up to at least 800m. It is not very tolerant of shade. But is found to be a ruderal species as they respond well to disturbances. ==Life cycle/phenology== Flower initiation occurs after a period of spring growth. V. strictissima begins its summer flowering during the months December through to March and sometimes to June with some plants. Individual plants will flower for 2‚Äì5 weeks. The flowers on the spike of one plant will normally flower at the same time. Capsules will form during the months March through to April and will dehisce seeds in autumn. These seeds are wind dispersed. The seeds can also be dispersed by birds and lizards. The flowers are pollinated by a single native bee Lasioglossum sordidum. ==Diet and foraging== Soil composition of Banks Peninsula is different to Lower Canterbury. It is made up of loess and basalt rock, while Lower Canterbury is predominantly alluvial. V. strictissima is found to prefer soil with moderate levels of moisture with low salinity and good soil drainage. ==Predators, parasites, and diseases== Veronica strictissima is eaten by grazing species such as sheep, goats and cows. The fruit are eaten by lizards and birds. Lizards and birds also feed on the nectar. The flowers are pollinated by a native bee, L. sordidum which feeds off the nectar and takes pollen with it. V. strictissima and other species from the genus Veronica are also fed on by hebe plume moth Platyptilia and large hebe loopers Xyridacma veronicae. Hebe gall midges, hebe leaf miner flies and hebe gall mites also live off V. strictissima. ==Cultural and medicinal uses== It was used culturally for medicinal purposes as a cure for dysentery. It worked effectively and was used in the second world war. For Maori it was traditionally used for a number of things including a decoction for ulcers, headaches, kidney and bladder troubles. ==Other information== Veronica strictissima can be confused with other hebe species and was once included with Hebe leiophylla as well as Veronica parviflora. It is very similar to Hebe traversii, which is far more widespread, being found in Canterbury, Marlborough and Nelson. There are suggestions that it is able to hybridise with Hebe salicifolia and a possible specimen is found in Wellington Herbarium. Veronica strictissima provides ecological services by controlling erosion. == References == strictissima Category:Banks Peninsula Category:Flora of New Zealand Category:Endemic flora of New Zealand ","title":"Veronica strictissima"},{"id":"54096551","text":"Speck Alto Adige PGI ‚Äì South Tyrolean speck Jam√≥n serrano on a jamonera This is a list of notable hams and ham products.

He spent some of his youth in Kentucky, attending prestigious boarding schools. James was twelve years old when his father died on the family plantation in Frankfort, Kentucky, and James and his mother Adelaide moved into the mansion in Washington D.C. that had been left to them by Isham. The death of his father at such a young age may have influenced the direction of his entire life and may have been the reason that he left home at such a young age. == Military career == When James turned eighteen, he joined John C. Fr√©mont's expedition into the Oregon Territory, despite pressure from his family to stay in Washington. James served as a member of the Corps of Topographical Engineers along with 38 others during the expedition, and contributed to the detailed and reliable maps created as a result.

While the two teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the league in 1970, their rivalry began to develop in the 2014‚Äì15 season, when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals, from 2015 to 2018. Prior to the streak beginning, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. Of these four series, the Warriors won three championships (2015, 2017, and 2018) and the Cavaliers, one (2016). The rivalry is considered to have ended in 2018, following LeBron James' departure from the Cavaliers to the Los Angeles Lakers. ==Pre-2014 history== The Warriors dominated the early series, going 37‚Äì22 () from 1970 to 1991. The Cavaliers would win 10 straight games from 1992 to 1996 to reduce Golden State's lead to 37‚Äì32 (). The two teams played each other close during LeBron James' first stint with the Cavaliers in the 2000s. From 2010 to 2014, James left the Cavaliers to play for the Miami Heat while the Warriors were a lottery team. The Warriors led the head-to-head series 53‚Äì50 () through the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. James returned to the Cavaliers during the 2014 off-season. The Cavaliers then acquired All-Star power forward Kevin Love for Andrew Wiggins and other assets. The Cavaliers quickly became the favorite to win the East, as they already had an All-Star point guard in Kyrie Irving and other rising stars such as Tristan Thompson. In the Western Conference, the Warriors were a team led by their backcourt of the \\"Splash Brothers\\", Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and a developed fast-paced, up-tempo offense, consisting mainly of three point shooting. ==2014‚Äì15 season== With LeBron James returning to the Cavaliers as a free agent in 2014, the team was favored to make it to the NBA Finals. The team started off the season poorly, with Love struggling in his new role and SG Dion Waiters unable to handle being relegated to a secondary role. The Cavaliers started off the season with a dismal record of 19‚Äì20. James missed two weeks in January with a back injury. Later that month, the Cavaliers traded away Waiters to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team deal with the New York Knicks. They acquired three-point specialist J. R. Smith and defensive asset Iman Shumpert. The team also acquired center and rim protector Timofey Mozgov in a separate trade. These players were critical for the team's return to the top of the Eastern Conference. Stephen Curry (pictured) of the Warriors won his first Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. The Warriors started off the season 21‚Äì2, with a 16-game winning streak, which made them the early title favorites. Stephen Curry immediately became a Most Valuable Player candidate. Curry was improving off of last year's All-Star season. Klay Thompson became one of the best shooting guards, three-point shooters, and two-way players in the league. Draymond Green averaged about 12 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. Rookie head coach Steve Kerr was a candidate for Coach of the Year. The two teams split their head-to-head meetings that season, each winning on its home court. Irving, James, Curry, and Thompson were all named to their respective NBA All Star teams, with Curry finishing first in the All-Star voting (1,513,324), and LeBron James finishing in second (1,470,483). Curry won the NBA MVP Award, averaging 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, and 2.0 steals per game, and shot 44.3% from three-point territory. James was third in MVP voting. He averaged 25.3 PPG, 6.0 RPG, and 7.4 APG. They were featured on the All-NBA First Team. Irving and Thompson made the All-NBA team as well. The Cavaliers finished the season with a record of 53‚Äì29, and the Warriors finished the season with a record of 67‚Äì15. 2015 NBA Finals The Warriors and the Cavaliers only lost five games combined in the first three rounds of the playoffs. For the first time in NBA Finals history, both teams were coached by rookie head coaches with Steve Kerr and David Blatt. The Cavaliers faced injury trouble, losing Love in the first round to a separated shoulder. Irving left Game 1 of the Finals in overtime after fracturing his left kneecap. The Warriors won Game 1 in a 108‚Äì100 overtime thriller. Game 2 also went into overtime, the all-around efforts of LeBron James and Matthew Dellavedova‚Äôs surprisingly stellar defense on Steph Curry took the game 95‚Äì93. James had carried the limping Cavaliers to a Game 3 win and a 2‚Äì1 lead over the Warriors. The Warriors would win the next three games to take home the 2015 NBA Championship. Andre Iguodala would win the NBA Finals MVP, although James averaged 35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, and 8.8 APG in a losing effort. ==2015‚Äì16 season== The 2015‚Äì16 Cleveland Cavaliers season saw the firing of head coach David Blatt (left), who would be replaced by assistant coach Tyronn Lue (right). The Warriors opened the 2015‚Äì16 season going 24‚Äì0, the most wins without a loss to start a season in NBA history and the second-longest winning streak in NBA history (28). By the All-Star break, the Warriors' record was a stellar 48‚Äì4, including a pair of regular season victories against Cleveland. This was the best record at an all-star break in league history. Curry, Thompson, and Draymond Green earned all-star selections. Golden State went on to break the 1995‚Äì96 Chicago Bulls 72‚Äì10 season record by winning 73 games. Stephen Curry became the first unanimous MVP in the history of the NBA that year. Despite their regular season dominance, the Warriors struggled in the Western Conference playoffs. After defeating the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers without Curry for several games due to injuries, the Warriors were pushed to seven games by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder jumped to a 3‚Äì1 lead but the Warriors were able to battle their way back and win the series. The Cavaliers faced some challenges in the 2015‚Äì16 campaign. Irving was recovering from a knee injury sustained in Game 1 of the previous season's Finals and would miss most of the first half of the season. Despite some hardship, Cleveland performed well throughout the first half of the season. Halfway through the campaign, with a record of 30‚Äì11, head coach David Blatt was replaced by Tyronn Lue. The team finished the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Conference and defeated the Toronto Raptors in 6 games to advance to the Finals against the defending champion Warriors. Finals for the ages Inside Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland before the start of Game 4 of the 2016 NBA Finals. The 2016 NBA Finals saw the Cavaliers and Warriors meet for the second straight season. The Warriors won Games 1 and 2 in Oakland before the series moved to Cleveland. While Cleveland won Game 3 at home in convincing fashion, the Warriors took Game 4 to set up a potential series-clincher at home. During the game, Draymond Green committed a flagrant foul on LeBron James. After reviewing the incident post-game, the league determined that the altercation warranted a flagrant 1 foul, which put Green over the NBA's flagrant foul limit and meant he would be suspended for Game 5. Kyrie Irving and LeBron James both scored 41 points in Game 5 to stay alive on the road, becoming the first pair of teammates to score at least 40 points in a Finals game. Back in Cleveland, LeBron James continued his explosive scoring, tallying another 41-point game in a Game 6 rout of the Warriors that saw a dominating 31‚Äì9 opening sequence and a late-game ejection of Stephen Curry. James became the first player since Shaquille O'Neal to score over 40 points in back-to-back NBA Finals games. LeBron James (right) posts up Klay Thompson (left) at the 2016 NBA Finals. With the series shifting back to Oracle Arena for the championship decider, the Warriors and the Cavaliers were neck-and-neck for most of Game 7. Late in the 4th quarter, with the score tied 89‚Äì89, LeBron James made a memorable chasedown block on Andre Iguodala to save a go-ahead basket. Soon after, Kyrie Irving hit a 3-pointer to give Cleveland the lead, and they held on to win the game 93‚Äì89. This was Cleveland's first franchise title and made them first team in NBA Finals history to come back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit. LeBron James became only the third player in NBA history to have a triple double in a Finals Game 7 and was unanimously voted Finals MVP after leading in all five categories of points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. ==2016‚Äì2018: Arrival of Kevin Durant== The Warriors continued their dominance with the signing of Kevin Durant (pictured) for the 2016‚Äì17 season. On July 4, 2016, Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors in free agency. He averaged 25.1 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.1 SPG, and 1.6 BPG. After finishing 67‚Äì15, the first team in NBA history to win at least 67 games in three straight seasons, the Warriors went 12‚Äì0 in the Western Conference playoffs. They became the third team in league history to sweep all three rounds after the Los Angeles Lakers (1988‚Äì89 and 2000‚Äì01), doing it against the Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz, and San Antonio Spurs, and the first to do so going 12‚Äì0 (the previous teams went 11‚Äì0 when the first round was best-of-five). In the Eastern Conference, the Cavaliers willfully made it to the Finals, going 12‚Äì1, cruising past the Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors in convincing series sweeps. In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics in five games. James was considered to be playing his best basketball of his career, entering the Finals averaging 32.5 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 7.0 APG, 2.2 SPG, and 1.4 BPG. He shot 57% from the field and 42% from three. James averaged a triple double in the Finals. Kevin Love also played his best basketball as a Cavalier, averaging 17.2 PPG 10.4 RPG, 1.9 APG, shooting 46% from the field, and 44% from behind the arc. Kyrie Irving set a career playoff-high 42 points during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. The Warriors and Cavaliers had a combined 24‚Äì1 record entering the Finals, the fewest combined losses entering the Finals ever. The series faced high anticipation as the Warriors, now dubbed as a \\"super-team,\\" looked for revenge on their East coast foe from the previous year's loss. The Warriors easily took Games 1 and 2 at home, defeating the Cavaliers 113‚Äì91, and 132‚Äì113. Game 3 looked to be in the Cavs‚Äô favor, until an 11‚Äì0 run by the Warriors in the closing minutes emerged, capped off by a dagger three from Kevin Durant to seal a 118‚Äì113 comeback victory. Down 3‚Äì0, James and Irving led the Cavaliers over the Warriors to a 137‚Äì116 win, including a record-breaking 49 points in the first quarter and a Finals-high 86 points in the first half. Durant and the Warriors looked to finish the series back home in Game 5. Despite early domination from James and Cleveland in Game 5, the Warriors surged ahead in the second half, fending off several late-game Cavaliers rallies, and won the title with a 129‚Äì120 victory. It was the team's second title in three years, and Durant's first championship and Finals MVP. In 2017‚Äì18, Golden State won the two regular-season meetings against the Cavaliers but struggled down the stretch with multiple All-Star injuries. However, fueled by the return of Stephen Curry during the playoffs, the Warriors dominated the first and second rounds of the playoffs and advanced to their fourth consecutive Finals by overcoming a 3‚Äì2 deficit against the Houston Rockets. Cleveland also struggled during the second half of the season after overhauling their roster at the trade deadline with new, younger players. However, they still managed to beat the Indiana Pacers in seven games, sweep the Raptors, then overcome their own 3‚Äì2 deficit against the Boston Celtics to advance to the Finals. It was the first time that the same two teams in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues have met for a championship round four consecutive times. Game 1 was close with several lead changes. James would score 51 points. However, the game went to overtime, in part due to a controversial reversed charging foul call against Durant, a missed go-ahead free throw by George Hill with 4.7 seconds left, and JR Smith subsequently rebounding and dribbling out the clock, mistakenly believing his team to be ahead. The Warriors would dominate overtime, winning the game 124‚Äì114. Several minor scuffles ensued in the closing seconds of overtime, culminating in Tristan Thompson getting ejected and later fined for shoving a basketball into the face of Draymond Green. After the game, Lebron James reportedly suffered a self-inflicted bone contusion onto his right hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room. He played through the injury for the rest of the series, and it was not disclosed until after Game 4. Game 2 was a more one-sided affair, with the Warriors winning 122‚Äì103. Curry would break his own NBA Finals record with nine 3-pointers in a Finals game. Game 3 was also close, as the teams exchanged leads several times. Curry struggled from the field, shooting only 3‚Äì16 (1‚Äì10 on 3's), while James set a record with his 10th Finals triple- double. However, Durant would lead the Warriors to a 110‚Äì102 victory, scoring a playoff career-high 43 points. Game 4 was a blowout victory for the Warriors, 108‚Äì85, led by Curry's seven 3-pointers and Durant's first career playoff triple-double. Golden State thus completed the sweep, earning their sixth championship and their third in four seasons. ==Aftermath of the rivalry== The rivalry is considered to have ended after LeBron James left the Cavaliers and signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. The Cavaliers entered a rebuild centered around Cedi Osman and 2018 first round draft pick Collin Sexton, while retaining Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love to serve as veteran leaders. The Cavaliers struggled in their next two seasons, finishing 19‚Äì63 in 2018‚Äì19 and 19‚Äì46 in the 2019‚Äì20 season prior to its suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cavaliers were not among the 22 teams invited to complete the season. The team fired Lue six games into the 2018‚Äì19 season. They hired former University of Michigan head coach John Beilien before the 2019‚Äì20 season, though he resigned midway through that season. Assistant coach J.B. Bickerstaff was named interim head coach and eventually full-time head coach for the 2020‚Äì21 season. The Warriors returned to their fifth straight Finals in 2019, in which they lost to the Toronto Raptors, 4‚Äì2. Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala left the Warriors for the Brooklyn Nets and Memphis Grizzlies (Iguodala was later sent to the Miami Heat), respectively, in the 2019 offseason. These losses, combined with injuries to Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry, led the Warriors to finish an NBA-worst 15‚Äì50 in the shortened 2019‚Äì20 season and not be invited to finish the season. The teams have played three games since James' departure, with the Warriors holding a perfect 3‚Äì0 record. ==Players of note== Since the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have been viewed as the faces of the Cavaliers and Warriors, respectively. Coincidentally, they were born in the same hospital in Akron, Ohio. On the Cavaliers, Kevin Love, J. R. Smith, and Tristan Thompson are the only other players to have appeared in all four NBA Finals matchups. Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Shaun Livingston are likewise the only other Warriors to have made all four NBA Finals matchups with the team. Anderson Varej√£o has the distinction of having played for both the Cavaliers and the Warriors, sitting courtside due to injury in the 2015 NBA Finals with Cleveland and playing in the 2016 NBA Finals with Golden State. == Results (2014‚Äì18) See also== * List of National Basketball Association rivalries * Death Lineup ==References== Category:National Basketball Association rivalries Category:Cleveland Cavaliers Category:Golden State Warriors ","title":"Cavaliers‚ÄìWarriors rivalry"},{"id":"54096631","text":"NGC 458 is an open cluster located in the constellation Tucana.

Due to the timing of the early caution, NASCAR decided to move the scheduled competition caution back five laps from it would've originally flown on lap 20. Back to green on lap 11, this run was a short 14-lap burst that concluded with the competition caution on lap 25. Four laps after the lap 30 restart, Martin Truex Jr. passed Larson going into Turn 3 to take the lead and drove on to win the stage on lap 60. Caution flew moments later for the conclusion of the stage. Larson returned to the lead under the caution when he exited pit road first. During this run, Erik Jones was running in the top-10 when he made an unscheduled stop for a loose wheel on lap 41. Second stage After going back to green on lap 68, the race settled into a green flag run that lasted the entire length of the stage that was only broken up by green flag stops starting on lap 107. Larson pitted from the lead the following lap, followed by Kyle Busch three laps later, giving the lead to Brad Keselowski. He pitted on lap 113 and the lead cycled back to Larson. As was the case in the first stage, Truex passed Larson exiting Turn 4 to retake the lead on lap 116, drove on to win the second stage on lap 120 and caution flew for the end of the stage. Unlike the first stage, Truex beat Larson off pit road to maintain the lead. Final stage Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott battle for the lead in the later stages of the race The race settled into another green flag run after the restart on lap 128, which was disrupted by Ryan Sieg spinning out, in front of race leader Truex, in Turn 4 with 50 laps to go, bringing out the fifth caution. Busch exited pit road with the race lead. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. restarted from the tail-end of the field for speeding on pit road. Back to green with 46 to go, everyone was on the razor's edge of making it to the end on fuel (with a fuel run at Michigan falling roughly between 40-45 laps). That dilemma went out the window, however, when debris in Turn 2 brought out the sixth caution with 21 to go. Tony Stewart, co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing, tweeted after the race it was \\"a shame that so many drivers and teams day was ruined by the results of another 'debris' caution towards the end of the race today.\\" Busch failed to fend off Larson on the restart with 15 to go and lost the lead to him going into Turn 1. Caution flew the following lap when Clint Bowyer tagged the wall in Turn 2. After the race, Bowyer said he was \\"sitting there seventh with 20 laps to go reeling them in thinking this was our day, and then a debris caution forces a restart (referencing the proceeding debris caution).\\" He added that restarts are realistically \\"the only times you can pass, so everyone was racing hard, and I got into the wall. It killed our day.‚Äù On the following restart with 10 to go, a domino-effect stack-up rounding Turns 1 and 2 resulted in Danica Patrick being hit exiting Turn 2, sliding down the apron and slamming the inside wall on the backstretch, therefore bringing out the eighth and final caution. Restarting with five to go, Denny Hamlin, who restarted aside Larson, lost the spot to Chase Elliott and third to Joey Logano. Larson held off Elliott in the closing laps to score the victory.

He identified the chemical structure of heparin and developed its clinical applications. Jorpes was the professor of medical chemistry in the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm in 1946‚Äì1963. == Early life == Erik Jorpes was born as Johan Erik Johansson to a poor fisherman's family in the village of √ñverboda in K√∂kar, √Öland Islands. The family lived in a house called Jorpes, which he later adopted as his last name to replace the patronyme Johansson. After the primary school, his parents send the talented kid to high school in Turku. Other students of the Swedish- language Svenska klassiska lyceum came mostly from wealthy upper-class families, Jorpes was bullied of his social status and dialect. As a result, Jorpes got interested in socialist ideas in the early 1910s. He joined the local Social Democratic student organization and wrote marxist articles to the newspaper Arbetaren. Jorpes graduated in 1914 and entered the University of Helsinki to become a doctor, although his parents wished him a priest. Jorpes finished his medical studies in 30 January 1918, just a few days after the outbreak of the Finnish Civil War. Jorpes did not support the idea of an armed revolution, but joined the Red Guards medical staff as he saw it was his duty to help the wounded. After the Battle of Tampere on 6 April, tens of thousands of Red refugees fled from the western parts of Red Finland. Jorpes and his patients were evacuated from Turku to the eastern Finnish town of Vyborg. They were soon transported to Soviet Russia, and finally Jorpes ended up working as a doctor in the Buy refugee camp, set for the Finnish Reds in the Kostroma Governorate. In August 1918, Jorpes attended the founding congress of the exile Communist Party of Finland in Moscow. As the Buy camp was disbanded in early 1919, Jorpes was offered a job in Saint Petersburg but he wanted to leave Russia and emigrate Sweden as a political refugee because the former Reds were prisoned in Finland. In the fall of 1919, Jorpes sneaked across the border to Finland and took a train to Turku. Jorpes was then shipped to his parents home in K√∂kar by local fishermen who soon smuggled him to Vaxholm in Sweden. The police visited the family a day after Jorpes had left. == Life in Sweden == Jorpes arrived Stockholm in October 1919. He had no money, but managed to find a place to live and with the help of the prominent Social Democrat politician Hjalmar Branting, Jorpes was able to continue his medical studies in the Karolinska Institute. after promising to quit the politics. In 1923, Jorpes was granted the Swedish citizenship. Three years later he was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Pharmacology, and in 1946 Jorpes was named the professor of medical chemistry. Jorpes retired in 1963 and continued as a professor emeritus until his death in 1973. In 1949‚Äì1951, Jorpes and his predecessor, the professor Einar Hammarsten had a major influence on the architectural design of the building of chemistry of the Karolinska Institute Campus in Solna. The drawings were originally made in 1937 by the architect Tore Rydberg but the construction was postponed due to the World War II. His first research involved pancreatic nucleic acids. Jorpes completed his German dissertation √úber Pentosennucleins√§uren im Tierorganismus unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Pancreasnucleins√§uren in 1928. After earning his doctorate, Jorpes received a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation and spent the academic year 1928‚Äì1929 in the Rockefeller University in New York City. He also visited the University of Toronto, where Jorpes studied the preparation of insulin in the Connaught Laboratories under the guidance of the Nobel-winning biochemists Frederick Banting and John Macleod. After returning Sweden, Jorpes launched the production of insulin in the laboratory of the pharmaceutical company Vitrum AB. The royalties soon made him a multimillionaire, but Jorpes gave most of his income to academic research or charity. In the early 1930s, Jorpes started his pioneering work on the isolation and structure of heparin. In 1936, he successfully purified heparin and subsequently demonstrated that it was localized in the mast cells of tissues. In the same year, Jorpes and the surgeon Clarence Crafoord used heparin to prevent postoperative thrombosis. Crafoord later confirmed the usefulness of heparin in treating thrombosis. Jorpes' classic study on the use of heparin in the treatment of thrombosis was published in 1946. Since the 1940s, Jorpes participated in studies on fibrinogen, factor VIII, plasminogen, prothrombin and thrombin. He also worked on von Willebrand disease with Erik Adolf von Willebrand. In 1961, Jorpes and the docent Viktor Mutt isolated the hormone secretin. Jorpes was known as a strong personality. There was often tensions between Jorpes and his students and colleagues. He was also a workaholic who enjoyed his time in the laboratory. In 1952, Jorpes was a nominee for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with K.P.Link. In 1945, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1968, Jorpes received the honorary doctorate of √Öbo Akademi in Turku, Finland. During his late years, Jorpes translated Russian literature to Swedish, wrote biographies of Nobel-awarded scientists, and published popular science articles in the Social Democratic newspaper Arbetarbladet. == Personal life == Erik Jorpes was married with Ida Elvira St√•hl (b. 1896) in 1930. == References  Literature == * Category:1894 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from K√∂kar Category:Swedish-speaking Finns Category:Swedish biochemists Category:Swedish physical chemists Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Category:Karolinska Institute alumni Category:Karolinska Institute faculty Category:Finnish expatriates in Sweden Category:Finnish military doctors Category:University of Helsinki alumni Category:People of the Finnish Civil War (Red side) Category:Finnish socialists Category:Finnish communists Category:Finnish refugees Category:Refugees in Sweden Category:20th-century Finnish physicians ","title":"Erik Jorpes"},{"id":"54096830","text":"John Hyrum Koyle (1864-1949) was a bishop in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) best known for his role in creating the Dream Mine in Salem, Utah. He claimed a series of prophetic dreams, including that the Dream Mine would produce precious metals to support the church during anticipated catastrophe before the Second Coming of Jesus, and was excommunicated from the church in 1948. ==Biography== Koyle was born in Spanish Fork, Utah, on August 14, 1864, to John Hyrum Koyle Sr. and Adlinda Hillman. In 1868, Brigham Young called the Koyle family to serve in the \\"Muddy Mission\\" near the Muddy River in Nevada. The family returned to Spanish Fork in 1871. Koyle and his father were quarrying stones in a canyon when the boy was 9, when a sudden rockslide occurred and he witnessed the death of his father. At the age of 14, Koyle worked as a muleskinner and teamster, selling goods to farmers in Utah County. On December 9, 1884, Koyle married Emily Arvilla Holt and bought a farm in Leland, Utah. In 1886, Koyle heard a sermon on gaining a testimony through spiritual manifestations, so he prayed to gain a testimony. That night, he dreamed of a lost cow in a field that had an injured horn which poked its own eye. A voice asked him, \\"If you find your cow at this place tomorrow, will you believe that the Restored Gospel is true?\\" He responded yes, and that morning he reportedly saw the injured cow, just as the voice had told him. Historian Kevin Cantera compared the Dream Miners' views of this experience with traditional LDS views of Joseph Smith's First Vision. From 1888 to 1891, Koyle served as a missionary in the Southern States Mission. During his mission, he became known for his prophetic dreams. He did not keep a diary but, according to legend, one of his dreams helped save J. Golden Kimball's life. He returned to Utah in 1894 and sold butter, cheese, and vegetables in the Mercur and Tintic mining districts. On August 27, 1894, he reportedly had a dream in which the Angel Moroni brought him to a Nephite mine on a nearby mountain, showing him nine caverns full of treasures buried by the Nephites, including the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, and the golden plates. The angel instructed him to reopen this mine and dig new tunnels, and said that it would provide financial aid during an economic collapse. The angel also said that the mine's gold would help provide financial relief for the LDS Church, and fund the gathering of Israel in the last days. The mine was closed in 1914 because of the opposition from the LDS Church, and it was reopened in September 1920 due to a $2,000 debt that the Dream Miners owed to the Spanish Fork Church Co-Operative. Koyle continued earning a reputation as a prophetic dreamer, allegedly predicting that World War I would start in 1914, and that Wall Street would crash in 1929. From 1932‚Äì6, Koyle and his followers constructed an ore mill called the \\"White Sentinel\\" just outside the Dream Mine. Koyle was brought before a disciplinary council in 1947 and was told that he could either repudiate his revelations concerning the Dream Mine or be excommunicated. He signed a notarized statement repudiating his revelations, which was then published in the Deseret News on January 8, 1947. Koyle soon said that he had been forced to sign this statement, and the LDS Church excommunicated him on April 18, 1948. Koyle died on May 17, 1949 in Payson, Utah. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1949 deaths Category:19th-century apocalypticists Category:20th- century apocalypticists Category:Latter Day Saints from Utah Category:American leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:American Mormon missionaries in the United States Category:People excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:People from Spanish Fork, Utah Category:Prophets in Mormonism ","title":"John Hyrum Koyle"},{"id":"54096852","text":"Andreas Katsantonis (; born 16 February 2000) is a Cypriot footballer who plays as a forward for the APOEL. == Club statistics == {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals -----  rowspan=\\"4\\"Omonia - 2016‚Äì17 21000021 - 2017‚Äì18 7100colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì71 - !Total!!9!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!9!!2 -  rowspan=\\"2\\"APOEL - 2018‚Äì19 00100010 - !colspan=2Career total !9!!2!!1!!0!!0!!0!!10!!2 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:2000 births Category:Cypriot footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:AC Omonia players Category:APOEL FC players Category:Cypriot First Division players ","title":"Andreas Katsantonis"},{"id":"54096866","text":"Renshou Temple () is a Buddhist temple situated in downtown Foshan, Guangdong, China. ==History== The Mahavira Hall at Renshou Temple.

Projects that have to be reviewed by CEQR are either in need of permits or approval from a city agency, need city funding, or are directly undertaken by a city agency. ==History== In 1973, New York City put into place Executive Order No. 87, meaning that any city project being implemented must be assessed for the impact it could have on the environment. This initiative was in response to the country's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which was enacted in 1970 and was one of the first national laws dedicated to protecting the environment. Continuing after that, in 1975 the State of New York put into place the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR). SEQR required that state and local government agencies must review the environmental impact of any discretionary action before funding or approving that action. From the SEQR came the CEQR in 1977. SEQR regulations allowed local governments to create their own environmental review procedures. Through the Executive Order No. 91, CEQR was established in New York City and so was the creation of a two co-lead agency system that would handle most of the environmental review functions. However, in 1991 the two co-lead agency system was replaced by a new system of lead agencies, where City agencies would act as the lead agency to any projects they wished to fund or implement. ==Environmental review process== An environmental review process starts when an agency proposes a project. In addition to the proposal, the agency must have a completed list of any permits, approvals, or funding needed to complete the project. The list will help guide the CEQR process; determining how intensely the CEQR process must be, or if a CEQR is even needed for a project. Once the CEQR process begins, it is separated into two stages. The first stage is an initial assessment, known as the Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), which discloses the description of the project and any potential impacts it could have. The EAS is then reviewed for any significant impacts that could arise and if any are found, the lead agency declares an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to be completed, which analyzes the impacts described in the EAS. During the review, projects can be categorized into several defining labels. One label is Project Development, where the project is still being defined and the data is being gathered before the CEQR process. Another label is Active, where the CEQR process is in progress. On Hold, where the review has been suspended. Complete, when the CEQR process is completed. Withdrawn, where an applicant withdraws the review. Terminated, when the review, after 6 months of inactivity, becomes canceled. And Monitoring, when a project, which has completed the CEQR process, is tracked, making sure guidelines are being followed. ==Environmental aspects== When conducting the review, CEQR takes the following areas into account for their assessment: * Land Use, Zoning, and Public Policy * Socioeconomic Conditions * Community Facilities and Services * Open Space * Shadows * Historic and Cultural Resources * Urban Design and Visual Resources * Natural Resources * Hazardous Materials * Infrastructure * Solid Waste and Sanitation Services * Energy * Transportation * Air Quality * Greenhouse Gas Emissions * Noise * Public Health * Neighborhood Character * Construction Impacts ==ReferencesExternal links== * NYC Office of Environmental Coordination Website Category:1977 establishments in New York (state) Category:Environmental impact assessment Category:Environment of New York City Category:Community development Category:Government of New York City Category:Environmental justice in New York City ","title":"City Environmental Quality Review"},{"id":"54096907","text":"Kacper Lasko≈õ (born 5 January 2000) is a Polish footballer who plays as midfielder for Ekstraklasa club Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. ==Career== GKS Tychy On 13 February 2019, Lasko≈õ joined GKS Tychy.Kacper Lasko≈õ odszed≈Ç z Wis≈Çy, wislakrakow.com, 13 February 2019 ==International career== Lasko≈õ played three games for Poland U16U-16: Powo≈Çania na dwumecz z Uzbekistanem, pzpn.pl, 24 March 2016U-16: Polska zwyciƒô≈ºy≈Ça w rewan≈ºu z Czechami, pzpn.pl, 17 March 2016, one for Poland U17 and three for Poland U18.U-18: Polacy zremisowali z Belgami, pzpn.pl, 3 September 2017U-18: Bia≈Ço-czerwoni remisujƒÖ z FrancjƒÖ, pzpn.pl, 30 August 2017 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Polish footballers Category:Ekstraklasa players Category:Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w players Category:GKS Tychy players Category:Association football defenders Category:People from Gorlice ","title":"Kacper Lasko≈õ"},{"id":"54096908","text":"Vladimir Obradoviƒá (; born 4 February 1981) is a Serbian tennis coachTennis player with autism slices up the competition and former professional tennis player. ==Biography== Obradoviƒá, a right-handed player with a one handed backhand, trained at Belgrade's Partizan Tennis Club.

It is Hawkins' second full-length thriller following the success of The Girl on the Train. Although the novel performed well, becoming a Sunday Times best seller and featuring on The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2017, critical reception was generally not as positive as it had been for her debut thriller. Several critics were confused by the plethora of characters (the story is told from the viewpoint of 11 characters) and the similarities of their voices. In February 2017, before the book was first published, Variety reported that DreamWorks' parent Amblin Partners purchased the film rights, with La La Lands Marc Platt and Jared LeBoff proposed as producers. ==Plot== Following the unexplained death of her sister, Nel, in a pool at the foot of a cliff, Jules Abbott returns to Beckford, a fictional town in Northumberland, to care for her niece, Lena. The novel is told in a mixture of first-person and third-person narrative. Jules had been estranged from her sister Nel due to an incidence from their childhood. Nel assumed that Jules had seduced her boyfriend Robbie even though he was sexually abusing Jules. Lena is furious at Jules for not speaking to her mom. Lena believes that her mom jumped into the Drowning Pool, a place where multiple women throughout the town's history have died. Lena blamed her friend Katie's death on her mother's obsession with the pool. Jules does not believe that her sister committed suicide. She heard fear in Nel's last voicemail, imploring Jules to meet her. Jules informed Detective Sean Townsend about this. Detective Sergeant Erin Morgan sensed Sean's distress in the case and found out that his mother also committed suicide in the Drowning Pool. Helen Townsend stays at her father-in-law Patrick's cottage as her husband betrayed her. Louise, Katie's mother, was relieved that Nel died as she holds her responsible for inspiring girls to become curious about the Drowning Pool. Her son Josh, however, is terrified that his mom was not at the house when Nel died. Jules searches for her mother's bracelet which Nel wore all the time and is shocked to find that it is missing. Louise finds diet pills prescribed to Nel among Katie's belongings and tells Sean that Nel's murder should be made public. But it turns out that Katie asked Lena to buy her the pills. Mark Henderson, Lena's teacher, finds Nel's bracelet in Helen's drawer while searching her room. Josh and Lena breaks his windows as revenge for Katie's death. Josh tells Sean that Mark seduced Katie, and Lena reveals that Katie sacrificed herself to protect Mark from being arrested for statutory rape. Louise confronts Lena for keeping the information from her, and Lena tells her she threatened Katie to end her relationship with Mark. After Louise leaves, she tells Jules that it was Nel who made the threat. Erin comes to know that Nel and Sean had a relationship. She asks Sean about it and he barks at her to check his records. She meets Nickie, a con artist who tells her that she must look upon Lauren (Patrick's dead wife) and not Helen. Lena waits for Mark at his home and tries to kill him but ends up injured. He ties her up and tries to escape with her in the car. He confronts her at his ex's cottage and tells Lena that he loved Katie and did not kill Nel. They fight, and Lena likely kills Mark. Lena tells Jules that Nel was murdered, having learned from Mark that Helen Townsend had a bracelet in her office that was missing from Nel‚Äôs body after her death. Jules goes to the Townsend house and accuses Helen of murdering Nel. Patrick (Sean's father) then confesses to killing Nel and to killing his own wife, Lauren, years ago. In the months after Patrick‚Äôs confession, each of the characters leaves Beckford. Jules and Lena go to London and have a much stronger relationship than they did at the beginning. Patrick is in jail. Helen and Sean leave together, but Sean disappears one day and Helen does not look for him. Sean, in an undisclosed location, tries to come to terms with himself and admits that it was he who killed Nel. ==Reception== The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 63% of critics \\"panned\\" the book, whilst 19% and 6% of the critics expressed \\"mixed\\" or \\"positive\\" impressions, respectively. Another 13% of the critics gave the book a \\"rave\\" review, based on a sample of 16 reviews. In contrast to the general acclaim Hawkins received for The Girl on the Train, Into the Water received mixed reviews. While acknowledging the challenges of writing for 11 separate narrative voices, crime novelist Val McDermid wrote in The Guardian that the similarity of the characters' tone and register makes it \\"almost impossible to tell [them] apart, which end up being monotonous and confusing\\"; furthermore, it doesn't reflect the speech patterns of Northumberland. McDermid concludes that the sales will be much higher than the readers' enjoyment. Similarly, Independent's Sally Newall says that the voices weren't \\"distinct enough\\". She was \\"semi-gripped\\" by the novel, but found that the \\"myriad of characters\\" made it difficult to care about them or the final reveal. Writing in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that Hawkins' \\"goal may be to build suspense, but all she achieves is confusion. Into the Water is jam-packed with minor characters and stories that go nowhere.\\" The New Statesman's Leo Robson wrote \\"Most of the time, the novel is plausible and grimly gripping.\\" He commended the writing as \\"addictive\\", and added that the novel \\"is on a par with The Girl on a Train\\". Jocelyn McClurg for USA Today also offers praise, suggesting \\"Hawkins, influenced by Hitchcock, has a cinematic eye and an ear for eerie, evocative language.\\" ==Translations== In 2017 Ali Qane‚Äô of the Tehran publisher Kuleh Poshty Publications stated that the company he works for received the right to translate the book in Iran after Qane‚Äô requested the author's permission to do so via a telephone call; he stated that five employees of the company are translating different parts of the book. ==References== Category:2017 British novels Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators Category:Novels set in Northumberland ","title":"Into the Water"},{"id":"54096927","text":"SuperKEKB is a particle collider located at KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. SuperKEKB collides electrons with positrons at the centre-of-momentum energy close to the mass of the Œ•(4S) resonance making it a second-generation B-factory for the Belle II experiment. The accelerator is an upgrade to the KEKB accelerator, providing approximately 40 times higher luminosity, due mostly to superconducting quadrupole focusing magnets. The accelerator achieved \\"first turns\\" (first circulation of electron and positron beams) in February 2016. First collisions occurred on 26 April 2018. At 20:34 on 15th June 2020, SuperKEKB achieved the world‚Äôs highest instantaneous luminosity for a colliding-beam accelerator, setting a record of 2.22√ó1034 cm‚àí2s‚àí1. == Description == The SuperKEKB design reuses many components from KEKB. Under normal operation, SuperKEKB collides electrons at 7 GeV with positrons at 4 GeV (compared to KEKB at 8 GeV and 3.5 GeV respectively). The centre-of- momentum energy of the collisions is therefore at the mass of the Œ•(4S) resonance (10.57 GeV/c2). The accelerator will also perform short runs at energies of other Œ• resonances, in order to obtain samples of other B mesons and baryons. The asymmetry in the beam energy provides a relativistic Lorentz boost to the B meson particles produced in the collision. The direction of the higher-energy beam determines the 'forward' direction, and the affects the design of much of the Belle II detector. As with KEKB, SuperKEKB consists of two storage rings: one for the high-energy electron beam (the High Energy Ring, HER) and one for the lower energy positron beam (the Low Energy Ring, LER). The accelerator has a circumference of 3016m with four straight sections and experimental halls in the centre of each, named \\"Tsukuba\\", \\"Oho\\", \\"Fuji\\", and \\"Nikko\\". The Belle II experiment is located at the single interaction point in Tsukuba Hall. == Luminosity == The target luminosity for SuperKEKB is 8√ó1035 cm‚àí2s‚àí1, this is 40 times larger than the luminosity at KEKB. The improvement is mostly due to a so-called 'nano-beam' scheme, originally proposed for the cancelled SuperB experiment. In the nano-beam scheme at SuperKEKB, the beams are squeezed in the vertical direction and the crossing angle is increased, which reduces the area of the crossing. The luminosity is further increased by a factor of two, due to a higher beam current than KEKB. The focus and crossing angle is achieved by two new superconducting quadrupole magnets at the interaction point that were installed in February 2017. On June 15, 2020, SuperKEKB set a new world record for the highest instantaneous luminosity for a colliding-beam accelerator: 2.22√ó1034 cm‚àí2s‚àí1. (On June 21, 2020, SuperKEKB broke its own record and achieved an instantaneous luminosity of 2.40√ó1034 cm‚àí2s‚àí1.) The previous world record of 2.14√ó1034 cm‚àí2s‚àí1 was achieved by LHC in 2018. == See also == * KEKB * Large Electron-Positron Collider * Large Hadron Collider == References  External links == * SuperKEKB webpage * KEK webpage * SuperKEKB on Inspire * Belle II on Inspire Category:Particle physics facilities Category:Particle experiments Category:B physics Category:Accelerator physics Category:Particle accelerators Category:Science and technology in Japan Category:Tsukuba, Ibaraki ","title":"SuperKEKB"},{"id":"54096937","text":"Pawe≈Ç Olszewski (born 7 June 1999) is a Polish football player who plays as defender for Jagiellonia Bia≈Çystok. ==Career== In July 2017, Olszewski joined Wigry Suwa≈Çki on a two-year loan.

It opened around the dawn of the 20th century and operated until financial difficulties led to its closure in 1958. The land on which it once stood is now home to a residential development. ==History== Puritas Springs bottling The land on which the amusement park would eventually be built was originally developed by the Cleveland, Berea, Elyri & Oberlin Railway. In the mid 1890s, the company purchased land in the area and began to bottle and sell water from the local springs Establishment and early days The railway company and Albert Akins, its vice president, soon made plans to create a park at the Puritas Springs site. They hoped to attract guests to the area and profit from increased rail ticket sales. The Cleveland, Berea, Elyria, and Oberlin Railway began service to the park gates on June 10, 1900. In the early days, the Puritas Springs did not include a merry-go-round, a Ferris Wheel, or other staple attractions of more modern amusement parks; like many parks of the time, it provided simpler amenities, such as a dance hall, camp sites and picnic areas. Transformation John Gooding was a very important figure in the history of the park. Though sources disagree on whether Gooding founded the park or became involved around 1908. What is clear is that he owned the park outright by the end of 1915 and directed many important changes until his death in the 1930s. John Gooding began to transform the park by installing mechanized rides, such as merry go rounds. In 1922, seven years after acquiring the park, he installed an enclosed roller skating rink, which featured a band organ. 1927 saw the installation of the Cyclone, a roller coaster designed by coaster pioneer John Miller. The Cyclone opened on June 10, 1928 and soon became the park's main attraction. Gooding died in the mid 1930s, but the park remained under the ownership of his family until its closure. Closure and fire In 1958, high insurance prices and increasing residential development in the area, combined with a decline in attendance, led to the sale of Puritas Springs Park to residential developers. Less than a year after the closure, a fire destroyed much of the park. The cause of the fire was never determined. After closure In spite of the fire and years of decay, parts of the park, including some of the famous Cyclone roller coaster, remained. A commemorative plaque funded by West Park Historical Society and The Ohio History Connection stands at the site of the park's original entrance ==Attractions== Dance halls Throughout its history, Puritas Springs featured three different dance halls, the first two of which were destroyed by fire. The original dance hall opened in 1900 and burned down ten years later. The second opened in 1911 and featured a high ceiling, a bandstand, and a balcony. In 1946, it, too, was lost to fire. The third and final dance hall was an open-air structure and was not nearly as full-featured as the second dance hall. Roller rink The roller skating rink at Puritas Springs was erected in 1922. It featured a band organ and was widely popular. Cyclone The Cyclone was the most famous attraction at Puritas Springs. It was designed by John Miller in 1927 and made significant use of the terrain.

The coaster was widely considered dangerous, and, in fact, several people claimed to have suffered injuries while riding it.

It helps with even cooking of steamed rice cakes, being the less dense layer (compared to the rice flour layer, which tend to turn stickier as it steams) through which steam passes more easily. Gomul is also used for topping bingsu (shaved ice). Sometimes, soybean gomul is served with grilled samgyeopsal (pork belly), with meat dipped in the soybean powder when eaten. == Varieties and preparation == Red bean or mung bean gomul is used in winter, while soybean or sesame gomul, which don't spoil as fast, are preferred in summer. Common varieties and their preparation are: * Bam-gomul (; \\"chestnut strands/flakes or powder\\") ‚Äì chestnuts are shelled and sliced into thin strands or flakes. Alternatively, they can be cooked, shelled, mashed, and sieved through a coarse strainer into powder. * Daechu-gomul (; \\"jujube strands/flakes\\") ‚Äì jujubes are peeled, and the skin part is sliced into thin strands or flakes. * Dongbu-gomul (; \\"cowpea powder\\") ‚Äì the white gomul is made with cowpeas. ** Geopipat-gomul (; \\"hulled red bean powder\\") ‚Äì to make the white gomul, red beans (often the black cultivar) are ground in a millstone, soaked in lukewarm water for five to six hours, husked, and steamed in siru. When properly cooked, the beans are salted, mashed, sieved, and pan-fried without oil over a low heat. * Kkae- gomul (; \\"sesame powder\\") ‚Äì sesame is washed, husked, pan-fried without oil, and used whole or coarsely ground with mortar and pestle. ** Heugimja-gomul (; \\"black sesame powder\\") ‚Äì black sesame is prepared in the same way as for sesame. * Kong-gomul (; \\"soybean powder\\") ‚Äì the yellow gomul is made by washing, draining, and roasting soybeans, then mashing them with ginger, garlic, and salt. It is then sieved to desired fineness: coarse kong-gomul usually used to coat injeolmi, and coarse kong-gomul to fill and top siru- tteok. * Nokdu-gomul (; \\"mung bean powder\\") ‚Äì the pale yellow gomul is made with mung beans in the same way that geopipat-gomul is made. * Pat-gomul (; \\"red bean powder\\") ‚Äì to make the dark red gomul, unhusked red beans are boiled in three parts water, drained when 80% cooked, and let steam for a long time. When properly cooked without excess moisture, it is salted and mashed. * Seogi-gomul (; \\"rock tripe strands/flakes\\") ‚Äì rock tripe is sliced into thin strands or flakes. == Gallery == KOCIS gyeongdan, sweet rice balls (4646996328).jpgGyeongdan coated with various gomul Bam-danja.jpgDanja coated with bam-daechu-gomul (chestnut and jujube strands) Injeolmi (tteok) (rice cake).jpgInjeolmi coated with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Rice cake ball.jpgGyeongdan coated with gomul Sirutteok.jpgSiru-tteok filled with pat- gomul (red bean powder) Black sesame injeolmi.jpgInjeolmi coated with heugimja-gomul (black sesame powder) Korean rice cake-Tteok- Gyeongdan-02.jpgGyeongdan coated with various gomul Injeolmi bingsu.jpgBingsu topped with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Yeot.jpgYeot coated with kong-gomul (soybean powder) Kong-gomul for dipping.jpgKong-gomul (soybean powder) for dipping samgyeopsal (pork belly) == References == Category:Food and drink decorations Category:Korean cuisine ","title":"Gomul"},{"id":"54097075","text":"Bence Kiss (born 1 July 1999) is a Hungarian footballer who plays as midfielder for Kazincbarcikai SC on loan from Halad√°s in Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g I. == References == Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g I players Category:Szombathelyi Halad√°s footballers ","title":"Bence Kiss"},{"id":"54097076","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Indiana Pacers season was Indiana's 51st season as a franchise and 42nd season in the NBA. For the first time since 2010, Paul George was not on the team's roster as he was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the previous off-season. Despite that, the Pacers improved on their previous year's record and clinched a playoff berth for the third straight season. Their season featured the emergence of Victor Oladipo, who the Pacers received as part of the trade for George. The Pacers finished the regular season with a record of 48‚Äì34, which clinched the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Pacers faced the 4th seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, who had previously swept the Pacers in the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs. The Pacers were once again defeated in the first round, losing to the Cavaliers in seven games. ==NBA draft== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! width=\\"75\\" style=\\";\\"  Round ! width=\\"75\\" style=\\";\\"  Pick ! width=\\"175\\" style=\\";\\"  Player ! width=\\"125\\" style=\\";\\"  Position ! width=\\"150\\" style=\\";\\"  Nationality ! width=\\"200\\" style=\\";\\"  College - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  1  18  T.

Leaf and Ike Anigbogu were both considered first round picks of the draft that were also teammates in their sole seasons at UCLA. Leaf was their starting power forward and that led the team in scoring with 16.3 points per game, while also averaging 8.2 rebounds 2.4 assists, and 1.1 blocks per game as a starting. Leaf was also named a member of the All-Pac-12 First Team and All-Pac-12 Freshman Team. Anigbogu was a backup center for UCLA and averaged 4.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks in 13 minutes of action per game, he was projected as a potential first round pick for his athleticism and defensive capabilities; He dropped to the later half of the second round possibly due to a knee injury he sustained during a Pacers pre-draft workout. The Pacers selected Edmond Sumner as their final pick of the draft, a point guard who was also rehabilitating himself from a knee injury during the NBA draft process. In his junior season, Sumner was then the second leading scorer for Xavier but failed to complete the season after suffering a serious knee injury on a January 29, 2017 in a win against St. John's University. He averaged 14.3 points, 4.8 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game with the Musketeers in his final year. Edmond became the first ever Pacer in franchise history to sign a two-way contract. ==RosterStandings== Division Conference ==Game log== Preseason  - bfb;\\"  1  October 4  @ Milwaukee   Lance Stephenson (17)  Myles Turner (9)  Lance Stephenson (6)  Bradley Center 6,691  1‚Äì0 - bfb;\\"  2  October 6  @ Cleveland   T.J.

Thomas Bradley Harris (October 29, 1826 in New York City; ‚Äì May 22, 1866 in Ellena, Borneo) was an American businessman and co- founder of the American colony of \\"Ellena\\" together with Joseph William Torrey on the island of Borneo. == Early life == Harris was born in New York on October 29, 1826. He was a professional merchant for ship equipment at the corner of South Street and Maiden Lane. At the first, he was working alone but later with his business partner named Nathan Gilette Pond, where they established the Harris & Pond company. The business premises had already opened by his father in 1805, and since working there they began to exported large quantities of butter to British Hong Kong. This export business was so successful that the trademark was soon copied by other exporters and stuck on its own goods. == Further career == In 1862, Harris left New York to set up his own branch of business in Hong Kong and put an end to unfair business competition in his country. He left his wife Sarah Louisa n√©e Seymour and his children in Walton, New York, where his father James Harris had already retired from the company in 1857.  Ellena Colony  Harris (standing left) and Joseph William Torrey (sitting right). In August 1865, the American consul in Brunei, Charles Lee Moses concluded a 10-year lease with the Sultan Abdul Momin and his successor, Pengiran Temenggung who guaranteed land rights in various areas in the north of Borneo. Looking for a quick profit, the consul immediately sought buyers for his concessions following the signing of the lease. He raised the interest among his countrymen including Joseph William Torrey and Harris. In October 1865, Torrey and Harris, together with Chinese lenders Lee Assing and Pong Ampong under the American Trading Company of Borneo decided to build a colony in the area of today's Kimanis. Taking note of the fact that the acquisition of the concession of Moses was also recognized by the Sultan of Brunei, Torrey made a new concession letter drawn up on November 24, 1865 at the Brunei Palace provided with the seals of the Sultan and three of his ministers. In December 1865, Torrey with 12 Americans and 60 Chinese founded the colony of \\"Ellena\\" with Harris was appointed as vice-governor. The position of Ellenas in the mouth of the sluggish Kimanis River was unfortunate and favored the outbreak of malaria and other diseases. Ellena soon failed as the colony lacked a solid financial base, and Torrey was forced to leave his own colony to Harris a while to look for investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai. == Later life and death == Harris grave at the \\"Governor‚Äôs Hill\\" in Kimanis. Harris however died of malaria on May 22, 1866 while Torrey was in Hong Kong trying to raise additional funds for their colony. Torrey buried him on the top of a nearby hill, now known as Governor's Hill where Harris had built his house on the slopes of the hill and laid a path down to the jetty by the river. A powerful granite block, which is said to require six water buffaloes to carry it in a two-days effort from a nearby quarry to the grave, marks his last retirement. Torrey made the following inscription to this tombstone: { style=\\"width: 5em\\" style=\\"width:30em\\" In Memory of Thomas Bradley Harris Hon. Chief Secretary of the Colony of Ambong and Maroodu.

Nayarambalam. The film was produced by Antony Perumbavoor through Aashirvad Cinemas; it stars Mohanlal, with Anoop Menon, Anna Rajan, Priyanka Nair, Siddique, Salim Kumar,Sanjeev M Pillai and Chemban Vinod Jose in supporting roles. Shaan Rahman composed the film's soundtrack and score. The film follows Michael Idikkula, a newly appointed vice-principal in a lesser-known seaside college. In order to raise fund for building a hostel, he teams up with the students to make a feature film based on one of the college's founding members. Principal photography took place between May and July 2017, primarily in the neighbourhoods of Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha in Kerala. Velipadinte Pusthakam was released in India on 31 August 2017. The song \\"Entammede Jimikki Kammal\\" from the film sung by Vineeth Sreenivasan and Renjith Unni was a viral hit attracting national and international attention for the first time for a Malayalam song. ==Plot== During the Karkidakam season in 2007, Vishwanathan, also known as Bullet Vishwan (Anoop Menon), is ambushed while riding his motorbike. As he fights his attackers, two men‚ÄîMaathan Tharakan (Siddique) and Kaaka Rameshan (Chemban Vinod Jose)‚Äîarrive. Maathan hits Vishwan with a steel bar, killing him. Prof. Premraj, also called Kamaraj (Salim Kumar), is the vice-principal of a college who tries to stop relationships between male and female students while continuing a relationship with a cleaner, and watches pornographic videos. Two student gangs; the 'kadappuram' (seafront) gang led by Franklin (Appani Sarath) and the 'Thiruvananthapuram' (city) gang led by Sameer (Arun Kurian). During one of these fights, the gangs break a picture of Vishwan. Premraj installs CCTV cameras in the campus. Franklin's friend Vignyanaakoshi (Jude Anthany Joseph) interferes with the system to show pornographic videos; Premraj turns on the monitor, sees the videos and is caught by Fr. George Kaattuparambu (Shivaji Guruvayoor), who suspends him from his job. Premraj tells Sameer and his gang he is innocent of the offence but is being replaced as vice-principal and is powerless to act. He orders the gang to break the new vice-principle's legs; Sameer agrees to this and the gang hold a small protest by the gate as Vishwan's replacement arrives. Franklin also arrives and congratulates the new vice-principal. The new vice-principal is Michael Idicula (Mohanlal), who avoids Sameer's plan to break his legs. He introduces himself to the teachers, including Mary (Anna Rajan). Michael's first class of students‚Äîespecially Sameer, who was praised for making a short film‚Äîseem to like him. This disappoints Franklin, who was expecting Michael to befriend Franklin instead. One day, Michael meets Franklin's father Varkey (Prasad Mohammah), who is drunk and invites Michael to his house. He meets Franklin's family. Later, the physics teacher Anumol (Sneha Sreekumar), who is Mary's friend, decides to propose to Michael on her behalf. When they go to meet Michael, he tells them to meet after the morning Mass at the local Latin church. They discover Michael is a priest and wonder why he still did not marry. Anumol and Mary cancel their planned proposal; instead Anumol asks Michael if he knows anyone willing to marry Mary, to which Michael agrees. Meanwhile, Michael reconciles Sameer and Franklin and their gangs, and they also meet Vareethettan (Alencier Ley Lopez), who has been serving Michael's family for a long time. Michael, as vice-principal, is popular with the students and the staff. When Michael suggests making a feature film to raise money for building two hostels for the college, Fr. Kaattuparambu gives permission, providing only the Phoenix College staff and students are in the film. Michael calls his friend, Malayalam film producer Vijay Babu, about the project, and he agrees to take part. According to Vijay, the story is only suitable for a short film and Michael suggests the story of Vishwan, who had campaigned for a college to be built on land originally owned by Maathan Tharakan. He describes Vishwan as a violent but honest man who always did the right thing whenever he could. Maathan Tharakan killed Vishwan the day after the college's cornerstone was laid, and paid to have his right-hand man Kaaka Rameshan sent to jail. Vijay says the story is perfect and goes ahead with the project. Auditions for the film's characters are held and all of the roles except that of Vishwan‚Äîwhom no-one portrays well‚Äîare cast. Because of this, Vijay decides to freeze the project. They eventually find someone who is perfect for the role‚ÄîMichael‚Äîwho changes his appearance completely. The film's production begins. Principal photography of the film begins; all of the actors‚Äîexcept Premraj (portraying Maathan Tharakan), who has difficulties in acting‚Äîperform well. Meanwhile, Michael meets Vishwan's widow Jayanthi (Priyanka Nair) and her second daughter Sreekutty, who explain that their first daughter died. One night, Premraj is beaten up by the real Maathan Tharakan and his gang, who warn him Michael will suffer the same fate if he carries on with the film. Michael goes to meet Maathan and tells him filming must continue. One night, Maathan tells Michael the story about Vishwan's death is wrong and that Kaaka Rameshan was the true killer; Vishwan was killed because he married Rameshan's lover Jayanthi. Shocked, Michael asks Sameer & Franklin to restructure the climax; after much argument, both agrees to the demands. The crew film the death of Vishwan's first child. After the filming, Michael signs a form in the name of Vishwan, shocking Vareethettan. He tells the staff and students Michael's father resented his son becoming a priest and forcibly removed him from the seminary; this incident affected Michael as a psychological illness. Vareethettan says Michael adopts the personality of characters he really likes, and asks them to stop Michael from acting. Michael vanishes but he‚Äîstill speaking as Vishwan‚Äîthreatens Varkey into revealing how Vishwan's first daughter died; Varkey says Kaaka Rameshan drowned her in a pond. Varkey told the real Vishwan everything and Vishwan started fighting Rameshan and got himself killed. The next day, Rameshan is released from jail and tells some of the people there he killed Vishwan, shocking everyone. Rameshan creates a fuss at the filming and then arrives at the climax scene. There, Michael‚Äîwho is supposed to be receiving a whack on the head from another actor‚Äîstops and beats up the actor. Rameshan gets involved and tells the crew he killed Vishwan, angering Michael, who nearly kills Rameshan. Vishwan's death is not depicted in the students' film; instead a caption tells the audience; \\"Vishwan lives in the minds of everyone\\". Michael's illness has been cured and the bishop explains that Michael is the best person to inaugurate the new hostel. He does this and announces that he will become the new principal of the Phoenix College. The film ends as all of them stands together to take a selfie. ==Cast== * Mohanlal as Prof. Michael Idicula / Fr.

In September, however, he said he would precede with a short-scheduled film by December and a Nivin Pauly film in early 2016, and had the \\"Mohanlal film in mind\\". His first-time working with the actor, Lal had made earlier attempts to make a film with Mohanlal, which never worked out. The project started during a story discussion with screenwriter Benny P. Nayarambalam, when Lal asked him if he could come up with a story that would suit Mohanlal. Benny described a character he had in mind, which Lal found interesting. They developed a story outline in 10 days. As of January 2016, a script for the project had not been written; Benny said the film was in its preliminary phase and might take another year to materialise, considering that both Lal and Mohanlal were busy with other projects. Shortly after, Pauly's film was mothballed and Lal confirmed the \\"Mohanlal film\\" as his next. He described its genre as a \\"light- hearted humourous movie\\". The rest of the cast and crew of the film were expected to be fixed as soon as the script was finished. In February 2016, Lal said Benny \\"has started the work\\", and after finishing the writing process the filming would commence in the second half of 2016. The following month, Benny said he would start writing after finishing scripting a Mammootty film scheduled to start in August 2016. Meanwhile, some reports said Mohanlal's role was of a college professor in the film. In December 2016, Benny said the film's discussion was progressing and that it dealt with a \\"subject that has humour and will have Mohanlal as a college professor\\". In April 2017, it was announced that the first schedule of filming would start by mid-May and the second schedule two months later. More details of Mohanlal's character were revealed: he plays a vice-principal in a college and will exhibit two different character looks while passing through two phases of life, but \\"not [in] a long [time] span\\"‚Äîone will have him in a bearded look and the other clean-shaven. It was reported that Mohanlal would shoot for around a month and will join the second schedule by July, appearing in different looks for each schedule. Some of the cast were confirmed and the rest were being finalised at the time. The title Velipadinte Pusthakam was announced by Mohanlal on 21 May 2017. As of April 2017, filming was scheduled to start on 15 May that year.  Casting  Lal Jose wanted every character in the film to get due importance; not just the lead character. The names of most of the supporting cast were revealed in April 2017. Anna Rajan, who debuted with Angamaly Diaries, was fixed in the role of Mary, a biology teacher in a college. Benny described her character as \\"a strict teacher and would be seen as a regular, sari-clad faculty member. We might add a pair of spectacles too to the look, but the final decision will be taken post the look test.\\" Anoop Menon was confirmed in an unspecified role who \\"appears in the backstory of the film\\".

Here he became the proteg√© of Prime Minister Jos√© de Grimaldo and was introduced to the Royal Court. When King Philip V of Spain abdicated from the throne in favor of his son Louis I of Spain, Jos√© de Grimaldo also stood down as Prime Minister (Secretary of the Universal Bureau) and Orend√°in succeeded him. But when King Louis died from smallpox just seven months later, Philip V of Spain was forced to return to the Spanish throne. Jos√© de Grimaldo followed in his footsteps and replaced Orend√°in as prime minister. Orenda√≠n became Minister of the Treasury. The next year, together with Juan Guillermo Ripperd√°, he was sent to Vienna where he negotiated the Treaty of Vienna (1725) with the former enemy. This treaty opened perspectives to regain former Spanish possessions in Italy. At their return, Riperd√° was made a Duke and also replaced Grimaldo, who favoured a treaty with Great Britain. Orend√°in received the title of Marqu√©s de la Paz (Marquess of Peace). In October 1726 Orend√°in became Prime Minister for the second time and he supported the aggressive foreign policy of Queen Elisabeth Farnese to regain former Spanish possessions in Italy. He stayed in office until his death, aged 55, on 21 October 1734. == Sources == * Euskomedia * Basques, ORENDAIN AZPILCUETA, JUAN BAUTISTA * Censo Archivos * Ministros de Hacienda de 1700 a 2004.

The Pilot, the official newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston criticized Catheron's appointmentin an editorial entitled \\"Bigotry Rewarded. An Unfortunate Appointment\\". Catheron denied being a member of the APA and stated that he was \\"incapable of prejudice\\". Boston Mayor James Michael Curley ordered his Corporation Counsel to investigate the legality of Catheron's appointment and ordered the City Auditor to withhold his pay until the investigation was concluded. On July 2, 1917 the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that Catheron's appointment was legal. Catheron also served on the Beverly School Committee and the State Commission on Probation. ==Later life== Catheron was a partner at Ropes, Gray, Boyden & Perkins. He died on January 8, 1950.

The building consists of a long, narrow nave, two small ridge turrets and a massive bell tower in the west. The choir is covered by two late Gothic fan vaults.Christian Rietschel, Bernd Langhof: Dorfkirchen in Sachsen. Evangelische Verlagsanstalt, Berlin 1963, p. 141. == Interior == The altar with the relief of the Last Supper was carved in 1602 and refurbished in 1836. The pulpit was built around 1670, and its stairway was decorated with paintings by Jacob Hennig from Pirna in 1672. == Pipe organ == Organ of Gottfried Silbermann in Reinhardtsgrimma The masterpiece of the church is the organ by Gottfried Silbermann, which was inaugurated in 1731. Gottfried Silbermann investigated the old organ in October 1725, as requested by Christiane Eleonore von Trettau n√©e von Berbisdorf, who was the widow of the chamberlain of . The old organ stood in an inappropriate position in the choir and was still tuned with the non-equal division of the octave. Silbermann concluded that the organ was beyond repair and offered in his proposal of 17 October 1725 a concept of a new instrument, an only slightly larger organ with two manuals. He estimated the cost at 800 thaler excluding painting and carpentry, which at that time was an amount equal to the salary of a medium to senior civil servant. Additionally, he wanted to be reimbursed for transport and lodging. The contract was probably signed in June 1729, when Silbermann agreed to provide a guarantee during his lifetime, and accepted to be paid in six rates until the end of 1732. The organ had Gottfried Silberman's serial number op. 21\\\\. It was sanctified on 6 January 1731. Its approval was granted by Emanuel Behnisch, then the organist of the Kreuzkirche, Dresden, who commented that he found the new organ good in all parts (f√ºr \\"allenthalben t√ºchtig befunden\\").

According to the \\"Rules on the construction of schools and school furniture\\" in 1881, the building was composed as a corner building and is one of the first schools in Belgrade that were special, modern and hygienic in terms of construction, erected as a whole. The building fulfilled all the conditions for the operation of such an institution, ranging from the use of building materials to the layout of the rooms, their size, lighting and more. The building was designed with a ground floor and two floors. The author formed three representative facades by plunging the angle. The two that meet each other are symmetrical, of equal number and arrangement of the window openings with emphasized entrance, balcony and bay window according to an axis of symmetry of both facades which are derived in neorenaissance style. The school has a basement, ground floor and first floor, with sixteen classrooms. It was built of brick in lime mortar, with wooden structures, except above the basement where shallow vaults are present. Vertical communication is carried out in each wing with one staircase. The school represented the model for all future school construction in Serbia, in terms of reached European ranking of programs and design, which is reflected in a number of innovations, of construction and design character, and in the equipping of all installations and facilities (gym, swimming pool, changing rooms, auditorium) as well, hitherto unknown in primary schools in Serbia. Opus of the architect Milan Kapetanoviƒá is important in the study of architecture of Belgrade between two centuries. Until 1927, Dorƒáol Elementary School was known as the \\"Serbian Royal Elementary School\\", later the Technical school for wood processing, interior decoration and landscape architecture.

Moy had been working as a researcher for Lord Low and noticed that lobbyists often provided inaccurate briefings to such legislators. Samuel had been concerned about accuracy in public debate for a number of years. Moy and Samuel were introduced by Julia Neuberger and worked together to found Full Fact. Full Fact applied to the Charity Commission for charitable status when it was being founded in 2009 but this was refused. An appeal was heard by the commission's tribunal in 2011 but this was rejected on the grounds that the stated objective of \\"civic engagement\\" was too political in nature. The wording was changed to \\"the advancement of public education\\" and charitable status was then granted in 2014. ==Methodology== Full Fact initially rated material on a five-point scale, using a magnifying glass as a symbol, instead of a star. They dropped this system as they felt such ratings were unreliable and so did not enhance their long-term reputation. The fact-checking process includes a three-stage review. Facts may then be reviewed by external academics too. Full Fact has been sponsored to develop automated fact-checking tools by the Omidyar Network and Open Society Foundations. Live is one of the tools that is intended to immediately check statements against a database of verified facts. The other tool is called Trends and this will track and display the spread of false information. Full Fact offers three-month secondments to statisticians working in the Government Statistical Service. Secondees have performed activities such as fact-checking Question Time and providing guidance on the presentation of statistics. Full Fact has also partnered with media organisations including the BBC, ITV and Sky News to provide information about political campaigns including the Scottish and UK-EU referenda and the general elections of 2015 and 2017. It also provided evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and the BBC Trust's impartiality review. ==Elections and referendums== In 2016, Full Fact covered the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum to check claims made during the campaign. For example that \\"We send the EU ¬£350M a week\\". Full Fact found that this was misleading, as the net amount sent was ¬£250 million (¬£13 billion a year) because of the UK's rebate. Another ¬£77 million a week (¬£4 billion a year) later comes back as EU expenditure on UK based projects, \\"mainly to farmers and for poorer areas of the country\\". Furthermore, extra money comes back as the EU spends money on the UK private sector, estimated by Full Fact to be ¬£1.5 billion a year (¬£29 million a week). In 2017, Full Fact collaborated with another similar organisation, First Draft, to staff a fact- checking team covering the UK general election. ==Facebook== On 11 January 2019, it was announced that Full Fact will be providing fact-checking services to the Facebook platform. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Charities based in England Category:Fact-checking websites ","title":"Full Fact"},{"id":"54097534","text":"Equivalence tests are a variation of hypothesis tests used to draw statistical inferences from observed data. In equivalence tests, the null hypothesis is defined as an effect large enough to be deemed interesting, specified by an equivalence bound. The alternative hypothesis is any effect that is less extreme than said equivalence bound. The observed data is statistically compared against the equivalence bounds. If the statistical test indicates the observed data is surprising, assuming that true effects at least as extreme as the equivalence bounds, a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences can be used to reject effect sizes larger than the equivalence bounds with a pre-specified Type 1 error rate. Equivalence testing originates from the field of pharmacokinetics. One application is to show that a new drug that is cheaper than available alternatives works just as well as an existing drug. In essence, equivalence tests consist of calculating a confidence interval around an observed effect size, and rejecting effects more extreme than the equivalence bound when the confidence interval does not overlap with the equivalence bound. In two-sided tests an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified. In non-inferiority trials, where the goal is to test the hypothesis that a new treatment is not worse than existing treatments, only a lower equivalence bound is pre-specified. Mean differences (black squares) and 90% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) with equivalence bounds ŒîL = -0.5 and ŒîU= 0.5 for four combinations of test results that are statistically equivalent or not and statistically different from zero or not. Pattern A is statistically equivalent, pattern B is statistically different from 0, pattern C is practically insignificant, and pattern D is inconclusive (neither statistically different from 0 nor equivalent).Equivalence tests can be performed in addition to null-hypothesis significance tests. This might prevent common misinterpretations of p-values larger than the alpha level as support for the absence of a true effect. Furthermore, equivalence tests can identify effects that are statistically significant but practically insignificant, whenever effects are statistically different from zero, but also statistically smaller than any effect size deemed worthwhile (see first Figure). == TOST procedure == \\"A very simple equivalence testing approach is the ‚Äòtwo-one-sided t-tests‚Äô (TOST) procedure. In the TOST procedure an upper (ŒîU) and lower (‚ÄìŒîL) equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest (e.g., a positive or negative difference of d = 0.3). Two composite null hypotheses are tested: H01: Œî ‚â§ ‚ÄìŒîL and H02: Œî ‚â• ŒîU. When both these one-sided tests can be statistically rejected, we can conclude that ‚ÄìŒîL < Œî < ŒîU, or that the observed effect falls within the equivalence bounds and is statistically smaller than any effect deemed worthwhile, and considered practically equivalent.\\" [Lakens 2017] Alternatives to the TOST procedure have been developed as well. A recent modification to TOST makes the approach feasible in cases of repeated measures and assessing multiple variables. == Comparison between t-test and equivalence test == The equivalence test can, for comparison purposes, be induced from the t-test. Considering a t-test at the significance level Œ±t-test achieving a power of 1-Œ≤t-test for a relevant effect size dr, both tests lead to the same inference whenever parameters Œî=dr as well as Œ±equiv.-test=Œ≤t-test and Œ≤equiv.-test=Œ±t-test coincide, i.e. the error types (type I and type II) are interchanged between the t-test and the equivalence test. To achieve this for the t-test, either the sample size calculation needs to be carried out correctly, or by adjusting the t-test significance level Œ±t-test, referred to as the so-called revised t-test. Both approaches have difficulties in practice, since sample size planning relies on unverifiable assumptions of the standard deviation \\\\sigma, and the revised t-test yields numerical problems. Preserving the test behaviour, those limitations can be removed by using an equivalence test. The second Figure allows a visual comparison of the equivalence test and the t-test when the sample size calculation is affected by differences between the a priori standard deviation \\\\sigma and the sample's standard deviation \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}, which is a common problem. Using an equivalence test instead of a t-test additionally ensures that Œ±equiv.-test is bounded, which the t-test does not do in case that \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma} > \\\\sigma with the type II error growing arbitrary large. On the other hand, having \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma} < \\\\sigma results in the t-test being stricter than the dr specified in the planning, which may randomly penalize the sample source (e.g. a device manufacturer). This makes the equivalence test safer to use. Chances to pass (a) the t-test and (b) the equivalence test, depending on the actual error ùúá.

The film is set in the backdrop of the dried-up Aral Sea and addresses the impact of the ecological catastrophe on the fate of the people in that region. It is the last part of the Central Asia trilogy that Khudojnazarov had planned, which started with his 1999 film Luna Papa. The second part of the trilogy, a tragicomedy named \\"Living Fish\\" (') after a screenplay by Oleg Antonov, had been projected since the year 2000, but was never completed as a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and the deaths of producer Karl Baumgartner in 2014 and Khudojnazarov in 2015. Waiting for the Sea was in the works in 2009. ==Plot summary== From the port town of Abasta (which resembles Mo‚Äòynoq) at the southern shore of the Aral Sea, Captain Marat sets off on a fishing trip despite a storm warning, since on this day an extraordinary amount of fish comes into the bay. After some hesitation, he takes his wife Dari along but sends her younger sister Tamara home. The ship sinks in the storm, leaving Marat the sole survivor. Ten years later, Marat is released from prison and returns to the town only to find that the sea has gone. The sea is now far away, and the port's pier rises into a vast sand desert with rusted ships. Town people treat Marat with hostility for the loss of their relatives during the naval accident. None of the missing crew members was ever found. Tortured by feelings of guilt, Marat starts to drag his ship with his own muscles in search of the sea. Only his old friend Balthazar stands by him. Tamara, the younger sister of his drowned wife Dari, loved Marat from her childhood and is now desperately trying to win his heart; Marat insists that Dari is his wife and tells her that he has \\"ashes in his heart\\". He only lives on for his quest of searching the sea, believing that if he finds the sea, he would also see his crew and his beloved wife Dari again, because \\"the sea doesn't kill. It returns what it takes\\". In the end, Marat dies of sickness and exhaustion. The perspective now changes into the soul of Marat: In a storm the sea returns and takes Marat on his ship out in the open, accompanied by the revelation of John 21:1. ==Cast== *Egor Beroev as Marat. *Anastasiya Mikulchina as Dari / Tamara. *Detlev Buck as Balthazar. *Dinmukhamet Akhimov as Dari's and Tamara's father. *Radzhab Khuseynov as Marduni. *Pavel Priluchnyy as Yasan. *Daulet Kekelbayev as Kvidak. == Filming locations == The film was shot in Kazakhstan on the Mangyshlak Peninsula in the mountainous deserts of the Caspian Sea and near the old port of Aktau.

This allows it to stop and rollback really fast. It has a short proboscis with a piercing organ called hypopharynx to inject a neurotoxin to its preys. A proboscis is a part of the insect mouth which is used to suck nectar or blood and usually its shape is tubular. With its claws, it can catch and its prey. It can measure until 15mm long. It has hairy legs and wide eyes that give it a good 3D vision. The male has a bulbous genital organ at the end of the abdomen and the female has a pointed back end at the abdomen which is corresponding at the male's genital organ. == Distribution ==  Natural global range  This species is an endemic species of New Zealand.  New Zealand range  This species can be found everywhere in the both principal islands of New Zealand.  Habitat preferences  It prefers grassland and silver tussock to live, so can be found widely distributed across New Zealand. It also lives in forest clearings on both islands. ==Life cycle/Phenology== It lays eggs directly on the soil or on plants. When the larva hatches, it may live either on or in the ground. When on the ground, it feeds on rotting organic matter. There are four larval stages and one pupal stage. The full nature of their trophic regime and its mechanisms are not fully known, but all larva stages are predators same as adult stage. ==Diet and foraging== Neoitamus melanopogon is an insect predator. It can hunt many kinds of insects, such as Ant, bee or Butterfly. It jumps on their back and injects them a neurotoxin to paralyze them. After that, it sucks the organs inside its preys. The common robber fly can occasionally eat the queen of Solenopsis (ant) species during nuptial flights. Its larvae is also a predator in the soil (Macfarlane et al., 1999).

Alexander and Mamia won the bloody encounter at Chikhori. == Deposition and comeback == Mamia's relations with Alexander's son and successor, Solomon I, was initially hostile. His involvement in an ultimately unsuccessful coup against Solomon in 1752 cost him the throne of Guria: Solomon returned with Ottoman support in 1756 and deposed Mamia in favor of his younger brother, Giorgi V Gurieli. Mamia fled to the mountains of Racha and eventually crossed into eastern Georgia to solicit support from the resurgent king Heraclius II of Kakheti. Through Heraclius's intercession, Mamia garnered favor with the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe and was restored in Guria in 1758. He reconciled with Solomon and took part in his struggle against the Ottoman encroachments and slave- trading. In 1765, the pasha of Akhaltsikhe overthrew Mamia and replaced him with his more amenable brother, Giorgi V Gurieli. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1767‚Äì1774, Solomon invaded Guria, defeated an Ottoman force marching from Batumi to Imereti, and restored Mamia in his principality. The relations between the two rulers quickly soured as Solomon sought to assert his supremacy in all of western Georgia. In 1775, he twice raided Guria. Mamia's brother and rival Giorgi exploited the instability and forced Mamia into retirement to a monastery. Mamia died in 1784 (or 1778 according to Cyril Toumanoff). == Family == Mamia was married twice, first to Rodam, Princess of Imereti, and then to a noblewoman Tavdgiridze. He had three children: * Princess Darejan (died 1813), married to Prince Mkheidze; * Prince Giorgi, who died very young; * Princess Tamar. == References == Category:1778 deaths Category:1784 deaths Category:House of Gurieli Category:18th-century people from Georgia (country) ","title":"Mamia IV Gurieli"},{"id":"54097680","text":"thumb Pirgel is a mud volcano in Iran, in the province Sistan and Balochistan close to the town of Khash. The mud volcano is accessible via a foot track. Mud volcanoes are landforms where water and gas are extruded from the ground. In southeastern Iran they occur in two places, one close to volcanoes such as Bazman and Taftan and are hot () effusions, the other is colder and linked to the extrusion of carbon dioxide and tectonic-sedimentary processes. Several theories have been proposed to explain cold mud volcanoes, one of which posits that water in clay is trapped and thus pressurized, causing the clay to liquefy and erupt on the surface along faults. Despite its location close to the two aforementioned volcanoes, Pirgel is considered to be a cold mud volcano, with temperatures of . Pirgel contains a main cone with an elevation of above sea level, and above the terrain. This makes it a relatively high mud volcano, the highest in Iran. There are eleven individual craters, of which seven are active, but they are all relatively small. The mud volcano covers an area of on a marl hill, also a relatively large size. Erosion from flowing water has affected both the surroundings as well as the mud volcano itself, forming gullies and ravines probably from the collapse of caverns. The mud volcano was reported active in May 2003, with the extrusion of cold muddy water and the eruption of bubbles every 15-600 seconds. This mud is relatively liquid and fairly saline. The gas extruded at Pirgel is principally carbon dioxide; unlike other mud volcanoes in the region methane is not a component. The mud volcano is considered to be a sacred place by local people, the site where a holy person manifests itself. == References == Category:Mud volcanoes Category:Geology of Iran Category:Mud volcanoes of Iran ","title":"Pirgel"},{"id":"54097688","text":"≈Ωan Celar (born 14 March 1999) is a Slovenian footballer who plays as a forward in Italy for Cremonese on loan from Roma. ==Club career== He made his Serie A debut for Roma on 11 March 2019 in a game against Empoli, as an 86th- minute substitute for Patrik Schick.

He was, however, continually employed, averaging from six to eleven films per year. A story in a 1933 issue of the Los Angeles-based African-American newspaper, California Eagle, stated that he \\"is reported to be the highest paid Negro actor in Hollywood\\".\\"John Larkin Is Highest Salaried Of Group In Movies, Writer Says / High Pay Man\\" (California Eagle / Associated Negro Press, 1933) {photograph included} ==Comedy and musical performer starting in 1898== Larkin first performed as a professional entertainer during the last years of the 19th century.

His wife left the show in 1901 and Larkin revised the act as Larkins & Patterson, with performing partner Dora Patterson with whom he starred, during 1902‚Äì03, in the musical A Trip to the Jungles, with the 1904 edition directed by W. C. Craine.John Larkin at the University of Kentucky Libraries' \\"Notable Kentucky African Americans Database\\" (mentioned under entry for performer/director W. C.

In 1919, about a year after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and, over the following ten years, Larkin took the group on a number of world tours which included performances in London and other European cities, China, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\\"Theatre Royal.

While in Australia, he established a relationship with costume designer Rachel \\"Rae\\" Anderson and they became the parents of two daughters, Olga, born in 1921 and Joan, born in 1924. Since interracial marriage was, at the time, illegal in Australia, Larkin ultimately returned to America.\\"The Tale of Jolly John\\" (Beneath Los Angeles, May 18, 2017) In 2019 through DNA matching, Larkin had also fathered a son Alan, in 1920 in Melbourne. ==Film career (1930‚Äì36)== In the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, acting companies struggled to survive and, while touring in Southern California during 1930, Larkin, now in his early fifties, was cast in his first film, Man to Man, released by Warner Bros on December 6, 1930. His stage name, appearing at the bottom of the cast list, was Johnny Larkins, but by the time of his second feature, MGM's The Prodigal, released the following February, the credited name, still billed at the bottom of the list, had been revised to \\"John Larkin\\", a form which would continue for the remaining five years of his life. Unlike his contemporaries, Stepin Fetchit, who was used primarily as comedy relief, or Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, whose scenes were mainly focused on singing and dancing, Larkin was given few opportunities to display his skills as singer, dancer or as a comedian and was employed for the most part as a character actor. Also, in contrast to the star billing he received during the years he was a theatrical headliner, his film credits usually placed him at the bottom of the cast list or omitted his name altogether. The extent, however, to which his name and reputation was valued in the entertainment industry may be judged by the article which appeared in a March 1933 issue of California Eagle in conjunction with the release of MGM's Gabriel Over the White House, one of the eight features in which Larkin had parts that year. Although his role as Sebastian, the president's valet was uncredited, the Eagle ran a story, \\"Hollywood Respects Larkin as Real Star of the Film\\", alongside a photograph with a caption, \\"High Pay Man\\", stating that he was earning a greater salary that any other black performer in film. Between 1931 and his death in March 1936, Larkin appeared in at least 45 films for nearly every studio in Hollywood which, in addition to Warners and MGM, included RKO (1931's Men of Chance, 1933's The Great Jasper), Paramount (1934's The Witching Hour), Universal (1935's A Notorious Gentleman) and Republic (1936's Frankie and Johnny). ==Death== John Larkin died in Los Angeles from a cerebral hemorrhage. The first of the 1936 productions in which he was featured, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, premiered on March 13, five days before his death, while four others ‚Äî The Great Ziegfeld, Frankie and Johnny (which was filmed in 1934), Hearts Divided and The Green Pastures ‚Äî were released posthumously. Larkin's tombstone is at Los Angeles' Evergreen Cemetery which, unlike most other cemeteries, permitted the burial of African Americans and includes graves of such performers as Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson, Louise Beavers and Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard, whose careers partially overlapped the period of Larkin's activity. The tombstone features a photograph of Larkin and the years 1882‚Äì1936, which would indicate his age as about 54 at the time of death. However, since programs indicate that he was performing with his wife as early as 1898, when he would have been 15 or 16, the year indicated by the Internet Movie Database appears to be the more likely one. Thus, his 58th birthday, four months before his death, would have been in November 1935. ==Filmography== * Man to Man (1930) as Bildad (film debut) * The Prodigal (1931) as Andrew Jackson Jones * Gold Dust Gertie (1931) as Black Waiter Aboard Yacht (uncredited) * Smart Money (1931) as Snake Eyes - Porter (uncredited) * Sporting Blood (1931) as Uncle Ben * Alexander Hamilton (1931) as Zekial * Men of Chance (1931) as Black Horse Handler (uncredited) * Emma (1932) as Train Station Porter (uncredited) * Union Depot (1932) as Porter with Ticket for Ruth (uncredited) * The Wet Parade (1932) as Moses * Lena Rivers (1932) as Lucifer 'Lucy' Jones * So Big (1932) as Jeff, the Black Waiter (uncredited) * The Tenderfoot (1932) as Depot Porter (uncredited) * Street of Women (1932) as Waiter with Food at Skyscraper (uncredited) * Love Is a Racket (1932) as Tod - Jimmy's Elevator Operator (uncredited) * Stranger in Town (1932) as Jed (uncredited) * Crooner (1932) as Men's Room Attendant (uncredited) * Washington Merry-Go-Round (1932) as Train Conductor with Telegram (uncredited) * Lawyer Man (1932) as Tony's Butler (uncredited) * The Great Jasper (1933) as Chippy (uncredited) * Gabriel Over the White House (1933) as Sebastian - Valet (uncredited) * Black Beauty (1933) as Eph * Bed of Roses (1933) as Black Man Meeting Released Prisoner (uncredited) * This Day and Age (1933) as Shoeshine Man (uncredited) * Stage Mother (1933) as The Porter (uncredited) * Ann Vickers (1933) as Black Trusty (uncredited) * Day of Reckoning (1933) as Abraham * Bedside (1934) as Train Porter (uncredited) * Lazy River (1934) as Negro at Jockey Club (uncredited) * The Witching Hour (1934) as Clarence - Brookfield's Butler (uncredited) * The Thin Man (1934) as Porter (uncredited) * Operator 13 (1934) as Slave Fishing for Codfish (uncredited) * Kentucky Kernels (1934) as Jackson - Wakefield's Servant (uncredited) * The Secret Bride (1934) as Janitor (uncredited) * A Notorious Gentleman (1935) as Joshua * Mississippi (1935) as Rumbo * So Red the Rose (1935) as Cato's Companion (uncredited) * Pursuit (1935) as Deacon (uncredited) * Diamond Jim (1935) as Butler (uncredited) * Broadway Hostess (1935) as Mose (uncredited) * The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936) as Ebony * The Great Ziegfeld (1936) as Sam (uncredited) * Frankie and Johnny (1936) as Andy * Hearts Divided (1936) as Isham * The Green Pastures (1936) as Sexton (final film, uncredited) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *as Johnny Larkins at American Film Institute Catalog *John Larkin at American Film Institute Catalog [credits combined with those of John Larkin (actor, born 1912) as well as with those of John Larkin (screenwriter)] *John Larkin at AllMovie (includes a biographical sketch with career overview) * * *\\"Jolly\\" John Larkin scrapbook, circa 1914-1932, at The Stuart A.

MacDonald was a Swedish-born American politician who served as Mayor of Beverly, Massachusetts and Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works. ==Early life== MacDonald was born in Stockholm on November 11, 1881. His father died several months before he was born and when he was three years old, he and his mother moved to the United States. They settled in Beverly, Massachusetts. He became a U.S. citizen when his mother was naturalized, but was not formally naturalized himself until 1920, which became an issue during his political career. MacDonald attended Beverly High School, Lynn Business College, and the Boston Y.M.C.A. Evening Law School. In 1910 he was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. ==Political career== From 1906 to 1910, MacDonald worked as a clerk and stenographer in office of governors Curtis Guild Jr. and Eben Sumner Draper. From 1911 to 1912 MacDonald represented the 20th Essex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During his tenure in the House, MacDonald guided a piece of railroad-related legislation known as the season ticket bill and a bill requesting the investigation of construction of a new bridge and dam between Salem and Beverly, through the Massachusetts General Court. He served on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Liquor Law. From 1913 to 1916, MacDonald was Mayor of Beverly. Taking office at the age of 32, he was the youngest person to hold the position. In January 1921, MacDonald was appointed secretary to governor Channing Cox. He later resigned to serve as recorder of the Massachusetts Land Court, but on January 1, 1925, he became secretary to governor Alvan T. Fuller. In 1928, former registrar of motor vehicles Frank A. Goodwin alleged that MacDonald ran the state while Governor Fuller was absent, which was \\"pretty much of all the time during the past four years\\". In December 1928, MacDonald was appointed Associate Commissioner of Public Works by Governor Fuller. His term of office expired on December 1, 1932, but remained in office until January 1934, when Democratic Governor Joseph Ely replaced him with Richard K. Hale. In 1934, MacDonald was a candidate for state treasurer. At the party convention, MacDonald finished in last place on the first ballot with 84 votes to Oscar M. Dionne's 279, Samuel H. Wragg's 170, and Richard E. Johnston's 99, and withdrew his candidacy. In 1935 he ran in the 2nd Essex District state senate special election following the death of Albert Pierce. He lost the Republican nomination to William H. McSweeney. In 1940, MacDonald was appointed Commissioner of Public Works by Governor Leverett Saltonstall. He was removed from the position in 1946 by Governor Maurice J. Tobin on the grounds that he had inefficiently managed the Federally-funded roads program. From 1947 to 1949, MacDonald served on the state Appellate Tax Board. ==Military service== In 1915, MacDonald took a leave of absence from his position as mayor to serve on the U.S.-Mexican Border as a second lieutenant with the 1st Massachusetts Field Artillery during the Border War. During World War I he served as a field artillery captain with the 26th Infantry \\"Yankee\\" Division in France. ==Personal life== On April 29, 1928, MacDonald married Marion S. Young of Boston at the Old South Church in Boston. On January 4, 1961, MacDonald died in Londonderry, New Hampshire. ==ReferencesNotes== :1.

She taught plant physiology at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Bamako from 1993-2000 before working with Winrock International from 2000 to 2004, the Polycentric Social Forum in Bamako from 2005 to 2006, the African Institute of Food and Sustainable Development from 2005 to 2009, the Unitarian Services of Canada from 2011 to 2013, the Forum for Another Mali, and the Ministry of National Reconciliation and Northern Development in 2013. She served as a technical advisor at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research before her appointment to Minister in 2016. == Early life and education == Ass√©tou Foun√® Samak√© Migan was born in 1960, in San, Mali. She went on to receive a doctorate in biological sciences at Kharkiv National University in the former USSR, specializing in plant genetics. She then received a certificate in agricultural biotechnology at Cheikh Anta Diop University‚Äôs UNESCO Biotechnology Laboratory in Dakar, Senegal. == Career == Migan taught plant physiology as well as supervised dissertations and teaching at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Bamako‚Äîa public higher education institution in Bamako, Mali‚Äîfrom 1993 to 2000. Then, from 2000 to 2004, she worked as a program assistant for Women of Agriculture and Environment at Winrock International, a nonprofit organization focused on American and international development with a mission to promote empowerment, economic stability, and sustainability,. Through her work there, Migan was involved with programming that prevented trafficking and child labor in the Sikasso region. From 2005 to 2006 , she was in charge of methodology at the Polycentric World Social Forum in Bamako, Mali, a yearly meeting of civil society organizations working toward a future free from hegemonic neoliberal globalization,. Then, Migan became Scientific Coordinator at the Institute of Research and Promotion of Alternatives in Development (IRPAD), a think tank promoting ‚Äòsocialized‚Äô multidisciplinary research, skill-building, and capacity-building actions to influence policy that she co-founded,. Through her work there from 2006 to 2009, she developed and coordinated programs and projects related to the institute's mission. In 2009, Migan became the program manager at the African Institute of Food and Sustainable Development. Soon after, she began working with the Unitarian Services of Canada, a non-profit international development organization devoted to fostering ecological agriculture. Specifically, the organization works toward enhancing resilience in Mali through community seed banks and farmer networks. Migan was then selected as the representative of the USC Canada in Mali, Senegal, and Burkina Faso‚Äîa position she held from May 2011 to July 2013. She entered Mali's Ministry of National Reconciliation and Northern Development in November 2013 as a technical advisor, contributing to the maintenance of peace in the nation after the Malian military coup in 2012 and the reinstatement of democratic governmental rule in 2013,. Specifically, she was responsible for the Northern Development Agency United Nations Platform for the Sahel, World Bank, UN Development Program, and provision of technical support to non-governmental organizations partaking in reconciliation activities. Over the course of her professional life, from 1997 until her appointment as Malian Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research in 2016, Migan was both a professor and researcher at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali. Beyond all of these positions, Migan is currently a consulting member of the Pedagogical Committee for Seed Continuing Education as well as a promoter of biotechnology in agriculture in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) area. She is also a principal researcher on the ‚ÄúImpact Assessment of Land Acquisition on Agriculture in West Africa,‚Äù a member of the Association Lecture au F√©minin, the Forum for Another Mali, the Regional Coordination of the Coalition for the Protection of African Genetic Heritage (COPAGEN), and the founder of the African Institute of Food and Sustainable Development. She has served as a consultant for the development of didactic tools for plant education at the Institute of Popular Education (IEP), the organization and animation of a training workshop for members of farmers‚Äô organizations on agricultural research and food sovereignty, the implementation of active pedagogy at the University of Bamako Faculty of Sciences for the Lead, Learn and Read (LLR) Program of the Flora Hewlett Association, and the development of didactic tools for the International Kungoso Environmental Education Camp. In the past, Migan was a member of the Board of Directors of the NGO GRAIN, the Steering Committee of the Democratic Inquiry Space (ECID) on Agricultural Research, the Scientific Committee of SEXAGON in the Office du Niger, and the Consumers Association of Mali. == Personal life == Migan is married and a mother to one child. She speaks Bamanan, French, Russian, and English. In her free time, she enjoys walking and reading. == Views on higher education and scientific research == As technical advisor to the former Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research Mountaga Tall, Migan presented on the theme of scientific research as a development factor at the International Conference Center of Bamako (CICB) on behalf of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita‚Äôs administration [MW1] [HM2] on December 28, 2015. Migan focused on the state of research and innovation in Mali, calling for policy to promote the growth of scientific research while acknowledging the obstacles facing researchers and the institutions that support them. Some of these obstacles included inadequate human resources, aging staff, overextended students, insufficient funding (specifically in the lack of a private sector to supply funding), budget cuts, and deficient governmental guidance. Her challenging of the government to commit to the advancement of this area‚Äîand, by extension, higher education‚Äîpaid off in that President Keita promoted her to Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research not long afterward. One of Migan‚Äôs main goals as Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research is the popularization of research through committed engagement with farmers‚Äô organizations in order to optimize yields by improving plants genetically. Migan maintains that ‚Äúscience [‚Ä¶] and technology have become, today, essential areas for socioeconomic development of nations,‚Äù allowing ‚Äúman to know himself as well as his physical and social environment‚Äîhis near and distant environment.‚Äù She aims to raise the level of Malian children engaged in science so that they are properly equipped to face the barriers to development, such as food security, sustainable use of raw materials, adequacy of living conditions, and growth of cities. Ultimately, she hopes that scientists will be enabled ‚Äúto meet the demands of an increasingly skill- hungry market in order to accelerate the transition to a developed, knowledge- based society.‚Äù == Controversy == In light of the two-month strike of the National Union of Higher Education and Scientific Research in 2017, Dr. Abdou Mall√©, Secretary General of Snesup, called for the dismissal of Ass√©tou Foun√® Samak√© Migan from her position as Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research on grounds of incompetence. All universities and colleges were closed because of this strike. Snesup maintained that Migan would not take responsibility and dismiss Ousmane Papa Kant√©, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Management (FSEG), who was accused of anti-pedagogical practices, including the selling of notes to students, unauthorized closing of classrooms, tampering with overtime, and replacing permanent teachers with acting teachers through the use of police force during said strike. Beyond this, the union also demanded an increase in the current grid ceiling, increasing the pay of teaching staff and researchers given that Malians make 1,210 FCFA as compared to their colleagues in Niger (2,750 FCFA), Senegal (4,064 FCFA), and Burkina Faso (3,380 FCFA). Dr. Mall√© claimed that only the dismissal of Minister Migan could keep the academic year from becoming a wash. Ultimately, Migan called for the suspension of Dean Ousmane Papa Kant√© on June 15, 2017, thereby appeasing Snesup. == Positions held ==  Professional  * Professor/researcher at the University of Bamako / University of Sciences, Technologies and Techniques of Bamako (1997‚Äìpresent) * Professor at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Bamako (1993-2000) * Migan provided courses in plant physiology, supervised dissertations and teaching courses * Program Assistant for Women of Agriculture and Environment at Winrock International (2000-2004) * Migan assisted with program preventing trafficking and child labor in Sikasso region * Polycentric Social Forum of Bamako (2005-2006) * Migan was responsible for methodology * Program Manager at African Institute of Food and Sustainable Development (IAD) (2005-2006) * Scientific Coordinator at Institute of Research and Promotion of Alternatives in Development (IRPAD) (2006-2009) * Migan developed and coordinated programs, projects connected to institute's mission * Representative of Mali, Senegal, and Burkina Faso for Unitarian Services of Canada (USC Canada) (May 2011-July 2013) * Technical Advisor for Ministry of National Reconciliation and Development of Northern Regions (November 2013-June 2014) * Migan's responsibilities included: oversight of Northern Development Agency (AND), United Nations Platform for the Sahel, World Bank/UNDP, technical support to NGOs involved in reconciliation activities  Community Life  * Co founder of the Institute for Research and Promotion of Alternatives in Development (IRPAD) in Mali * Member of the Association Lecture au F√©minin * Member of the Forum for Another Mali (FORAM) * Member of the Regional Coordination of the Coalition for the Protection of African Genetic Heritage (COPAGEN) in Abidjan, Ivory Coast (2004 to the present) * Former Member of the Board of Directors of the NGO GRAIN in Barcelona Spain * Founder of the African Institute of Food and Sustainable Development (IAD) * Former Member of the Steering Committee of the Democratic Inquiry Space (ECID) on Agricultural Research (K√©n√© Conseil / Mali) * Former member of the Scientific Committee of SEXAGON in the Office du Niger * Former member of the Consumers Association of Mali (ASCOMA)  Consultations  * Senior Researcher on \\"Impact Assessment of Land Acquisition on Agriculture in West Africa * Consultant and member of the Pedagogical Committee for Seed Continuing Education and the holistic foundation of biotechnology in agriculture in UEMOA, Benin (2007-2011) * Consultant on Critical Analysis of USC Canada Programs in Mali * Consultant for the development of didactic tools for plant education in the bilingual pilot school of the Institute of Popular Education (IEP), Kati, Mali (2008) * Consultant for the organization and animation of the training workshop of the members of farmers' organizations on agricultural research and food sovereignty in Mali (Kenya Council, Mali, 2009) * Consultant for the evaluation of the USC Canada Program in Douentza, Mali (USC Canada 2009-2010) * Consultant for the implementation of active pedagogy at the University of Bamako, Faculty of Sciences (Apprenticeship Service) for the Lead, Learn and Read (LLR) program of the Flora Hewlett Foundation, IEP of Kati (2009-2010) * Consultant for the development of didactic tools for the living plant collection and photographs of International Kungoso Environmental Education Camp (Kungoso International Camp, Mali) == See also == * Politics of Mali ==References== Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of Mali Category:Malian women in politics Category:1960 births ","title":"Assetou Foune Samake Migan"},{"id":"54097968","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 season will be Bradford City's 115th season in their history, in the Football League and in the English football league system.

It is known from one skeleton collected in the Andes of Venezuela, and is closely related to Ahytherium. == History of discovery == The holotype (and so far only known) specimen was found in a cave called Cueva de los Huesos (meaning \\"Bone Cave\\") on Cerro Pintado, a mountain found in the Serran√≠a del Perij√° range of the Andes, in the extreme northernmost part of the Sierra de Perij√° National Park on the border between Venezuela and Colombia at an altitude of . The various known pieces of the skeleton were recovered in two expeditions to the cave in 1993 and 1997. The specimen was found in a scattered condition, with some bones being damaged, notably the skull was missing the left Squamosal bone. The specimen is currently known from the aforementioned skull, both a right and left humerus, a left ulna, two thoracic vertebrae, a complete rib and three rib fragments. There is apparently more of the specimen left in-situ in the cave. The age of the specimen was found to be approximately 17,300 Cal BP == Distribution and habitat == The specimen is approximately 17,000 years old, this would put the specimen just after the retreat of the glaciers after the Last Glacial Maximum, which could indicate a cold climate. However, the specimen is associated with fossils of Neochoerus (an extinct capybara) Mazama (brocket deer) and Tayassu (peccary), which could indicate a warmer, perhaps savanna- like climate. == References == Category:Prehistoric sloths Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Pleistocene xenarthrans Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Lujanian Category:Pleistocene Venezuela Category:Fossils of Venezuela Category:Fossil taxa described in 2013 ","title":"Megistonyx"},{"id":"54098131","text":"Harrison Goddard (born 8 April 1998) is an Australian professional rugby union player of Aboriginal descent who plays for the Melbourne Rebels in Super Rugby.

Gordon studied at Juilliard School and played with Buddy Johnson and Ray Draper in the 1950s. He worked with Lionel Hampton in 1961-1962 and with Lloyd Price and Sam Rivers later in the 1960s. In the 1970s he played with Charles Tolliver, Clark Terry, Count Basie, Howard McGhee, and Frank Foster, as well as with Hampton again; he continued working with Hampton until 1989. He also led his own ensembles in the late 1970s, with sidemen including Tolliver, Roland Alexander, Lisle Atkinson, Stanley Cowell, and Andrew Cyrille. After leaving Hampton, Gordon played in Al Grey's ensemble, Trombone Summit, and founded a group called Trombones Incorporated with Fred Joiner. When Joiner left the group in the early 1990s, Gordon became its leader and changed its name to Trombones Unlimited. In the 1990s he also played with Slide Hampton, Josh Roseman, Lafayette Harris, Martin Winder, Curtis Fuller, and Thilo Berg. Gordon worked for several decades as a session musician for recordings and has also performed in pit orchestras for Broadway musicals. ==References== *Gary W. Kennedy, \\"John Gordon\\".

She was born in 1954 in Los Angeles, the daughter of a ceramist.http://lynettehaggard.blogspot.fr/2011/07/tracey-adams-monterey- california.html Her artworks reflect a strong interest in musical patterns, rhythms, lyrical compositional elements and what she calls a sense of performance. She lives and works in Carmel, California. == Education == Adams earned her BA from Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles in 1978. She studied printmaking and painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston from 1979 to 1981, and earned her master's degree from the New England Conservatory of Music in 1980. == Awards == Adams has received several fellowships and grants, including the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant in 2015, a grant from the US Department of State and the Ministry of Culture, and a Vermont Studio Center Fellowship. == Technique == Adams works on panel and paper, using a mixture of paint, encaustic and graphite as well as elements of monotype and collage. Planning and intuition equally inform her process. Often, she will begin a work or a series from the perspective of an exact mathematical formula, planning compositional elements in advance. Other times she will begin with a grid structure then work within that structure, incorporating organic, performative gestures and expressive brushwork. Regardless of where a particular work begins, Adams engages in an open, exploratory process that allows the work to evolve. Often the finished result is a mixture of her original idea and her instinct, creating a composition that captures the essence of the harmony of mind and emotion. == Exhibitions == Adams has exhibited extensively in solo and group shows throughout the United States and in Europe, including the Andy Warhol Museum in Medzilaborce, Slovak Republic. == Collections == Work by Adams is part of the permanent collections of several museums, including the Bakersfield Museum of Art the Monterey Museum of Art, the Fresno Art Museum, the Tucson Museum of Art, and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. Her work is also part of multiple corporate collections, including those of Adobe Systems, AT&T; Corporate Headquarters, Hallmark Corporate Headquarters, Sony Corporation, Albemarle Corporation, and Intel. == References  External links == * Tracey Adams Art Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American painters Category:People from Los Angeles Category:School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts alumni Category:New England Conservatory alumni ","title":"Tracey Adams (painter)"},{"id":"54098285","text":"The smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) is a species of non-venomous snake found in northern and central Europe.

The center was the first LSD-based meditation center in Manhattan.Santa Cruz Sentinel. \\"Remembrances\\", 02 January, 2000 She also worked closely with Jean Houston, Abraham Maslow, Stanley Krippner, and Alan Watts. ==Early life== Born Jewish in Vienna, Austria in 1918 as Gusti Schreyer, she fled the Nazis in the late 1930s and lived/worked as a refugee in London, England. While in Antwerp, Belgium on an extended visit, she married Jewish scarfmaker and Kishinev refugee Michel Graboi (whose father had been killed in the pogroms). Many European Jews who sought a safe haven from Nazi persecution, including the Grabois, had difficulty with the United States' restrictive immigration quotas and the complicated, demanding requirements for obtaining visas.Holocaust Encyclopedia. \\"Immigration to the United States 1933‚Äì1941\\", United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In an attempt to immigrate to America after finally obtaining a visa, the Grabois fled to France and set sail on the Wyoming freighter.

Nina Graboi's sister-in-law was artist Greta Schreyer (n√©e Loebl). ==Pre-psychedelic background== Dissatisfied with her life in Long Island as a society hostess, in the 1950s Graboi plunged into the study of esoteric subjects and became an avid practitioner of meditation, while also running a successful theater group. As she learned about comparative religions, she became more interested in Buddhism and Hinduism. Her private studies continued through the early 1960s.Luker, Kelly. ‚ÄúHigh on life, four Santa Cruz women drink deeply from the barrel of experience\\", MetroActive, 10 December 1998 After learning about Walter Pahnke's 1962 \\"Good Friday Experiment,\\" in which theology students were given psilocybin as part of psychedelic research at Harvard University under the supervision of Leary and Alpert, Graboi longed to experience what the divinity students had experienced. She realized there was more to these drugs than the media had let people know, and it was the first time she had heard of an experiment with exceptional states of consciousness. In early 1965, Graboi went to a seminar given by a Tibetan Buddhist teacher, and joined a weekly spiritual group led by Virginia Glenn with participants Stanley Krippner, Jean Houston, and Ida Rolf. Glenn helped birth the Human Potential Movement.Kent State University Libraries. ‚ÄúVirginia Glenn Papers: 1950-1970\\", Kent State University, 17 September 2002 In early 1966 Graboi's translation of Jacques Audiberti's anti- war play Les Patients was used in an Off-Broadway production directed by Eugene Lion. With Lion's encouragement Graboi founded The Third Force Lecture Bureau, which promoted and presented speakers in New York City ‚Äì her clients included Alan Watts, Ira Progoff, USCO, Yoko Ono, Charles Tart, Paul Krassner, and Peter Stafford. Glenn introduced Graboi to Timothy Leary and Larry Bogart at one of Leary's press conferences, a few months after Leary (by this point a former lecturer at Harvard University in Clinical Psychology), had been arrested in December 1965 for possession of marijuana.Harvard Crimson. ‚ÄúLeary Arrested On Drug Charge\\", Harvard Crimson, 3 January 1966 Bogart was doing public relations for Leary, and through Bogart's suggestion Graboi rented an office across from his at United Nations Plaza.

She and Leary had developed a close friendship in 1966 after Graboi gave him her paper Evolution in Search of a New Breed of Man. Graboi frequently spent time at Millbrook with a group gathered around Leary and Richard Alpert (later Ram Dass) to study the mind-expanding effects of LSD. Her first trip there was at the Meditation House. Graboi also became involved with the Bay Area counterculture. While visiting Alan Watts on his Sausalito houseboat in 1966 with Virginia Glenn, during a week-long LSD conference in San Francisco, Graboi took marijuana in the company of Watts.Lee, Paul A. ‚ÄúSanta Cruz in the ‚Äô60‚Äôs\\", The Hip Santa Cruz Oral History Project She and Watts were taken to a party in Marin by Paul Lee. Lee - one of the founding editors of the Psychedelic Review along with Leary - spoke about the party at the conference in a talk titled \\"Psychedelic Style.\\" The Grateful Dead had thrown the party, with Owsley Stanley handing out his acid to anyone who wanted it. At the time, Lee was also an assistant professor of philosophy at University of California, Santa Cruz. Later that year, in October 1966, LSD use became illegal in California.Jarnow, Jesse. ‚ÄúLSD Now: How the Psychedelic Renaissance Changed Acid\\", Rolling Stone, 06 October, 2016 Leary announced the Millbrook community had incorporated as a religious group named The League for Spiritual Discovery. The League for Spiritual Discovery was incorporated by Leary as a religious organization in New York State. Although the Millbrook group viewed psychedelics as a primary key to the mystical experience, they continued to search for non-drug ways to reach it. Graboi co-founded the Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery in Greenwich Village with Leary in 1966, and became its director after Leary asked Graboi to head it. Graboi accepted the position as director to disseminate information about the use and misuse of psychedelics, in order to minimize their ill effects. Leary and Alpert gave free weekly talks at the center in 1967. The nonprofit organization, influenced by Leary's writings, operated to help and educate people engaged in exploring the potential of psychedelic consciousness. Around end of 1967/early 1968, the League for Spiritual Discovery was closed down after Leary left Millbrook, and the New York Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery was abandoned shortly after Graboi left her position as director. In 1968 LSD was added to the list of Schedule 1 substances, which made it illegal to possess, manufacture, or use for any purpose in the United States.Johnson, Lyndon B. \\"Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relating to Traffic in or Possession of Drugs Such as LSD\\", 25 October 1968.

In 1969 Graboi moved to Woodstock, a few months before the Woodstock festival, and opened a boutique where she sold her crafts. She founded the Woodstock Transformation Center, and taught New Age-related classes. Graboi moved to Santa Cruz, California in 1979, where she worked for University of California, Santa Cruz mathematics professor Ralph Abraham. She also gave talks in Santa Cruz and at conferences on the relationship between the psychedelic experience and the spiritual quest. She wrote her autobiography, One Foot in the Future, in 1991. Terence McKenna described it as \\"an extraordinary tale of humor and hope.\\"Erowid, Fire ‚ÄúOne Foot in the Future: Blurbs\\", The Vaults of Erowid Graboi died at age 81 from lung cancer.

Ultimately, I hope, all religious dogma will be replaced by direct, personal experience...

As the war ended he turned to politics and journalism. In 1947/48 he briefly (and divisively) served as national secretary of the Italian Liberal Party. == Life == He was born in Rome. His father, Alfonso Lucifero was from Crotone in the south and served between 1886 and 1919 as a member of parliament. After the Badoglio Proclamation of 8 September 1943, Roberto Lucifero d'Aprigliano participated in the Roman resistance against the city's occupation by German forces, as a member of an underground monarchist group. In April 1944 he was captured by German Nazi paramilitaries and imprisoned in the Regina Coeli, from where he was released on 4 June 1944 as allied forces liberated Rome from the German occupation. A few days later he participated in the formation of the short- lived Italian Democratic Party (Partito Democratico Italiano, PDI), created through the merger of the \\"Centro della Democrazia Italiana\\", the \\"Partito di unione\\" and the \\"Partito socialdemocratico\\". As a member of the PDI party executive, he took on responsibility for contributing to the daily news publication \\"monarchico Italia nuova\\", from the pages of which he attacked the antifascist measures of the Bonomi government and the \\"dictatorship\\" of the National Liberation Committee (\\"Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale\\" / CLN). On 12 September 1944 he had a meeting with the Foreign Minister and CDU leader, De Gasperi, whom he urged to break the CLN coalition alliance with the Communists (something which in May 1947 De Gasperi would indeed do). Lucifero d'Aprigliano used \\"monarchico Italia nuova\\" to promote his opposition to the very broad political coalition underpinning the CLN, which was at variance with the mood of the times. He was known as a strong supporter of the monarchy. Sources suggest that at a time when the future of the monarchy was being questioned, the king and his family were themselves embarrassed by the support of Lucifero d'Aprigliano's \\"Italia nuova\\" movement at a time when the royal family were making a determined push to move away from the Mussolini years, towards a more democratically focused monarchy. In September 1945 he was appointed to the National Consultative Body (\\"Consulta Nazionale\\"), and on 2 June 1946 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Italy as a member of the National Bloc of Freedom coalition. On 2 June 1946 a referendum was held on the future of the monarchy. The result was clear, but by no means overwhelming, support for a republican future. Lucifero d'Aprigliano was among those who urged the king to stand firm in resisting the referendum result. Not for the first time, however, he found the tide of history was moving against him. In the Constituent Assembly Lucifero d'Aprigliano intervened on matters such as the \\"right to strike\\", regional autonomy, church-state relations, the preservation of public morality and the use by the old aristocracy of their titles. He was also prominent in discussions concerning the rights and properties of the House of Savoy. He spoke in a plenary session of the assembly on 4 March 1947 to oppose the expressly antifascist sense of the new constitution, contending that the constitution should make no reference whatever to fascism \\"neither in positive nor in negative terms\\". His preferred formulation involved a preamble to the main text of the constitution along the following lines: :\\"The Italian people, invoking God's help, freely exercising their sovereignty, have been granted this fundamental law. through which The State is constituted\\". :\\"Il popolo italiano, invocando l'assistenza di Dio, nel libero esercizio della propria sovranit√† si √® data la presente legge fondamentale, mediante la quale si costituisce e si ordina in Stato\\" On 3 December 1947 Lucifero d'Aprigliano presented a constitutional motion to the assembly designed to preserve a united front among the various right wing parties. The motion passed, albeit narrowly, by 381 votes against 373. The lead he had taken led to Lucifero d'Aprigliano being elected national secretary of the Italian Liberal Party (\\"Partito Liberale Italiano\\" / PLI). However, he failed to achieve his objective of consolidating a permanent alliance of right wing political parties. His continuing fervent monarchism remained out of tune with the political mainstream and his incumbency as party secretary turned out to be brief, lasting from December 1947 till October 1948. At first he lobbied colleagues to reinstate him, but after the fifth party congress in July 1949 he found himself increasingly marginalised within the PLI, and during 1950 he resigned from it. At the General Election of 7 June 1953 Lucifero d'Aprigliano stood for election to parliament as a candidate from the Monarchist National Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Monarchico\\" / PNM)). He was successful, representing the Reggio Calabria electoral district, and was re-elected in 1958. ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Politicians from Rome Category:Italian Liberal Party politicians Category:Monarchist National Party politicians Category:Members of the Consulta Nazionale Category:Members of the Constituent Assembly of Italy Category:Senators of Legislature I of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature II of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature III of Italy Category:20th- century Italian lawyers Category:20th-century Italian journalists Category:Italian male journalists Category:Italian resistance members ","title":"Roberto Lucifero d'Aprigliano"},{"id":"54098566","text":"Ahidus (), also sometimes called ahidous, haidous, tahidoust or hidoussi, is a style of collective performance in Morocco.

The initial formation of the dance was done by making a closed circle which indicated the unity between the performers in particular and the inhabitants of the tribe in general. The leader of the dance would stand in the middle and lead the group. An important aspect of Ahidus which did not change through the years is the traditional uniform.

Bayside United FC built upon these beginnings after its establishment in 1974, expanding the club so that it was able to join the mainstream Brisbane soccer competitions. For its first ten years, Bayside United played at Cox Park in Richard Street, Lota. The club moved to its current home at Don Randall Oval, Lota in 1984. Bayside United‚Äôs first recorded season at senior level was in 1977 when the club finished second and achieved promotion from Brisbane‚Äôs Division Six. The club rose through the divisions to Division Two in 1983, but was relegated after a single season. By 1989, the club was back in Division Six, but won its first premiership the following season, achieving 16 wins from 20 matches. Since 1990 Bayside United has slowly risen through the divisions, being relegated just once in 1999. Between 2003 and 2007, Bayside United spent five seasons in Metro League Division One, the fourth tier of Brisbane football. The club lost grand finals against Souths United in both 2005 and 2007, and finished second in 2006 but were suspended from the finals series. Bayside United won Metro League Division One in 2007 with 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses from 20 games and were promoted to Premier Division Two. Five seasons in Premier Division Two culminated in winning the minor premiership and promotion in 2012, which coach Ben Ryan said achieved the club‚Äôs priority for the season. The club was still disappointed to lose another grand final, this time in a penalty shoot-out to Annerley. The club‚Äôs Premier Division Two reserves team did win the double in 2012, winning the premiership, and the grand final 3-1 against Holland Park Hawks FC . In 2013, the club finished runners-up in Capital League 1 to the undefeated Mitchelton team, and in a normal season would have been promoted to the Brisbane Premier League, however there was no promotion for this season only, and Bayside United missed the chance to play in the top flight of Brisbane football for the first time. In 2014, Bayside United finished third and lost another grand final on penalties, this time to Taringa Rovers . Bayside United remain in Capital League 1 after they finished 10th in 2015 and avoided relegation by five points, and then achieved a mid-table finish in 2016.

There is a rosette of leaves at the base of the flowering stem and up to fifteen pale green flowers which have a sensitive labellum. Labelled image of P. mutica ==Description== Pterostylis mutica, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. There is a rosette of between six and twelve, egg-shaped leaves, each leaf long and wide at the base of the plant. Between two and twenty well-spaced flowers are borne on a flowering spike high with five to ten stem leaves wrapped around it. The flowers are pale green, long and about wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column. The galea is curved with a pointed tip turning downwards. The lateral sepals turn downwards and are about long, wide, cupped and joined for most of their length. The labellum is about long, about wide and whitish-green with a dark green appendage. Flowering occurs from July to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis mutica was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen collected near Port Jackson and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (mutica) is a Latin word meaning \\"shortened\\" or \\"docked\\" referring to the blunt petals and sepals. ==Distribution and habitat== Pterostylis mutica is widespread and often common, growing in a wide range of habitats from near the coast to mountains, but usually in well-drained soil. It tolerates dry conditions, poor soil and exposed positions. It is widespread in New South Wales and Victoria and also occurs in south-east Queensland, south-eastern South Australia and the south-west of Western Australia. There is doubt about its presence in Tasmania ==Ecology== The labellum of P. mutica is attractive to a species of gnat which lands on the labellum and grasps the dark green appendage. When it does so, the labellum springs upward, trapping the insect inside the now- closed flower. The gnat can now only escape by pushing between \\"wings\\" on the sides of the column. As it does so, it either removes a pollinium or deposits one from a previously-visited flower of the same species, and pollination occurs. ==References== mutica Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1810 ","title":"Pterostylis mutica"},{"id":"54098757","text":"Mohamed El Moctar is a Malian politician.

There, Judah Maccabee and his handful of fighters fought their first heroic battle against the legions of the Greek Empire. Following America's declaring that they would move their embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as capital of the State of Israel, Kidron was asked to prepare a meaningful work of art that would express the State of Israel's gratitude to the American Government.

Belgrade City Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments ==Architecture== The house was built around 1884 for Milan Piroƒáanac, presumably by architect –à–ævan Ilkiƒá, as a typical example of the representative urban architecture of the time. For the building of his house, Piroƒáanac spent the money he got by selling the property for 4,000 ducats, as he told his friend Milan Miliƒáeviƒá, and in addition, he borrowed 75,000 francs from Lender Bank. Representative effect of the house project in accordance with then prevailing academicism with neo-Renaissance elements in the fa√ßade, conceived as a free-standing villa, is achieved through the symmetrical composition of the base and rich decorative exterior. In 1934, was carried out by adding the mansard. The special value of the facade which is plastered was achieved by the decorative frieze set over a wide area between the windows on the first floor, developed in graphite which was destroyed during repair. The overall impression of the grandeur of the interior is complemented by the gypsum plastics of the ceiling and walls, wrought iron balustrades and furniture parts of high levels of craftsmanship. In the house, a significant part of the political and social life of Belgrade and Serbia in the late 19th century took place.

On March 30, 2017, Katie Walsh, formerly White House Deputy Chief of Staff, left that position to join America First Policies. The organization has courted controversy, as one of its directors was forced to resign due to racist and inflammatory comments and another adviser was caught proclaiming support for the Nazis on video. ==History== America First Policies was founded by several people, including Nick Ayers, a Republican consultant who is regarded as Mike Pence's top political adviser, Rick Gates and Brad Parscale. America First Policies and its affiliated super PAC, America First Action, have faced criticism for their high turnover of GOP givers. Trump Presidential Campaign donor Rebekah Mercer disagreed with Parscale about the direction of America First Policies. According to investigative journalist Vicky Ward, Mercer wanted America First Policies' data engine to be Cambridge Analytica, which would have effectively given her organizational control and potentially influence over the Republican Party. If Mercer had control over the organization's database and the money, Mercer could have led the organization to sway President's supporters against the President. Parscale aggressively sought to establish himself as leader of the group and commented in an early meeting that although he meant \\"no disrespect\\" to the Mercer family, the focus of America First Policies ought to be on Donald Trump and his political movement, rather than on the Mercers. ==America First Action Super PAC== In the 2016 and 2018 elections, four Trump-related Super PACs received donations from 38 people who gave over $500,000 each. To consolidate these efforts, America First Action was created for 2020. It is the only Trump-related group permitted to collect unlimited donations in 2020. However, as of August 2020, only six of the previous 38 top donors contributed to America First. The legally separate America First Action (as opposed to \\"Policies\\") Super PAC serves a similar function of promoting Trump‚Äôs policies under the \\"America First\\" theme, but due to its legal status may expressly advocate for the election or defeat of particular candidates (rather than only advocating for policies), and must disclose its donors. Both organizations have overlapping personnel (such as the chair, president, and communications director). In the 2018 midterm election cycle, the Super PAC spent $29 million. As of the end of March 2020, it had reported spending $9 million during the 2020 election cycle. ==Donors== It was reported in May 2018 that CVS Health, Dow Chemical, and Southern Company had donated a combined $1.6 million to America First Policies. == Targeted campaigns == On June 23, 2017, Republican Senator Dean Heller was targeted with an advertising campaign over his opposition to the Obamacare repeal bill. Heller was considered to be vulnerable in the 2018 election, and ultimately lost to Democratic challenger Jackie Rosen.https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/results/nevada == Racism, anti- Semitism and bigotry == America First Policies' Director for Advocacy, Carl Higbie was forced to resign as head of Corporation for National and Community Service (an organization which runs AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, Senior Corps, and other national service initiatives) to which he had been appointed by Donald Trump, after making racist and inflammatory comments on a radio talk show about black Americans, Muslims, women, LGBT people, veterans suffering from PTSD and immigrants, which included advocating violence. Higbie also pushed the false Birther conspiracy about Barack Obama. In a 2018 tweet, Higbie apologized for his comments. On May 10, 2018, it became public that the group's policy advisor, Juan Pablo Andrade, was a Nazi sympathizer, after he was recorded on a Snapchat video saying that \\"the only thing the Nazis didn't get right was that they didn't keep fucking going.\\" Andrade has been on Trump‚Äôs National Hispanic Advisory Council, Trump‚Äôs National Diversity Coalition and the Trump campaign as a surrogate. He also wrote for The Hill, but the outlet dropped him when it learned of the video and its contents. Later that month, it was reported that John Loudon, a policy advisor for the group, used inflammatory and derogatory language against women, Muslims and Democrats. He suggested that Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim. In May 2018, CVS Health and Dow Chemical announced that they would not contribute more money to America First Policies, citing racist and bigoted comments by the staff at America First Policies. This announcement followed a report stating that three Fortune 500 companies, including CVS Health and Dow Chemical, had contributed to America First Policies. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * https://www.facebook.com/carlhigbiepublic/ Category:Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign Category:501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations Category:Conservative political advocacy groups in the United States ","title":"America First Policies"},{"id":"54098823","text":"Mohamed Ag Erlaf is a Malian politician.

Depending on the nature of the substance, the duration of exposure and other factors it can lead to varying degrees of damage to the oral mucosa, the esophagus, and the lining of the stomach. The severity of the injury can be determined by endoscopy of the upper digestive tract, although CT scanning may be more useful to determine whether surgery may be required. During the healing process, strictures of the oesophagus may form, which may require therapeutic dilatation and insertion of a stent. ==Signs and symptoms== Immediate manifestations of caustic substance ingestions include erosions of mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract or airway (which can cause bleeding if the erosions extend to a blood vessel), mouth and tongue swelling, drooling or hypersalivation, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea. dysphona/aphonia irritation of the eyes and skin. Perforation of the esophagus can lead to mediastinitis or perforation of the stomach or bowel can lead to peritonitis Swelling of the airway or laryngospasm can occur leading to compromised breathing. Injuries affecting the respiratory system include aspiration pneumonia and laryngeal sores. Signs of respiratory compromise include stridor and a change in a person's voice. Later manifestations of caustic substance ingestions include esophageal strictures or stenosis; which can result in chronic pain and malnutrition. Esophageal strictures more commonly occur after more severe mucosal injury, occurring in to 71% and 100% of grade 2b and 3 mucosal lesions respectively. Remote manifestations of caustic ingestions include esophageal cancer. People who have a history of caustic substance ingestion are 1000-3000 times more likely to develop esophageal cancer with most cases occurring 10-30 years after the ingestion. ==Classification== The severity of injuries to the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract is commonly rated using the Zargar criteria. {  ! Category ! Findings -  0  Normal examination -  1  Mucosal edema and erythema -  2a  Superficial ulcerations or erosions, friability, blister formation, exudates, hemorrhages -  2b  Deep ulcerations (either discrete or circumferential) as well as the findings described in 2a -  3a  Multiple small, scattered areas of necrosis -  3b  Extensive necrosis } ==Pathophysiology== Acids with a pH of less than 2 or alkalis with a pH above 12 are capable of causing the most extensive injuries in ingestions. Alkalis damage tissue by saponifying fats, leading to liquefaction necrosis which allows the alkalis to reach deeper tissues. Acids denature proteins via coagulation necrosis, this type of necrosis is thought to prevent the acid from reaching deeper tissues. Clinically, the pH, concentration, volume of ingested substance in addition to the duration of time in contact with tissue as well as percentage of body surface area involved determine the severity of the injury. ==Treatment== Common treatments used for toxic substance ingestions are ineffective, or are even harmful, when implemented in ingestions of caustic substances. Clinical attempts to empty the stomach can cause further injuries. Activated charcoal does not neutralize caustics and can also obscure endoscopic visualization. There is no known clinical benefit of neutralization of the caustic substances; neutralization releases heat as well as causing gaseous distention and vomiting, all of which can worsen injuries. Signs of airway compromise including decreased level of consciousness, stridor, change in voice, inability to control oral secretions necessitate intubation and mechanical ventillation. IV fluids are often needed to maintain hydration and replace insensible water losses. Endoscopy should be done within the first 24-48 hours of ingestion as subsequent wound softening increases the risk of perforation. Endoscopically inserted nasogastric tubes can serve as a stent to prevent esophageal strictures as well as allow tube feedings. A CT scan, often enchanced with contrast, can also be used to evaluate injuries. The most common surgical methods of treatment in children include esophageal dilation and esophageal replacement as less commonly implantation of an esophageal stent. ==Epidemiology== In general, most ingestions in children involve exploratory ingestions of small amounts of caustic substances, with the rare exception being cases of child abuse where larger amounts are often ingested. Caustic ingestions in adults usually involve larger amounts of ingested material during attempts of self harm. Due to the greater amount of material usually ingested; injuries are often more severe in the intentional ingestions of adolescents and adults as compared to those of children. Commonly ingested substances include ammonium hydroxide (found in general cleaner and grease remover), sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide (found in drain opener or oven cleaner), sodium hypochlorite (bleach), oxalic acid (metal polish) and hydrochloric acid (toilet bowl cleaner).

Miller is an American endocrinologist and professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Miller is expert in the field of human steroid biosynthesis and disorders of steroid metabolism. Over the past 40 years Miller's group at UCSF has described molecular basis of several metabolic disorders including, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pseudo vitamin D dependent rickets, severe, recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 17,20 lyase deficiency caused by CYP17A1 defects, P450scc deficiency caused by CYP11A1 defects, P450 oxidoreductase (Cytochrome P450 reductase) deficiency (also referred as Antley-Bixler syndrome). Miller has published more than 420 research papers, reviews and book chapters in endocrinology, biochemistry and metabolism. Miller‚Äôs reviews on the molecular biology of steroid hormone synthesis are among the most widely cited papers in the field. ==Biography== Research * Miller first achieved international prominence in 1980 for cloning bovine growth hormone and prolactin. This has permitted an increase in milk production worldwide. * Beginning in 1983, Miller focused on human steroid hormone production and regulation in health and disease. He systematically studied and cloned many genes for enzymes involved in steroid metabolism. Most notable were CYP11A1 (also known as P450scc), which is the initial, rate-limiting enzyme in steroid hormone production from cholesterol and CYP17A1 (also known as P450c17), which catalyzes two distinct enzyme activities, 17-hydroxylase activity which is required for cortisol production and the 17,20 lyase activity, which is required for sex steroid biosynthesis. His laboratory then identified the first mutations that caused isolated 17,20 lyase deficiency. His laboratory also showed that there is post-translational regulation of 17,20 lyase activity by serine phosphorylation and by cytochrome b5, that regulate sex steroid biosynthesis. * In studies of the common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Miller‚Äôs group discovered the gene for Tenascin-X, overlapping the CYP21A2 gene. They then discovered a contiguous gene syndrome from a deletion encompassing both CYP21A2 and TNX, causing CAH and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). This led to the full description of TNX deficiency as the cause of severe, recessive EDS. * To enter mitochondria, where the P450scc enzyme resides, cholesterol requires the action of a protein called StAR, (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), which was first cloned from mice by Dr. Douglas Stocco. Miller's laboratory established the biological role of StAR by identifying human mutations in StAR gene that caused congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia. They then showed that StAR acts exclusively on the outer mitochondrial membrane in a ‚Äòmolten globule‚Äô configuration. * In collaboration with AA Portale, Miller‚Äôs group was first to clone the vitamin D 1Œ±-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which is the regulated step in the bioactivation of vitamin D and showed that its mutation causes the genetic form of rickets variously called ‚Äòvitamin D-dependent rickets‚Äô or ‚Äòpseudo vitamin D-deficient rickets. * In 2004 Miller's laboratory identified the first mutations in human Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase (POR), thus describing a new form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In a large follow-up study they showed that both POR deficiency and activating mutations of FGFR3 can cause the skeletal malformation syndrome known as Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), and that not all patients with POR deficiency have ABS. * Most recently along with his collaborators in Switzerland, Miller described a novel disorder of fetal androgen synthesis involving aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C2 and AKR1C4), showing that both the conventional and alternative (\\"backdoor\\") pathways of androgen synthesis are needed for normal male fetal development. * In addition to scientific work, Miller has led opposition to the prenatal use of dexamethasone in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and has co-authored the clinical practice guidelines for CAH prepared by the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and by The Endocrine Society.

She started her career as a courtesan in Paris and in 1917‚Äì18 she had an affair with the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). After her marriage to Egyptian aristocrat Ali Kamel Fahmy Bey, she was frequently called Princess by the media of the time. In 1923, she killed her husband at the Savoy Hotel in London. She was eventually acquitted of the murder charge after a trial at the Old Bailey. Her affair with the Prince became the subject of the book The Prince, the Princess and the Perfect Murder. The killing of her husband was the focus of the book Scandal at the Savoy: The Infamous 1920s Murder Case. ==Life== Marguerite Marie Alibert was born on 9 December 1890, in Paris to Firmin Alibert, a coachman, and Marie Aurand, a housekeeper. At the age of sixteen she gave birth to a daughter, Raymonde. In the following eight to ten years, Alibert led an itinerant life until she met Mme Denant who ran a Maison de Rendezvous, a brothel catering to a high society clientele. Under the tutelage of Denant, Alibert became a high-class prostitute. Prince of Wales Alibert met Edward, Prince of Wales in April 1917 at the H√¥tel de Crillon in Paris. At the time, Edward was in France as an officer of the Grenadier Guards in the Western Front during World War I. Edward became infatuated with her and during their relationship he wrote many candid letters to her. Although the affair was intense while it lasted, by the end of the war Edward had broken off the relationship. Ali Fahmy Ali Fahmy Bey became infatuated with Alibert when he first encountered her in Egypt while she was escorting a businessman. He saw her again several times in Paris and they were eventually formally introduced in July 1922. Following that meeting, they embarked on a tour of gambling and entertainment establishments in Deauville, Biarritz, and Paris. Fahmy returned to Egypt, but, soon after, he invited her to the country feigning illness and telling her that he could not live without her. They were married in December 1922 and had a formal Islamic wedding in January 1923. Killing of Ali Fahmy On 1 July 1923, the couple arrived in London for holidays. They stayed at the Savoy Hotel with their entourage consisting of a secretary, a valet and a maid. On 9 July, the couple and the secretary went to see the operetta The Merry Widow.Bland (2013), p. 133. Upon returning to the hotel, they had a late supper where they started one of their frequent arguments. At 2:30 a.m. on 10 July, Alibert shot her husband repeatedly from behind, striking him in the neck, back, and head. She used a .32 calibre semi-automatic Browning pistol. The victim was transported to Charing Cross Hospital but died of his wounds in about an hour. Trial The trial opened on Monday 10 September 1923 with large numbers of people queuing to enter, including some who had waited since before daybreak. The trial lasted until Saturday 15 September.Bland (2013), p. 134. \\"The trial at the Old Bailey opened on Monday 10th September and concluded the following Saturday. It was noted that of the huge numbers queuing to enter the court the majority were women,...\\" During the trial, Alibert presented herself as the victim of the \\"brutality and beastliness\\" of her \\"oriental husband\\". Alibert was defended by Edward Marshall Hall, one of the most famous British lawyers of that era. The trial judge disallowed any mention of Alibert's past as a courtesan, ensuring that the name of the Prince of Wales was never mentioned as part of the evidence during the trial. At the same time, Fahmy was described as \\"a monster of Eastern depravity and decadence, whose sexual tastes were indicative of an amoral sadism towards his helpless European wife\\". Alibert was acquitted of all charges.  Post trial  After the trial, Alibert sued her late husband's family aiming to lay claim to his property. A court in Egypt rejected the verdict at the Old Bailey and dismissed her claim. She lived in an apartment facing the Ritz in Paris until the end of her life. After her death, the few remaining letters from Edward, which she had kept as insurance, were found and destroyed. ==In culture== Book In the book The Prince, the Princess and the Perfect Murder it is speculated that the acquittal of Alibert of the charges for murdering her husband was part of a deal for returning the love letters of the Prince of Wales to him and a further guarantee by Alibert that Edward's name would not be mentioned in court.

She spent three months in 1970 training under Linda Brauckmann in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and would later travel occasionally to London, England ( 1975‚Äì1978), to learn from Gladys Hogg. Coulthard competed in both ladies' singles and pairs. With her first partner, Phillip Brown, she won the junior national pairs' title in 1968. Competing on the senior level, she and Mark Lynch became four-time national champions during the early 1970s. As a single skater, Coulthard won the silver medal at the 1977 Golden Spin of Zagreb and the Australian national title during the 1979‚Äì1980 season. She finished 28th at the 1979 World Championships in Vienna, Austria, and 24th at the 1980 World Championships in Dortmund, West Germany. Australia elected not to send her to the 1980 Olympics, leading to her decision to switch to coaching. Noonan coached Amanda James to a national title in the 1984‚Äì85 season. She is based at the Sydney Figure Skating Club. She has also served as a figure skating consultant for the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia, as a commentator for Channel Seven at the Winter Olympics, and as a judge for Torvill & Dean's Dancing on Ice (Channel Nine Australia).

Walter produced paintings that dealt with landscape, portraiture, and identity, as well as abstract explorations of nuclear energy and the universe. His portraits, both real and imagined include a ballerina's legs in African Genealogy; Hitler in Dipsomaniac; Walter himself as Christ on the Cross; and Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales as Adam and Eve.For the most complete biography of Walter, see Barbara Paca (Ed.), (With contributions from Sir Rodney Williams, Nina Khrushcheva, Rt. Hon. Patricia Scotland, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Caitlin Hoffman, Marcus Nakbar Crump, Barbara Paca, Sir Selvyn Walter, and Kenneth Milton), Frank Walter: The Last Universal Man, Radius Books on the occasion of the 57th International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale, 2017, == Early life == Frank Walter was born in Antigua on September 11, 1926. He studied at the Antigua Grammar School where he excelled in Latin, science, and the arts. Impressed by his abilities, Walter's tutors encouraged him to pursue a degree in medicine or law. Walter opted for agriculture. Walter was raised by elderly family matriarchs and learned from oral histories at a young age that his ancestors included both aristocratic European slave owners and enslaved people of African descent. During Walter's youth, Antigua was a society divided along racial lines, and the reality of mixed-race families created outside of marriage was largely considered private knowledge and often lost through the generations.Oral histories recorded by Barbara Paca of Frank, Jules, and Sir Selvyn Walter; and Barbara Paca, \\"Stories from a Sunny Clime: West Indian Tales of Unity and Strength.\\" Ancestry.com Blog, 10 March 2016 In his youth, Walter's education and professional trajectory defied the statistical challenges facing young men of color in 1930s Antigua, and the identity that he constructed was heavily influenced by his awareness of his aristocratic European forebears. Later in life, Walter became tormented by his descent from white slave owners, enslaved women, and illegitimate mixed-race children.Catrin Lorch. \\"An educated citizen from Antigua and Barbuda.\\" Suddeutsche Zeitung, 15 May 2020. https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/retrospektive-des-kuenstlers-frank-walter- ein-bildungsbuerger-aus-antigua-und-barbuda-1.4908938 == Agricultural career in Antigua == Walter was the first person of color to break through the race barrier to work in the upper tier of Antigua's agricultural industry. When he was promoted to the role of manager in 1948 at age twenty-two by mentor and Director Sir Alexander Moody-Stuart, Walter became the first to work as an equal among whites in the Antiguan Sugar Syndicate. Sugar was the source of socio-economic power at that point in Antigua's history, and Walter's capabilities earned him the respect of his peers. == Life in Europe == Walter was offered the opportunity to manage the entire Antiguan Sugar Syndicate in 1953, but he turned down this job to embark on what was intended to be a ten- year industrial Grand Tour of Great Britain and Europe. He was motivated by a desire to engage new technologies to alleviate the poverty of his fellow black countrymen, and wanted to introduce the latest European and British innovation in mining and agriculture to Antigua. From 1953 to 1961, Walter spent eight years traveling in Europe and the UK struggling with a race-based caste system that relegated him to the menial role of unskilled laborer. During an interview for his first job in London, he proudly stated his role as manager. The employer rebuffed, \\"We don't have tropical sugar plantations in England,\\" and offered him a job to clean the floors. Walter suffered from poverty resulting from subsistence wages, but continued to pursue his academic interests by studying in Europe's metropolitan libraries. During this period, Walter actively researched his family history and studied various aristocratic family trees. He became obsessed with his heritage, inventing connections to the regents of Britain and Europe‚Äîcrowning himself as the 7th Prince of the West Indies, Lord of Follies and the Ding-a-Ding Nook. It is interesting to note that Follies and Ding-a-Ding Nook are the names of plantations owned by his white Antiguan ancestors. The complexities of Walter's mixed-race identity and his frustrations with postcolonial society became increasingly apparent during his eight years in Europe and the UK. However painting, writing, and time spent in the natural world provided solace, and memories of these environments were the subject of much of his art for the next sixty years of his life.Cord Riechelmann, \\"Frank Walter's Ghosts: On the Subjectification of a Colonizee.\\" Barbara Paca and Susanne Pfeffer (Eds.): (With contributions from Precious Okoyomon, Barbara Paca, Susanne Pfeffer, Cord Riechelmann, Gilane Tawadros, Krista Thompson, and Frank Walter), Frank Walter. Eine Retrospektive, Ausstellungs-Katalog Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst (MMK), Frankfurt am Main 2020, K√∂ln : K√∂nig, Walther, 2020, == Life in Dominica == When Walter arrived in Antigua in 1961, the sugar industry was on the brink of collapse. He relocated to the nearby island of Dominica, and applied for and received a land grant from the government. He named his 25-acre agricultural estate Mount Olympus and spent five years clearing the land by hand to create a sustainable and productive acreage. He selectively removed the canopy of bois diable trees to allow sunlight and air for fruit trees and vegetables. Using kilns, he repurposed these cleared materials as charcoal to make a viable local energy source he shared with his neighbors. During this time, Walter continued to write poetry and prose, and also began to sculpt figures using wood harvested from his estate in a style that was likely inspired by the traditions of the Caribbean Arawak and African Dogon peoples. Once Mount Olympus was prepared for planting in 1968, the government confiscated it from Walter. He was bereft at his loss and returned to Antigua. == Seclusion in Antigua == In the late 1960s, Walter became involved in politics and wrote manifestos for the Antigua and Barbuda National Democratic Party. In 1971 he ran and was defeated by his relation, Sir George Walter in Antigua's race for prime minister. He chose to retire from public life and dedicate himself to his art practice in small studios in central St. John's. He worked as a photographer and a painter during this period, selling mostly small Polaroid photographs and tiny paintings of letters of the alphabet and landscape to tourists. No one knew of his larger-scale abstract and figurative paintings, which were done in secret, and stored for a large-scale exhibition that he planned but was never realized. In 1993, Walter designed and built a house and art studio in the picturesque countryside above Falmouth Harbour where he lived until his death in 2009 in peaceful isolation. He sited the structures to enjoy spectacular views of Sugarloaf Mountain, Monk's Hill, Falmouth Harbour, and the sea, and dwelt in close proximity to nature. Without running water or electricity, Walter grew much of his own food, and lived near his relations who were organic farmers. His home was filled with paintings and sculpture that he made in secrecy and carefully arranged in his house. He was also surrounded by stacks of books on philosophy, law, history, botany, and heraldry. Walter's creative process relied on a multidisciplinary approach and a collection of curio to generate what Walter Benjamin identified in his 1931 essay \\"Unpacking My Library\\" as a \\"dialectical tension between the poles of order and disorder.\\" While he revered his paintings, Walter's sculptures held a talismanic power for him. They were kept close to him and never for sale to anyone as he believed they connected him to another world. He depicted figures as varied as ancient Arawak people, Antiguan farmers, European royalty, and men from outer space. He revisited his memories in remarkable detail in painting and writing and explored nature as an avid environmentalist and student of science. Many portraits and landscapes drew upon his memories of travel in Scotland and Europe, and he classified his broad range of paintings as galactic, scientific, heraldic, and abstract.Barbara Paca, \\"How I Became European: Frank Walter in Retrospect.\\" Barbara Paca and Susanne Pfeffer (Eds.): (With contributions from Precious Okoyomon, Barbara Paca, Susanne Pfeffer, Cord Riechelmann, Gilane Tawadros, Krista Thompson, and Frank Walter), Frank Walter.

Nina Khrushcheva is responsible for the title, positing that the sheer diversity and depth of Walter's work as visual artist, musician, and philosopher allowed him to attain the humanist ideal of man exemplified in Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (c.1490). Walter's struggle with his mental health gave him a unique perspective and can be seen as an inextricable part of his creativity and invention. For this reason, comparisons have been made between Frank Walter and mathematician John Nash, who was featured in the 1998 novel A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar and the 2001 film of the same name directed by Ron Howard.Dr. Caitlin Hoffman. ‚ÄúPerceptions of creative genius: Impetus for innovation and collaboration.\\" New York Hospital, Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center Blog, 22 May 2017. http://weillcornellbrainandspine.org/perceptions-creative-genius-impetus- innovation-and-collaboration Walter's art practice has been linked to a diverse group of artists, including Hilma af Klint (1862‚Äì1944), Adolf W√∂lfli (1864‚Äì1930), Alfred Wallis (1855‚Äì1942), Forrest Bess (1911‚Äì1977), and Henry Darger (1892‚Äì1973).

Guyanese painter Aubrey Williams (1926‚Äì1990) shares much in terms of biography. They were both highly educated and enjoyed early careers as successful tropical plantation managers. They were the product of a British colonial heritage, and traveled in the early 1950s to England, where they encountered overt racism. For example, Pablo Picasso reduced Williams to his physical appearance when they met. The famous artist told him that he had a \\"fine head,\\" and that he would like to paint him one day. According to New York Times critic Jason Farago, Walter's paintings of Antiguan flora‚Äîthe insignia of European nobility‚Äîand his small abstractions of stars and circles recall the Pop Art of Robert Indiana. == The Venice Biennale and other Selected Exhibitions == \\"I was incredibly excited by the inaugural Biennale presentation of Antigua and Barbuda, Frank Walter: The Last Universal Man, organized by Barbara Paca.

The national pavilion was also intended as a posthumous fulfillment of Walter's expressed desire to open his house and studio as a center for art and dialogue.

Afterwards he lived in the Antiguan countryside, intensely interested in questions of ecology and agriculture. He was a pioneer. And he painted over 5,000 paintings! An unbelievable body of work, which has not been seen so far. He also wrote poems, worked in nearly all art disciplines.

To Lorch the work of the artist and descendants of slaves and German plantation owners, who worked in English mines and at Mannesmann in the Ruhr area before returning to Antigua, appears almost manic. \\"If you look at the motifs he found in Antigua after his return to Antigua Year 1967 dedicated, now experienced in its entirety, it is surprising how they trace the canon of a bourgeois, almost Biedermeier painting on the surface. Portraits, friendship pictures, animals, landscapes, especially panoramas‚Äîa few chunks of mountain, horizon lines, water surfaces, sky, palm trees.

Instead, they imbue nature with a sense of ontological unease. The framing of paintings, a great part of which is devoted to the late artist's birthplace of Antigua, almost violently cuts the setting into seemingly trivial fragments, de-exoticing the mise en sc√®ne. Ominous, at points monstrous undertones intensify my first visit to the museum after months of self-isolation.\\" \\"Walter's artworks are reduced to an almost diagrammatic skeleton, capturing instability that ceases to be either climatic or spectacular. Eschewing the standards of a sustain-release dramatic structure, the instability is perennial, incessant, offering a window into brief instances in the life of someone whose very presence made him antagonistic to the realities of his (and our) times.\\" * Esther Attar- Machanek. \\"Frank Walter retrospective, MMK Frankfurt 2020.\\" Esther Art Newsletter, 20 May 2020. http://www.estherartnewsletter.com/news-international * \\"Exhibitions, Frank Walter A retrospective.\\" C& American Latina, 20 May 2020. http://amlatina.contemporaryand.com/events/frank-walter-a-retrospective/ * \\"Museum MMK ‚Äì Frank Walter.

A gray triangle on the left on the horizon. It is the first of an endless number of images in this retrospective by Frank Walter at the Frankfurt Museum of Modern Art. A simple composition and yet very sophisticated. Because it appears completely abstract in parts, figurative in others and because one is subordinate to the other. You can interpret the three circles as balls, the triangle as a mountain‚Äîand the flat image gets a considerable depth. Walter has mastered both forms of expression and much more. He was a man of many talents. One who designed cosmological-mathematical drawings of great dynamism and entangled microcosms with macrocosms in fascinating compositions. At the same time an accomplished landscape painter who condensed the intensity of a sultry evening or a shimmering afternoon in sometimes tiny paintings. Who could create worlds with which a handful of casually thrown brush strokes on thin wooden plates, cardboard disks or packaging backsides, in which one would like to sink.\\" \\"Although the artist was always aware of the quality of his work, it was not shown during his lifetime.

On 30 January 2019 Amanda announced that she had signed with Sony Music Entertainment. She later released her single \\"Thandwa Ndim\\", which was her first release in two years. The song debuted on Metro FM's Fresh Breakfast Show with DJ Fresh and Somizi Mhlongo and peaked at No. 1 on the local iTunes charts the day of release. == Artistry == Musical style Amanda Black on Idols South Africa 2016 Amanda Black began singing at an early age in church then later continued to sing to her favourite artists, including Beyonc√©, Whitney Houston, Brandy Norwood, and Brenda Fassie. She sings in Xhosa and in English. In an interview with Patience Bambalele of The Sowetan, she describes her genre of music as Afro-soul with a fusion of hip- hop and a bit of soul and R&B.; On 29 May 2017 the singer appeared in an interview on the SuperSport TV show Homeground‚Äîhosted by Minnie Dlamini and Lungile Radu‚Äîjust a few months after her album Amazulu was released. Alongside her was her music producer Christer Kobedi, who claimed that the album was created and finalised in just over one month. The singer also expressed that the album title song \\"Amazulu\\" was, in fact, the first song she had ever written in her home language, Xhosa. Facial art Amanda Black usually adorns her face with Stipples of Xhosa face paint as an expression of how proud she is of her roots. \\"Xhosa facial art ‚Äì Xhosa umchokozo ‚Äì is used to represent Xhosa people. There are different types of patterns, which are created mostly by women. When I was growing up, they were mostly done on special occasions ‚Äì but in some rural parts of the Eastern Cape, for example, umchokozo is an everyday practise. The Xhosa facial art that I wear on my face has quickly become part of my brand as Amanda Black. But it started as a way of expressing myself and embracing who I am. For me, it‚Äôs taking back my culture as a Xhosa woman ‚Äì and feeling beautiful while doing it. It‚Äôs about me living the way I understand my culture to be. It‚Äôs a way of representing my roots and where I am from.\\" Growing up, Amanda did not like the fact that she is dark skinned, she says because TV celebrates light skin and she felt like she was not good enough because she is dark-skinned. She started learning about her roots as a Xhosa woman, her history and origins. Doing this helped her understand who she is and helped her to love herself as an African woman. This also influenced her decision to start painting her face with tribal art, the way she writes, the music she makes and the stories she tells sonically. Amanda started embracing who she is after reading Steve Biko‚Äôs Black Consciousness. ==Reception and accoladesDiscography== * Amazulu (2016) * Power (2019) == References == Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:South African singer-songwriters Category:People from the Eastern Cape Category:Nelson Mandela University alumni Category:Xhosa people Category:South African female singers Category:Soul musicians Category:South African rhythm and blues musicians Category:21st-century women singers ","title":"Amanda Black"},{"id":"54099354","text":"Hari Bahadur Rokaya (born 2 September 1965) is a Nepalese long-distance runner.

Hair Peace Salon's music is distinguished by its use of English lyrics with emotional flow and drastic mood swings in songs. The group was founded in 1998 and they have released one full-length album Gentleman, numerous singles and EPs. In 2013 the members took a break when frontman and co-founder Aleh Vial created another band, Bristeil. ==History== Early years (1998‚Äì2001) Aleh Vial wanted to play music in 1996, but waited until the next year when his brother bought him a drum kit. In 1998 he gathered two schoolmates, Maxim Devichensky and Alex Vashchilo, in his band, which became the foundation for Hair Peace Salon. They were inspired by local bands and bands such as Nirvana. The first years of the band were spent learning how to play together and experimenting with new ideas and methods of songwriting. First releases (2002‚Äì2006) Their first public performance was given on 22 February 2002 at The Base club in Minsk. The show was dedicated to the birthday of Kurt Cobain, and the band played a couple of their songs. Their band name was found quite unexpectedly on the floor of a friend of the band, Belarusian poet and novelist Alexandr Yak. It was a crumpled up piece of paper on which was written one of his English prosimetrical works titled, \\"Hair Peace Salon\\". In the same year their original drummer Alex Vashchilo left the band and Artur Luchkov replaced him. The young band with him participated in various concerts and performed at the music festival \\"The Fresh Wind\\", which took place in BNTU in September. By 2003, the band became a classically structured rock quartet (rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass guitar, and drums) with the addition of lead guitarist Vadim Dubina. They played at the festival of avant-garde fashion in Minsk in March. Then they recorded the single from two songs \\"Next Level\\" for promotional purposes, and it was released in early 2004. In June 2004 Hair Peace Salon, together with the Jitters band, played at the international festival ‚ÄúPiirideta Muusika‚Äù (), which took place in Narva (Estonia). At the same time, Aleh Vial (guitar, vocal) and Artur Luchkov (drums) were playing in another indie and alternative rock band Jitters, which was being headed by its frontman Konstantin Karman on lead vocals and playing bass. In general, players from both bands were performing at the same concerts, often producing similar music in the British wave style, so their members knew each other well and were friends. The band was taking steps onto the grunge music scene, actively playing on the Nirvana influenced gigs during the second part of 2004. Their lead guitarist Vadim Dubina left the group due to family circumstances in 2005. There were a few months without a lead guitar player, but eventually at the end of searching and experiments Hair Peace Salon found Vadim Isaev, from Zhodzina, the familiarity with whom came to fruition via the newspaper \\"Muzykal'naya Gazeta\\". They hit the road to successfully play at the Basovi≈°ƒça'05 festival in Poland in July, and at the musicfest \\"Rock-kola-2005\\" (Polotsk) in December. Their next CD was released in 2005. It contained the full EP \\"Hover\\" with the self-titled lead single, which was taken to be presented on the music compilation of various alternative rock artists \\"Spotlight On\\" released on the label Matchbox Recordings on 14 November 2005. In October, the frontman Aleh Vial stopped cooperation with the amicable Jitters band, where he played guitar and was a backing vocalist in parallel, because of specific technical and logical reasons and to devote more time to his band. At the end of spring 2006, drummer Artur Luchkov became exempt from the side duties in Jitters too, and the quintet spent that year performing on stage, in addition to concerts across Belarus, participated in some abroad festivals such as Polish \\"Rock bez Ig≈Çy\\" (Tychy), \\"Wioslo Jacwinga\\" (Suwa≈Çki), \\"Fiesta Borealis\\" (Olecko). Also, the musicians showed up at the concert in support of the series of self-titled compilation albums ‚ÄúSongs of Freedom‚Äù led by Neuro Dubel, N.R.M., and some other prominent Belarusian rock bands and held at the Bangalor square in Minsk on 25 August 2006.  Gipsy and in Tune (2007‚Äì2009)  In 2007 the second EP was released. All songs on it were performed by all four official members of the band while keyboard parts were played by a few different session musicians. The band got the nominee in the category \\"Rush of the year\\" at the \\"–†–æ–∫-–∫–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è 2007\\" award show in February, won a selection into the finale in May as the finalist of the contest ‚Äú–ò–¥–∏–ù–∞–†–æ–∫‚Äù in June with its prize, got to record a song in a professional music studio, performed at the biggest country stages during the Day of the City Minsk and at the festival \\"Ambasovi≈°ƒça\\" was held by the Belarusian Embassy of the US in September, and became just a semi-finalist on the international live music competition Global Battle of the Bands (2007), but lost to a French band Milque Twins. After tinkering with sessional keyboardists prior to and on the ‚ÄúAcoustics of Spring‚Äù March presentation in view of a half of the year business trip of Konstantin Karman, to the end of 2007 the number of the official members of the band was increased, as he paused the existence of his band Jitters and was invited to play in Hair Peace Salon on a full-time basis. The band already had a full-time bass player, and because he had bought a Roland JP-8000 on his business trip to Scotland, he became a keyboardist with vocal parts, as well as composing songs. On 28 October 2007 the EP Gipsy was released. The new look of the band was shown at the presentation of the EP Gipsy supported by Open Space and some other musicians and friends of the band on 18 November 2007. On 25 October 2007 the split album named Split Before, Together Now was released on the West Records label to promote this new collaboration. This CD contained Hair Peace Salon (Gypsy) and Jitters (Pick Me Up) EPs with the original artwork filled with two laced together shoes as a symbol that there were two bands, but since this release they are united now. ‚ÄúThe guys from HPS have always admired the creativity of the not very famous but beloved in certain circles Jitters band. And today they caught up them in skill, came near, and even outstripped them in some ways,‚Äù highlighted Elena Sobolevskaya from the newspaper Mzykalnaya Gazeta the music standards of both britpop and brit rock collectives in her album review. In addition to regular gigs, given circa 30 live shows in the 2007 year, musicians were successfully participating in various music contests, such as \\"Musical Playoffs\\" (semi-finalists), \\"Golden Acoustics\\" (the winners), The official video on the self-titled lead single of the EP \\"Hover\\" featuring new band member Konstantin Karman was filmed in February 2008 to be showcased on the television program ¬´Pro –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ+¬ª. During the first part of the 2008 year, the brand new single \\"Stand The Rain\\" was recorded at the OSMOS studio as a prize for the winner of the contest \\"–ò–¥–∏–ù–∞–†–æ–∫\\". In March 2008 the lead guitarist Vadim Isaev left the band. That was a hit during the record sessions of the upcoming EP, and although the band tried to find a new solo guitarist, these efforts fell short. Despite this, the remained quartet decided neither to slow their recording tempo, nor to decrease the number of live performances. They took the second place in the contest \\"–ú—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–ø–∞—Ä—Ä–∏–Ω–≥\\". The very first presentation of the EP In Tune was held in the \\"Bronx\\" club on its release date on 1 November 2008 supported by the folk band Akana-NHS with Irena Kotvitskaya and Rusya from Indiga. This CD had four songs, including one bonus track. Notwithstanding the fact that Vadim Isaev was not a band member anymore, his solo guitar parties were denoted on two recordings on this EP \\"Like A Whale\\" and \\"Stand The Rain\\". As a winner of preliminary rounds together with the Open Space, in January 2009 the band played on the local final of the Bandscan festival, the final of which had to be taken place in Sweden, but they took the second place after The Toobes. The official video on the single \\"In Tune\\" was shot in February, and the full edited clip went on public in December. During the springtime, drummer Artur Luchkov left the band as a result of disagreements within Hair Peace Salon, but after brief searching Alexey Kuznetsov, ex-member of Prophetic Dream, Iris7, and some other bands, was seated in the drum chair. During the upcoming year, Hair Peace Salon was working in the studio on new material, getting experience with acoustic as well as rock programs, and often playing gigs with the British wave band Open Space like in previous years. As a participant in the project \\"Tuzin. Perazagruzka\\" from the web-portal \\"Tuzin.fm\\" and the public campaign \\"Budzma Belarusians!\\", the band re-released its song \\"Ice Age\\" in the Belarussian language with the poetical translated lyrics by man of letters, Vital Voranau, which became their first song in their native language. This notable track called ‚ÄúStudzie≈Ñ‚Äù was put on the compilation CD of the project released in December 2009, subsequently officially digitally re-released on SoundCloud in 2014. In August the band won a national selection organized by European Radio for Belarus and went to Chernihiv (Ukraine) at the \\"Be Free\\" festival to present this mother language version of the song live with Lyapis Trubetskoy, Vopli Vidopliassova, and more Belarusian and Ukrainian rock bands. At the end of the 2009 the band redesigned their website with artwork by Polina Pastushenko, director of the \\"In Tune\\" music video, to support the release of the brand new video clip on the song \\"Like A Whale\\" filmed as a participant of the TV-show \\"PRO–¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ +\\". Shortly after, Alexey Kuznetsov left the band in December 2009. The frontman Aleh Vial later said that this happened because they had not been playing with him in harmony well. In the coming months, Vladimir Agayan, fan of the band who won the new drummer selection, became his successor. So, Vial, Devichensky, Karman, and Agayan began to cooperate on a new CD, as they made know on the air on the radio ‚ÄúStalitsa‚Äù and on the pages of the (\\"I Love Rock and roll\\") magazine. Gentleman (2010‚Äì2012) The band was doing well in the first several months of 2010 winning round-by-round in the ‚ÄúGraffiti Open Music Fest‚Äù festival, when on 5 April 2010 the very first single of the upcoming full-length album called Happy for a While was released on the Chinese market with different artwork at first to support the signing of the new drummer, while its worldwide release was 5 days later. That one marked the musical shift of the band towards power pop, while the album had to be released next fall. A new melodic and dress code switch was showcased on 10 April 2010, and the release event in the \\"Broadway\\" club was supported by Drum Ecstasy, –ö–∞—Å—Å–∏–æ–ø–µ—è, The Stampletons, and more. In September 2010 the band made a double release as the brand new rock 'n' roll internet-single Rolz'n'Rulz was supported by the experimental remix EP HPS Remixed filled with 6 remixes of the songs from two latest singles from a few different Minsk electronic stage DJs in trance, drum 'n' bass, downtempo, and more styles. All of two songs from the singles Happy for a While (\\"Happy for a While\\",‚ÄúOut of Time\\") and self-titled \\"Rolz'n'Rulz\\" were credited with Alexey Kuznetsov as the drummer despite his leaving Hair Peace Salon almost a year ago. On 3 December 2010 the band gave an online concert on the biggest Belarusian web-portal Tut.By, performed several songs from these new singles. In the press release in support of both single and EP, the band indicated that the work on the upcoming debut album will be done by the start of winter 2010. Nevertheless, during the 2011 year the band continued to be focused on writing songs for the forthcoming album. Eleven tracks were planned to be put that CD initially, while the topics of nobility, generosity, fortitude, lust for life, plus a few oddities, and self-irony had to run through it like a red thread. At the time of finishing of the work on the music side of the album at the end of 2011, the band was seeking for a \\"true artist\\" who would draw its artwork. On 18 March 2012 the band made the official reveal of the first full-length album in a short video clip. Music works from the past three years were merged in the album Gentleman, and this release was started rolling out for free from the official band's website hairpeacesalon.com from 21 March 2012. It's worth to note that despite the previous announce, only 10 tracks appeared in the final release. ‚Äú10 good-quality tracks and nothing redundant ‚Äù from ‚Äúthe album we can certainly be proud of‚Äù via Tuzin.fm received mostly positive response: ‚Äúbeautiful voice, good lyrics, excellent sound, flawless execution, competent flow‚Äù, ‚Äú\\"Rolz'n'Rulz\\" rules‚Äù, ‚Äúthis collective is just about closer to the standard of the European tradition of combining rock instruments with enough pop melody than all\\", \\"melodic and melancholic songs, beautiful guitars, and the recognizable high vocals of Aleh Vial\\", \\"the charm of HPS is not just in stylistic restraint and impeccably qualitative arrangements and compositional work, but also in unconditional organicness\\", \\"polyphony that sometimes forces to recall the Fab Four gives lightness and a feeling of a large stroke to sound\\". At the same time reviewers noted a lack of brightness and originality, because the record was being heard like an ordinary British wave album. ‚ÄúVery nice work where individuality is felt‚Äù as it was noted in the review of the year by Tuzin.fm was selected in a few tops of Belarusian albums released in that span, and its first track \\"Borderline\\" was chosen in the top of the best contemporary Belarusian songs by Lenta.ru. Following the album launch, a substitution was made in the band which played live as a trio for a short time again, as Alex Stepanovich was found to replace Vladimir Agayan, who left Hair Peace Salon in July, and the new drummer was officially introduced in September 2012. Because of that, the release party show was postponed to 11 October 2012.  Break-up (2013)  Supported the new album with a row of shows, acoustic and full rock ones, for half of a year, at its third appearance at an annual Acoustic of Spring event in March 2013, the band showed some new songs to be released under new Aleh Vial's Bristeil band copyright later on: a brand new song in Belarusian Nieba Abraz and Lana Del Rey's hit Video Games (both are from the Cyruƒ∫nia Svietu EP, the latest one will be actually re-sung and covered in the Belarusian language). The band received a nomination for \\"Debut of the Year\\" at the Rock Profi awards for Gentleman. At the end of August 2013, together with The Toobes and Dzieciuki the band was selected to represent Belarus in Poland at the ‚ÄúCieszan√≥w Rock Festiwal 2013‚Äù. Having worked together on recording ‚ÄúVS ¬Ω HPS‚Äù in Spring 2013, frontman and guitarist Aleh Vial and drummer Alex Stepanovich with two other musicians founded new Belarusian rock band named Bristol later in autumn. The band got a new name Bristeil some time later and in February 2014, the official site was shut down, and subsequently the domain hairpeacesalon.com was merged with bristeil.com The band has never declared about its break-up, but since 2013 there were no new songs released. == Style == Musicians of Hair Peace Salon started as an alternative rock band at the turn of the millennium, through the first decade of 2000 with an indie rock. brit rock, and britpop repertoire, became known in the 2010s mainly as performers of English power pop. The music of the band gives emotions of sadness and empathy, so their work more closely matches the definition of brit rock, in which a depressive mood is often present. Volha Samusik, contributor for the ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù, told about the band's performance at the Basovi≈°ƒça'2005 festival on the pages of the periodical, stating: There is a noticeable claim on the Westernism of the sound. The guys play just like crazy. Basovi≈°ƒça is not their level. We do not understand, why they spend their musical time here, they need to conquer European heights... Hair Peace Salon is a good band, especially for those who are a true brit-pop-rocker‚Äù. In a review of the 2005 year EP \\"Hover\\", the ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù described the music of Hair Peace Salon as ‚Äúguitar rock in English, rich in ideas, spectacular, which sends you to prog music (what the hell, it is as if brit rockers got complicated)... great vocals. As it is ¬´approved¬ª for this kind of music, arrangeable emotions are poor.‚Äù In general, the sound of the group is entirely compared to the music of Jitters; after listening to promotional discs for the 2005 year of both bands, –û‚Äô–ö put this notion on paper in the same issue of the newspaper, ‚Äúeverything that is written about HPS can be written about Jitters. Maybe ‚ÄúThe Jitters‚Äù are a little sharper. A half of the members of Jitters completely plays in Hair Peace Salon... or vice versa‚Äù. Colleagues of musicians from the Caravan band, when they were asked a question by the newspaper ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù about collectives that they like, in the second January issue of 2005 chose ‚Äúexcellent collectives‚Äù Hair Peace Salon and Jitters, because ‚Äúthey play original music‚Äù. After one of their concerts by the time of September 2006, columnist for the ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù Slap highly praised the band, ‚ÄúThere was an impression that this music is already crowded in a small club room. Taking into account the incandescence of emotions, the quality of material, and its play, it was obvious that it is time to go onto big stages and to a large audience for the guys‚Äù. Konstantin Karman joined the band in 2007, playing the synthesizer. Following the results of listening to the album Split Before, Together Now, the ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù once again definitely attributed the creativity of ‚Äúthe Minsk blood brothers of Coldplay‚Äù to the British rock scene, because ‚Äúthe bands which belong to britpop (Travis, Radiohead, Muse, Blur, Coldplay) have much in common, they are known, therefore they can be attributed to something... \\"salons\\" have something in the sound that is close to all of these collectives, with their own characteristics, of course, but it is known in the same way‚Äù. Tat'yana Zamirovskaya from the weekly ‚ÄúBelGazeta‚Äù described Hair Peace Salon's music in the review of the same album with the following words, ‚Äúbrit rock with dizzy harmonies' weaves √† la The Mars Volta, technical guitar arpeggios √† la Muse, and neurotic-sensual intonations √† la Travis... some HPS tunes inexplicably reminiscent the new album of Radiohead (released after the disc material has been recorded!)‚Äù. Another Radiohead comparison was made by her via BelaPAN in 2009. Elena Sobolevskaya from the music newspaper ‚ÄúMuzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äù wrote in 2007, ‚Äúit has been known for a long time that Hair Peace Salon is not music for the masses‚Äù. ==Language issue== During their early years of existence, Hair Peace Salon performed in English and thus were not invited to festivals and on-air rotation. However, over time the band ‚Äúdiscovered unusual grace and the melody of the Belarusian language‚Äù, as it was admitted to the news agency ¬´–ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫-–Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª in 2015 in shared memoirs about the experience of writing its first song in the native language ‚ÄúStudzie≈Ñ‚Äù. The path to demanded Belarusization was supported by the self-cover of ‚ÄúGipsy‚Äù on the lyrics of Vital Voranau as well as ‚ÄúCia≈Ñki‚Äù. == Discography == * Next Level (single, 2004) * Hover (single, 2005) * Split Before, Together Now (split album, 2007) * Gipsy (EP, 2007) * Stand The Rain (single, 2008) * In Tune (EP, 2008) * Happy for a While (single, 2010) * HPS Remixed (EP, 2010) * Rolz'n'Rulz (single, 2010) *Gentleman (album, 2012) *Garela Sasna (feat.

These models help organizations to create structure around their Big Data capabilities and to identify where to start.Halper, F., & Krishnan, K. (2014). TDWI Big Data Maturity Model Guide. TDWI Research. They provide tools that assist organizations to define goals around their big data program and to communicate their big data vision to the entire organization. BDMMs also provide a methodology to measure and monitor the state of a company‚Äôs big data capability, the effort required to complete their current stage or phase of maturity and to progress to the next stage. Additionally, BDMMs measure and manage the speed of both the progress and adoption of big data programs in the organization. The goals of BDMMs are: # To provide a capability assessment tool that generates specific focus on big data in key organizational areas # To help guide development milestones # To avoid pitfalls in establishing and building big data capabilities Key organizational areas refer to ‚ÄúPeople, Process and Technology‚Äù and the subcomponents include alignment, architecture, data, data governance, delivery, development, measurement, program governance, scope, skills, sponsorship, statistical modelling, technology, value and visualization. The stages or phases in BDMMs depict the various ways in which data can be used in an organization and is one of the key tools to set direction and monitor the health of organization‚Äôs big data programs. An underlying assumption is that a high level of big data maturity correlates with an increase in revenue and reduction in operational expense. However, reaching the highest level of maturity involves major investments over many years. Only a few companies are considered to be at a ‚ÄúMature‚Äù stage of big data and analytics. These include internet-based companies (such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Amazon) and other non-internet-based companies, including financial institutions (fraud analysis, real-time customer messaging and behavioral modeling) and retail organizations (click-stream analytics together with self-service analytics for teams). == Categories of Big Data Maturity Models == Big data maturity models can be broken down into three broad categories namely: # Descriptive # Comparative # Prescriptive models. == Descriptive Models == Descriptive models assess the current firm maturity through qualitative positioning of the firm in various stages or phases. The model does not provide any recommendations as to how a firm would improve their big data maturity.  Big Data & Analytics Maturity Model (IBM model)  This descriptive model aims to assess the value generated from big data investments towards supporting strategic business initiatives. Maturity Levels The model consists of the following maturity levels: * Ad-hoc * Foundational * Competitive Differentiating * Break Away. Assessment Areas Maturity levels also cover areas in matrix format focusing on: Business Strategy, Information, Analytics, Culture and Execution, Architecture and Governance.  Knowledgent Big Data Maturity Assessment  Consisting of an assessment survey, this big data maturity model assesses an organization‚Äôs readiness to execute big data initiatives. Furthermore, the model aims to identify the steps and appropriate technologies that will lead an organization towards big data maturity. == Comparative Models == Comparative big data maturity models aim to benchmark an organization in relation to its industry peers and normally consist of a survey containing quantitative and qualitative information.  CSC Big Data Maturity Tool  The CSC Big Data maturity tool acts as a comparative tool to benchmark an organization‚Äôs big data maturity. A survey is undertaken and the results are then compared to other organizations within a specific industry and within the wider market.  TDWI Big Data Maturity Model  The TDWI Big Data Maturity Model is a model in the current big data maturity area and therefore consists of a significant body of knowledge. Maturity Stages The different stages of maturity in the TDWI BDMM can be summarized as follows: Stage 1: Nascent The nascent stage as a pre‚Äìbig data environment. During this stage: * The organization has a low awareness of big data or its value; * There is little to no executive support for the effort and only some people in the organization are interested in potential value of big data; * The Organization understand the benefits of analytics and may have a data warehouse * An organization‚Äôs governance strategy is typically more IT-centric rather than being integrative business-and-IT centric. Stage 2: Pre-Adoption During the pre-adoption stage: * The organization start to investigate big data analytics. Stage 3: Early Adoption The Chasm There is then generally a series of hurdles it needs to overcome. These hurdles include: * Obtaining the right skill set to support the capability, including Hadoop and advanced analytical skills; * Political issues, i.e. big data projects are conducted in areas within the organization and trying to expand the effort or enforcing more stringent standards and governance lead to issues regarding ownership and control. Stage 4: Corporate Adoption The corporate adoption stage is characterized by the involvement of end-users, an organization gains further insight and the way of conducting business is transformed. During this stage: * End-users might have started operationalizing big data analytics or changing their decision making processes; * Most organizations would already have repeatedly addressed certain gaps in their infrastructure, data management, governance and analytics. Stage 5: Mature / Visionary. Only a few organizations can be considered as visionary in terms of big data and big data analytics. During this stage an organization: * Is able to execute big data programs as a well-oiled machine with highly mature infrastructure * Has a well-established big data program and big data governance strategies. * Executes its big data program as a budgeted and planned initiative from an organization-wide perspective. * Employees share a level of excitement and energy around big data and big data analytics. Research Findings TDWI did an assessment on 600 organizations and found that the majority of organizations are either in the Pre-Adoption (50%) or Early Adoption (36%) stages. Additionally, only 8% of the sample have managed to move past the chasm towards corporate adoption or being mature/visionary. == Prescriptive Models == The majority of prescriptive BDMMs follow a similar modus operandi in that the current situation is first assessed followed by phases plotting the path towards increased big data maturity. Examples are as follows:  Info-Tech Big Data Maturity Assessment Tool  This maturity model is prescriptive in the sense that the model consists of four distinct phases that each plot a path towards Big Data Maturity. Phases are: * Phase 1, Undergo Big Data Education * Phase 2, Assess Big Data Readiness * Phase 3, Pinpoint a Killer Big Data Use Case * Phase 4, Structure a Big Data Proof-of-Concept Project.  Radcliffe Big Data Maturity Model  The Radcliffe Big Data Maturity Model, as other models, also consists of distinct maturity levels ranging from: * 0 ‚Äì In the Dark * 1 ‚Äì Catching up * 2 ‚Äì First Pilot * 3 ‚Äì Tactical Value * 4 ‚Äì Strategic Leverage * 5 ‚Äì Optimize & Extend  Booz & Company's Model  This BDMM provides a framework that not only enables organizations to view the extent of their current maturity, but also to identify goals and opportunities for growth in big data maturity. The model consists of four stages namely, * Stage 1: Performance Management * Stage 2: Functional Area Excellence * Stage 3: Value Proposition enhancement * Stage 4: Business model transformation  Van Veenstra's Model  The prescriptive model proposed by Van Veenstra aims to firstly explore the existing big data environment of the organization followed by exploitation opportunities and a growth path towards big data maturity. The model makes use of four phases namely: * Efficiency * Effectiveness * New Solutions * Transformation. == Critical Evaluation == Current BDMMs have been evaluated under the following criteria: * Completeness of the model structure (completeness, consistency) * The quality of model development and evaluation (trustworthiness, stability) * Ease of application (ease of use, comprehensibility) * Big Data value creation (actuality, relevancy, performance) The TDWI and CSC have the strongest overall performance with steady scores in each of the criteria groups. The overall results communicate that the top performer models are extensive, balanced, well-documented, easy to use, and they address a good number of big data capabilities that are utilized in business value creation. The models of Booz & Company and Knowledgent are close seconds and these mid-performers address big data value creation in a commendable manner, but fall short when examining the completeness of the models and the ease of application. Knowledgent suffers from poor quality of development, having barely documented any of its development processes. The rest of the models, i.e. Infotech, Radcliffe, van Veenstra and IBM, have been categorized as low performers. Whilst their content is well aligned with business value creation through big data capabilities, they all lack quality of development, ease of application and extensiveness. Lowest scores were awarded to IBM and Van Veenstra, since both are providing low level guidance for the respective maturity model‚Äôs practical use, and they completely lack in documentation, ultimately resulting in poor quality of development and evaluation. == See also == * Big data * Analytics * Maturity model * Data management * Capability Maturity Model == References == Category:Big data ","title":"Big Data Maturity Model"},{"id":"54099819","text":"Riaz Gujjar (Punjabi) is a 1991 Pakistani, action and a musical film directed by Hassan Askari and produced by Muhammad Younis.

It served the United States military installations in the Gulf Coast of the United States through two world wars, and up through 2005 when it was closed and sold to the city of New Orleans. ==Establishment== Robert F. Broussard, United States Senator from Louisiana, urged Quartermaster General of the United States Army Henry Granville Sharpe to consider New Orleans as a location for a new supply depot to equip Gulf Coast military regiments that had formed in response to the 1917 outbreak of World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, making it one of thirteen Army supply depots in the United States as of that date. It served military installations in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and the Panama Canal Zone. ==Base closing== When the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission took effect, military units moved elsewhere, and the base was closed September 15, 2011, and sold to the City of New Orleans. Concern about the future of the historic structures that were no longer under Federal jurisdiction led to a Programmatic Agreement (PA) as a means of oversight. ==National Register of Historic Places listing== It was listed on the NRHP Orleans Parish, Louisiana on February 1, 2016. There are nine contributing resources. Of those, three original warehouses were used as storage for military supplies and munitions from 1918 through 1945.

It existed from 1962 to around 1965. It offered consulting and services in data processing, information technology, credit information processing, and advanced business techniques and management methods. One mid-1963 description given to a trade industry publication was that Hughes Dynamics provided a \\"broad range of research and consulting services in management sciences and information technology; operations research, systems analysis and design, computer programming and operations, [and] market research\\" and that its business model involved \\"consultation with businesses, industries, governments, [and] institutions [as well as] fee for services\\". It staged a rapid growth from mid-1962 to early 1964, primarily through acquisitions, but then just as quickly shut itself down and dispersed its businesses. The role of Howard Hughes in all this is somewhat unclear. ==Origins== The first mentions of Hughes Dynamics, including Help Wanted ads for positions within the company and speaker notices for a seminar on data retrieval, began appearing as early as July 1962 in newspapers in Louisiana and Texas. The employment ad was listed for \\"males\\" and offered \\"unusual career opportunities for experience professionals in information systems research and engineering computer programming technical systems marketing in Houston and Dallas, Texas.\\" The existence of Hughes Dynamics was publicly announced on or about September 1, 1962. Much of its staff consisted of scientists, engineers, or other such technical positions. The general manager of Hughes Dynamics was John E. Hodges, who had been a vice president of Hughes Tool Company. The initial emphases of the new venture were said by the announcement to be \\"technical, scientific and management services to the oil and transport industries.\\" The new entity was based in Los Angeles, California. The central computer facilities were acquired from the firm C-E- I-R and consisted of IBM 360 mainframes in the Miracle Mile area. It also had offices in Houston and elsewhere. The core business of the parent company, Hughes Tool, was the manufacture of drill bits for wells and associated products and services. The announcement regarding Hughes Dynamics was made by Raymond Holliday, Executive Vice President of the Hughes Tool Company. Holliday was a longtime assistant in the Hughes organization who was functionally a chief officer of Hughes Tool from 1957 on (and who would become CEO of it in 1972 after Howard Hughes sold it to the public). Another announcement of Hughes Dynamics, Inc. was made in April 1963, with F. William \\"Bill\\" Gay being named as \\"executive committee chairman\\" of the new division of Hughes Tools. Gay was a longtime Hughes executive who was a senior vice president of Hughes Tools at the time. Gay said, \\"Creation of the new subsidiary ... is an important step forward in Hughes Tool Company's broad diversification program.\\" c. April 1963, p. xliv?. ==Divisions and acquisitions== Hughes Dynamics' business ventures consisted of ones that came from other parts of Hughes as well as from firms it bought. Over the 18 months from July 1962 to January 1964, it grew both from Hughes-originated activities as well as going on an extended buying spree in terms of acquisitions. In terms of parts existing in Hughes, the CPM Systems Department of Hughes Dynamics was formed by Russell D. Archibald and two other people coming over from Hughes Aircraft; the staff eventually grew larger. It used Critical path method (CPM) and Program evaluation and review technique (PERT) techniques, which were in use in various parts of the Hughes organization as part of achieving best efficiency. It then used these techniques for projects in aerospace and in building construction and sold those services on both a consulting and a service bureau basis. The CPM unit also did work in promulgating the CPM and PERT methodologies, giving a series of week-long classes in Los Angeles, Houston, and New York in the technique to production managers in the aerospace and other government contracting industries, as well as to private groups such as the American Building Contractors Association. The controversial figure John H. Meier worked Hughes Dynamics as a marketing assistant, where he was known as \\"Dr. Meier\\" and was said to hold two doctorates, despite in reality having little education beyond the high school level. (Meier later rose to a level of some prominence in the greater Hughes organization.) By January 1964, some 30 employees of Hughes Dynamics were located in Midland, Texas, doing the data processing work at the Permian Basin oil fields, in an effort to bring $2 million worth of computers and related equipment to the forefront of oil exploration. In terms of acquisitions, in April 1963, the Electrada Corporation sold its Advanced Information Systems unit to Hughes Dynamics. The Advanced Information Systems group specialized in non-numerical computing and, led by engineer John A. Postley, had developed a file management program, originally called GIRLS (the Generalized Information Retrieval and Listing System), that had gone through several refinements and at this point was called Mark II and Mark III and largely sold to the municipal government sector. In April 1963, Hughes Dynamics acquired a ten- year option to buy the majority of the stock of Dashew Business Machines, a maker of computer peripherals founded by business data pioneer Stanley Dashew. Dashew was looking to garner additional monies with which to expand his business. Automated Systems International, a Detroit-based firm that makes computer-operated information systems for automotive business, was acquired by Hughes Dynamics in June 1963. Sometime during 1963, Hughes Dynamics bought Consumer Credit Clearance, a credit information service that had been in business since 1942. The acquisition was certainly in place by early November 1963, when help wanted ads declared the credit firm to be a division of Hughes Dynamics.See this search result Hughes Dynamics acquired Tellertron, a real- time transaction processing system for savings banks that was owned by Stone Laboratories, in November 1963. By January 1964, there was speculation that Hughes Dynamics was also going to start selling commercial computers. By one accounting, Hughes Dynamics acquired some 30 small firms in all. By another account, $9.5 million of Hughes Tool money was invested in Hughes Dynamics. ==What did Howard Hughes know?== The role of Howard Hughes in all this is unclear, especially given the secretive world of his empire. Some accounts, such as one from computer historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, seem to ascribe the creation of Hughes Dynamics to Hughes' personal desire to enter the computer services market. Accounts later told by some executives of other companies also imply that Hughes himself was aware of or played a role in what was going on. However, according to investigative journalists and Hughes biographers Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, who quote the testimony of Robert Maheu, another top-level Hughes associate, Hughes Dynamics had been \\"formed without [Hughes'] knowledge\\" by Bill Gay. Indeed, according to Maheu, Hughes only found out about the existence of the entity by happenstance: Hughes Dynamics was preparing to take part of the top floor of an office building in Los Angeles, the other part of which was occupied by a high-end restaurant. When Jean Peters, Hughes' wife, went to have lunch at the restaurant, one of the eatery's staff members told her how happy they were that her husband's company would be sharing the floor with them. Once back home, Peters related this to Hughes, who became furious. There were later grievances and fallings out among Hughes, Gay, Maheu, and Meier, a few of which are associated with the existence of Hughes Dynamics and the money that was spent on it. pp. 72ff, see in particular p. 126. Authors of a more conspiratorial bent, such as Carl Oglesby, have worked Hughes Dynamics into their greater narratives, such that it was intended to eventually compete with IBM and represented part of a long- running contest for power between Northeastern and Southwestern elites. ==Dismantling== In any case, after the immediate results from being in the computer services field for what seems to have been less than two years proved to be poor, someone within the Hughes organization decided to exit the business. This included the activity of making software. Campbell-Kelly ascribes this action to \\"the capricious Hughes.\\" Barlett and Steele also state that, once Hughes found out about the firm and how much money had been put into it, he ordered it shut down. News articles describing cuts at Hughes Dynamics began appearing as soon as March 1964, with reports that as many as half the company's employees had been let go. Postley of the Advanced Information Systems unit later told the story of what happened from his perspective: In the same vein, Archibald recalled a very similar conversation regarding a Hughes executive notifying the CPM unit and telling the executive that contracts had to be completed. So in March and April 1964, the CPM business was split out into a new firm, CPM Systems, Inc. Archibald served as its president. Then in May 1964, Advanced Information Systems was sold by Hughes Dynamics to Informatics, Inc. The sales price was essentially nothing: Hughes actually paid Informatics $38,000 to take it, but in doing so, Informatics assume some existing customer obligations of about the same amount. (A few years after that, a further successor to Mark III, the fourth- generation programming language MARK IV, was released by Informatics for the IBM System/360; it would go on to become the most important and best-selling product from an independent software vendor during the mainframe era. CPM Systems would also later be bought by Informatics as well.) Datamation magazine reported around mid-1964 that the firm was shifting its emphasis from software to hardware, and at that point, only 10 percent of Hughes Dynamics employees would likely remain with the company after all of these moves were complete. c. June 1964, p. 85?. In December 1964, Hughes sold Consumer Credit Clearance to a new firm that operated under that name; the sales price was $2,050,000. The Hughes Dynamics relationship with Dashew Business Machines lasted into 1965. According to Dashew's later recollections, Hughes executives mismanaged the company and did not commit the pledged financing, and so Dashew's firm went into bankruptcy that year. In August 1965, Hughes Dynamics, which by that point had acquired 41 percent of Dashew Business Machines' stock, infused it with some funds to keep it going while in reorganization. Dashew later said that the relationship with the Hughes organization had been the worst experience of his business career, adding with a dry wit, \\"The chances of successful partnership are lessened when the principal partner is inaccessible.\\" When the last vestiges of Hughes Dynamics disappeared, and the entity ceased to exist is unclear. A long April 1966 article in the New York Times describing Howard Hughes' battle for control of Trans World Airlines still lists Hughes Dynamics as one of seven subsidiaries underneath Hughes Tool Company. However, there is no indication that it had any operational activities by that point. ==References== Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Aerospace companies of the United States Category:Technology companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Defunct computer companies based in California Category:1962 establishments in California Category:1965 disestablishments in California Category:Howard Hughes ","title":"Hughes Dynamics"},{"id":"54100381","text":"The Downtown Philadelphia Historic District is a designated area within the city limits of Philadelphia, Mississippi in Neshoba County.

The CD was named for Deutsch and is considered a continuation of the line of Panhard-powered vehicles built by Deutsch-Bonnet. The car was the production version of the CD Dyna that raced at Le Mans in June 1962. ==The CD Dyna== At the end of 1961 the partnership between French engineer and aerodynamicist Charles Deutsch and his longtime collaborator Ren√© Bonnet ended. Shortly afterwards venerable French automaker Panhard approached Deutsch to design a successor to his DB HBR 5 for the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans. While this would be Deutsch's first solo project, he had already designed cars with Panhard components, and a detailed drawing of a car that anticipated the CD Dyna, and may have been a planned HBR 6, dates from as early as October 19, 1960. Panhard gave approval for work to start on the car at the end of January 1962, and factory manager Etienne de Valance began to build a team of drivers. Five cars were built; one prototype with a body of hand-hammered steel and four more with bodywork in glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) by Chappe et Gessalin. A tubular steel space-frame was considered but the car would instead get a steel backbone chassis. The first car, chassis number 101, was finished in just 70 days. The next four cars were given designations 102 through 105. The car was variously called the CD-Panhard coach, the Panhard et Levassor CD Le Mans and the CD-Panhard Dyna Coup√©, but in the results of the 1962 24 Heures du Mans it is listed as the CD Dyna. The design of the body was handled by Deutsch and aerodynamicist Lucien Romani along with his prot√©g√© Marcel Hubert. The engines were the air-cooled boxer twins designed by Panhard's Louis Delagarde and tuned by Deutsch and Soci√©t√© Moteur Moderne. Power was boosted by means of enlarged valves, a higher-lift camshaft and two Zenith down-draught carburetors. While the first engine built had also been enlarged to 954 cc the Le Mans cars would all have a smaller 702 cc engine. The car's transaxle was from the Panhard PL 17. Racing the CD Dyna The coup√© first appeared at the Le Mans test days in April 1962, where the car was registered in the class for prototypes with engines of up to . Drivers Pierre Lelong and Bernard Boyer posted the 20th and 21st best times of the day. On 27 May 1962 chassis 101 and 102 were brought to the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring. Chassis 101 was driven by the team of Andr√© Guilhaudin and Bernard Boyer and chassis 102 by Jean-Pierre Hanrioud and Alain Bertaut. The Hanrioud/Bertaut car did not finish due to an accident, but the Guilhaudin/Boyer car finished in 24th place overall. CD Dyna Number 53 Four cars were entered for the 24 Heures du Mans of June 23 and 24 1962. Chassis 103 received number 53 and was driven by the team of Andr√© Guilhaudin and Andr√© Bertaut. Chassis 104 received number 54 and was driven by Pierre Lelong and Jean-Pierre Hanrioud. Chassis 105 received number 55 and was driven by Bernard Boyer and Guy Verrier. A car that is believed to have been chassis 102 received number 70 and was to have been driven by Robert Neyret and Robert Mougin but the car did not arrive. Number 54 was eliminated in the ninth hour of the race due to an accident in which the car overturned and caught fire. Hanrioud, who was driving at the time,managed to walk away from the crash. Boyer and Verrier in number 55 retired in the fourteenth hour with an overheated engine. Number 53, driven by Bertaut and Guildaudin, finished 16th overall and won its class and the \\"Indice de Performance\\". The car also placed third in the \\"Indice au rendement √©nergetique\\", or consumption index, with an average of with a vehicle weight. Guilhaudin and Bertaut's average speed over the entire race at was , while their fastest lap took 5 minutes 22 seconds with a speed of . On September 16 Deutsch brought a CD Dyna with a modified engine and some additional aerodynamic changes to the Hunaude√®res straight where the car reached a top speed of . In October 21, 1962 drivers Andr√© Guilhaudin and Alain Bertaut finished in 20th position at the 1000 km race of Paris. This was the end of the Dyna Coup√©s' racing career. ==The production Panhard CD== Rear three-quarter view The Panhard CD inherited its Grand Touring coup√© body with distinctive tapering rear and \\"double-bubble\\" roof from the CD Dyna. The lightweight body was made of fibreglass, which lent itself to the curvy shape and the economies of a small production run of vehicles. Deutsch and Romani had sculpted a form that was extremely aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient (\\\\scriptstyle C_\\\\mathrm d\\\\,) of 0.22. The body was mounted on a torsionally-rigid central backbone frame that followed the pattern set by earlier DB designs. The complete chassis weighed . The front bodywork was a single piece that tilted up and back to expose the front chassis and entire drive-train. The CD was sold in two trim levels; GT and Rallye. The GT sold for 15,500 francs, and the Rallye for 16,500 francs. The engine in both was Panhard's M5-T \\"Tigre\\". The engine in the GT was a standard model fed by a single Zenith type 38 NDIX down-draught carburetor that made . The Rallye model had two carburetors and produced about . The four-speed gearbox was a Panhard component with a direct-drive third gear and overdrive fourth that drove the front wheels. The transmissions in the Rallye versions had a final-drive ratio almost 10% \\"taller\\" (numerically lower) than the GT. Top speed for the GT was 165 km/h, and 180 km/h for the Rallye. Suspension was independent at all four corners. The front suspension comprised lower A-arms and an upper transverse leaf spring with lever-arm shock-absorbers. The rear suspension was semi-trailing arms with torsion-bars and lever-arm shock- absorbers. Steering was rack-and-pinion from the PL17. Braking was by System ETA (√©v√©cuation thermale acc√©l√©r√©), with a light alloy drum on the outside of the wheel for cooling and an iron lining. Tires were Michelin XAS FF 145x380 front and rear. The Panhard CD debuted at the 1962 Salon de l'Auto in Paris. Due to problems encountered producing the fibreglass bodies the first cars were not delivered until April 1963. In September 1964 the Panhard CD won the Grand Prix de l'Art et de l'Industrie Automobiles Fran√ßais (Sports and Grand Touring category) at the Paris Salon de l'Auto. From 1963 to July 1965, 179 cars were sold: 122 GTs and 57 Rallyes. Adding the five CD Dyna brings the total production for all cars to 184. The chassis numbers began with 101 for the first steel-bodied prototype, went from 102 to 105 for the rest of the CD Dynas and then continued into the production series with numbers from 106 to 284. According to some sources three additional cars were left unassembled. ==The Panhard LM64== LM64 After going to Le Mans in 1963 with a car powered by a DKW two-stroke three-cylinder engine, Deutsch returned in 1964 with a new ultra-streamlined Panhard-powered car called the LM64. Two cars were built; LM64/1 and LM64/2. These cars retained the central backbone chassis from the production Panhard CD, revised by Jean Claude Haenel. The transverse leaf spring in the front suspension was replaced by coil springs. Once again Romani took the lead shaping the body. He produced a shape with completely covered headlamps, smooth sides with front and rear wheel spats and a smooth underfloor with a section towards the rear of the car shaped like a diffuser in an early use of \\"effet de sol\\" or \\"ground effect\\" to produce down-force. A more obvious feature was the two large vertical fins at the rear for stability at high speeds. The result of this work was that the LM64s had a drag coefficient even lower than that of the Panhard CD, with a \\\\scriptstyle C_\\\\mathrm d\\\\, of just 0.12. Due to safety concerns cars with engines smaller than 1 litre were not allowed to run at Le Mans beginning in 1964. To overcome that restriction the engine in the LM64s received a Sferma supercharger along with other changes that included twin-iginition and dual Zenith carburetors. By applying the 1.4 multiplication factor for engines with forced-induction the effective displacement of the 848 cc Panhard engines rose to 1187 cc making the car eligible for the under 1200 cc class. Power output was up to . The transaxle used was a ZF 5-speed unit. Racing the LM64 One of the LM64s appeared at the Le Mans test. Driver Alain Bertault posted the 33rd fastest time. One car was slated to appear at the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring but did not arrive. Both LM64s were entered at Le Mans in 1964. Guy Verrier and Pierre Lelong drove LM64/1 with car number 45. They qualified 55th, but were forced to retire when their gearbox failed. LM64/2, driven by the team of Andr√© Guilhaudin and Alain Bertault, received car number 44. This car qualified 54th but left the race before its sister car due to a failed engine. Deutsch did not race the cars again. LM64/1 was kept in storage until 1979.

He served for sixteen years at Lloyds Bank of California, rising to be vice-president and head of its international division. Delwari returned to Afghanistan in early 2002, to work as senior advisor to the minister of Finance. In 2003 he founded the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency and served as its president until November 2004 when he became head of Da Afghanistan Bank in 2005. Although the House of the People initially rejected his appointment as governor of the central bank in 2006, he stayed on as governor until 2007. After 2007 Delwari became chief of an Afghan investment support NGO and was reappointed as governor of Da Afghanistan Bank in November 2011, after previous governor Abdul Qadir Fitrat in the aftermath following the Kabul Bank scandal. Fitrat claimed he was under threat for investigating fraud at the privately owned Kabul Bank. Although critics said Delwari does not have a good record from his previous stint as director of the bank, the trusted acquaintance of Karzai kept his position until he handed in his resignation on 6 December 2014.

Introduced in 2017, the vehicle is based on the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, and replaced the ≈†koda Yeti. The car slots between the smaller ≈†koda Kamiq and the larger ≈†koda Kodiaq. == Overview == The car was officially introduced at a special event on 18 May 2017 in Stockholm, Sweden. The car began to be produced at the turn of June and July 2017 in Kvasiny. The sales started in the autumn of 2017. It is a sister model to the SEAT Ateca, sharing its chassis, roof stamping and side doors, although Volkswagen Group adopted extra measures to maximally differentiate their design by applying each brand's design language. Compared to its predecessor, the ≈†koda Yeti, the Karoq is significantly larger. It is 160 mm longer, 35 mm wider and 40 mm lower than the Yeti, and the wheelbase is 60 mm longer. It is not being marketed as the second generation Yeti to have a naming consistency with the Kamiq and Kodiaq. The new Karoq name is also adopted to boost the car's global appeal, since in China, one of the large market for the Karoq, the yeti association is seen as a negative and 'polarized', as referred by ≈†koda board member for sales and marketing Werner Eichhorn. The name Karoq comes just like the name Kodiaq from Aleuts, the native inhabitants of Alaskan island Kodiak. The name Karoq was created by a combination of Aleutian words Kaa'Raq and Ruq, a car and an arrow, which is the motive of the ≈†koda logo. The Karoq is available in two and four-wheel-drive configurations. Higher trim levels will come with a Driving Mode Select system with five modes, while an Off-Road mode featuring traction control and electronic differential lock is an option on four-wheel-drive models. The Karoq's suspension features a MacPherson-designed front axle with triangular wishbones, and a four-link rear axle. A Dynamic Chassis Control system on the 1.5-litre TSI and 2.0-litre TDI engines will offer three chassis modes which are Comfort, Standard and Sport with electrically operated valves adjusting based on road conditions. It is Skoda‚Äôs best-selling model in 2019, with global deliveries already exceeding 137,700 units in the first 11 months of the year. In 2018, the automaker delivered 115,700 units to customers worldwide, with the total number of units built since the model‚Äôs launch in October 2017 reaching the 250,000 mark in mid-September 2019.

The vehicle made its domestic debut at the 2017 Guangzhou Auto Show with the Chinese name Ke Luoke (ÊüØÁèûÂÖã). Compared to the European model, the car is longer by and the wheelbase is increased by . It went on sale in January 2018. The vehicle is used as a basis for a Volkswagen-badged sister model called the Volkswagen Tharu.  Russian market  The Karoq entered production on 12 December 2019 at Volkswagen Group‚Äôs Nizhny Novgorod plant in Russia through CKD kits. It went on sale in Russia from February 2020. The standard engine choice is a 1.6-litre MPI naturally aspirated four-cylinder petrol engine, while a 1.4-litre TSI petrol is available for higher trims. The base engine comes with a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, while the TSI is mated to either an 8-speed automatic and FWD or a 6-speed DSG transmission with AWD.

The ≈†koda Karoq won the title Car of the Year 2018 in the Czech Republic in January 2018. == Sales == Strong demand for the Karoq forced Volkswagen Group to assemble the car in two additional plants, in Mlad√° Boleslav, Czech Republic from January 2018 and in Volkswagen plant in Osnabr√ºck, Germany from the end of 2018. In April 2018, ≈†koda CEO Bernhard Maier said during Skoda's annual results conference that customers in several markets had to wait for up to 10 months for their car to be delivered.

He was named Hammer of the Year. ==International career== Republic of Ireland Although born in London, Rice was eligible to play for Ireland as his grandparents are from Cork. On 19 March 2017, Rice was named Republic of Ireland U17 player of the year.

He made his senior debut on 23 March 2018 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Turkey. In August 2018, Rice was omitted from the squad to play Wales by manager Martin O'Neill, who said that Rice was considering switching to play for England after being approached by them. By November 2018, having been omitted from three squads selected by O'Neill, Rice said he was no closer in deciding whether to play for Ireland or England. In December 2018, Rice met with new Ireland manager Mick McCarthy and his assistant, Robbie Keane. McCarthy said that Rice was a potential future captain of Ireland and that he would build the team around Rice should he decide to play for the country.

Two locomotives of this series were involved in the train disaster at Twello (The Netherlands) in 1900. ==NRS 101-109 (HSM 350-358, NS 1601-1609)== The Nederlandsche Rhijnspoorweg- Maatschappij (NRS) ordered nine locomotives numbered 101-109 at Sharp Stewart and Company located in Glasgow in 1899. The axle configuration of these locomotives was 2'B. These were the first locomotives in The Netherlands with a bogie in front of the driving wheels. Originally these locomotives were equipped with a speedometer of the system Kapteyn, which was driven by one of the axles of the bogie. A sanding system of Gresham & Craven was fitted as well. A year after the order of these locomotives, the NRS was disbanded and these were its last locomotives ordered. The equipment of the disbanded railroad was split over Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (HSM) and Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (SS); each railroad receiving the same number of locomotives randomly being assigned. Locomotives 101, 102, 103, 108 and 109 transferred to the SS and were renumbered in SS numbers 1101-1103 and 1108-1109. Locomotives 104-107 transferred to HSM and were renumbered HSM 350-353. As the locomotives were too long for the small SS turntables, the SS transferred them in 1891 to the HSM, where they were renumbered 354-358. They were nicknamed \\"Rhijnbogen\\" at the HSM in honour of their NRS heritage and their bogies. At the merger of the equipment of HSM and SS in 1921, the locomotives were numbered in the NS 1601-1609. The locomotives were taken out of service between 1935 and 1938, with the exception of 1604. This locomotive continued in service until 1940. Locomotive 1604 was chosen for inclusion in the collection of the Dutch Railway Museum (Nederlands Spoorwegmuseum). To this purpose it was stored in the locomotive facility in Maastricht. On 8 September 1944 the locomotive was severely damaged due to war activities. After the complete liberation of The Netherlands, the NS main service center in Tilburg fully restored the locomotive. The locomotive was restored to the brown outfit of the NRS, with its original number 107. The locomotive has been on display in the Spoorwegmuseum since March 1955. After the completion of modernization of the Spoorwegmuseum, completed in 2005, the locomotive can be viewed from the bottom as well. ==HSM 359-408 (NS 1610-1659)== The HSM was impressed by the service of the locomotive, and ordered an additional 40 locomotives at Sharp Steward and Company. These additional locomotives had a wider smokebox, a chimney with a crown and rising support plates next to the smokebox. The additional units entered service between 1891 and 1892, with numbers 359-398. In 1900 another 5 locomotives were ordered at Sharp Stewart and Company and delivered with numbers 399-403. In 1903 another 5 units were added to the order. These locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company, into which Sharp Stewart and Company was included. They were numbered 404-408. In 1921 the locomotives were renumbered in NS 1610-1659. These last units had a higher steam pressure and a larger tractive force of 5030 kg. The steam dome was located further to the rear on the boiler. Later in their career nine locomotives (350-358) received tenders from HSM 600 series locomotives (601-605 and 609-612) when these units entered service in 1895 and 1896. These new tenders had larger water and coal capacity and were more suitable for fast-train service. Numbers 1614, 1633, 1636, 1636 and 1646 did get a superheater installed in 1921. Due to poor results, the planned application to the other units was cancelled. The locomotives were withdrawn from service starting from 1936 to 1949. Unit 1614, withdrawn from service in 1938, was used a stationary boiler in Zwolle. In 1940, the locomotive re-entered service, with its superheater elements being shorted. Locomotive 1622 was the last of the series to be withdrawn from service in 1949. Units 1614, 1621 and 1640 got a Weir feeder pump installed. ==Rental== In 1899 the Nederlandsche Centraal-Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NCS) rented locomotive 105 from the NRS for a few months. As the turntable in Zwolle was too short for the locomotive, the locomotive and tender were disconnected, turned separately and reconnected. The NCS rented 390, 395 and 405 of the HSM for a few months in 1917. ==Overview== {  style=\\"float\\" - ! Manufacturer ! Builder Number ! Build in ! NRS number ! SS number ! HSM number ! NS number !

The Reichsstra√üen were created in 1934 for the German Reich. The R 15 began in Gera and went through Schleiz, Hof, Wunsiedel and Marktredwitz to Mitterteich. From Mitterteich, it followed today's route to the connection to the Inntalautobahn near Rosenheim. From there, the R 15 went through Brannenburg and Oberaudorf to the border at Kiefersfelden. After the Anschluss in 1938, the R 15 was extended via Kufstein to W√∂rgl. In Kufstein, an auxiliary road, R 15a, branched off and went to the R 31 near Ellmau. In 1941, the path of the R 15 north of Mitterteich was changed. Now, the R 15 began in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad and traveled through Falkenau (Sokolov), Eger (Cheb), and Waldsassen to Mitterteich and from then on, the same path as before. The part from Gera to Hof was given to the R 2, and the part from Hof to Mitterteich was given the designation of R 303. After World War II, the path of the road was changed again. The B 15 now began in Hof and led over Selb and Marktredwitz to Mitterteich, and then south to the Austrian border as before. The part of the road between Eger and Mitterteich that was still within Germany became part of B 299. == References == 015 ","title":"Bundesstra√üe 15"},{"id":"54100623","text":"The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore is a 1908 painting by Claude Monet. It is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This painting, catalogued W1755, is one of six versions of this scene painted by Monet in 1908. Other versions are held by the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/3054 ==Early history and creation== Monet created this work during his visit to Venice in late 1908. He returned to his home in France with many paintings incomplete, and he took a few years to prepare 29 works for exhibition. In 1912 he held a successful show Claude Monet Venise at the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Six of these paintings were created in order to capture the different light effects created throughout the day. Monet often made multiple copies of the same work of art; this process is better known as series painting. His series paintings originated in his early career when he and other impressionists became interested in en plein air and were inspired by the effects of changing light. The Doge's Palace was done later in his career after he had already established his artistic style, however this work is considered less successful because of the little time he spent in Venice and that he had to finish the series by memory later in Paris. ==Description and interpretation== The Doge's Palace is made with oil on canvas and its dimensions are 25 3/4 x 36 1/2 inches. This work depicts the Doge's Palace, an iconic landmark of Venice and the historic seat of government of the Republic of Venice, along with buildings of the Riva degli Schiavoni waterfront. The scene is viewed from the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. ==Later history and influence== Although Monet spent little time in Venice, works that he started in Venice, such as The Doge's Palace, are some of his most highly regarded artworks. These paintings capture his signature style and influence from the effervescent Venetian sunset. After this painting was exhibited in Paris in 1912 it went on to travel the world, and has now made a permanent home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, N.Y.

Henry C.

Lane was an American lithographer and a maritime painter who lived most his life in the New England fishing city of Gloucester, Massachusetts, north of Boston, Massachusetts, on Cape Ann. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Early history and creation== This is the house flag for clipper ships of Chambers & Heiser, a New York-based multi-vessel merchant marine company. Although Lane spent much of his life in Massachusetts, he had a strong incentive during the early 1850s to spend time in New York City, a busy seaport full of activity for a maritime artist. First, Lane's work was being sold through exhibitions at New York galleries. Second, Lane was hired by Chambers & Heiser, a New York merchant shipping line, to provide the dramatic image of the company's new vessel, the Golden State. The ship, built for travel to California - during the California Gold Rush - around Cape Horn during a period when transcontinental land crossings across North America were not reliable, was launched in 1853, the same year that Westervelt was elected Mayor of New York City. For Lane, the work in 1854 on The Golden State Entering New York Harbor was a repeat commission. Chambers & Heiser had brought him to New York during the previous year to paint the company's clipper ship Sweepstakes. ==Description and interpretation== The Golden State Entering New York Harbor is rich in detail. As noted by the Fitz Henry Lane Online Project of the Cape Ann Museum (Cape Ann is the rocky cape north of Boston on which Gloucester sits), the painting shows New York City in the background, as seen from New Jersey. A steamship is shown just past the bow of the Golden State. A variety of vessels plies New York Harbor. As he was hired by the owner of Golden State for his second commission, Lane was incentivized to show energy and a plethora of vessel types, all adding up to the idea that New York was foremost world harbor. Four stylistic characteristics are seen in The Golden State Entering New York Harbor. First, Golden State evidences the luminism style of American landscape painting in the 1850s through the 1870s. Luminism uses careful attention to light in landscapes, aerial perspective, and concealment of visible brushstrokes to emphasize tranquility. Water is often calm and reflective; the sky is often soft and hazy. The Hudson River school typifies luminicsm in art. Second, Golden State shows strong influence onto Lane's work from Robert Salmon (1775-1845), an English artist who lived in Boston and was the preeminent marine painter of his time. His studio was near Lane's lithography shop in Boston, where Lane lived during his early adult years. The Fitz Henry Lane Online Project notes, \\"[W]e have no direct evidence of contact or a teacher-student relationship. Lane's early works are so indebted to Salmon they have been confused with his in the past. In this case [i.e., Golden State], the wind-whipped waves diagonally patterned across the canvass are very much like Salmon's style, as are he light-and-dark patterns of the cloud and a tumultuous harbor scene crowded with vessels.\\" Third, Golden State shows a turn by Lane from landscapes and shoreline structures to maritime activity. Lane's commissions in New York City from Chambers & Heiser led to larger and more detailed, busier paintings. Additionally, Lane had established a market for his art in Boston; he wanted his New York exhibitions to add to his business success. Fourth, Golden State as well as Sweepstakes are the only two known paintings of Lane in which he signed his full name. On Golden State, the signature reads: \\"Fitz Henry Lane, Gloucester, Mass. A.D. 1854.\\" The Fitz Henry Lane Online Project speculates that Lane wanted his new clients in New York City to remember all his painting details. ==Later history and influence== This photo is from the book, American Clipper Ships 1833‚Äì1858, by Octavius T. Howe and Frederick C. Matthews, Vol. 1 (Salem, Mass.: Marine Research Society, 1926). The caption published in the book reads: \\"Golden State, 1363 tons, built at New York, in 1852. From a photograph showing her in dock at Quebec in 1884.\\" The ship Golden State was sold in 1855 to A.A. Low & Brother, the clipper and old China trade business owned by Abiel Abbot Low.

The caftan is reconstructed from garment fragments excavated from a burial ground near Moshchevaja Balka (located by the Bolshaya Laba River in Karachay- Cherkessia, on the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe). Moshchevaja Balka is considered part of the Saltovo-Mayaki archaeological culture. The caftan is associated with a pair of silk leggings with linen feet, also in the Met. Along with fragmentary garments from Moshchevaja Balka in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, the caftan and leggings represent rare survivals of garments from the Caucasus, where the climate‚Äîunlike that of more arid regions‚Äîis not generally conducive to the preservation of organic materials. == Context == The Silk Road was the great overland trade route of the Ancient World, carrying goods including silks from China to the Mediterranean. By the 6th century C.E., tensions between Byzantium and the Sasanian Empire disrupted trade along the traditional route. Central Asian merchants developed a new route to Byzantium, going north from the Caspian Sea and crossing the Caucasus Mountains via steep passes (most prominently in the North Caucasus, the Darial Gorge). The first caravan carrying Chinese silks traveled via this North Caucasus route in 568. The Caucasus silk routes remained in use through the Middle Ages, losing their importance only in the 14th century. In the 20th century, many textile finds of this period were discovered near the mountain passes and on the piedmont below. The main site is a burial ground at Moshchevaja Balka (\\"Ravine of the Mummies or Relics\\"), in a densely wooded area about above sea level.Knauer (2004), p. 4 Anna A. Ierusalimskaja, curator of the North Caucasian antiquities in the Hermitage, has written extensively on the finds (in Russian and in German), but Elfriede R. Knauer concludes that \\"neither the age and places of manufacture of the majority of Chinese silks nor of those from the eastern Mediterranean recovered at the North Caucasian sites can as yet be defined with absolute certainty. In the absence of further criteria, Ierusalimskaja's dates can only be accepted with caution.\\"See These finds provide the context for the Met's caftan. It is consistent with documented finds from Moshchevaja Balka, where several tribes of the North Caucasus \\"seem to have shared a fairly uniform and‚Äîwere it not for the textile finds‚Äîunspectacular material culture, known as the Saltovo-Majaki culture\\". The wearer could have been a man from Alania, in a region then under Khazar domination. These tribal horsemen would have served as local guides and carriers, collecting short lengths of silk as \\"tolls and rewards\\" in kind from among the textiles shipped via the northern route of the ancient Silk Road.Knauer (2001), p. 8 == Construction == Rear view of the caftan, showing the silk borders on the slits of the skirt panels. The caftan is made of dense, bleached plain weave linen, now discolored from the grave. It is trimmed with a border of two distinct woven silk textiles, and had a sheepskin lining of which only traces remain. The cut or shape of the caftan is distinctive to men's coats of the Adygo-Alanic tribes of the central Caucasus, although the style shows influences from Persia, Central Asia, and the nomads of the steppe.Knauer (2001), p. 10 The caftan is fitted to the upper body and has a flared skirt attached at the waist. The front is double-breasted, with the \\"proper left front closing toward the right and the right front overlapping it\\".Kajitani (2001), p. 11 Two long slits at the back, below the hipline, also trimmed with silk borders, accommodate a seated rider. The garment is secured with three sets of frogs, fabric-covered buttons and twisted loops of cording made of bias-cut strips of linen. The caftan is made from linen cloth woven as a bolt of fabric and cut using a \\"semistraight\\" structure, with triangles and trapezoids‚Äîsome of them pieced from smaller fragments of cloth‚Äîassembled to shape the garment. This type of construction is common to traditional garments of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Knauer (2001), p. 16 The lower sleeves and upper neckline of the caftan have not survived, and it is unknown whether a collar or cuffs were part of the garment. The pieces are sewn with linen thread in neat flat-felled seams, and the upper body and skirts were assembled and trimmed separately before being joined at the waist.Kajitani, p. 95 \\"Overall, the high quality of the linen cloth, garment design, cutting, assembling, and sewing demonstrated remarkable professional coordination in comparison with ontemporaneous examples from other cultures, attesting to this region's elevated standards in artistic and technical achievements regarding textile culture and perhaps even social decorum.' == Silk borders == Silk leggings associated with the caftan. The caftan's borders, each about wide, are made of two different designs of polychrome samite (weft-faced compound twill weave) patterned silks. One textile is used for the lapels and the outer border of the lower panels, and the second for the inner border of the lower panels. Both would be visible when the garment was worn. The silk borders are pieced (one from three different bolts of the same general design). They are padded with wool wadding to approximate the thickness of the linen coat with its sheepskin lining. The two silks now appear as patterns of off-white on dark brown, but analysis shows that each is patterned in four colors. It is no longer possible to determine with certainty what colors were used; likely, the designs were originally dark blue from an indigotin-bearing plant, yellow, brilliant red from safflower, and white (undyed silk) on a dark brown or black ground. Ierusalimskaja categorized the silk fragments found at Moshchevaja Balka into groups by likely origin. The majority are suggested to be Sogdian, products of silk-weaving centers in the region surrounding Samarkand. However, within this group is a subset, including the trims on the caftan, that is probably of purely local origin. \\"Fragments of this very circumscribed group have so far not been unearthed beyond sites in the northwestern Caucasus. ... Within the range of \\"Sogdian\\" they are technically much inferior to the rest of the material, in both dyeing and weaving.\\"Knauer, 2001, p. 9 Safflower red dye, especially, degrades rapidly, but all of the dyes used in the silk borders are of poor quality. The circle-and-cross designs are simplified, and the roundels themselves vary in size and shape. All of these factors suggest rural production, likely intended for export.Kajitani (2001), pp. 113‚Äì115 ==References== Category:Clothing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:History of the North Caucasus Category:Individual garments Category:Metropolitan Museum of Art 2017 drafts Category:Silk Road ","title":"Caftan (Metropolitan Museum of Art)"},{"id":"54100786","text":"A supergiant is a massive and luminous star, including: * Blue supergiant star, a hot supergiant * Yellow supergiant star, a supergiant with a temperature similar to the sun * Red supergiant star, a cool supergiant Supergiant may also refer to: * Supergiant Games, a video game development company * Super Giant, a Japanese superhero * Alicella gigantea, the supergiant Amphipod * Rising Pune Supergiant, a cricket team in the Indian Premier League * Type-cD galaxy, a supergiant elliptical galaxy * Supergiant (comics), a fictional character in the Marvel Universe ","title":"Supergiant (disambiguation)"},{"id":"54100795","text":"Manish Prakash is the head of the Telenor B2B division, having served in that role since September 2016. == Career == Prakash is responsible for overall global strategy, overall growth of enterprise revenues and ecosystem innovation utilising digital, cloud, and IoT technologies.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and was purchased by the Museum in 2005 as part of the Gilman Photographs Collection. ==Early history and creation== Onesipe, Self Portrait with his Brother, Olympe Aquado Onesipe Aguado, born May 9, 1830 in √âvry, France was the youngest of three brothers born to the wealthy banker Alexandre Aguado, marquis de las Marismas del Guadalquiver. Onesipe and his oldest brother Olympe Aquado were amateur enthusiasts who split their time between socialite activities, a close family life, and photography. Upon their father's death in 1842, Onesipe and Olympe inherited a considerable fortune that included vacation homes. Onesipe and Olympe were students of Gustave Le Gray, and were active early members of the Societe Francaise de Photographie. They were early makers of photographic enlargements and known for their experimentations with photographic processes‚Äîproducing daguerreotypes, cartes-des-visites, techniques with negative paper for landscapes and collodion on glass for portraits. They were also known for the diversity of their subjects‚Äîdeserted interiors, close studies of trees as well as sweeping pastorals, portraits, reproductions of works of arts and snapshots of sailboats. ==Description and interpretation== The portrait, Woman Seen from the Back, a salted paper print from glass negative, suggests the wit and playfulness of its photographer. The image is devoid of depth, possibly an extension of the artists' work on foreshortening, making the sitter appear two dimensional and merely a silhouette. ==Later history and influence== Aquado's unique composition of his subject‚Äîthat focuses on the subject's back, is also seen in the 1818 painting, Wanderer above the Sea of Fog by Caspar David Friedrich and later, in 1928, in La Mort des Fant√¥meshttp://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/263154 (1928) by Ren√© Magritte.

He was called to the bar in 1908, took silk in 1933 and continued working until his death in 1960. Many of his notable cases were related to divorce, libel, slander and interpretation of the UK gambling laws. ==Early years== Gotz Philip Beyfus, 25 February 1829 Beyfus's parents were Emmie Marguerite Ruth Plumsted and solicitor Alfred Beyfus. His grandfather, Solomon Beyfus, was a London-based furniture manufacturer, trader, diamond dealer and bill discounter. His great- grandfather, Gotz Philip Beyfus, who came to Britain from Germany in the early part of the 19th century, was a professor of languages, taught in the Western Synagogue and was the secretary of the Jews‚Äô Free School. Beyfus had one sibling, a half brother called Alfred Butt, who later became a theatre impresario and politician. Many of his uncles had wide-ranging business interests and these included directors of theatres, department stores, fruit importers, a solicitor, diamond dealers and money lenders. Beyfus was educated at Harrow School (entry 1899) and Trinity College, Oxford where he obtained a second class honours degree in 1907. Later that year he took his examination for the Bar and was awarded a Certificate of Honour. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in January 1908 and took silk in 1933. ==Political life== Beyfus stood for parliament in 1910 as a Liberal candidate for the constituency of Cirencester. The Conservative candidate, Benjamin Bathurst, won the seat with a majority of 8.8%. He next tried for a parliamentary seat in Dudley, again as a Liberal candidate. He was selected and the election was due in 1915, but the start of World War I delayed this. In addition, Beyfus had joined the army and was sent to the front in February 1915. After the war he tried again to win a seat and was selected as a National Liberal candidate for Kingswinford where he was beaten in the 1922 election by the Labour incumbent MP Charles Henry Sitch. In 1923 he was approached by the Liberal Party of East Nottingham to be their candidate, but rejected the offer. In 1937 he joined the Conservative Party and applied twice to be candidates for them, but on both occasions failed to be selected. ==Army career and prisoner of war== At the start of the First World War Befus volunteered to join the army and was appointed on 15 August 1914 as Second Lieutenant to the 3rd Battalion, West Riding Regiment. He had some previous experience having been a member of the 27th Middlesex (Harrow School), Rifle Corps. He joined his regiment in Belgium at Ypres where he suffered shrapnel wounds during the battle for Hill 60 in April 1915. He returned to duty in May and was assigned to Hill 60, which at this time was in the possession of the allied forces. Beyfus narrowly escaped suffocation when the Germans mounted an attack using gas, but in the confusion he was taken prisoner. During the engagement, Beyfus's cousin, Harold Emanuel Beyfus, who was serving with The London Regiment, was fatally wounded and died two days later in Boulogne hospital. Beyfus remained a prisoner until the end of the war but made several attempts to escape. Most notable was his attempt, with two fellow escapees, to cross the Baltic Sea in a 16 ft rowing boat. They were spotted by a coastal patrol and taken back to the prison camp. ==Legal career== In his early career Beyfus obtained legal work from the firm of solicitors Beyfus & Beyfus, owned by his father and his uncle Philip Beyfus. He also represented family members when they became involved with court actions. In 1920 Beyfus represented a client in a case that related to a gambling debt. Beyfus won the case on a technicality, but the outcome had consequences for the gaming industry, forcing them to take a test case to the High Court and then to the House of Lords. On both occasions Beyfus's arguments won the day and in consequence the Government were forced to amend the law. Beyfus became one of the country's leading experts on the gaming laws. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the subject in 1950 and helped M.P. William Rees-Davies frame a private member's bill. In 1933 he was appointed King‚Äôs Counsel. In 1935 he was involved in another gaming related test case, this time connected to the football pools. The test was to establish if the pools company was in breach of section 26 of the 1934 Betting and Lotteries Act. Again Beyfus argued his client's case around a technicality and the judge found in his favour. However, he was not always successful and in 1931 lost a case that involved his client attempting to set up a business selling tickets for Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake in Britain. Ironically a year later Beyfus found out that he had drawn the ticket in the Irish Sweepstake for The Derby favourite Orwell. Sadly the horse ran lame resulting in huge disappointment. In 1958 Beyfus represented John Aspinall and his associate, John Richard Burke, who had both been accused of unlawful gaming in the home of Lady Osborne (Aspinall's Mother). She appeared in court with them but was represented by another barrister. Aspinall had been operating casinos where the principal game was Chemin de Fer, moving locations to avoid the attention of the police. After listening to Beyfus's legal argument the judge told the jury that in his opinion there was no evidence of unlawful gaming and consequently the case was dismissed. One of the longest and most expensive cases he dealt with was in 1935, when he represented a UK dealership that sold Chrysler motorcars. The owner, Arnold de la Poer, alleged that threats and misrepresentation had been used to force him to sell his shares to the American Chrysler motor corporation. After a hearing that lasted 62 days the judge found in his favour and awarded damages of over ¬£40,000 plus costs. Initially the Chrysler corporation intended to appeal, but eventually a settlement was agreed between the parties. In addition to his legal work related to gaming and divorce Beyfus handled some notable libel cases. In 1957 three members of the Labour Party, Aneurin Bevan, Richard Crossman and Morgan Phillips sued The Spectator for publishing an article by Jenny Nicholson indicating that they were drinking to excess during a convention in Italy. Beyfus won the case for them and they were each awarded ¬£2500 and costs of ¬£4000. In the same year he represented Jaime Ortiz-Pati√±o in an action against the Sunday Graphic. He was awarded ¬£20,000 after the newspaper withdrew their defence. In 1959 the entertainer Liberace sued the Daily Mirror for publishing an article written by William Connor (Cassandra) that appeared to impute that he was homosexual. Beyfus represented Liberace, but by this time he was 74 years old, suffering from ill health, and his appearance did not inspire confidence in his client. However, in court he showed all his old flair and won the case and ¬£8000 damages for his client. By now Beyfus was terminally ill but kept working. His final case was one of slander and libel involving the Duchess of Argyll and her dispute with a former social secretary, Yvonne Macpherson, who was Beyfus's client. The jury found in favour of Mrs Macpherson and she was awarded ¬£7000. ==Marriages== Beyfus married three times. His first wife was Margaret Moore, a revue actress (real name Margaret Malone, formally Margaret Ella Squires) who was aged 25 when they married in 1929. They had one child named John Gilbert who in later life became a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm. The couple parted in 1947 and two years later Beyfus remarried to 29 year old divorcee Joan Hilda Grant (surname at birth Croker and formerly married to John Hook) . They divorced within two years and Beyfus married for the third time in 1953 to 27 year old Eileen Louisa Hill; they remained together until his death in 1960 at his home in Haslemere. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1960 deaths Category:English barristers Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1922) politicians Category:Duke of Wellington's Regiment officers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British World War I prisoners of war Gilbert ","title":"Gilbert Beyfus"},{"id":"54100851","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Eintracht Frankfurt season was the 119th season in the football club's history and 6th consecutive and 49th overall season in the top flight of German football, the Bundesliga, having been promoted from the 2.

Pope Francis raised him to the rank of Cardinal on 28 June 2017. He is the first cardinal from Mali. ==Biography== Jean Zerbo was born on 27 December 1943 in S√©gou, Mali, and ordained a priest there on 10 July 1971 by Pierre Louis Leclerc, Bishop of S√©gou. He continued his education first in Lyon in 1975 and then in Rome at the Pontifical Biblical Institute from 1977 to 1981, earning his licenciate in sacred scripture. Beginning in 1982, he was assigned to parish work in Markala while also teaching at the Major Seminary in Bamako. On 21 June 1988, Pope John Paul II appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Bamako and Titular Bishop of Accia. On 20 November 1988, he was consecrated bishop by Jozef Tomko, Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, with Luc Auguste Sangar√©, Archbishop of Bamako, and Joseph Paul Barnab√© Perrot, Bishop emeritus of San, as co-consecrators. On 19 December 1994, Pope John Paul II named him Bishop of Mopti and on 27 June 1998 Archbishop of Bamako. Pope Francis raised Zerbo to the rank of cardinal at a consistory on 28 June 2017. At the end of May, Le Monde reported that Zerbo and other Malian prelates had secret Swiss bank accounts. Mali's conference of bishops responded that the financial dealings were \\"transparent\\", called the news report \\"tendentious\\", and noted that the Swiss Leaks release of financial documents appeared timed to embarrass the Catholic Church in Mali just when Zerbo's elevation put it in the public spotlight. La Stampa said that Zerbo's participation in the consistory demonstrated that an internal investigation had cleared him of financial wrongdoing. As archbishop he has fostered dialogue between Christians and Mali's Muslim majority and participated in peace negotiations, as well as called for humanitarian aid to those affected by conflicts in the country.. In 2012, he was part of a delegation of representatives of civil society that participated in discussions between Mali's ruling military regime and opposition political parties. He has been an advocate for national reconciliation ever since. He has also served as president of Caritas Mali, an international aid program for refugees and the poor. On 4 October 2017 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Francis made him a member of the Dicastery for the Laity, Family and Life on 23 December 2017. == References External links== * * Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Bishops appointed by Pope John Paul II Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from S√©gou Category:Malian Roman Catholics Category:Cardinals created by Pope Francis Category:Malian cardinals Category:Members of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples ","title":"Jean Zerbo"},{"id":"54100908","text":"Llandyssil (Welsh: Llandysul) is a community in Powys (historically Montgomeryshire), Wales, including the villages of Abermule and Llandyssil, and had a population of 1527 as of the 2011 UK Census.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Early history and creation== Carved from amber, this fibula dates to about 500 B.C.E. The artist is unknown, and there is some debate if the piece is Etruscan made or Etruscan influenced. Amber was a popular material in both Greek and Etruscan art, with the Etruscans using it frequently, often in funerary art. ==Description and interpretation== The work depicts a couple reclining on a sofa, with the woman in the forefront and the man behind her. A bird, possibly a duck, sits on the shoulders on the couple, and at the feet of the reclining duo is a small attendant. It is thought that this piece is a fibula because of the holes at the bottom which show some indications of an iron pin being there. The object is large, allowing for fine detail on the piece. In particular are the folds of the clothing on both the man and woman, their hair, and the woman's gesture of holding out a bottle of perfume or other oil in her right hand and holding two fingers out in her left hand, appearing to offer some to her companion. This gesture is visible in other pieces of Etruscan art, including the Sarcophagus of the Spouses in the Villa Giulia Etruscan museum located in Rome. The depiction of couples laying together and seemingly banqueting is also common, and be seen in the fresco of the Monterozzi necropolis of Tarquina, such as the Tomb of the Leopards and the Tomb of the Triclinium. Etruscan society allowed for women to participate in banquets and public life to a much greater extent than in Greece or Rome. It is unknown if the couple carved in the amber are divine or simply two humans. Andrew Richter suggested that it may be Turan and Atunis (the Etruscan version of Aphrodite and Adonis) in 1940, since the motif of Turan and Atunis was popular in Etruscan art. ==Later history and influence== The fibula was given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917 by J. Pierpont Morgan. Supposedly it was found in Falconara Marittima, near Ancona, ancient Greek colony on the Adriatic coast of Italy. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual report from the time of acquisition simply describes the piece as \\"an amber group of two reclining figures\\" and as part of a larger donation given by Morgan. ==References== Category:Metropolitan Museum of Art 2017 drafts Category:Jewellery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Etruscan artefacts Category:Archaeological discoveries in Italy ","title":"Morgan Amber"},{"id":"54100967","text":"Switz Kill converges with Fox Creek in Berne, New York.

A church was present at the location by 1295, when it was a chapel of ease to the parish church in Bedwas, St Barrwg. It retained this function for the next 619 years, separating from Bedwas in 1914. The parish records at St James's date back to 1627. After 1254, the Bishop of Llandaf held the right to appoint the parish priest at Rudry, a practice which would continue until 1920. There exists a long-standing local myth that Oliver Cromwell sought refuge in St James's during the English Civil War. Hard evidence for this is lacking, though it is known that King Charles I spent time at nearby Ruperra Castle. In the late 18th Century, the officiant at St James's was Father William Price, an eccentric priest who was known for his habit of swimming naked in local ponds. His son was William Price, the archdruid and pioneer of cremation, who was baptised in St James's in 1800. ==Conservation== The church was restored by John Prichard in 1885. It was Grade II listed in 1963. The tower at St James's was refurbished in the early 2011s.RCAHMW: Coflein database ==Churchyard== There are two Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials in the churchyard, marking the burial place of two soldiers of the First World War.

The band was founded in 2003 by vocalist Benjamin Nominet and guitarist Thomas \\"Drop\\" Betrisey. Sybreed disbanded in 2013 when Nominet departed from the group. ==History== The band was founded by Thomas \\"Drop\\" Betrisey (guitar) and Benjamin Nominet (vocals) after their previous band Rain broke-up. The two wanted a band that unified their common predilection for metal and electronic music. The two recruited Luis \\"Burn\\" Da Silva Cruz on bass and Alex Anxonnia on drums to record their debut album, Slave Design, produced by Drop and Claude Lander. Slave Design was released on 7 September 2004 through Reality Entertainment/Caroline Distribution. In early 2006, the band uploaded a song entitled \\"Emma-Zero\\" to its MySpace page; this song would appear on Antares under the name \\"Emma-O\\". Drummer Alex Anxonnia departed Sybreed in February 2006, citing musical and personal differences; Anxonnia would form the industrial death metal band Etna in 2007, which became Breach the Void in 2009. Dirk Verbeuren was hired as a session musician that April to record the drums for the band's then upcoming album, which would be Antares. Antares was recorded and mixed throughout 2006 and was released on 1 October 2007 through Listenable Records. Kevin Choiral joined the band in 2009 as its permanent drummer. Around the same time, bassist Luis \\"Burn\\" Da Silva Cruz left the band was replaced by St√©phane Grand. Sybreed's first release with this new line-up was the EP A.E.O.N. and was released on 21 July 2009 through Listenable. The EP featured the songs \\"A.E.O.N.\\" and \\"Human Black Box\\", which would appear on the band's third studio album The Pulse of Awakening, along with three remixes of the song \\"Emma-O\\", which originally appeared on Antares. The band's third studio album, The Pulse of Awakening, was released later that year on 16 November and was mixed by Rhys Fulber, known mainly for his work with Fear Factory and Front Line Assembly. The song \\"Doomsday Party\\" was released for free download for the video game Rock Band on 7 April 2010. In 2011, Sybreed recorded and released the EP Challenger in promotion for its upcoming fourth album. Later that year in June, Grand left the band and was replaced on bass by Ales Campanelli. The band's fourth and final studio album, God Is an Automaton, was released on 24 September 2012. The next day, on 25 September, a music video, the band's first, was released for the song \\"Hightech Versus Lowlife\\" showing the band performing the song in studio. Sybreed gained some minor mainstream exposure in December 2012 when Rachel Aspe performed the song \\"Emma-O\\" on the French talent show La France a un incroyable talent. A music video for the song \\"No Wisdom Brings Solace\\" was released on 20 December and shows the band performing the song live at Euroblast Festival 2012. On 20 February 2013, a music video was released for the song \\"The Line of Least Resistance.\\" Unlike the performance-centered nature of the previous two videos, the music video for \\"The Line of Least Resistance\\" is more narrative focused, following a woman who discovers she is secretly an android in disguise along with shots of the band performing the song.

Hopkins as the headquarters for the 2nd City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps and built between 1887 and 1888. That unit became the 6th (City of London) Battalion The London Regiment (City of London Rifles) in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. On the night of 8 September 1915, Zeppelin L13 commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Mathy attacked London, and two of his bombs hit Messrs Frank Stadelman's warehouse at 59‚Äì61 Farringdon Road. Falling masonry from the building did considerable damage to the drill hall behind.Godfrey, p. 206.Morris, p. 54. When the London Regiment was broken up and the battalion moved out to Sutton in its new role as an anti-aircraft unit in the mid 1930s, the hall fell vacant.Godfrey, p. 262. In 1947 the drill hall became the home of 167 (City of London) Field Ambulance and 168 (City of London) Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps (TA). The hall had fallen vacant again by 1967 when the field ambulances went through a re-organisation and a new unit (217 (London) General Hospital) was formed at the Braganza Street drill hall in Walworth. Much of the site has since been converted to offices and is now used, among others, by Rufus Leonard, a firm of marketing consultants. ==ReferencesSources== * Godfrey, Captain E.

Heavily influenced by the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident, he edited tangwai publications and pushed for the school to permit direct elections for student body president alongside Liu Yi-te and Lai Chin-lin. University administration labelled Lee \\"excessively politically progressive\\" instead and expelled him in 1986, after which he became active in Taiwan's labor rights movement. Lee was also active in the Wild Lily student movement of 1990. ==Political career== Within the Democratic Progressive Party, Lee is allied with the New Tide faction. Elected to the National Assembly in 1991 and again in 1996, Lee launched his first campaign for a seat on the Legislative Yuan in 1998. Shortly after the 1999 Jiji earthquake, Lee proposed a number of bills intended to aid rescue efforts. In his first term, Lee helped uncover a financial scandal involving Taiwan Pineapple Group and members of the Taiwanese judiciary dating back to November 1999. That month, Lee and Michael Tsai were charged with libel by fellow legislator Lo Fu-chu. The pair had accused Lo of interference in a Yunlin County by-election in favor of Chang Jung-wei. For a portion of his first term in the Legislative Yuan, Lee served as DPP caucus convenor. He won reelection to the legislature in 2001. In 2004, an essay written by Lee titled New Culture Discourse was leaked. In it, Lee advocated keeping the Republic of China as Taiwan's official name, stating \\"there will be no suitable environment in the next two or three decades for the Republic of China (ROC) to change its national name.\\" Reasons given for retaining the Republic of China included acceptance of the term by Taiwan's citizens of both Hoklo and Mainlander descent. In addition, retention of the name was seen to appease the People's Republic of China. Lee spent the end of his second legislative term advocating that the government acquire extensive military equipment. After winning reelection in December 2004, he continued arguing for military upgrades. Lee was criticized by the Democratic Progressive Party in 2005 when he proposed that the party revoke its support of Taiwanese independence and form a coalition with the People First Party. Lee and Lin Cho-shui resigned their legislative seats in November 2006 to protest the way a party-led investigation into Chen Shui-bian was being run. Despite his resignation, Lee declared his candidacy for the 2008 legislative election cycle. He next represented the Democratic Progressive Party in the 2009 Nantou County magistracy election. During his campaign, Lee accused Kuomintang candidate Lee Chao-ching of working with Chiang Chin-liang, a convicted felon. When DPP member Huang Wen-chun alleged that Lee Wen-chung had also sought the support of Chiang, the party moved to expel Huang. Lee later became director of the party's Department of Organization. He launched his second campaign for the Nantou County magistracy in June 2013 and was formally confirmed as DPP candidate in November. Lee lost to Lin Ming-chen, and was named deputy minister of the Veterans Affairs Council in 2016. Political stances Lee's writings for the Taipei Times have extensively covered military affairs and national defense. He has also been critical of Ma Ying- jeou and his economic and Cross-Strait policies. ==Personal life== Lee is married to Chen De-yu. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians of the Republic of China on Taiwan from Nantou County Category:New Taipei Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Democratic Progressive Party Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 4th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 5th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 6th Legislative Yuan Category:National Taiwan University alumni ","title":"Lee Wen-chung"},{"id":"54101046","text":"Deneb is a supergiant star in the Cygnus constellation, also known as Œ± Cygni.

The Photographic Display Unit, or PDU, was a large-format display system used by the Royal Air Force to present radar images for interpretation by a number of operators and commanders. Made by Kelvin Hughes, it projected a diameter image that could optionally be overlaid with a map and range rings. The PDU was originally designed for the ROTOR system and subsequent AMES Type 80-based Master Radar Stations. A smaller version with a display was used onboard Royal Navy ships, and a larger version projected onto movie screens was used in the SAGE system in the US. ==Description== The PDU was essentially an automated 35mm film processing system. A bright cathode ray tube duplicated the image from one of the radar consoles, while the film was exposed in front of it through an f2 lens. Each complete scanning rotation of the radar took 15 seconds, but as it reached a selected location, normally opposite the direction the radar was designed to observe, the film was pulled out from in front of the lens and a new frame pulled into place. The recently exposed frame then moved through four stations, moving through one every 15 seconds. The first sprayed it with a developer, the next with water, then a fixer, water again, and then it was dried with an air blower. The entire developing process took one minute, after which the frame was pulled into a large film projector that shone upwards into the bottom of the plotting table. Plotters viewing the table from the top used methods developed in World War I to maintain tracks for the various aircraft. As each new frame appeared, they would place small arrow-shaped markers on the new location, leaving behind the ones they had placed earlier. This produced a trail that indicated the direction of travel. The plotting table was normally covered with a large sheet of semi-transparent paper that contained a National Grid map and allowed the operators to make notes directly on its surface. Each PDU was fed from a reel of film. Two machines were used at each site. When the film or developer system ran low or there was any sort of problem, the operator could switch to the second unit simply by moving a mirror under the projector. The used reel could then be removed and used as a record of action. The Navy version differed only in size, using 16mm film and being generally smaller. The US SAGE system used the PDU hardware to project an even larger display onto a movie screen, which was used for overall battle control in the \\"subsector command post\\", more widely known as the \\"blue room\\". In these systems the original CRT was replaced with a charactron driven by the FSQ-7 computer, outputting both graphics and character data onto the film. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:Radar signal processing Category:Cold War military equipment of the United Kingdom Category:Royal Air Force Category:Royal Navy ","title":"Photographic Display Unit"},{"id":"54101053","text":"King Creek converges with Fox Creek in Gallupville, New York. == References == Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Schoharie County, New York ","title":"King Creek (New York)"},{"id":"54101055","text":"Amy Jo Dempsey FRSA (born 1963) is an independent scholar and art historian.

Separation of content and presentation (or separation of content and style) is the separation of concerns design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. Under this principle, visual and design aspects (presentation and style) are separated from the core material and structure (content) of a document. A typical analogy used to explain this principle is the distinction between the human skeleton (as the structural component) and human flesh (as the visual component) which makes up the body's appearance. Common applications of this principle are seen in Web design (HTML vs. CSS) and document typesetting (Lambert 's document body vs. its preamble). == Use in Web design == This principle is not a rigid guideline, but serves more as best practice for keeping appearance and structure separate. In many cases, the design and development aspects of a project are performed by different people, so keeping both aspects separated ensures both initial production accountability and later maintenance simplification, as in the don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle. == Use in document typesetting == LaTeX is a document markup language that focuses primarily on the content and structure of a document. When a document is prepared using the LaTeX system, the source code of the document can be divided into two parts: the document body and the preamble (and the style sheets). The document body can be likened to the body of a HTML document, where one specifies the content and the structure of the document, whereas the preamble (and the style sheets) can be likened to the CSS portion of a HTML document, where the formatting, document specifications and other visual attributes are specified. Under this methodology, academic writings and publications can be structured, styled and typeset with minimal effort by its creators. In fact, it also prevents the end-users ‚Äî who are usually not trained as designers themselves ‚Äî from alternating between tweaking the formatting and working on the document itself. Similar to the case with HTML and CSS, the separation between content and style also allows a document to be quickly reformatted for different purposes, or a style to be re-purposed across multiple documents as well. ==See also== *CSS *Form follows function *HTML *LaTeX *Markdown *Model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller software architectural pattern == References == Category:Design ","title":"Separation of content and presentation"},{"id":"54101075","text":"The Salmonier Cove Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Shale formations ","title":"Salmonier Cove Formation"},{"id":"54101085","text":"The Sam Head Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Sam Head Formation"},{"id":"54101088","text":"The Sculpin Point Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Sculpin Point Formation"},{"id":"54101094","text":"The Snooks Tolt Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Volcanism of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Snooks Tolt Formation"},{"id":"54101102","text":"The Southern Hills Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Southern Hills Formation"},{"id":"54101110","text":"The Spanish Room Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Spanish Room Formation"},{"id":"54101116","text":"The St. Josephs Cove Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Sandstone in Canada ","title":"St. Josephs Cove Formation"},{"id":"54101125","text":"The Taylors Bay Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Taylors Bay Formation"},{"id":"54101130","text":"The Terrenceville Formation is a formation cropping out in Newfoundland. ==References== Category:Geology of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Terrenceville Formation"},{"id":"54101136","text":"The 2017 FA Women's Cup Final was the 47th final of the FA Women's Cup, England's primary cup competition for women's football teams.

As a bronze sculpture, versions are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in the \\"Cloister of the Clasped Hands\\" at Armstrong Browning Library, Baylor University. ==Early history and creation== Hosmer described the work's creation thus: It was one of earliest works created that Hosmer created in Rome. First created in plaster, the work was only cast in bronze years later. ==Description and interpretation== The work directly depicts the clasped hands of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning, without other parts of the body. The artist Harriet Hosmer cast the hands of the poets herself at the request of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The artist left the casting exactly as it came from the mold to preserve the textural quality of the casting and the lovers' sensitive physiognomy. The difference in size of the hands as well as the cuff at each wrist indicate the identity of each hand, and the although her hand is inside of his, hers is more visible and there is a sense of equal partnership in the representation. The signature of the artist is on end of Robert Barrett Browning's wrist and reads: HANDS - OF - ROBERT / AND / Elizabeth Barrett Browning / cast By / Harriet Hosmer / Rome 1853. The work was in the same tradition as Hiram Powers' Loulie's Hand, and they were both inspired by contemporary Spiritualism. ==Later history and influence== Nathaniel Hawthorne alludes to the work in the 1860 novel The Marble Faun, as ‚ÄúHarriet Hosmer‚Äôs Clasped Hands of Browning and his wife symbolize the individuality and heroic union of two highly poetic lives.‚Äù Later in life, Hosmer commemorated the Brownings in some lines of poetry, \\"Parted by death we say...

In the evening, Trump and the U.S. delegation took part in the traditional ardah sword dance. Trade agreement and arms deal On May 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a US$350 billion arms deal with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The arms deal was the largest in world history. The transaction included tanks, combat ships missile defence systems, as well as radar, communications and cybersecurity technology. The transfer was widely seen as a counterbalance against the influence of Iran in the region. The arms transfer was described by news outlets as a \\"significant\\" and \\"historic\\" expansion of United States relations with Saudi Arabia. ==United States ‚Äì Gulf Cooperation Council Summit== Trump met with GCC leaders the morning of May 21. ==Arab Islamic American Summit== Video of Trump's speech at the Arab Islamic American Summit.

Orphaned from an early age, he became the leading juvenile earner from the first crop of Dialed In. He was a contender on the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby, winning the Delta Downs Jackpot Stakes as a two-year old and the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park during his three-year-old season. Given a layoff after finishing seventh in the Derby and fifth in the Preakness Stakes, he returned in August to win the Tangelo Stakes before finishing second in the Travers Stakes. == Background == Gunnevera is a chestnut colt bred in Kentucky by Brandywine Farm in partnership with Stephen Upchurch. Gunnevera was sired by 2016 leading first-crop sire Dialed In, who won the Holy Bull Stakes and Florida Derby in 2011 before off-the-board finishes in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Dialed In entered stud in 2013 at Darby Dan Farm and initially stood for $7,500. His stud fee has risen to $15,000 as of 2017. Gunnevera's dam Unbridled Rage, a daughter of 1990 Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, made only one career start, finishing eleventh in a maiden claimer at Churchill Downs. She was bought in 2005 by Brandywine as a ten-year-old broodmare for a mere $13,000, the low price due to the lack of success of her first four foals on the racetrack. On February 28, 2014, the 19-year-old Unbridled Rage gave birth to Gunnevera, who was to be her final foal. Soon after Gunnevera's birth, Unbridled Rage began to hemorrhage. Over the next few days, her condition improved, but she died of a heart attack when Gunnevera was 10 days old. As a result, Gunnevera was raised by a nurse mare, a Paint Horse named Jenny. As a yearling, Gunnevera was sold at the 2015 Keeneland September Yearling Sale for $16,000 to trainer Antonio Sano on behalf of Peacock Stables LLC. After the Preakness Stakes, Venezuelan business Salomon del Valle bought out the other partners in Peacock Stables to become the horse's sole owner, running him in the name of Sano Racing Stables. Sano was a highly successful horse trainer in his native Venezuela who fled his homeland after having been kidnapped twice. During his second ordeal, he was held captive for 36 days. Sano's family and friends gathered money to pay for the ransom, which included everything Sano's family had. He and his family moved to Florida in 2009, leaving behind a 160-horse barn in Venezuela to start all over again. Sano re-established himself as a trainer in the United States, saddling 565 winners out by the end of 2017. Following the sale, Gunnevera was sent to Julio Rada's Altamira Stable in Ocala, Florida to be broken in, and was sent back to Sano's barn when it came time for him to make his racing debut. ==Racing career==  2016: two-year-old season  Gunnevera made his racing debut on June 10, 2016, in a maiden race at Gulfstream Park, finishing second behind future stakes winner Three Rules. He finished fourth in his next start, again behind Three Rules, in the Birdonthewire Stakes. On July 16, he broke his maiden by making a late rally in a maiden special weight race at Gulfstream. Sano then moved him up to graded stakes company in the Saratoga Special Stakes on August 14, which he won with a last-to-first move. \\"Everything worked out great, we had a perfect trip,\\" said jockey Javier Castellano. \\"Long term, he is going to be a really nice horse.\\". Gunnevera finished fifth behind eventual two-year-old champion Classic Empire in the Gr.I Breeders' Futurity Stakes. In his final start as a juvenile, he found the winner's circle in the Delta Downs Jackpot Stakes. 2017: three-year-old season  Gunnevera made his three-year-old debut in the Grade II Holy Bull Stakes on February 4, 2017, finishing second behind Irish War Cry but ahead of favorite Classic Empire, who finished third. Gunnevera then won the Fountain of Youth in his next start, defeating multiple Gr.I winner Practical Joke, Three Rules, and Irish War Cry. The win marked Gunnevera as one of the early favorites on the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby. In his final prep race for the Derby, he finished a distant third behind rising star Always Dreaming in the Florida Derby, despite a closing drive. For the 2017 Kentucky Derby, Gunnevera was installed at 15-1 odds in a field of 20 horses. With Javier Castellano aboard, he finished seventh after getting caught in traffic at several points in the race. In his next start, the 2017 Preakness Stakes, Gunnevera was ridden by Mike E. Smith after Castellano opted to ride Cloud Computing, who won the race. Gunnevera finished fifth but came out of the race with bleeding in his left hind leg and did not start in the Belmont Stakes. Given a brief layoff to recover, Gunnevera returned on August 6 in the Tangelo Stakes at Gulfstream Park. He rated behind a slow early pace, then moved to the lead as they moved into the far turn. Under a hand ride, he drew away to win by five lengths. \\"My horse is back 100%,\\" said Sano. \\"The race was very easy for him today. He's gained weight, he's very happy, and now we'll go to the Travers.\\" On August 26, Gunnevera made his next start in the Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga. He was widely dismissed at odds of 20-1 on the morning line in a field of nine graded stakes winners, including the winners of the three Triple Crown races. After being bumped hard at the start, Gunnevera dropped well back for the first half mile before beginning a sustained run on the backstretch. He circled wide on the final turn and moved into contention in mid-stretch while bearing in and bumping with Irap, who finished third. Gunnevera finished second behind West Coast, then withstood a stewards' inquiry into the interference with Irap. In the Breeders' Cup Classic held at Del Mar on November 5, Gunnevera faced older horses for the first time in a field that featured Horse of the Year candidates Gun Runner and Arrogate. He raced far back for the first three- quarters of a mile, then closed to finish in a dead-heat with Arrogate for fifth place. 2018: four-year-old season Gunnevera at the 2018 Breeders' Cup 2019: five-year-old season ==Pedigree== Gunnevera is inbred 4 x 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning Mr. Prospector appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. Gunnevera is also inbred 5 x 5 to both Secretariat and Northern Dancer. ==References== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Thoroughbred family 16-h ","title":"Gunnevera"},{"id":"54101474","text":"The Andaluc√≠a Costa del Sol Match Play 9 is a golf tournament on the Challenge Tour, played in Spain.

Finding a multiplicative approximation is a #P-hard problem, so a better approximation is considered unlikely. However, it is known that computing an additive approximation of the Jones polynomial is a BQP-complete problem. The algorithm was published in 2009 in a paper written by Dorit Aharonov, Vaughan Jones and Zeph Landau. == The Markov trace == The first idea behind the algorithm is to find a more tractable description for the operation of evaluating the Jones polynomial. This is done by means of the Markov trace. The \\"Markov trace\\" is a trace operator defined on the Temperley‚ÄìLieb algebra TL_n(d) as follows: given a T\\\\in TL_n(d) which is a single Kauffman diagram, let tr(T)=d^{a-n} where a is the number of loops attained by identifying each point in the bottom of T's Kauffman diagram with the corresponding point on top. This extends linearly to all of TL_n(d). The Markov trace is a trace operator in the sense that tr(1)=1 and tr(XY)=tr(YX) for any X,Y\\\\in TL_n(d). It also has the additional property that if X is a Kauffman diagram whose rightmost strand goes straight up then tr(XE_{n-1}) = \\\\frac{1}{d}tr(X). A useful fact exploited by the AJL algorithm is that the Markov trace is the unique trace operator on TL_n(d) with that property. == Representing B_n in TL_n(d) == For a complex number A we define the map \\\\rho_A:B_n\\\\to TL_n(d) via \\\\sigma_i\\\\mapsto AE_i+A^{-1}I. It follows by direct calculation that if A satisfies that d= -A^2-A^{-2} then \\\\rho_A is a representation. Given a braind B\\\\in B_n let B^{tr} be the link attained by identifying the bottom of the diagram with its top like in the definition of a Markov trace, and let V_{B^{tr}} be the result link's Jones polynomial. The following relation holds: :V_{B^{tr}}(A^{-4})=(-A)^{3w(B^{tr})}d^{n-1}tr(\\\\rho_A(B)) where w is the writhe. As the writhe can be easily calculated classically, this reduces the problem of approximating the Jones polynomial to that of approximating the Markov trace. == The path model representation of TL_n(d) == We wish to construct a complex representation \\\\tau of TL_n(d) such that the representation \\\\tau\\\\circ\\\\rho_A of B_n will be unitary. We also wish that our representation will have a straightforward encoding into qubits. Let :Q_{n,k}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ q\\\\in\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1,\\\\ldots,k-1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ^{n}\\\\mid q(1)=1,\\\\leftq(i)-q(i+1)\\\\right=1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and let V_{n,k}=\\\\mathbb{C}[Q_{n,k}] be the vector space which has Q_{n,k} as an orthonormal basis. We choose define a linear map \\\\tau:TL_n(d)\\\\to V_{n,k} by defining it on the base of generators \\\\\\\\{1,E_1,\\\\ldots,E_{n-1}\\\\\\\\}. To do so we need to define the matrix element \\\\tau(E_i)_{q,q'} for any q,q'\\\\in Q_{n,k}. We say that q and q' are 'compatible' if q(j)=q'(j) for any j e i+1 and q(i)=q(i+2). Geometrically this means that if we put q and q' below and above the Kauffman diagram in the gaps between the strands then no connectivity component will touch two gaps which are labeled by different numbers. If q and q' are incompatible set \\\\tau(E_i)_{q,q'}=0. Else, let l be either q(i) or q(i+2) (at least one of these number must be defined, and if both are defined they must be equal) and set :\\\\tau\\\\left(E_{i}\\\\right)_{q,q'}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{l}}{\\\\lambda_{l-1}} & q\\\\left(i+1\\\\right)=q'(i+1)>l\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{l}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{l-1}\\\\lambda_{l+1}}} & q\\\\left(i+1\\\\right) e q'(i+1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{l}}{\\\\lambda_{l-1}} & q\\\\left(i+1\\\\right)=q'(i+1) where \\\\lambda_l=\\\\sin(\\\\pi l/k). Finally set d=2\\\\cos(\\\\pi/k). This representation, known as the path model representation, induces a unitary representation of the braid group. Moreover, it holds that d=-A^2-A^{-2} for A=ie^{-\\\\pi/2k}. This implies that if we could approximate the Markov trace in this representation this will allow us to approximate the Jones polynomial in A^{-4}=e^{2\\\\pi/k}. == A quantum version of the path model representation == In order to be able to act on elements of the path model representation by means of quantum circuits, we need to encode the elements of Q_{n,k} into qubits in a way which allows us to easily describe the images of the generators E_i. We represent each path as a sequence of moves, where 0 indicates a move to the right and 1 indicates a move to the left. For example, the path 1,2,3,2 will be represented by the state \\\\left001\\\\right\\\\rangle . This encodes \\\\mathbb{C}[Q_{n,k}] as a subspace of the state space on k-1 qubits. We define the operators \\\\varphi_i within this subspace we define :\\\\Phi_{i}\\\\leftw\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\begin{cases} 0 & w_{i}=w_{i+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{z_{i}-\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{w_{i}}}}{\\\\lambda_{z_{i}}}\\\\leftw\\\\right\\\\rangle +\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_{z_{i}-1}\\\\lambda_{z_{i}+1}}}{\\\\lambda_{z_{i}}}X_{i}X_{i+1}\\\\leftw\\\\right\\\\rangle & w_{i} e w_{i+1} \\\\end{cases} where X_i is the Pauli matrix flipping the ith bit and z_i is the position of the path represented by \\\\leftw\\\\right\\\\rangle after i steps. We arbitrarily extend \\\\varphi_i to be the identity on the rest of the space. We note that mapping E_i\\\\mapsto\\\\varphi_i retains all the properties of the path model representation. Specifically, it induces a unitary representation \\\\varphi of B_n. It is fairly straightforward to show that \\\\varphi_i can be implemented by \\\\text{poly}\\\\left(n,k\\\\right) gates, so it follows that \\\\varphi(B) can be implemented for any B\\\\in B_n using \\\\text{poly}\\\\left(m,n,k\\\\right) where m is the number of crossings in B. == A quantum version of the Markov trace == The benefit of this construction is that it gives us a way to represent the Markov trace in a way which can be easily approximated. Let \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,k} be the subspace of paths we described in the previous clause, and let \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,k,l} be the subspace spanned by basis elements which represent walks which end on the lth position. Note that each of the operators \\\\varphi_i fix \\\\mathcal{H}_{n,k,l} setwise, and so this holds for any W\\\\in\\\\text{Im}\\\\Phi\\\\left(TL_{n}\\\\left(d\\\\right)\\\\right), hence the operator W_l:=W_{\\\\mathcal{H}_{n,k,l}} is well defined. We define the following operator: :Tr_{n}\\\\left(W\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{l=1}^{k-1}\\\\lambda_{l}Tr\\\\left(W_{l}\\\\right) where Tr is the usual matrix trace. It turns out that this operator is a trace operator with the Markov property, so by the theorem stated above it has to be the Markov trace. This finishes the required reductions as it establishes that to approximate the Jones polynomial it suffices to approximate Tr_{n}. == The algorithm == algorithm Approximate-Jones-Trace-Closure is input B\\\\in B_n with m crossings An integer k output a number s such that s-V_{B^{tr}}(e^{2\\\\pi/k})<1/poly(n,k,m) with all but exponentially small probability repeat for j=1 to poly(n,m,k) 1\\\\.

Randomly pick q\\\\in Q_{n,k} which ends in position l 3\\\\. Using the Hadamard test create a random variable x_j with \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[x_{j}\\\\right]=\\\\mathcal{Re}\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\alpha\\\\mid Q\\\\left(B\\\\right)\\\\mid\\\\beta\\\\right\\\\rangle Do the same to create y_j with \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[y_{j}\\\\right]=\\\\mathcal{Im}\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\alpha\\\\mid Q\\\\left(B\\\\right)\\\\mid\\\\beta\\\\right\\\\rangle let r be the average of x_j+iy_j return (-A)^{3w(B^{tr})}d^{n-1}r Note that the parameter d used in the algorithm depends on k. The correctness of this algorithm is established by applying the Hoeffding bound to x_j and y_j separately. ==NotesReferences== # D. Aharonov, V. Jones, Z.

The larvae are found in streams in eastern North America where they build net-like retreats. ==Description== Adult caddisflies are small moth-like insects; the adult Dolophilodes distinctus has brown wings with darker brown markings. Adult females emerging in summer are winged while those emerging in March are often brachypterous (have vestigial wings). These sometimes breed on the snow that is lying on the ground at this time of year. ==Distribution== Dolophilodes distinctus is native to eastern North America. It is a common species whose range extends from Minnesota and Newfoundland southwards to Georgia. They are usually found in clear montane streams. ==Ecology== Like other members of Philopotamidae, the larvae of D. distinctus is free-living and builds a net to intercept the fine organic particles drifting downstream. In streams in Ontario, this species was found in shallow streams with small pools joined by riffles. In one stream with clear hard water, the stream bed was limestone gravel interspersed with sand and patches of clay, and in a different, brown-water, stream it was granite gravel mixed with assorted size cobbles. In the limestone gravel location, larvae at various stages of development were found to be present all year, with peak numbers in August, and emergence occurring for much of the time between late June and late August; some emergence possibly happened in mid-winter as well. The larva builds a net consisting of an elongated sac made of a meshwork of fine silk strands. The longitudinal strands are stout and the transverse strands are finer and closer together. In the final instar, the sac may be up to long and in diameter, with extra silk threads at the upstream end to anchor it to the stream bed and nearby rocks. It has been estimated that the net made by the final instar larva is composed of over a kilometre of silk and has 100 million rectangular mesh openings. The net is usually built underneath a rock where a current of water flows through it. The downstream end of the net is free to move and has an opening to permit a respiratory current to flow through, and groups of nets are often built besides each other. The larva moves about inside the net and feeds on the fine organic matter and diatoms that get caught in the mesh structure. Much of its time is spent scraping this deposit off the net with specialised mouthparts. ==References== Category:Trichoptera Category:Insects of North America Category:Insects described in 1852 ","title":"Dolophilodes distinctus"},{"id":"54101534","text":"Chillesford Church Pit is a 1.1 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Chillesford, south of Saxmundham in Suffolk.

Gottfried Schapper, was an Signals intelligence officer, who was known for having the original idea for the Forschungsamt signal intelligence agency. Schapper had worked in the Reichswehr Ministry cipher bureau from 1927 to 1933, which would later form part of Luftwaffe signals intelligence unit, had been dissatisfied by both the scope of monitoring and intercept work and the incompetence of the methods employed there. He along with some colleagues, including the convinced Nazi, Hans Schimpf, proposed to Hermann G√∂ring that a separate signals office be created that would be free from department ties. ==Personal life== Gottfried Schapper Schapper was the son of the protestant pastor Karl Schapper and grew up with seven siblings. His eldest brother (son from the father's first marriage) is the resistance fighter against national socialism and labour leader Karl Schapper, his youngest (like Gottfried from second marriage) the prophet Helmut Schapper. During 1919 he was married, and had a son in 1934. ==Career== Gottfried Schapper was promoted to Fahnenjunker in 1910 and posted to a radio communications unit, and promoted to Lieutenant in the railroad regiment No. 2 in Hanau (German Army (German Empire)). By 1913 he was transferred to Signals. During World War I, he was deployed on both the West and the Eastern Front. From 1916 to 1917, he was director of the cryptographic office in the Reichswehr signals intelligence office and in 1919 he was promoted to the civil service rank of director () of the whole signals intelligence service. During 1918, he was Divisional Signals Commander with various divisions in the west. In 1919, he was discharged with a military rank of captain () In 1920, he became secretary to the National Society of Berlin for Rescuing the Reich from the Revolution, Nationale Vereinigung (National Association) and was a participant in the Kapp Putsch. Schapper joined the Nazi Party in 1920 and a remained party member until 1923. From 1920, he worked as a kind of manager for national organizations, newspapers, clubs and clubs, until 1927. From 1927, Schapper played a key role in centralizing the scattered interception and decryption departments of the Ministry of the Reichswehr (). He became director of the cryptographic office () in the Reichswehrministerium and stepped back in 1933, because he was dissatisfied with the incompetent methods on site. A quote regarding Schapper at the time, that is attributed to the spy Hans-Thilo Schmidt who stated: :He was always talking about the unease felt as much in the Abwehr as in the chiffrierstelle due to the chaotic organization of the research and analysis of the intelligence. Everyone gets involved, military and civilian, sailors, airmen, police, foreign affairs, postal, customs and so on. He joined the Nazi Party again in 1931. ==Forschungsamt== From 1933 to 1937 or 1938 he was a member of the SS and had the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. He resigned, as they refused to recognize his Christian philosophy of life. Gottfried Schapper's idea for a new central intelligence agency took form as early as 1927. As quoted by Hans- Thilo Schmidt: :Schapper's idea, in line with Patzig and many other specialists in the Abwehr, is to create a Central Intelligence Office. This organization would be directly dependent on the chancellor [Hitler, who was not yet in power], and would centralize and coordinate research and would oversee its analysis In 1933 he turned to Hermann G√∂ring, who was an acquaintance from the First World War, to create the new agency. Schmidt stated: :The main aspects of the project were submitted by Schapper to G√∂ring. If the F√ºhrer approves in turn, and if the Nazis take power, then it is likely this reform will happen. Schapper will then occupy an important place and will surely ask me to take a place next to him. Hans Schimpf, who was a close friend of G√∂ring was selected, along with 8 key people, and Schapper to create the new agency, which started operation in March 1933. He became head of a subsection, later head of a section of the Research Office of the Reich Air Ministry (). From October 12, 1943 to May 8, 1945, Schapper was the head of the Forschungsamt. During his leadership, he was initially active in Berlin and after numerous bombardments in Breslau and Kaufbeuren. He was arrested near Rosenheim in May 1945 and taken to Salzburg and Augsburg, where he was interrogated by TICOM, the project formed in World War II by the United States to find and seize German intelligence assets. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:Signals intelligence Category:Luftwaffe personnel of World War II Category:Nazi Party members Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:German cryptographers Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Gottfried Schapper"},{"id":"54101615","text":"ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã T√®o (born 19 July 1968) is a Vietnamese long-distance runner.

The normal vector to the flame is \\\\mathbf{n}=- abla G / abla G.

Consider a two- dimensional planar slot burner of slot width b with a premixed reactant mixture is fed through the slot with constant velocity \\\\mathbf{v}=(0,U), where the coordinate (x,y) is chosen such that x=0 lies at the center of the slot and y=0 lies at the location of the mouth of the slot. When the mixture is ignited, a flame develops from the mouth of the slot to certain height y=L with a planar conical shape with cone angle \\\\alpha. In the steady case, the G equation reduces to :U\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} = U_L \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)^2} If a separation of the form G(x,y) = y + f(x) is introduced, the equation becomes :U = U_L\\\\sqrt{1+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2}, \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{U^2-U_L^2}}{U_L} which upon integration gives :f(x) = \\\\frac{(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{U_L}x + C, \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad G(x,y) = \\\\frac{(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{U_L}x + y+ C Without loss of generality choose the flame location to be at G(x,y)=G_o=0. Since the flame is attached to the mouth of the slot x = b/2, \\\\ y=0, the boundary condition is G(b/2,0)=0, which can be used to evaluate the constant C.

The story screenplay of the movie is written by Anil Pandey and Madhur Bhandarkar and the dialogues are penned by Sanjay Chhel . Indu Sarkar is produced under the banner of Bhandarkar Entertainment and Mega Bollywood Private Limited. The film is set in the period of the emergency in India, i.e. the 19-month-long period from 1975 to 1977 when there was a state of emergency across the country. The film stars Kirti Kulhari, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Anupam Kher, Tota Roy Chowdhury, Nitanshi Goel and Supriya Vinod. The music is composed by Anu Malik and Bappi Lahiri. The film was released on 28 July 2017 with few cuts. == Plot == During the Emergency, Indu's husband, a government employee, plans to use the situation to his advantage and move ahead in his career.

Rashmi Jha was roped in to play the role of Farzana, which is inspired from socialite Rukhsana Sultana. ==Release== The film was released at around 825 screens across India. ==Critical reception== The film garnered mixed reviews from critics. Nitin Bhave of Times of India praised the film for its acting performances and gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. Rajeev Masand of News18 gave 2 stars by saying \\"This is at Best an Average Movie\\". Hindustan Times criticised the director's confused narrative by giving 2 stars. Giving 2 stars Indian Express also panned the film by saying \\"A watered-down, bloodless version of the Emergency\\". ==Controversy== The film generated controversy since the time its trailer got released. Indian National Congress supporters heavily criticised the director Bhandarkar's attempt to portray former Prime Minister of India Mrs.Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay Gandhi in a bad light. However, the director clarified that it was not a biopic on former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi under whose regime the Emergency was declared in the country in 1975. Sanjay Gandhi's alleged daughter Priya Singh Paul approached the Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the film. However, Bombay High Court rejected the plea after Paul failed to present solid evidence of her association with the lineage of Sanjay Gandhi. Just two days before the release Paul moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the release of the movie after Bombay High Court dismissed her plea. The Supreme Court also refused to stay the release of the film and quoted it as \\"The movie is an artistic expression within the parameters of law.\\" After the release of the film several supporters of the Indian National Congress protested and even tried to stall the screening. Congress and BJP workers clashed in front of a cinema hall in Indore. Police used canes to disperse the BJP and Congress workers who came to blows. ==Box office== The film opened at 8.50 million nett on its first day, as reported by Box office India. The film grossed 47 million net in first weekend.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Early history and creation== The history of the set is unknown. It was discovered in a two chamber tomb in the ancient site of Vulci in 1832. The burial featured a two chamber tomb of a man and woman, who were most likely married in life. ==Description and interpretation== The Vulci group is a set is made of ten pieces of jewelry: a pair of earrings, a necklace, three fibulae, and five rings. The necklace itself is made of eleven pendents that are attached to tube shaped beads. Depicted on the pendants are a satyr or possibly the god Acheloos and a female head flanked by wings and another head; these designs alternate. Also on each pendant are imitation carnelian and banded agate. Sirens form the clasps at the end of the necklace. There are five rings that are a part of this set. One is a thin gold band with a cartouche of a sphinx and a lion, dated to about 530 BCE. Another ring has a much thicker gold band, and unlike the rest of the set, taken from the male's burial chamber. It features an oval carnelian in the enter, and is flanked by satyr heads on either side. A third ring features a gold band with a red carnelian that has a scarab on it. It swivels to show a man holding a club, who may be Hercle. A similar ring made of banded agate also features a scarab, as well as a youth holding a sword while leaning on a pillar. Finally there is another large gold band, featuring a bezel with a resting lion. It is surrounded by radiating palmettes. Three pins also are a part of the set. One features segments that join to form a pomegranate flower. Another is much more simple, featuring a little sphere, but little other decoration. Finally there is a fibula with a double sphinx head, as well as rosettes. The earrings that form the set have a circular band of gold, with filigree branching out from the center. In the gold band and set in the center are carnelian stones, although some are now missing. This type of earring was common in Etruscan art, with similar examples in the British Museum. ==Later history and influence== This group of material was found in a two chamber tomb in Vulci by Domenico Campanari in 1832. The tomb ran alongside the Fiora River, and Campanari's entire family was involved with archaeological work in the area and as well as Poggio Buco and Tuscania. So influential was the family's work with Etruscan excavation, they helped organize some of the very first exhibitions of Etruscan art in places such as London. Within the tomb, one chamber was set aside for the male buried there, and the other set aside for a female. It is from the woman's portion of the tomb that the Vulci group was taken. The jewelry transferred to the hands of Jaques Claud, the Bargon Beugnot, and then to Rougemont de Lowemberg. By 1930 the set was on the antiquities market, and the museum purchased it in 1940. The Vulci group is extremely important to the interest in Etruscan culture during the 19th century. Due to the richness of the materials within, and other like discoveries including a tomb on the property of the Prince of Canino in 1828, it became common for the wealthy to purchase imitation Etruscan jewelry. The Castellani family were some of the best known for their Etruscan influenced work. ==References== Category:Metropolitan Museum of Art 2017 drafts Category:Jewellery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Etruscan artefacts Category:1832 archaeological discoveries ","title":"Vulci set of jewelry (Metropolitan Museum of Art)"},{"id":"54101811","text":"Roberto Marcora (; born 30 August 1989) is an Italian tennis player.

The Westinghouse brake system was a first for the NRS; the additional hand brake was common. To obtain a stable ride at high speeds, inside cylinders were employed. The firebox was situated between the coupled axles. The front and rear axles were of the Webb type, already employed by the London North Western Railway. The radial axle boxes were produced with very fine tolerances. Rubber bumpers were employed to move the axle back into position. Locomotives 285, and 287 transferred to the SS, while locomotives 284 and 286 were transferred to the HSM at the termination of the NRS. Both HSM machines were sold before the merger of HSM and SS to NS. HSM 310 (old 386) was sold to Spoorweg-Maatschappij Gent-Terneuzen, where it remained in service until 1915. HSM 309 (former 384) was sold to the Amsterdamse Ballast Maatschappij in 1918, where it remained in service until 1930. Units 285 and 287 were renumbered 1285 and 1287 by the SS. A second series of the same type of locomotives was ordered by the Nederlandsche Zuid Ooster Spoorweg Maatschappij (NOZS). Initially 6 machines were ordered for service on its Nijmegen-Den Bosch-Tilburg route; later another 2 machines were added. These machines did not have the safety valve that was present on the NRS machines. These machines entered service in 1882 and 1883. At the merger of the SS, into which the NZOS had been merged, into the NS, these machines were employed by the NS to run local trains, together with the two units transferred via the SS. The SS numbers were 267‚Äì274. During their later operating years some machines got outfitted with Serve-pipes which put the heated surface to 107,5 m2 or 89,5 m2. The NS renumbered the units 5301‚Äì5310 at the merger of SS and HSM in 1921. The former NZOS locomotives were numbered 5301‚Äì5308, whilst the NRS units were numbered 5309 and 5310. They were classified as PT3 by NS. The locomotives were retired between 1925 and 1935. All have been scrapped. == Overview == {  style=\\"float\\" - ! Builder Number ! NRS Number ! NZOS Number !

She teams up with Cassandra, a reporter, to uncover the secrets they hold. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" !Title !Issue # !Release date -  colspan=\\"6\\" 2CC6E8;\\"  - \\"I want everything you have.\\" - Laura  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" June 18, 2014 -  colspan=\\"6\\" The survivors of the 1920s Occurrence (Amaterarsu, Amon-ra, Susanoo, and Minerva) meet at the end of their lifetime and kill each other, with Ananke watching from a distance. In 2014, after attending a performance by Amaterasu, Laura is invited to meet several members of the Pantheon by Lucifer (who is one of the Pantheon herself). After Lucifer and Laura arrived, they see that Amaterasu is being interviewed by a woman named Cassandra, a skeptic reporter who believes the Pantheon is an elaborate hoax. Another Goddess is introduced: Sakhmet. Assassins attempt to murder the Pantheon members during the interview, but Lucifer kills them in retaliation. At the trial for the committed murder, Lucifer toys with the judge using the ability to kill people with just a click of her fingers. After doing so, the judge's head explodes, but Lucifer insists that she has nothing to do with any of it. First appearance: The 1920s Occurrence, Ananke, Laura, Amaterasu, Lucifer, Cassandra, Sakhmet, Beth -  colspan=\\"6\\" 2CC6E8;\\"  - \\"You spend all your life wishing you were something special.

She then visits Cassandra and they plot to investigate the Pantheon with the intention of discovering if one of them framed Lucifer. Laura attends a concert in the subway by Pantheon member, The Morr√≠gan. But when she arrives, another member, Baphomet (Baph), appears holding The Morr√≠gan's severed head. First appearance: Baal, Laura's family, Baphomet, The Morrigan -  colspan=\\"6\\" 2CC6E8;\\"  - \\"Killing you is too quick of a thing.

Laura breaks up the fight, but the two start to fight again, both speaking at once, which envelops Laura's world in darkness. The police arrive and fire a plastic round at Baph. He sets the cop on fire, which eventually kills him. The Morr√≠gan reveals a third form, Annie, who brings the man back to life. Laura is then arrested. Soon after she goes to meet Cassandra, and they discuss what Lucifer had told them about individual members of the Pantheon. As they talk, Pantheon member Baal appears before them.

They discuss what to do with Lucifer before Laura goes to visit her. At their meeting, Lucifer breaks out the prison, revealing that she was not in danger at any point. First appearance: The Valkyries (Brunhilde and others), W≈çden, Minerva, Owly -  colspan=\\"6\\" 2CC6E8;\\"  - \\"If you exist, you're staring at me.\\" - Tara  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" October 22, 2014 -  colspan=\\"6\\" Lucifer goes on a rampage, and the other gods come to control her. Amaterasu tries to reason with her but Baal and Sakhmet attempt to fight her. Laura goes to find The Morr√≠gan, who agrees to help her and whisks Lucifer away from the battle to safety. As Lucifer attempts to leave the safe house, Ananke appears and clicks her fingers, blowing up Lucifer's head. Later on, Laura clicks her fingers to try to light a cigarette like she had seen Lucifer do. Miraculously, the cigarette starts to burn. }  Fandemonium  A month after Lucifer's death, Laura teams up with Inanna to uncover the truth about who framed her, whilst dealing with the emergence of new Gods and her newfound fame as friend of The Pantheon. Meanwhile, Cassandra still seeks her big story about The Pantheon. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" !Title !Issue # !Release date -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"I've got no reason to be afraid anymore.\\" - Inanna  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 6  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" December 17, 2014 -  colspan=\\"6\\" Laura has been lying low when she is contacted by Inanna, who reveals that they met a year before at Ragnarock (an event about the Pantheon that occurred before the Recurrence) before he was chosen to become Inanna. He tells her that the men who attempted to assassinate Lucifer were fans. Afterwards, Laura decides to come back into the public eye, having become famous in the Pantheon fandom for her public association with Lucifer. First appearance: Inanna, David Blake -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"I'm a God, not a saint.\\" - W≈çden  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 7  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" January 21, 2015 -  colspan=\\"6\\" At an event called Fantheon, Laura runs into Cassandra and they discuss the shooting and the Prometheus Gambit, which is a theory that states killing a god will turn you into one. They run into Beth, Cassandra's disgruntled former employee, fired for leaking their location to Baal. Afterwards Laura takes part in a panel about life after being close to a god. At the panel, Kerry, a former member of W≈çden's entourage, the Valkyries, where she went by the name Brunhilde, gives personal details about him. W≈çden then arrives and asks if she will rejoin the Valkyries, if she reveals all she said was lies. The desperate Kerry agrees but W≈çden walks away, terminating the offer, and leaving her broken. Afterwards, Kerry attempts to shoot W≈çden (under the illusion that the Prometheus Gambit exists), hoping to become a god if she succeeds. Minerva incapacitates her, but is shocked by her aggression. At the end of Fantheon, Laura runs into Baph who takes her to the Underground for a night of fun. Afterwards The Morr√≠gan invites Laura to a party thrown by Dionysus, who has recently revealed himself. First appearance: Minerva's parents, Brunhilde (as Kerry) -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"Being happy for a night.

At the party, Laura dances with Sakhmet, and W≈çden talks to Cassandra. Laura briefly comes out of the drug-like effect the party has to talk to Baphomet, asking him whether anything special happened before he became a god. She talks to Baal about Brunhilde, who is at a private hospital, and Minerva, who has gone into isolation since the incident. After the party, which goes on for days, Laura tells Dionysus that he's the best, because he makes others happy - but he reveals he isn't happy himself. On her way home, Baal stops and asks if she wants a lift. They then spend the night together. First appearance: Dionysus (post-transformation) -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"'Life is the last thing I have boy.\\" - Ananke  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 9  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" March 25, 2015 -  colspan=\\"6\\" At Valhalla, Ananke is comforting Minerva when Baphomet appears to talk about Laura. Minerva, tired of Baphomet's sarcastic nature, shouts at him about how they are all going to die. Baphomet gets emotional and Ananke comforts him and informs him that the Prometheus Gambit will only work for a death god (to buy more time) - but strictly warns him about punishment for killing a God. Cassandra appears and Baph is dismissed after trying to harm her. Ananke gives Cassandra an interview, beginning with the history of the Pantheon - the Gods come to Earth to fight the Great Darkness in the world. After winning once, the Pantheon had failed for thousands of years. When they win once again, they decide to elect Ananke to guide and protect the Gods. She then reveals that Cassandra is the twelfth god and transforms her into Ur√∞r, who in turn transforms her two assistants (Meredith and Zoe) into Verdandi and Skuld, to make up the Three Norns. First appearance: The Norns (post-transformation) -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"If I'm going to hell, you're all coming with me.\\" - Baphomet  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 10 May 6, 2015 -  colspan=\\"6\\" The Morr√≠gan talks to Baphomet, who wants more from his life. Laura is upset about not being the twelfth god, so Inanna takes her to Ragnarock, a massive festival in Hyde Park, and then leaves for his own performance. Laura goes to talk to Ur√∞r, who has worked out who tried to kill Lucifer, but superfan David Blake tells her instead as Ur√∞r isn't seeing anyone. The Norns then begin their Ragnarock performance. Baphomet appears, and attempts to kill them to steal their life but The Morr√≠gan stops him. Ananke threatens to kill Baphomet, but The Morr√≠gan promises to look after him and they escape. The crowd begin to riot, so The Norns perform to calm them down. After her performance, Ur√∞r is upset that the crowd cheered her performance about their inevitable deaths. Laura comforts her and tells her she's happy for her. Baph regrets it but realizes he must kill Inanna at his performance. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:orange\\"  - \\"No one gets a happy ending.\\" - Laura  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 11  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" June 3, 2015 -  colspan=\\"6\\" When Laura returns home, Ananke is waiting for her. Baphomet attacks Inanna at his performance, and they fight, ending in the building exploding and the death of Inanna. Ananke tells Laura that she is a thirteenth member of The Pantheon, Persephone. Ananke tells her to sing, but just before she does, Ananke clicks her fingers, killing Persephone. When Laura's parents discover this, Ananke blows up the house, killing them. First appearance: Laura (as Persephone) } == Book Two ==  Commercial Suicide  The Pantheon is reeling after the events of the last issue and each attempt to deal with their emotions in their individual ways, whilst also dealing with an inner threat unknown to them all. Each issue in this arc focuses on a different character in the comic and most featured an additional artist: Kate Brown (#12), Tula Lotay (#13), Stephanie Hans (#15), Leila del Duca (#16) and Brandon Graham (#17, except last page which was done by Jamie McKelvie). All issue's back quotes are from another character talking about the featured character.

They head to the wreckage of Inanna's residency, to record footage of the grieving crowd, when Baal appears to pay his respects. Beth uses her previous connection with him to give him a lead on Innana's death, in exchange for an interview. Afterwards they head to find The Morr√≠gan, using the same method Laura had used when Lucifer was in danger. After revealing herself, Baal begins beating The Morr√≠gan, wanting information on Baphomet's whereabouts. Ultimately, W≈çden appears and breaks up the fight, taking the two Gods with him. Beth is left with her exclusive and Baphomet appears in the shadows, choosing to cover his own back rather than help The Morr√≠gan.

When she tries to play an original song, the crowd boos and turns violent against her until she starts performing again. She starts narrating about her life, from where catcalls began at the age of eleven and threats of rape occurred. Adopting a mask to hide her face, she begins gigging in secret to small crowds, which is where Ananke finds her and changes her into Tara. In the present, Tara makes a rare visit to talk to the other Gods and Ananke. They argue about what to do with The Morr√≠gan and the footage that Beth has obtained.

He then reveals that Ananke killed the judge at Lucifer's trial, which he kept quiet about. He tells of all the things he had done for Ananke; build a hideout for the Gods, organize Fandemonium and Ragnarok and even cleaned up the murdered body when Ananke blew up Laura's house. Ananke has been making W≈çden do her work for ages and he is afraid that more will die soon.

Dionysus, Baal, W≈çden and Sakhmet argue with each other and all storm out, leaving Amaterasu alone with the body. Heading down the hall, she goes into Kerry's room, where she is still recovering from her injuries. Minerva is with her, along with Beth's crew. Minerva is still feeling guilty over what she did to Kerry but is also concerned that everything that is happening doesn't add up. The Norns arrive and chastise Beth for being there, who had been invited by W≈çden to document the Pantheon. When Amaterasu tries to keep Ur√∞r from waking Kerry, Ur√∞r calls her out for appropriating culture. The two argue about Japanese culture which culminates in Amaterasu Stepping The Norns to Hiroshima. During their argument, Amaterasu accidentally creates a very offensive image of a sun over Hiroshima. Amaterasu realizes her mistake and explains to Ur√∞r that she didn't choose this image. Returning to the shrine, she prays for her fellow Gods and the ones who have died. \\\\---- Video Games #3: Amaterasu shows Brunhilde (Kerry) the ring from W≈çden that he told her belonged to the 1920s Amaterasu.

Combined with the efforts of the other Gods, Persephone manages to fight and capture Ananke in her vines. Ananke reveals that four Gods must die for the Great Darkness to be held back and accuses Persephone of being the one to destroy them all. The other Gods decide to spare Ananke and put her in the cage that once held The Morr√≠gan, but Persephone, bitter about Ananke killing her sister Jenny without even realising, kills her.

Later Persephone, Baal and Minerva are watching an old Ananke interview, with Minerva feeding off the anger from it and wishing she could solve the puzzle that Ananke was. Baal is confident in what Ananke told them about the Great Darkness but Persephone has doubts. An interview with Amaterasu sends Minerva into a rage for leaving her to die but as she is venting, the windows behind her suddenly smash and she is dragged out by a humanoid shape made of darkness, which Baal believes is the Great Darkness Ananke talked about. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:green\\"  - \\"You're lying.

He reveals that Ananke told him about the Darkness when he first became Baal and that Amaterasu also knew because she was also a sky god. The Pantheon decide to vote on what to do: fight the Darkness head on, study the problem or leave it alone to anarchy. Baal, Minerva and Amaterasu vote to fight, W≈çden, Dionysus and Ur√∞r vote to study and Sakhmet, The Morr√≠gan and Nergal choose anarchy. Persephone is left with the deciding vote and chooses anarchy, much to the chagrin of Baal and Ur√∞r.

From January to February the various members of the Pantheon go about their lives: Persephone enjoys time with Sakhmet while occasionally sleeping with Nergal, who has created a holographic version of her family to get closure. Baal meets with the Prime Minister about their situation and continues to work with Ur√∞r to try and combat the Darkness. Amaterasu starts her own religion called ShinTwo, Minerva starts drinking, W≈çden moves on from his Asian fetish onto a type more like Persephone. The Morr√≠gan stays in the underground, maintaining her dominant relationship with Nergal. Dionysus works with both W≈çden and Ur√∞r to try and activate her perception to other powers through a series of Dio's parties. In the end it works but she still finds it pointless. At the beginning of March, Ur√∞r invites David Blake to Valhalla to offer him a role being a community liaison for the Pantheon. He warns Ur√∞r that in the second year of the Recurrence the Gods become more violent and less able to be controlled. The other Norns, Verdandi and Skuld, ask David if they will die with the other official Gods that were transformed by Ananke, but he has no answer. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:green\\"  - \\"Isn't this great?\\" - Amaterasu  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 28  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" April 12, 2017 -  colspan=\\"3\\" A few days after meeting with the Norns, David Blake returns home and finds them in his house, where Ur√∞r is surprised to find he has a child.

Ur√∞r confronts Amaterasu about the temple but backs off when Ammy threatens her. Nergal shows up at the party but runs away when he sees Persephone, who he's been ignoring. Persephone runs after him trying to get an explanation but accidentally knocks his sunglasses off, revealing bruises and scratches where The Morr√≠gan has been abusing him. Dio goes after him which abruptly ends the party, but Sakhmet, Amaterasu and the partygoers remain for an orgy. In the middle of complaining about Ur√∞r, Amaterasu accidentally reveals to Sakhmet that Persephone killed Ananke, who up until now was the only God who did not know. Sakhmet flies into a rage and Amaterasu escapes, while Sakhmet kills everyone at the orgy.

Ananke kills her sister as the sister warns it will end badly for Ananke once the children catch on. In the present, Persephone tells the reader she has a secret while wanting others to call her Laura again. Mimir tells them his father knew Ananke killed the judge and has the other three heads; and that W≈çden sent the snipers after Lucifer in the first place. They consider Ananke may have done something to Minerva. Verdandi and Skuld find themselves human again and discover the cage.

In the present, W≈çden confronts Minerva who says Ananke promised her a way to live and taught her how to transfer the heads, though she cannot find them, which W≈çden wants for his own purposes. Laura and The Norns escape though W≈çden grabs Mimir's head. As Uror prepares to tell people what happened; over text Minerva says W≈çden attacked her and that she thinks Baal has his own secret room she could never get into. Once Minerva tells Baal that Persephone has found a room, he teleports there in a panic.

Even fewer appear to be male Persephones. Two appear to be killed by Minerva. In the present, Baal explains that Ananke told him he must kill a child every four months to stave off the Great Darkness; else it will kill the world, starting with those closest to him. Ananke had W≈çden make the lightning bolt necklace so nobody would know which Baal he truly was. He refused to kill kids but then his father was killed. He's killed five children, including the day he teleported away from Minerva. He despises it but sees it as necessity. He lets Persephone live after she tells him her secret that she's three months pregnant; with no idea who the father is (Baal or Nergal).

In the present, Minerva prepares the three heads for W≈çden's finding them by sewing their mouths shut. Fans discuss Ur√∞r's crazy story; none of them believe her as W≈çden brainwashed everyone into thinking the gig went great. The Valkyries then recaptured The Norns.

Nergal learns from Minerva's text that The Morr√≠gan ignored Sakhmet's attack on Laura. He breaks up with her, causing Badb to attack him.

Minerva appears in a field in July 2013, calling Ananke to come pick her up and pay off a couple to pose as her parents. Ananke's attack on Minerva was all a ruse so Minerva could carry on the work after Ananke fell. The machine truly does nothing and Ananke's suicide note was for Minerva. In the present, Nergal takes The Morrigan's body to where they live in The Underground preparing to memorialize her. Laura tells him she is pregnant. He says he will support her but to never do what he did in life. This makes Laura realize something. W≈çden has The Norns imprisoned, working with Beth and her crew to create the smear campaign that Ur√∞r is going insane. Woden has The Norns divine where the heads are, finding them with their mouths sewn shut, and is convinced not to touch them by Minerva. Talking with Baal, Minerva is horrified to hear Persephone is pregnant. Laura returns to her place, finding her other phone; and sending a text to Ur√∞r (and W≈çden): to watch out for Baal in April and she's sorry she cannot help. Laura decides to give up and leaves. Minerva has W≈çden force The Norns to divine where Laura is, Ur√∞r reveals Persephone doesn't exist. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:brown\\"  - \\"The cycle breaks.

He also has a gun set to stun to capture Persephone, but Minerva sets it to lethal. He sends Beth, Robin and Toni in power suits to capture her. The sister's fourth rule is revealed to be that if her god ever has a child: the cycle will break and the Great Darkness takes Ananke forever. When confronted by the trio, Laura reveals she is not a god anymore, and also had an abortion. Beth is disgusted Laura gave up her powers, and lets her go to live with the shame. W≈çden no longer considers Laura a threat. Minerva believes she has won, able to manipulate W≈çden and Baal, having The Norns under control (with Uror to become the forth head), and expecting Nergal and The Morrigan to destroy each other. A final flashback shows the sister tell her grandson that the fourth rule will be a lie to fool Ananke, and they must have faith one of the children will find the real way out. Laura goes home, determined without godhood to decide who and what she is for herself; revealed to still summon fire with a snap of her fingers. }  Okay  The final arc. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - !

Fan of Persephone, Tom, and his friend Nathan record themselves getting ready for Baal's final gig at the 02 arena, holding 20,000 people. Minerva, W≈çden and Baal discuss the plan. Using technology to mimic Dioynsus' powers to control the crowd and lure out The Great Darkness, Baal believes he can destroy it by sacrificing the crowd.Though there won't be any children at the gig he still feels very guilty and his unknowing mother encourages him to go through with it; Baal has included her in the crowd. Minerva tells her \\"little monster\\" to create what seems like a plague to turn them against each other; while also mocking the Great Darkness. Several people who've previously interacted with the Pantheon attend the event, falling under the spell. Outside the arena, The Great Darkness appears and is seemingly caught by a blast. Afterwards, the fans are still alive with no idea what happened; Tom's phone shows Laura appearing and promising everyone it will be okay. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:black\\"  - \\"I'll make you something wonderful.\\" - Mimir  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 41  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" January 15, 2019 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  Laura still has limited powers of fire and vocal control, using them to free The Norns whom then fight off the Valkyries. Ur√∞r finds the 3 heads of Lucifer, Inanna and Tara, while freeing Mimir's head. Fleeing to the Underground, the first 3 heads are able to expose Minerva as Ananke. Laura has a solution for 3 of the heads to get bodies again. Tara volunteers to stay a head, Mimir promises to make her something wonderful. Meeting with Nergal, he reveals The Morr√≠gan intended for him and her to constantly resurrect the other one while forever being apart. Laura helps him through the abuse. Nergal permanently kills The Morr√≠gan's 3 incarnations, allowing for the other 3 heads to claim the bodies. Laura has a plan but needs Baal for it to work. In order to prove the Great Darkness isn't the real problem, Ur√∞r asks a new question with her powers. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:black\\"  - \\"I am oh so bored of men like you.\\" - Minerva  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 42  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" February 27, 2019 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  Laura is able to show Baal the real source of The Great Darkness-the 1831 creature, which that era's W≈çden merged with, and then was captured by Minerva/Ananke in 1923; forced to do their bidding as their monster ever since. Baal grants her the mercy of killing her. Mimir texts his father the truth about Minerva, causing him to send the controlled Valkyries after her; but Minerva easily turns them back on him, crushing W≈çden's skull and tearing him apart. After Baal protects his family from the Valkyries and turns them over to the police, the footage of Laura killing Ananke goes live. Laura says she can end this so all the gods will be like her. Nergal flees to Dionysus' hospital room, sadly killing his brain to bring back Dionysus instead. - -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:black\\"  - \\"Whatever happens, you get to live.\\" - Cassandra  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 43  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" April 24, 2019 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  Minerva takes control of Beth, Robin and Toni, sending them and the Valkyries after the gods while she sets up W≈çden's machine to control the gods. Dionysus is able to shut it down. The Valkyries, Robin, Toni and the other two Norns all leave before the last conflict (knocking Beth out when she still wants the power of the gods). Confronting Minerva, Laura uses her powers to help her show them the truth. In the ancient time, Ananke and her sister had minor miracle abilities and found ten others whom shared the skill. Ananke wanted to cheat death, while signs pointed to twelve like them being born into every generation. Ananke's sister discovered the power of \\"godhood\\" displaying the grander miracles. One of their group only saw himself as a god and his power burned him out after two years; godhood is a shortcut to power as opposed to a lifetime of work-a song that will end. Ananke proposes she create the cage of a story, labeling each generation's twelve children as a god that takes advantage of each person's weaknesses while she collects the heads as both Maiden and Crone. In the present, the humans renounce their godhood, realising what each of their weaknesses was; though Lucifer refuses and summons her fire. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:black\\"  - \\"I need time.\\" - Minerva  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 44  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" July 4, 2019 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  Outside, the police arrest the Valkyries, other two Norns, Beth, Robin and Toni. Laura is able to use her vocal powers to put on a performance for Lucifer. Lucifer realizes her dream to be in on stage is not worth her life, reverting to just Eleanor. Though Minerva claims her powers are gone without the gods, the others expect the cycle to continue as long as she's alive. Though Laura initially wants to kill her, she is convinced to lock Minerva in the cage that held Mimir; realizing she doesn't want to be a murderer anymore. However, Valentine no longer wants to live, so he grabs Minerva, and throws himself off a ledge, killing them both. The others agree to follow Cassandra's plan. Laura disarms the police but then everyone allows themselves to be arrested. On June 16, 2015, at Laura's trial, the court appreciates everyone's cooperation in explaining everything but she is still guilty of killing Ananke. The judge prepares to deliver Laura's sentence, as she seems content. -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:black\\"  -   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 45  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" September 4, 2019 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  On July 16, 2055, 40 years after the Recurrence ended, an elderly Laura arrives at Valhalla, now a museum dedicated to the Recurrence, to attend Cassandra's funeral. Laura meets with Eleanor, revealing that the two eventually split up and Laura and Cassandra married instead. Laura meets with the surviving members of the Recurrence: Zahid, Aruna (now using a robotic body invented by Jon), Jon, Meredith, Zoe, and Umar. She speaks with them about the people they have lost and the lives they have led. Laura begins the funeral, but instead of giving Cassandra's eulogy, activates a hologram that Cassandra recorded before her death. Cassandra speaks to each member of the Recurrence, explaining what they have meant to her and how she feels about her life, before ending with the words Ananke spoke at the end of each Recurrence: \\"I love you. I love you all. I'll miss you.\\" As Aruna sings to end the funeral, Laura steps away and speaks directly to the reader, explaining that this is the story that she has told and speaking on what a lifetime of work means. Laura counts to four while making her final points on the nature of stories and the future, and snaps her fingers. - } == Specials ==  Specials  Standalone specials written about Pantheons through the ages, featuring contributions by different artists. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" !Title !Year Featured !Guest Artist !Release date -  colspan=\\"6\\" FAF519;\\"  - \\"You will go on long after we are gone.\\" - Woden  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1831  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Stephanie Hans  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" September 21, 2016 -  colspan=\\"6\\" By March 5, 1831, five Gods remain alive: Hades, Lucifer, Inanna, W≈çden and The Morr√≠gan. In Rome, Hades is delirious on his deathbed when Ananke kills him. At the Villa Diodati on Lake Geneva, the last few Gods and Goddesses of the recurrence gather to wait out their final days. The group decide to tell stories to pass the time. Inanna tells of her life as Claire Claremont and how her step-sister and her husband, Mary and Percy Shelley, were granted Godhood by Ananke before her and the feelings about this. W≈çden tells of her three attempts to have a child, all ending with failure. Lucifer and Morr√≠gan reveal they are plotting to resurrect Hades using their abilities but the creature they create is monstrous and kills the pair. As it prepares to kill Inanna, W≈çden intervenes and merges with the creature to stop it. The shell of W≈çden controlled by the creature reveals W≈çden knew all along that Inanna killed her three children to keep her divinity. The creature is about to kill her when Inanna reveals she is pregnant with Lucifer's child, so it spares her and disappears across the frozen lake outside the villa. A week later, Inanna thinks she has been spared, but Ananke appears and kills her, ending the Occurrence on March 19, 1831. -  colspan=\\"6\\" FAF519;\\"  - \\"Let me burn.\\" - Lucifer  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 455  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Andr√© Lima Ara√∫jo  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" May 18, 2017 -  colspan=\\"6\\" By August 455, Lucifer is the only God left alive. Calling himself Julius Caesar, he approaches the Vandal army, kills many whilst scattering the others and is then declared Emperor of Rome. Bacchus praises his performance as an emperor, and Lucifer wishes he was there, revealing him as a vision. Ananke arrives to condemn his actions and that he should have killed himself as his time is up and he is endangering the future. Lucifer rejects his role as a God and wants to be merely a man again. Ananke begs him to sacrifice himself and when he refuses attempts to kill him. Instead Lucifer sets her on fire and moves to kill her, but she convinces him to give it two weeks and if he isn't dead he is allowed to kill her. The Vandals return and gather nearby but instead of dealing with them as his council wishes him, he kills the council for patronising him and turns them into a human harp. He begins to fall apart, bleeding everywhere so demands to talk to Jupiter. He gathers Rome's gold at the temple and begs to live, but slowly falls apart on himself and dies, saying 'et tu, Jupiter' as he dies. Ananke takes his body and takes him outside the rules, beginning to cut him up and throw him in the river, giving him the pagan funeral she promised. Geiseric approaches her, saying he witnessed Baal last year and wondered if he had the same power as Lucifer. Ananke wants Geiseric to take the city and erase the rule of Lucifer as emperor from history, ending the Occurrence on August 16, 455. -  colspan=\\"6\\" FAF519;\\"  -  \\"Well done us.\\"- Lucifer  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2013-2014  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Kris Anka, Chynna Clugston Flores, Carla Speed McNeil, Rachael Stott, Emma Vieceli, Matt Wilson  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" December 13, 2017 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  In November 2013, Baal has sex with Inanna and falls in love with him. The next month as Sakhmet and Lucifer wake, Baal confronts Lucifer for sleeping with Inanna as well; though the warning not to use their powers prevents a proper fight. Sakhmet leaves Lucifer, calling her a bad person. Cameron (Nergal) hitchhikes to London for one of The Morrigan's early gigs, meeting Umar (Dionysus) and they become friends; though Cameron warns Umar not to believe in people's better natures. In October 2013, Ananke encourages Tara to perform her own music no matter what the mortals think; secretly acknowledging the advice was actually cruel. In January 2014, Laura admits her attraction to Lucifer in jail. In August 2013, Elanor tells Hazel over gaming that she would want to be the furthest thing from a god. Two months later after she transformed, Lucifer dismisses Hazel. In December 2013 she is saddened that Hazel became Amaterasu and will soon die as well. In May 2014, Laura sleeps with Baal whom asks her not to tell Inanna; Laura believes it will become complicated. -  colspan=\\"6\\" FAF519;\\"  -  \\"This will have to be my masterpiece.\\"- Ananke  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1923  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Aud Koch  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" February 7, 2018 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  In 1923, Lucifer calls all the gods together onto his private island mansion and smaller island with a lighthouse; to celebrate their final few weeks together complete with a projection of a butler. Ananke privately prepares a grand plan as it is unusual to have all the gods still alive this late in the cycle. Amaterasu and Susanoo have never acted on their obvious feelings for one another; despite being strangers as mortals they are brother and sister as gods. Amon-Ra is still not over Amaterasu leaving him. The elitists Baal and Set are disgusted by the trio's interpretation of art. German futurist Woden loves the National Socialism spreading in his homeland. The child Minerva is amused by The Morrigan whom refers to himself in the third person. The three male Norns disagree on the greatest threat to the future. As Dionysus nears the end of his life, his visions of another war to come disgust the former soldier Neptune. Lucifer is found dead at his dinner table. Dionysus is soon killed by the projection technology. Neptune is found drowned on the shore. The Norns figure out that Baal, Set and Woden are working together. Set and Baal believe in preserving art and culture for those born elite by plunging the world into war and darkness to kill everyone else. Woden wants a totalitarian future for humanity. Uror and Skuld join in: killing Veroandi for objecting to the plan. Ananke lets them choose their own path. Ananke kills The Morrigan after he has a vision and she blames the conspirators. After Minerva warns the others, they rush to stop a ritual with a machine that required the deaths of four gods, at the lighthouse. The ritual works; but Woden is shocked by the machine and vanishes. Set kills Uror and Skuld, no longer needing them. Amaterasu uses her miracles to attack Baal and Set; killing him, while Minerva secretly murders Set. Ananke secretly meets with Woden under the lighthouse; the ritual having captured something Woden considers a \\"zeitgeist,\\" for Germany: a female creature of science and fiction (Implied to be the 1831 creature). Ananke removes Woden's fake godhood, (likely by killing his Mimir). Leaving Woden a mortal man once again, Ananke refuses to explain why she put all this in motion and kills him. Ananke says with all the gods killed for the dark ritual, perhaps the remaining 4 of Susanoo, Amaterasu, Minerva and Amon-Ra can give the world a chance by sacrificing themselves; creating the opening scene in the main series. -  colspan=\\"6\\" FAF519;\\"  -  \\"Father, forgive me.\\"- Lucifer  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1373  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Ryan Kelly  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" September 26, 2018 -  colspan=\\"6\\"  In Avignon, France, 1373 A.D., twenty-two years after the Plague known as the Black Death: Lucifer the nun has lived well past her time limit as a god but is still in full control of herself and her powers. Immune to the plague and desperate to repent, she visits a village where a girl says the disease has returned. After allowing herself the be whipped by dying Christians, Lucifer goes to visit the first patient of the village; Ananke. Hearing the old woman's confession, Ananke reveals she and her helper manipulate the other gods towards their deaths and often tell the gods the world will end if they keep living. Lucifer's human mother died of the plague but the baby survived, her father convinced his daughter that she was The Devil even before Ananke transformed her. Lucifer refuses to kill Ananke with the knife, so Ananke reveals the plague was created by the previous Pantheon; Ananke nurtured it so it would spread through Europe, the Middle East and China. She admits such a tactic isn't one she'd try again. Lucifer is enraged, but chooses to cut flesh from her hand, placing it in Ananke's mouth. Lucifer and Ananke burn together as godhood consumes the former (burning the village and ending the plague); while she makes one last plea for forgiveness from the Christian God and her birth father.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was originally part of the Castillo de V√©lez-Blanco in V√©lez-Blanco, Andalusia, Spain. The patio now serves as the entrance of the museum's Thomas J. Watson Library and to showcase the museum's Italian Renaissance statues. ==Early history and creation== The patio was built from 1506 to 1515 for the Governor of Murcia, Pedro Fajardo, 1st Marquis of los V√©lez, as part of the Castillo de V√©lez-Blanco in V√©lez-Blanco, Andalusia. It was crafted out of marble of Macael by Northern Italian sculptors and artisans. After political unrest in Spain, the castle was abandoned by the early 19th century. In 1904, the castle's owners removed and sold the entire patio to a Parisian dealer, whereupon it was transported to Paris. ==Later history and display== From the museum's first floor Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s' Saint John the Baptist, part of the \\"Sculpture and Decorative Arts of the Spanish Renaissance\\" exhibit George and Florence Meyer Blumenthal purchased the patio in 1913 and initially used it as a centerpiece for their private house on Park Avenue in Manhattan. It remained there until he gifted the patio to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the year of his death (1941), also during his tenure as president of the museum. In 1945, the patio was removed and shipped in blocks to the Met; Blumenthal's house was subsequently razed. The patio was moved into museum storage and remained there until around 1963. At that time, Olga Raggio undertook a five-year research study of the patio, and reconstructed and installed it in the museum in 1964. During the reconstruction, Raggio had two arches and other more modern elements from Blumenthal's ownership removed. The patio now serves as the entrance of the museum's Thomas J. Watson Library and to showcase the museum's Italian Renaissance statues. From 1997 to May 2000, the patio was closed for refurbishment, where the carvings were cleaned, extra lighting was installed, and a new floor, also of white Macael marble, was put in. The floor closely matches the original floor of the patio, and was produced in the same quarry as the stone of the patio. The Flemish tapestry The Triumph of Fame hangs on the patio's east wall. Upon the museum's acquisition of the tapestry, it held two temporary exhibitions simultaneously within the patio, beginning on May 12, 2000. \\"The Forgotten Friezes from the Castle of V√©lez Blanco\\" displayed six of ten 20-foot-long reliefs from the same castle, which were discovered at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris in 1992; the exhibit ran until February 2, 2003. The other exhibit, \\"Sculpture and Decorative Arts of the Spanish Renaissance\\", displayed 65 Spanish Renaissance sculptures and objects and ran until December 31, 2002. ==Description and interpretation== The work is a patio from the Castillo de V√©lez-Blanco, near Almeria. It is a notable example of early sixteenth-century Spanish architecture, with an asymmetrical layout, Gothic gargoyles, low and segmental arches, and a flat-timbered ceiling. The patio's arches, the piers of the balustrade, and the doors and windows all feature intricate Renaissance details, carved by workers from Northern Italy. Motifs include flora and fauna, elaborately made yet clear in form and with a three-dimensional quality characteristic of the early Italian Renaissance. These motifs resemble those of the palazzi in Venice and its surrounding towns. On a flat band below the cornice of the patio's second story is an inscription in Latin: \\"PETRUS FAGIARDUS: MARCHIO DE VELIZ PRIMUS: AC REGNI MURCIE QUINTUS PREFECTUS SUE PROSAPIE HANC ARCEM IN ARCE TITULI EREXIT: CEPTUM OPUS ANO AB ORTU CRISTI MILLESSIMO QUINGENTESSIMO SEXTO PERFECTUM ANNO QUINTODECIMO SUPRA MILESSIUM AC QUINGENTESSIMO\\".

The chateau dominates the \\"hameau du Villaret\\", and its location on top of a hill makes it highly noticeable from kilometres away. The chateau was strategically located within a system of defense for the region. Indeed, in case of attack, the Chateau of Chamb√©ry would send signals from the main tower to the Chateau de Monterminod, which would then signal another chateau, and so forth until the message reached the Maurienne valley. This system enabled the vassals from the area to prepare for any attack and provide help. The vineyard that surrounds the Chateau de Monterminod was created following an 11th- century law by Odilo of Cluny, the archbishop of the Cluny Abbey.http://www.vins- perrier.com/fiche-A%7CVINSPERRIE%7CMONTERMINO-0100000000000000000-vins_de_savoie- FR.html The vineyard already surrounded the medieval castle and has not changed up to this day.

Around that time, the Princess Anne of Cyprus, called \\"the most beautiful princess in the world\\", who became Duchess of Savoie when she married her husband, gave her name to the grape variety that she brought with her from Paris, the c√©page Altesse. The Chateau de Monterminod traded hands multiple times between the 15th and 20th centuries until 1955, when Joseph Girard, a noted wine trader in the region, acquired the property.

The locomotives were named as was typical for the HSM. These were of the same type as locomotives of the series JAN PIERERSZZ., KOEN-OLIVIER VAN NOORT, with the exception that the new machines were compound locomotives. Compounding was introduced in an effort to improve efficiency. In 1885 Mr F.A.A. Middelberg of the HSM ordered a study of coal efficiency improvement by the use of compounding. Four existing locomotives, two in freight service and two in passenger service, were converted. The trials were successful The four production machines showed a decrease in coal consumption as well. The reduction in coal usage was around 17%. Still, no further compound locomotives were built for the HSM. Typically compounding locomotives use a small-diameter high-pressure cylinder(s) and a large-diameter low-pressure cylinder(s). These locomotives were different: the cylinders had the same bore, but different strokes. The low pressure cylinder's stroke was double the length of the high pressure cylinder's. The cut-off of the cylinders could be independently controlled. The HSM employed these locomotives from depots in Zutphen and Almelo. In 1908, three locomotives were taken out of service, whilst the 191 Paulus Potter remained in service until 1913. All units have been scrapped. ==Fleet list== {  style=\\"float\\" - !

For financial reasons, it was therefore decided to upgrade the B 31 to the Federal Motorway 860, since the Federal bears the costs for motorways. The sections of the B 31 and B 31a, which have already been developed in a manner similar to a motorway, are to be upgraded to a motorway at the same time as the completion of the city tunnel, in the best case around 2030.

In the show, Silver undertakes a search to discover what and where the mysterious entity Tanis is. While the style of Tanis evokes the earlier investigative nonfiction podcast Serial and its plot commingles real-world historical events and places with fictional elements, Taniss production team never acknowledges the story's fictional nature. After its premiere on October 13, 2015, episodes of Tanis have generally been released every two weeks, with longer gaps between each of its four seasons. Critical reception of the show has been positive and it peaked on the U.S. iTunes podcast download chart in the eleventh spot. A television adaptation of the podcast is planned as of 2017 and the fifth season of the podcast premiered on September 2, 2020. ==Content== Synopsis Nic Silver, a former radio host, discovers references to something called Tanis in two disparate sources. He begins hosting the podcast in an effort to determine what and where Tanis may be, quickly enlisting the help of an \\"information specialist\\" known via the username Meerkatnip. Silver comes to believe that Tanis is currently somewhere in the Puget Sound area. His search, aided with information provided by Meerkatnip, leads him to confront a variety of mysterious groups and organizations: Tesla Nova Corporation, a group Silver calls \\"The Cult of Tanis\\", and a group known as the Grackles. Format Tanis is a mystery horror podcast released every two weeks on iTunes and other services. Terry Miles, with the production company Public Radio Alliance, serves as the show's executive producer and provides the voice work for Silver, who Miles refers to as his \\"cousin\\" and who is listed as the show's other executive producer. Episodes of the show take approximately one week to plot and write, another week to record, and two weeks to mix, edit, and score. Dialogue is recorded where it occurs in the narrative, such that a scene which takes place in Tanis in a living room would be recorded in an actual living room. Tanis is scored with backing music and features a musical intro song by Miles's former band, Ashley Park. Financial support for the podcast comes from listeners via Patreon and sponsors, for whose products and services ads are integrated into the production. The podcast was described as \\"deep fiction\\" by The Guardian because, while it blends real-world and fictional events and people into its narrative, the show's creators and characters never acknowledge that the podcast is fictitious. The podcast, according to Molly Osberg in Vice, occurs in a world that \\"isn't so much an alternate reality as [a world] that hovers comfortably adjacent to ours.\\" In addition to the regular episodes, Miles also produces a variety of supporting documents and interviews which he posts on the show's official website in order to lend plausibility to the notion that the events of the show may be real. Tanis mimics the successful format of the earlier nonfictional investigative podcast Serial, notably its \\"unpretentious narrative style and mystery 'plot'\\". It is one of a spate of podcasts released in the wake of Serial first season in 2014 that remixed those elements of Serial with the horror and mystery genres, other such podcasts including Alice Isn't Dead, ars Paradoxica, and Tanis sister show The Black Tapes. Themes Themes of powerlessness and uneasy alliance with a (possible) enemy are present in Taniss narrative. Michael J. Collins described a pattern in mystery horror podcasts of narrators existing within uncertain personal or professional situations, such as Silver's inconsistent work and sleep schedules, which mimic \\"the lifestyles of overworked, yet unremunerated, Millennials.\\" Collins wrote that Tanis evoked millennial economic unease when Silver accepts aid in his investigation from Tesla Nova Corporation and thus becomes complicit with the organization Silver believes may be responsible for the goings-on he is investigating. ==Episodes== The first season of Tanis premiered October 13, 2015, when the first two episodes were released.

She was best known for founding the Los Angeles Unified School District's Project 10 program, an educational support and drop-out prevention program for LGBT youth, and the nonprofit arm of the Project 10 program, Friends of Project 10 Inc. == Personal life == Uribe was born in Los Angeles, and lived her entire life in Pasadena, California. She grew up in an Italian family, living with parents and her grandparents in the same household. She went to Catholic school throughout elementary school, high school, and college. Her grandparents were immigrants and \\"intensely\\" patriotic and believed the United States to be a land of opportunity. Their sense of fairness, working class sensibilities, and liberal ideals shaped her world view. Uribe felt that her family was supportive of her throughout her childhood, which gave her the mindset and strength needed to advocate for youth. Uribe felt her deepest attractions towards women. During her time as a student, she found herself sexually attracted to nuns at the Catholic schools she attended. While these desires remained mostly hidden, Uribe believed that some of the other female Catholic students had similar desires towards nuns, based on their behavior while in their presence. She eventually married a man, as that was the expectation in those days, but the marriage ultimately ended in divorce. She was the mother to two children and a grandmother to two children. Later in life, she met Gail Rolf in 1988, and they were later married in October, 2008, and remained together until her passing. Occupational choices for women were limited in her youth. Uribe felt she needed to choose among social work, nursing, and teaching. She chose education. During her career as a science teacher and counselor at Fairfax High School, Uribe became interested in youth LGBT outreach. She decided to form the program after hearing student concerns about a gay African-American male who had been kicked out of his family's home and dropped out of four high schools due to being sexually harassed. She founded Project 10 in 1984, as a drop-out prevention program for students who were LGBT. The program gained notoriety in the media following attacks on the program by Rev. Lou Sheldon and the Traditional Values Coalition, and people from around the country began sending money to Project 10. With that, she formed the nonprofit arm in 1986, Friends of Project 10 Inc. == Project 10 and Friends of Project 10 Inc. == Uribe founded Project 10 in 1984 to help schools curtail harassment of homosexual students, therefore reducing the LGBT dropout rate. Project 10, Los Angeles Unified School District program, provides support services and education for gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, and questioning students. Project 10's main goal is to establish voluntary, confidential, peer support groups led by trained facilitators. The support groups provide a safe environment for discussing the coming out process, family relationships, harassment, and health. The organization also works to educate young people, educators, and parents on important issues such as HIV/AIDS, STDs, teenage pregnancy prevention, school dropout, depression, and substance abuse. Services are provided to elementary and secondary advisers and district staff for at-risk youth. According to the organization's mission statement, \\"[Project 10] works to assure that public schools are in compliance with state and federal laws regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, and that academic achievement should not be limited by being part of a marginalized social group.\\" Project 10 received backlash from conservative politician Marian La Follette in March 1988, who led the GOP caucus in voting to withhold new funds from the Los Angeles Unified School District until it stopped supporting the program. Despite this, then District Supt. Leonard Britton and school board members voiced strong support for Uribe, the program, and homosexual students. On September 24, 1990 a session to teach some San Diego Unified School District staffers how to help students with the \\"curiosity, depression and fear that can surround homosexuality\\" drew a crowd outside of about 25 people, many of whom protested the program. Friends of Project 10 Inc., became a resource for educators, students, parents, and community groups throughout the country. The organization contributed to the ultimate passage of AB 537, the California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act 2000, which prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in California public schools. Friends of Project 10 Inc., produced Youth Lobby Days, the Make It Real Conference, the LGBTQ Youth Prom, the Models of Excellence Scholarship competition, and the annual Models of Pride Conference. == Awards and honors == Uribe has received recognition for her work from the California State Assembly and State Senate, the Mayor‚Äôs office of the City of Los Angeles, National Education Association, the LA Gay & Lesbian Center, GLADD, the Stonewall Scholarship Committee of United Teachers Los Angeles, 1999 Liberty Award from Lambda Legal Defense, Southern California Women for Understanding, the LA Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, the City of West Hollywood, Long Beach Pride, the LA County Human Relations Commission, the Los Angeles Unified School District, Vox Femina LA. Uribe was awarded the NOGLSTP GLBT Educator of the Year Award in 2009. One of her proudest moments was when she was informed by the White House, during President Obama's tenure, that she was a finalist for the Presidential Citizens Medal. In June 2019, Uribe was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall‚Äôs unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. == Sources External links== Category:1933 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th- century American educators Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Science teachers ","title":"Virginia Uribe"},{"id":"54102153","text":"Maria Hjertner (born 3 July 1996) is a Norwegian handball player who plays for Larvik HK.

Announced March 11, 2016, it was noted for being a dramatic departure from Rooster Teeth's typically comedic productions. The series follows a junkie, Jake (Jesse C. Boyd), who emerges after a drug binge only to learn that most of humanity has died after falling asleep. Jake and a small group of survivors search for the cause of the mysterious ‚Äúsleep epidemic.‚Äù ==Development== The concept had been in development since 2011 and was originally envisioned as a feature film, then a 45-minute short before becoming a six-episode series. According to Flanagan, ‚ÄúThe original concept was [co-founder] Burnie Burns‚Äô. He was trying to come up with a way to make an apocalyptic story on a lower budget. [...] So it was approached from a budgetary level from the very beginning but it‚Äôs such a relatable thing because everyone knows what it‚Äôs like to be this ridiculously tired.\\" RTX 2012 attendees filled Congress Avenue as extras for a scene being filmed. A scene was filmed during RTX 2012, and involved shutting down downtown Congress Avenue and 1,800 attendees. The 8-episode second season premiered on August 6, 2017. It features guest stars William Sadler and Jake Busey, along with new recurring cast members Ryan Cooper, Electra Avellan, and Adriene Mishler. A third season was originally set to premiere sometime in 2019, with the first two seasons being removed from Rooster Teeth first and syndicated to television networks for a six-month window instead. The two seasons have since been returned to the site after their broadcasts. On December 12, 2019, Flanagan announced on Twitter that he was no longer a full-time employee of Rooster Teeth, and confirmed that he did not have any future seasons of Day 5 in development at that time; while they had not been officially canceled, he stated, \\"I feel it's very unlikely they'll ever return as direct continuations. ==Cast and characters== Introduced in Season 1 * Jesse C.

On 17 April 1972, a battalion of the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces (SAF) landed by helicopter to establish a position on a dominating ridge at Sarfait, near the border with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The aim was to interdict the supply lines used by the guerillas of the PFLOAG from the PDRY to the interior of Dhofar, which ran along the narrow coastal plain beneath the foot of the escarpment at the southern end of the ridge. It was found that the position could not be extended to the coast to block the camel and vehicle tracks running below the escarpment, and lacking water, the position could be maintained only by aircraft or helicopters. The demands placed by the Simba position on the Sultan of Oman's Air Force forced the SAF to curtail other operations in Dhofar and several times threatened the collapse of the position. After the position had been held for three years, and the overall course of the war turned in favour of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, the Simba position became the launching point for an operation which was originally intended as a diversion but succeeded in cutting the rebels' supply line, precipitating their ultimate collapse. ==Background== The Dhofar Rebellion began in the mid 1960s. The Dhofar Liberation Front (DLF) sought local autonomy, but after the British Withdrawal from Aden in 1968 and the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the rebel movement acquired a secure source of supplies and weapons, and became more revolutionary in nature, renaming itself the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG). By 1970, the PFLOAG guerillas dominated the jebel, the mountainous hinterland of Dhofar. On 23 July that year, the reactionary Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed by his son, Qaboos bin Said al Said, who immediately instigated social reforms and began a counteroffensive against the guerillas. While locally recruited irregular firqats and two squadrons of the British Special Air Service sought to establish a permanent foothold on the eastern jebel from which civil aid teams could expand the Sultan's authority, the two regular battalions of the Sultan's Armed Forces (SAF) stationed in Dhofar also took a more active role. One of them, the Desert Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Knocker, was holding a base at Akoot, on the western jebel. This position was of little tactical significance, and most of the battalion was tied down merely defending it and bringing up supplies, especially water.White (2011), pp.212-216 ==Plan== The Sultan's Armed Forces had recently acquired squadrons of transport aircraft and AB-205 helicopters, which made more ambitious moves possible. Knocker and his superiors, Colonel Mike Harvey, commanding the Dhofar Area, and Brigadier John Graham, the overall commander of the Sultan's Armed Forces, were all looking at the area close to the border with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The PFLOAG's supply line ran from Hawf, just inside the PDRY, along vehicle and camel tracks known variously as the \\"Chinese Road\\", the \\"Freedom Road\\" and the \\"Ho Chi Minh trail\\" along the coast before turning north up a wadi to a complex of caves at Shershitti, from where camel trains took the supplies and munitions eastward. Lieutenant Colonel Knocker intended to seize the high ground at Sarfait, close to the border with the PDRY. The \\"Freedom Road\\" was in dead ground at the foot of the escarpment at the south of this ridge, so the Desert Regiment would then capture a sharp rocky peak known as \\"Capstan\\" below the escarpment. The plan depended both on being able to construct an airstrip on the ridge and on finding a water source on \\"Capstan\\", which some firqats insisted did exist. Despite the uncertainties of the plan and the calculation that it would take most of the SAF's resources to maintain the position, Brigadier Graham judged it was necessary to launch an aggressive operation before Britain's continuing withdrawal from the Middle East left Oman isolated.White (2011), pp.121-122 ==Launch== \\"L Day\\", the date on which the operation was to be launched, was set for 17 April 1972. In preparation for the operation, all the AB 205 helicopters of No. 3 Squadron of the Sultan's Air Force, flown mainly by serving RAF pilots on loan to Oman or former RAF pilots under contract, were concentrated at AkootWhite (2011), p.155 As a preliminary move, sixty men from two companies (No. 2 Company and \\"Red\\" Company) of the Desert Regiment and a firqa were flown on \\"L-1 Day\\" to a position north of Sarfait from where the regulars moved overnight to seize the intended landing ground. Ab 205 helicopters of the Sultan's Air Force landing troops 17 April opened with bad weather, with a low cloud ceiling which threatened to thwart the operation. However, it lifted enough for the operation to be launched after a delay of two hours. Rather than a massed \\"air cavalry\\" assault, pairs of AB 205 helicopters shuttled 100 troops, support weapons, defensive stores (sandbags, barbed wire etc.), ammunition and supplies from Akoot during the day.White (2011), pp.158-159 The helicopter lift continued over the next two days, during which a rough airstrip was cleared at Simba. The first Short SC.7 Skyvan transport aircraft of No. 2 Squadron of the Sultan's Air Force landed on 19 April. During the following night a violent storm struck much of western Dhofar. The camp at Akoot was partially flooded, and the newly completed position on the exposed high ground at Sarfait was devastated. One soldier was killed by lightning.White (2011), pp.163-164 ==Capstan== The view from the southern part of the Sarfait position (known as \\"Mainbrace\\") looking down the precipice leading to the sea and the track from the PDRY used by the PFLOAG As Graham and several other commanders had feared, the demands on the Sultan's Air Force to supply and reinforce Sarfait hampered other operations. Some positions recently captured in the eastern jebel had to be abandoned. The remaining troops at Akoot were also withdrawn on 7 May.White (2011), p.191 Nor had the troops on Simba been able to occupy Capstan. Only a very precipitous and rough gully ran down the Sarfait escarpment, and on the night of 4 May, two companies of the Northern Frontier Regiment of the Sultan's Armed Forces failed to negotiate it. To Graham's disappointment, there had been initially no strong reaction by the PFLOAG to the occupation of the Simba position. On 5 May however, PFLOAG units inside the PDRY opened a heavy bombardment of a fort on the frontier at Habarut, some miles north of Sarfait. The garrison, of paramilitary Dhofar Gendarmerie and a firqat unit, lost radio contact with Salalah. A half company from the Desert Regiment was flown to the area. They found that the Gendarmerie's radio had been damaged and they had withdrawn from the fort. A Special Air Service trooper attached to the firqat had been killed. In retalion, BAC Strikemaster attack aircraft of No. 1 Squadron of the Sultan's Air Force destroyed the fort on the Yemeni side of the frontier. On 22 May they also attacked PFLOAG facilities in Hawf inside the PDRY. On the night of 26 May, two infantry companies, one each from the Desert Regiment and the Northern Frontier Regiment, and a firqat unit at last succeeded in descending the wadi on the face of the Sarfait escarpment, using ropes. \\"Capstan\\" was captured without opposition, and as expected it could dominate the \\"Freedom Road\\". However, the promised water source on \\"Capstan\\" could not be found, and it also proved impossible to supply the position by helicopter as a PFLOAG machine gun position, with a heavy DShK \\"Shpagin\\" machine gun, dominated the landing zones on \\"Capstan\\". The SAF's Strikemaster attack aircraft were unable to knock out this post, and the detachment on \\"Capstan\\" was withdrawn after four days.White (2011), pp.210-216 ==Siege== Further east, the PFLOAG suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Mirbat on 19 July 1972. The PFLOAG nevertheless calculated that the position at Sarfait provided them with an opportunity for a victory. The position could be supplied only by aircraft and helicopters, and the airstrip was vulnerable to fire from the higher ground to the north. On 3 February 1973, PFLOAG opened fire on the airstrip with 75-mm and 106-mm recoilless rifles. They destroyed one aircraft and effectively closed the airstrip.Devore, p.20 To maintain Sarfait would have placed an impossible burden on the eight AB 205 helicopters of the Sultan's Air Force. It appeared that the garrison would have to be evacuated either by air or by an overland retreat through PFLOAG-dominated territory, or possibly even forced to surrender. However, Sultan Qaboos's earliest actions on ousting his father had been to seek recognition and aid from other Middle Eastern and Gulf states. While Jordan, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, all conservative monarchies or sheikhdoms which felt threatened by the PFLOAG's revolutionary agenda, were the first to offer support, the Shah of Iran's aid was most decisive. An Imperial Iranian Battle Group, initially numbering 1600, was sent to Dhofar. The Battle Group had six helicopters, of the same model as those used by the Sultan's Air Force, and starting on 15 February, they were sufficient to keep the Sarfait position supplied. During the remainder of 1973 and throughout 1974, Sarfait remained under siege, and was intermittently bombarded by mortar bombs and rockets. Elsewhere in Dhofar however, the PFLOAG lost support among the jibali tribes on the jebel and were starved of munitions. ==Final offensive== By the start of 1975, the Sultan's Armed Forces and the Imperial Iranian Task Force were preparing a final offensive to clear the rebels, who had renamed their movement the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO) from the western jebel. However, attacks in the early part of the year against the Shershitti Caves were defeated with heavy losses. The final offensive was codenamed Operation Hadaf. Brigadier John Akehurst, who by this time commanded the Dhofar Brigade, intended to launch the main attack from a recently captured airstrip at Deefa. To distract the PFLO, a diversion was to be launched from Sarfait. By this time, Sarfait was occupied by the Muscat Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Christie. For the preceding weeks, the Muscat Regiment had been openly clearing the gully which descended the escarpment of anti-personnel mines, but had covertly cleared another route which descended the back of the ridge. On 14 October 1975, the Muscat Regiment moved at night down this alternate route, and secured \\"Capstan\\" with very little opposition. In response, the PFLO launched a heavy bombardment from 85-mm guns sited inside the PDRY against both the Simba position and the newly captured line. With this unexpected success, Akehurst discarded much of his earlier plan.Jeapes (1996), p.228 Two additional infantry companies were flown into Sarfait to reinforce the attack. Major General Ken Perkins, commanding the SAF, ordered Hawker Hunter jets which the SAF had recently acquired from Jordan to attack the PFLO's artillery and rocket positions inside the PDRY.McKeown (1981), p.93 On 17 October, while these air strikes destroyed almost all the gunsJeapes (1996), p.229 and greatly reduced the number of shells and mortar bombs which hit the Sarfait position, the two reinforcements companies passed through \\"Capstan\\" and reached the sea, establishing a line of outposts which effectively cut the \\"Freedom Road\\". The PFLO resumed the bombardment of Sarfait and the new positions with even heavier 130-mm guns sited further inside the PDRY, which continued until December. Nevertheless, the new position was reinforced and supplied with defence stores lifted by helicopter from a merchant ship, \\"Al Sultana\\", operated by the Sultan of Oman's Navy.McKeown (1981), p.94 The Omani strikes into the PDRY were halted on 21 November and international diplomacy secured a ceasefire in December. On 17 October, the Iranian Task Force began another diversion against Shershitti. The main attack by the Frontier Force Regiment advancing west from Deefa threatened to surround the remaining rebels, and their leaders ordered a retreat into the PDRY. They left behind large numbers of heavy weapons and quantities of munitions.Jeapes (1996), pp.229-230 On 2 December, patrols from the Muscat Regiment and Frontier Force met on the Darra Ridge, north of Sarfait, sealing off the western jebel. The rebellion was officially declared to be over on 11 December, although isolated incidents took place until 1980. Diplomatic pressure caused the government of the PDRY to order a ceasefire. For the four years during which the Sultan's Armed Forces occupied Sarfait, it had been hit by 10,000 mortar bombs, shells and rockets. However, only six soldiers had been killed and twelve wounded by artillery, rather than in patrol operations and sweeps around the base. ==Notes== ;Footnotes ;References ==Bibliography== * \\\\ * * * \\"The United Kingdom's last hot war of the Cold War: Oman, 1963-75\\" by Marc DeVore ==External links== * An Interview with Colonel Nigel Knocker - Reflections on the Dhofar War (The Anglo-Omani Society Category:1972 in Oman Category:1973 in Oman Category:1974 in Oman Category:1975 in Oman Category:1972 in military history Category:1973 in military history Category:1974 in military history Category:1975 in military history ","title":"Operation Simba"},{"id":"54102341","text":"Herdman Brook converges with West Kill by Spruceton, New York. == References == Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Greene County, New York ","title":"Herdman Brook"},{"id":"54102348","text":"Korah or K√≥rach (), son of Esau, is an individual who is described in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. ==Life== According to the Book of Genesis , Korah was the son of Esau and Aholibamah, and had two brothers, Jeush and Jaalam. has Korah's mother, Aholibamah, being daughter of Anah, and granddaughter of Zibeon, making Zibeon Korah's maternal great grandfather. The same verse repeats Genesis 36:5 and names his two brothers again. Anah in Genesis 36:2,14,18,25 mentioned above is the same as the Anah, the son of Zibeon in verse 24. In verse 2 and 14 it says, \\"Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite.\\" Some are confused with this wording and believe that it is saying that Anah is a daughter of Zibeon. In verse 24 it clearly says that Zibeon's two sons were Ajah and Anah. Since the original text does not have a literal word for \\"granddaughter\\", the word bat (\\"daughter\\") was used in both cases.

Examples include feminist bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third-waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Feminist entrepreneurs established organizations such as the Feminist Economic Alliance to advance their cause. Feminist entrepreneurs sought three primary goals: to disseminate their ideology through their businesses, to create public spaces for women and feminists, and to create jobs for women so that they didn't have to depend on men financially. While they still exist today, the number of some feminist businesses, particularly women's bookstores, has declined precipitously since 2000. Many of these were created primarily to provide a service, rather than with the goal of making a profit. Feminist health centers, many run as collectives, started along these lines. Lesbian bars and the women's music of the 1970s provided ways to meet. == Feminist bookstores == One of the oldest feminist bookstores, Antigone Books. Feminist bookstores hold a part of the second-wave feminism movement inside their stores, with expansion of the bookstores beginning in the 1980s. In 1983 there were around 100 bookstores located in North America, which created over $400 million in sales annually. Independent bookshops have declined generally in the 21st century and there are in 2016 there were thought to be fewer than 20 feminist bookstores. The oldest surviving example, Antigone Books, is in Tucson, Arizona. The 13 book stores host feminist events to support feminism as well as carry books about the topics of queer theories, animal rights, lesbian fiction, gay studies, and also information about different cultures. Notable stores include Amazon Bookstore Cooperative and Silver Moon Bookshop. == Feminist economic alliance == During the Thanksgiving of 1975, the founding women of the Feminist Economic Alliance (FEA) met in Detroit, Michigan at a conference to discuss the problems women faced with money. Two leading women for the alliance in 1975 were Susan Osborne and Linda Maslanko, both from New York. They were the spokeswomen for FEA and educated the public on what the alliance meant and what the future of FEA looked like after splitting into eight geographic regions. The Feminist Economic Alliance was created to aid new sister credit unions as well as allowing any women to become economically powerful, independent, or grow as an individual. This independence for women was going to be achieved by encouraging, assisting, and promoting the women of feminist credit unions and feminist enterprises. The main idea behind this new alliance was that older sister credit unions could help the new developing credit unions by sharing research, resources, and guidance in the process. == Feminist credit unions == In the 1970s during the second wave feminist movement, women had the urge to fight unequal credit so they created their own non-profit, financial institutions so that men were no longer in control of their money. The co-manager of the union, Susan Osborne, was creating an environment for women to save money as well as help other women in need. By creating their own credit unions, women were able to avoid being discriminated based on their gender even though the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 banned credit unions from discriminating potential customers. The women being excluded from receiving loans despite the law in place, were divorced women, low-income women, women needing legal money or women on welfare. Establishing feminist credit unions meant that they would now be able to receive loans hassle free, save their money, and gain money management counseling. When receiving credit, women are viewed by their individual character rather than if they were married or single. A woman no longer has to be the co-signer, she can now be in control of her money. The unions run no differently than any other union, in fact, the feminist credit unions are governed by the same laws as the normal credit unions.  Detroit, Michigan branch  In 1982, the Detroit, Michigan branch, the last feminist credit union, was dissolved due to financial problems and also the reconstruction of the unions language change. The language was suggested to be changed to include both genders, not just female. The Michigan Credit Union League saw the feminist credit unions as bias towards men and suggestions of equal consideration for males in a female position were to be given resulting in it being dissolved. == Feminist mail- order magazines ==  History  The feminist mail-order magazine came from Great Britain around the 1970s and lasted until the 1990s. The collectives were notable for allowing women to take equal parts in the creation of the magazine in all areas including: copy typing, design, layout or interviewing. By allowing women the equal chance at learning, women were developing their creativity and gaining new skills. Women were allowed to fight back at the patriarchal system by voicing their opinions and allowing women who were excluded also have a platform. Excluded women during that time were black, lesbian, working class, or single mothers. Popular magazines at the time were Spare Rib, Scarlet Woman, Catcall, and Outwrite. The magazines were not afraid to comment about inequalities the women were facing or issues that needed to be addressed. Feminist activities were also talked about in the magazines creating networks, reformation, expressing opinions or attitudes relating to a certain topic. Mail-order magazines were a way for women to become educated on feminism and how to join the movement.  Magazines   Spare Rib  Spare Rib was a second-wave British feminist magazine that emerged from the counter culture of the late 1960s as a consequence of meetings involving, among others, Rosie Boycott and Marsha Rowe. Spare Rib is now recognised as an iconic magazine, which shaped debate about feminism in the United Kingdom, and as such it was digitised by the British Library in 2015. Spare Rib contained new writing and creative contributions which challenged stereotypes and supported collective solutions. The magazine was published between 1972 and 1993. The title derives from the Biblical reference to Eve, the first woman, created from Adam's rib.  Scarlet Woman  In April 1975, the first issue of Scarlet Woman was published by Sydney SW Collective.http://www.vwllfa.org.au/bios-pdf/arch91-SW.pdf It was created to be a socialist feminist magazine and included articles dealing with money, lesbians, health and more.  Ms.  Ms. magazine cover, Spring 1972 Ms. is an American liberal feminist magazine co-founded by second-wave feminists and sociopolitical activists Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes. Its founding editors were Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Mary Thom, Patricia Carbine, Joanne Edgar, Nina Finkelstein, and Mary Peacock. Ms. first appeared in 1971 as an insert in New York magazine. From July 1972 until 1987, it appeared as a stand-alone monthly publication; it now publishes quarterly. Ms. was the first women's magazine to address domestic violence, speak about politics, or discuss topics men thought were unnatural for women, motivating the feminist movement. During its heyday in the 1970s, it enjoyed great popularity but was not always able to reconcile its ideological concerns with commercial considerations. Since 2001, the magazine has been published by Liberty Media for Women, LLC, owned by Feminist Majority Foundation, that is based in Arlington, Virginia and Los Angeles, California. == Feminist restaurants == The earliest form of feminist restaurants took shape in suffrage restaurants, tea rooms, or lunch rooms. Food was sold at a low cost of five or ten cents and men were permitted to eat, in hopes of women persuading men to support a certain political cause. These restaurants suffered from conflicts dealing with the founders and donators. Alva Belmont, a wealthy socialite, was the founder of a suffrage restaurant that was known for strict rules and a fast pace. The ideas and motives behind these suffrage restaurants in the 1910s were the foundations for the feminist restaurants in the 1970s. In April 1972, the first feminist restaurant, Mother Courage, was founded by Dolores Alexander in New York. Bloodroot, a vegan/vegetarian feminist restaurant and bookstore located in Bridgeport, Connecticut, has been in business since 1977. Feminist restaurants are used more as a place to gather and socialize rather than eating. The restaurants were used to share ideas, literature, educate one another and to promote the feminist movement. Guest speakers, political speakers, poets, or musicians would come to the restaurants to promote issues or spread awareness. Coffee houses and cafes are also popular among the feminist movement. Restaurants offered same pay to every staff member, which was entirely women. The style was simple and supported the movements that were occurring during that time. They support other occupations by avoiding certain products such as lettuce and grapes for the farmers or boycotting orange juice for the anti-gay campaign. Feminist restaurants were also notable for treating women or lesbians with respect in a non-hostile environment. A women who is dining with a man will be given a wine sample as well as the check at the end of the meal. That was typical not the case in restaurants that were not catered to feminism. == Feminist businesses today == In today's society, feminist businesses look different besides the few bookstores left in the world. There are over hundreds of companies created by women, that have a purpose besides making money such as changing our society, impacting employers and the consumers they reach. One famous company started by a woman that has been successful is Tory Burch. She created the store from nothing and has been able to create a multibillion-dollar business as well as a foundation called the Tory Burch Foundation in 2009, to help empower women and female entrepreneurs. Today feminist business are about empowering women in the shape of products sold, campaigns run, and businesses created. ==See also== *Sh!

Pumpkins is a fictional character played by American actor Tom Hanks. He first appeared in the October 22, 2016 episode of Saturday Night Live (SNL) in a sketch by SNL writers Mikey Day, Bobby Moynihan, and Streeter Seidell. Fans responded positively to the character and his catchphrase, \\"Any questions?\\" Pumpkins has appeared in two episodes of SNL as well as an animated Halloween special that aired on October 28, 2017. ==Concept and creation== The character was created by Bobby Moynihan, Mikey Day, and Streeter Seidell. Moynihan said they wanted to make a Halloween-themed version of the viral video \\"Little Superstar\\" with a character who was a \\"Santa Claus for Halloween\\". The writers said the character's middle initial \\"S\\" stands for Simon. The initial idea for the sketch did not include the Pumpkins character, and involved a \\"creepy hotel\\" which resembled Disney's Haunted Mansion; this was later changed into a Tower of Terror-style ride. Day credits Pumpkins' eventual creation with his love of \\"stupid suits\\". The first version of Pumpkins has more dialogue, which Hanks cut back while \\"playing with the character\\". At one point there were plans to include Lady Gaga, the night's musical guest, in the sketch as \\"Mrs. David Pumpkins\\", but as \\"her musical set was pretty involved\\", she passed on it. Hanks thought the character was \\"very bizarre\\" before the sketch aired and initially suggested Chris Hemsworth would be better suited for the role. ==Appearances== Saturday Night Live Pumpkins first appeared in the fourth episode of SNL 42nd season, in the sketch \\"Haunted Elevator (ft. David S. Pumpkins)\\". A couple (played by Beck Bennett and Kate McKinnon) enters the \\"100 Floors of Frights\\" attraction, in which Kenan Thompson plays a \\"Hellevator\\" operator and opens the doors to reveal various characters that scare the couple with typically horrific scenes until they stop on the 49th floor. The doors open revealing break dancing skeletons and Pumpkins wearing a black and orange pumpkin-themed suit, that the writers bought for $12.99 at Party City. In not answering the couple's questions, Pumpkins says that he is \\"his own thing\\", and that the skeletons (Moynihan and Day) that stand next to him on many floors (73 out of 100) of the elevator are \\"part of it\\". He insists that he is there to \\"scare the hell out of you\\" but manages only to confuse the passengers. The elevator visits several other floors, at some of which Pumpkins continues to appear, until it stops at the final level. The door opens on just the skeletons, until Pumpkins appears right behind the guests and shout-asks \\"Any questions?\\", succeeding in scaring them. Dave Chappelle, while hosting SNL in season 42's sixth episode, references David S. Pumpkins in the sketch \\"Jheri's Place\\". After \\"a sketch gone wrong\\", Chappelle jokingly says that he thought his failed character \\"was going to be the next David S. Pumpkins\\". In the 21st episode, hosted by Dwayne Johnson and the finale of the same season, Pumpkins appears in the prerecorded music video \\"Rap Song\\", using the name David S. Pimpkins and wearing a furry hat and jacket. Among other fictional featured artists, \\"Pimpkins\\" pesters Thompson's character, in a pastiche of \\"overstuffed all-star rap videos\\" like \\"I'm the One\\" by DJ Khaled. The Halloween Special On September 28, 2017, NBC announced that Pumpkins would star in a 30-minute animated special created by Bento Box Animation. Hanks, Day and Moynihan reprised their roles, with Seidell and Peter Dinklage joining the cast. Two weeks prior, Hanks posted a picture of the special's script, titled \\"The David S. Pumpkins Song,\\" on Twitter and Instagram. The David S. Pumpkins Halloween Special, which aired October 28, 2017, starts with a live-action address from Hanks dressed as Pumpkins. In the story, Kevin (Dinklage) is embarrassed to take his younger sister trick-or-treating. After choosing the \\"magic pumpkin\\" at a pumpkin patch, David S. Pumpkins and the skeletons take them on an adventure and sing- along. The boy and girl ride in Pumpkins' \\"pumpkinmobile\\" (a strawberry car) while the mysterious Raincoat Man steals all the Halloween candy. Pumpkins and the skeletons rescue the candy from what turns out to be pre-teens who had bullied Kevin. Pumpkins uses magic to deliver the candy around the neighborhood inside of pumpkins. ==Reception== When the character was first performed, his appeal was unclear, though he immediately developed a fan following. Aired just weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it has been suggested that the non-political nature of the sketch helped fuel its popularity. Day suggested this came from a \\"weird alchemy of Halloween, the best host ever, the time of the country, and just a silly song\\". Seidell said, \\"The election was so intense. David Pumpkins, this dumb silly thing, was the last thing that everyone could kind of agree on, that they could talk to each other about without it ruining Thanksgiving.\\" The character's apparent meaninglessness was referenced in the original skit. Tom Hanks jokingly tweeted that he dressed as Pumpkins for Halloween in 2016. To promote his Reddit Ask Me Anything, Microsoft founder Bill Gates parodied the original sketch, and received some criticism for the effort. Hanks's performance as an SNL host, including the Pumpkins sketch, garnered him a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 2017. In October 2017, Madame Tussauds Orlando adapted their existing wax figure of Tom Hanks to appear as David Pumpkins. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Watch Haunted Elevator (ft. David S.

It was founded by Konstantinos Sarandopoulos (d. 1972) with the international writer and publisher Gregorios Xenopoulos and is the longest-running literary magazine in Greece. Its director since 2012 is the writer and university professor Nikos Karapidakis and the publishing company is Nea Estia Booksellers, I.D. Kollarios & Co., which has been administered by its owner, the writer Eva Karaitidi, since 1998. ==Before Nea Estia== In the nineteenth- century, between 1876 and 1895 Estia (now a newspaper) was published, initially as a family periodical, later becoming a literary one. The directorship initially was held by the editor Pavlos Diomedes; after 1889 jointly with Nikolaos Politis, the folklorist and university professor and Georgios Drossinis, the poet, prose-writer and publisher. From 1894 until 1895 when it closed, it was taken over by the writer and publisher Gregorios Xenopoulos (as Iconographeia Estia), while at the same time George Drosinis started the newspaper Estia. Thirty years later, Xenopoulos wanted to revive the old periodical, but the newspaper Estia, which had come into the possession of Achilles Kyrou, legally precluded the use of the same name. Left in this position, the periodical took the name Nea Estia (\\"New Estia\\") and began circulation on 15 April 1927. ==Directors of the magazine== The first director was Gregorios Xenopoulos, novelist and publisher, from 1927 until 1932. For two years Gregrios Xenopoulos held the directorship together with Petros Charis, the prose-writer, essayist and academic (1933‚Äì34), who took over alone after 1934 until 1987 (a long-running service of fifty-four years). In 1987 the writer and critic Evangelos N. Moschos took over until 1998, the writer Stavros Zoumboulakis until 2012, and after that the historian Nikos E. Karapidakis. ==Publishers== The founding publisher of the magazine Nea Estia was Konstantinos Sarandoupoulos, who from 1925 had become a partner with his father-in-law Ioannis D. Kollaros. Ioannis D. Kollaros was presented as the publisher beginning in 1927, later this became \\"Estia Booksellers, I.D. Kollarios & Co.\\". Later editions had Sarandopoulos together with I.D. Kollarou until 1956, when Kollaros died and continued with Sarandopoulos listed alone until 1972, when he died. The company was taken over after 1972 by his daughter, Marina \\"Mania\\" Koraitidi, which continued until 1998. From 1998 on the publication of the magazine has been run by her daughter, Eva Karaitidi, the writer. ==Critical reception== The viewpoints of Nea Estia are such that the magazine, whose publisher began \\"one of the most distinguished publications of the inter-war era\\", is an authoritative magazine in the world of letters and one which has constituted a \\"spiritual beacon\\" for many decades. reprinted in Importance is attached to the fact that it never stopped circulating during World War II (a \\"publishing feat\\"). One characteristic of Nea Estia is that it maintains a neutral ideological stance, free of meaningful rivalries with other periodicals, with balanced choices of themes, styles and arrangement, while not taking an explicit or activist position on any social or political topic. ==Content== The purposes of the director of the magazine, Grigorios Xenopoulos, were made clear in a meditative four-page pamphlet which was distributed in February 1927, two months before the first edition of Nea Estia, outlining six principles: The magazine and its content consist either literary works or studies of literature in Greece and around the world. At the close of the 20th century it gave a comprehensive view of Greek literary trends and criticism, but also more general coverage of visual and fine arts themes, exhibiting a multi- dimensional character, but always with a significant weighting toward literature. ==NotesReferencesExternal links== *Nea Estia, volumes 1‚Äì1773, ŒïŒöŒïŒíŒô (ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø ŒíŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒøœÖ [National Book Centre], in Greek) Nea Estia ","title":"Nea Estia"},{"id":"54102480","text":"JBS Foods International engages in the food business internationally.

The Atherstone Ball Game is a \\"Medieval football\\" game played annually on Shrove Tuesday in the English town of Atherstone, Warwickshire. The game honors a match played between Leicestershire and Warwickshire in 1199, when teams used a bag of gold as a ball, and which was won by Warwickshire. At one time similar events were held in many towns throughout England, but Atherstone's is now one of at least three such games that are still played each year at Shrovetide, the others being the Royal Shrovetide Football match held in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and The Alnwick Shrovetide Football Match in Alnwick, Northumberland. ==Overview== Atherstone Conservative Club in Long Street (known as the Connie) is the venue from which the ball is thrown to commence the game The game is an annual event played in Atherstone each Shrove Tuesday. Shops in the town are boarded up in preparation for its staging, while local children are allowed to leave school early on that day. The two- hour game is played in the town's main street, Long Street, and sees groups of players compete for possession of a giant ball that is specially made for the occasion. The match is usually started at 3.00pm on Shrove Tuesday by a celebrity guest, usually someone associated with the area, who is invited to throw the ball from the upstairs balcony of the Atherstone Conservative Club (known locally as the Connie). The Atherstone branch of Barclays Bank was used until its closure in 2019; the Conservative Club was then selected as a replacement venue to start the game, beginning in 2020. The game itself has few rules, two being that play is restricted to Long Street and participants are not allowed to kill anyone. The winner is declared at 5.00pm, the title going to the person who has possession of the ball when the whistle sounds. Ahead of the game itself, sweets and pennies are thrown to local children. The ball is decorated with ribbons before the game, and prizes are also awarded to anyone who gets hold of one, as well as to the person who gets the golden penny, thrown into the crowd shortly before the game commences. Gameplay can become quite intense as players compete to keep hold of the ball, with clothes torn off and occasional violence. The New Zealand Herald has described it as \\"combining all the best aspects of the UFC, volleyball and Gloucester's famous cheese wheel chase\\". The event is policed by officers from Warwickshire Police, while members of West Midlands Ambulance Service are on standby to treat any injuries. Famous people who have started the game include those from the worlds of sport, acting and television. Among those to throw the ball out to the crowd are rugby player Wally Holmes in 1953, actor Sid James in 1963, comedian Jimmy Tarbuck in 1968, comedian Larry Grayson in 1976, former Aston Villa manager Brian Little in 1985 and 2019, footballer Gordon Banks in 1995, television newsreader Llewella Bailey in 2000, and actress Annette Badland in 2017. Singer George Formby was also pictured at the game in 1937. The 2020 game had two personalities to launch proceedings, former Coventry City footballers Dave Bennett and Kirk Stephens. ==History== A sculpture of the Atherstone Ball Game created by Michael Disley. The original medieval football game honoured by the annual event was held in Atherstone in 1199, during which teams from Warwickshire and Leicestershire competed, using a bag of gold as a football. This original \\"Match of Gold\\", as it became known, was won by Warwickshire. The Ball Game was once one of many such games held in towns throughout England, but is presently one of three that continue to be held over Shrovetide, the other two being the Royal Shrovetide Football match in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and The Alnwick Shrovetide Football Match in Alnwick, Northumberland. Medieval football matches were more common before the 20th century, but their violent nature led the government of the time to pass the Highway Act 1835 to prevent it being played in the streets, although games continued to take place in Atherstone. In 1901, an attempt by police and local authorities to also have the Atherstone game banned was rejected by parish councillors. Before the 1970s the game was played throughout the town, but was restricted to Long Street because the ball frequently ended up in the Coventry Canal. In 1986, a public meeting was held to determine the game's future after that year's event got out of hand. The outcome of this meeting was the formation of a Ball Game committee, which now has responsibility for organising the event. After violence broke out at the 2019 game, committee chairman Rob Bernard suggested those responsible threaten the game's future: \\"In the past, when things have got out of hand, we've put it out there that the future of the Ball Game is under threat and it calms down a bit the following year...But then it comes back again. It is the nature of it.\\" Following that year's game, a clip of participants fighting received 3.4 million views on Facebook, and a report in the Daily Mirror newspaper claimed that a man's ear had been ripped off during the fracas. However, no such casualties were reported either by police or ambulance officials. The 2020 game, held on 25 February of that year, was abandoned around half way through the match when a steward was taken ill, having collapsed from a heart attack at the town's Conservative Club. He was treated at the scene by paramedics from West Midlands Ambulance Service before being airlifted to hospital, where he underwent medical procedures. A JustGiving page was subsequently established to provide financial help for his family. For several years the ball was made by the sportswear manufacturer Webb Ellis. Prior to this Alan Johnson the local Saddler from Market Street was the maker from the 1950s. Following the 2017 game Webb Ellis cancelled their contract to make the ball. As a consequence, Atherstone upholsterer, Pete Smith, was commissioned to produce the ball for the 2018 game. This marked the first occasion the ball had been made in the town since 1982. Smith based his design on an original cardboard template made by local craftsman Brian Brown. Coverage of the game was first heard on BBC radio in 1934, and footage of it was first shown on television in 1958. ==NotesReferences== Category:Football in Warwickshire Category:Traditional football Category:Warwickshire folklore Category:English traditions Category:Atherstone Category:1199 establishments in England ","title":"Atherstone Ball Game"},{"id":"54102576","text":"Trillia Newbell is the Director of Community Outreach for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. ==Publications and career== She is the author of United: Captured by God‚Äôs Vision for Diversity (2014), Fear and Faith: Finding the Peace Your Heart Craves (2015), Enjoy: Finding the Freedom to Delight Daily in God‚Äôs Good Gifts (2016) and God's Very Good Idea: The True Story About God's Delightfully Different Family (2017).

The movement began in earnest in early 1956, when the All-China Women's Federation in tandem with local branches of the Women's Federation began promoting \\"Five Goods\\" for urban housewives to aspire to.People's Daily, February 10th, 1956, pg. 4. \\"All China Women's Federation and Thirteen Work Unit's Joint Notice Regarding The Commemoration of March 8th Women's Holiday\\" ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂ¶áËÅîÁ≠âÂçÅ‰∏â‰∏™Âçï‰Ωç ÂÖ≥‰∫éÁ∫™Âøµ\\"‰∏âÂÖ´\\"Â¶áÂ•≥ËäÇÁöÑËÅîÂêàÈÄöÁü•. These \\"five goods\\" intended to promote socialist development primarily through the education of children and support of male workers. The five tenets of the campaign were to encourage housewives to: promote mutual assistance between neighborhood households, arrange domestic life well, educate children well, encourage and support the production, work, and study of (male) spouses, and to study well themselves. In this case \\"study\\" referred to the political study of government issued works intended to promote socialist and communist thought. This model of the ideal housewife reflected PRC visions of how a seemingly \\"non-productive\\" member of socialist society could contribute to the building of a socialist state. The \\"Five Goods Movement\\" primarily encouraged the practice of thrift and frugality within families and the promotion of mothers as socialist educators of children.People's Daily, August 9th, 1957, pg. 3.\\"Thrift-The Fountain of a Family's Happiness-Li Chunpei Discusses her Experience\\" Âã§‰ø≠‚Äî‚ÄîÂÆ∂Â∫≠Âπ∏Á¶èÁöÑÊ≥âÊ∫ê‚Äî‚ÄîÊùéÊò•ÂüπË∞àÂã§‰ø≠ÊåÅÂÆ∂ÁöÑÁªèÈ™å Numerous articles from the People's Daily during this period reflect these aims of the \\"Five Goods Movement,\\" praising housewives who frugally managed their families food supplies and provided an orderly domestic space which enabled children and husbands to earnestly study socialist political texts. Although the Five Goods Movement initially focused on urban \\"family dependents\\" (ÂÆ∂Â±ûjiashu), the campaign eventually spread to rural areas, and added the promotion of sanitary practices as one of the \\"five goods\\" for rural housewives to practice in their everyday lives.People's Daily, July 15th, 1957, pg. 6 \\"Speech at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress to Widen the Role of Women in Building Socialism: Zhang Yun's Speech\\" Âú®Á¨¨‰∏ÄÂ±äÂÖ®ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ë‰ª£Ë°®Â§ß‰ºöÁ¨¨ÂõõÊ¨°‰ºöËÆÆ‰∏äÁöÑÂèëË®Ä Êõ¥Â§ßÂú∞ÂèëÊå•ÂπøÂ§ßÂ¶áÂ•≥Âú®Âª∫ËÆæÁ§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâ‰∏≠ÁöÑ‰ΩúÁî® Á´†Ëï¥ÁöÑÂèëË®Ä.

The \\"Five Goods\\" campaign began in early 1956 and was continually mentioned in the People's Daily (the National Newspaper of the People's Republic of China) through 1960, although the height of the campaign occurred from 1956-1958. == References == Category:1950s in China Category:1956 in China Category:1957 in China Category:1958 in China Category:Campaigns of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Five Goods Movement"},{"id":"54102617","text":"National Police Bureau is an institution under Ministry of Interior, Pakistan.

The Brazilian Federal Police charged him with alleged bribes made by his company, JBS S.A., to former president of the Brazilian parliament Eduardo Cunha, intended to help JBS free up resources from the (FI-FGTS).  2017: Bribery and insider trading allegations  On May 17, 2017, the Batista brothers admitted to the Brazilian Federal Police that they had bribed several Brazilian officers and politicians over the previous 12 years. As a result of these bribes, he and his company JBS allegedly obtained funding from the BNDES of over R$10 billion at below market rates, and then used the funds to bribe politicians. In return for their cooperation, the Brazilian Federal Police set Batista, his brother and other directors of JBS S.A. free of charges, with a fine of R$225 million. Prior to the release of the recordings, Batista and his brother Joesley Batista sold several shares of JBS S.A. and bought over USD 1 billion.

It was the first artist signature model having been named after Ken Roberts, a friend of (Ro-Pat-In President) George Beauchamp. In addition, the instrument was the first electric guitar to provide a stock appointed tremolo arm; designed & patented by Doc Kauffman. The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts holds the current world record for the highest price paid for a guitar, after selling in 2017 for $7.5 million. ==History== Produced between 1931-1938, the instrument line was officially released in 1935 and was terminated in 1938. It is estimated that less than 50 total quantity were produced & sold between 1935-1938. Less than 10 are known to survive today. It was the first electric guitar to offer players an extended neck that joined the body at the 17th fret, enabling extended playability on the 22 fret neck; a design element that persists in the current day electric guitar. Another key element found on the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts, was the stock equipped hand-operated ‚ÄúVib-rola‚Äù vibrato device produced by patent holder Clayton Doc Kauffman. ==Historical Significance== The Rickenbacker Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was revolutionary for its time. Its design elements set precedence for future electric guitars development in particular Fender and Les Paul who would later utilize the Doc Kauffman vibrola on his early \\"log\\" prototypes and personal signature models. The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to play standing up vertical with a strap, as practiced in modern electric guitar performance. Concurrently with Rickenbacker's Spanish guitars, Hawaiian \\"lap-steel\\" instruments were also produced. ==Historian Perspectives== Dan Orkin, Director of Content with Reverb.com stated in 2017: \\"What makes this guitar special is that it is what most people consider the first modern electric guitar. There's a lot of debate about which was truly the first one of course. This was the popular guitar music of the time. Electric guitars like this, the Spanish style, really took off with jazz and a lot of the big band music of the time. You had the Vib-Rola system, designed by Doc Kauffman, who went on to collaborate with Leo Fender, and a body produced by Harmony, which was another big instrument manufacturer of the time. So this guitar was a really unique piece of guitar history. Only around 50 of these guitars were produced, and six or seven are known to exist today.\\" In 2014, a popular vintage instrument boutique in New York City's Brooklyn neighborhood, RetroFret Vintage Rare & Unusual Fretted Instruments, composed a historical evaluation on a surviving Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts guitar. RetroFret stated: \\"Rickenbacker were the undisputed pioneers in the commercialization of the electric guitar, and the early Ken Roberts electric Spanish model is one of the most important, if relatively unknown, of their early creations. Although mostly forgotten by history, the Ken Roberts represents a fascinating and important step in the evolution of the modern electric guitar.\\" Historian and author Rich Maloof stated in his 2017 article titled \\"Who Really Invented the Electric Guitar\\"featured on Reverb.com: \\"With less than 50 built, the Ken Roberts guitar was, in many ways, the first modern electric Spanish‚Äìstyle guitar ever produced.\\" ==References== Category:Electric guitars Category:Rickenbacker guitars ","title":"Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts"},{"id":"54102696","text":"Mochdre () is a small village and larger community in Montgomeryshire, Powys, Wales.

Two distinct forms of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer have been identified in humans and other animals ‚Äì specific PIT and general PIT ‚Äì with unique neural substrates mediating each type. In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior). General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus. An example of specific PIT, as described by a neuroscience review from 2013 on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, is as follows: \\"in a typical experimental scenario a rat is trained to associate a sound (CS) with the delivery of food. Later, the rat undergoes an instrumental training where it learns to press a lever to get some food (without the sound being present). Finally, the rat is presented again with the opportunity to press the lever, this time both in the presence and absence of the sound. The results show that the rat will press the lever more in the presence of the sound than without, even if the sound has not been previously paired with lever pressing. The Pavlovian sound-food association learned in the first phase has somehow transferred to the instrumental situation, hence the name 'Pavlovian- instrumental transfer.'\\" ==Specific and general transfer== In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior). General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus. Neurobiological state factors (e.g., appetite and satiety states, stress level, drug states such as intoxication and withdrawal, etc.), and particularly the motivational state of an animal, strongly affect the amount of appetitive motivational salience (i.e., incentive salience) that a reward cue confers to an associated rewarding stimulus via Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Acute stress amplifies the motivational salience that reward cues confer to rewarding stimuli through both specific and general PIT; however, chronic stress reduces the motivational impact reward cues. Specific PIT and general PIT also occur with aversive stimuli and are defined analogously. Specific PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with an aversive stimulus and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed away from the aversive stimulus with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes escape and avoidance behavior). General PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with one aversive stimulus and it enhances an operant response that is directed away from a different aversive stimulus. ==Neural substrates== Based upon studies on rats that involved PIT with rewards, specific PIT is mediated by the nucleus accumbens shell and basolateral amygdala, while general PIT is mediated by the nucleus accumbens core and central amygdala. Studies on humans which employed neuroimaging during PIT experiments with rewards appear to be consistent with these findings. ==Clinical significance== Addiction Due to the effect of reward cues and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer on the amplification of incentive salience for rewarding stimuli, PIT is believed to be one of the mechanisms responsible for producing \\"cue-triggered wanting\\", or craving, for a drug that occurs when an individual with a drug addiction is exposed to drug cues even after long periods of abstinence. For example, anti- drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia ‚Äì which is a type of drug cue ‚Äì as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effect of incentive salience in causing cravings and relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters. Dieting The sight or smell of food which one has consumed and enjoyed in the past can elicit hunger (i.e., the motivation to eat) in humans, an effect which is presumably mediated through PIT. In PIT experiments with rats, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus which has been paired with food has been shown to increase instrumental actions that have been reinforced by food, such as pressing a lever which leads to the delivery of a food pellet. ==See alsoNotesReferences== Category:Addiction Category:Behavioral concepts Category:Behavioral neuroscience Category:Behaviorism Category:Cognition Category:Cognitive psychology Category:Experimental psychology Category:Motivation ","title":"Pavlovian-instrumental transfer"},{"id":"54102870","text":"Synaphea divaricata is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.

Hart also produces the film alongside Will Packer, as well as co-wrote the script. The story follows a group of adults who set out to earn their GEDs. The film was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on September 28, 2018, grossed over $103 million worldwide and received mixed to negative reviews from critics. ==Plot== In 2001, high school student Teddy Walker drops out of school when he finds himself unable to concentrate during a crucial test. Years later, in 2018, he works as a barbecue grill salesman while dating a wealthy woman named Lisa, having developed a careful financial strategy that allows him to maintain the illusion that he is better off than he actually is. However, his life falls apart just as he learns that he is going to inherit control of the store when the current manager retires. As he proposes to Lisa in the shop, Teddy accidentally triggers an explosion when a champagne cork pops open a gas tank, with the manager taking the insurance from the explosion and promptly moving away to Florida. Now jobless, Teddy learns from his best friend Marvin that he could theoretically get a job at Marvin's financial investment firm, but it requires him to have a GED. Teddy goes to his old high school in the belief that he can just charm the new principal into giving him the relevant qualification, but this plan is ruined from the start with the discovery that the principal is Stewart, whom Teddy bullied when he was at school. Fortunately, Teddy is able to make arrangements to attend night school that semester taught by the unorthodox Carrie, but finds himself still frustrated by his old concentration issues. At the same time, he claims to Lisa that he has already got the job working for Marvin, while secretly working at a local fast food restaurant to give himself some financial support. As the rest of the class struggle to cope, Teddy convinces them to join him in stealing the test answers. When Carrie realizes what happened, Teddy is expelled from night school after he takes the blame. When he returns to make a genuine appeal to Carrie that he wants to do better, she agrees to take Teddy back to night school if he gets tested for learning disabilities, allowing them to determine that he suffers from dyslexia, dyscalculia, and various processing issues. Carrie is able to devise new systems to help Teddy cope and he soon settles into the night school while genuinely befriending his classmates. With their last class on the night of the senior prom, Teddy suggests that the night school students attend the prom themselves. In the process, Carrie opens to Teddy that she is a lesbian but he is confronted by Lisa who Stewart brought to the school that night under the pretense of wanting corporate sponsorship to improve the school. Hurt at the revelation that Teddy was lying to her, Lisa breaks up with him, prompting a devastated Teddy to give up on night school and the GED. However, he is subsequently visited by Carrie and Stewart with the latter apologizing to Teddy as he realizes that he crossed too many lines in his desire for revenge. Carrie convinces Teddy to return for the GED. Although Teddy does not pass the test with his classmates, he continues to persevere and completes the test after another four attempts. At graduation that semester, Teddy makes a speech on behalf of the other night school students about how they all prove that second chances are possible, which is witnessed by Lisa. After the ceremony, Teddy apologizes to Lisa for lying to her and re-introduces himself. He asks her out and she accepts but he tells her she will have to pay for everything since he has no money.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars. Varietys Owen Gleiberman said the film \\"wants to be a nasty sitcom but spends too much time playing it safe\\" and wrote, \\"Night School has a handful of laughs, but it's a bloated trifle that, at 111 minutes, overstays its welcome.\\" Writing for IndieWire, David Elrich gave the film a \\"D\\" grade, saying \\"Kevin Hart can be funnier than he is in this joyless and interminable comedy, but he no longer seems interested in trying.\\" == Home media == Night School was released digitally on December 11, 2018, and was on 4K UHD Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray and DVD on January 1, 2019. ==Television series== On January 10, 2020, it was reported that NBC is developing a comedy TV series based on the box office hit for the network.

The civilians were religious volunteers, or kar sevaks, assembled near the Ram Janmabhoomi site at Ayodhya. The state government's official records report that 16 people were killed. ==Background== In September 1990 the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bhartiya Janata Party campaigned for the Ram Temple to be rebuilt at the Ram Janmabhoomi site. The situation became volatile, with L. K. Advani conducting rath yatra and the VHP mobilizing people to the site. The state government, under Mulayam Singh Yadav, promised protection and a complete lockdown of the site and city. Yadav reassured the public: \\"No bird would be able to fly into Ayodhya\\". ==Timeline== 21 October 1990 Volunteers, or kar sevaks first assembled in Ayodhya, at the behest of L. K. Advani of the BJP and Ashok Singhal of the VHP, on 21October 1990. 30 October 1990 Called \\"the D-Day of Karseva\\" 30October saw the start of unprecedented security arrangements. Police barred all bus and train services to Ayodhya. Most kar sevaks reached Ayodhya by foot; some swam across the Sarayu river. The police also barricaded the 1.5 km-long climb to the disputed structure and imposed a curfew. According to the investigatory Liberhan Commission report, issued after the event: * 28,000 Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary personnel were deployed in Ayodhya * Out of 40,000 kar sevaks, only 10,000 managed to reach Ayodhya At around 10am, a large group of kar sevaks headed towards the site, led by Vamadev, Mahant Nratyagopal Das, and Ashok Singhal of the VHP. Ashok Singhal was wounded on the head by a police baton. This altercation led to a mob frenzy and open confrontation between civilians and policemen. At around 11am, a Hindu holyman or sadhu managed to gain control of an Armed Constabulary bus in which the police were holding detainees. The sadhu drove the bus right through the barricades, clearing a way for the others to follow on foot. The security forces were caught off guard and were forced to chase about 5,000 kar sevaks, who stormed through the heavily guarded site. According to eyewitnesses the Kothari brothers mounted a saffron flag atop the Babri Masjid. On the orders of Mulayam Government security personnel fired on the crowd and chased kar sevaks across the area. Many people died from head wounds. There was a stampede at the Saryu Bridge, which killed a number of people. 1 November 1990 Hindu groups took a day of rest on 1November. 2 November 1990 Assembled kar sevaks offered prayers at Ramlila on the morning of 2November and then proceeded to Babri Masjid. Members of the crowd used the strategy of touching security personnel's feet, which made them withdraw a step. This worked for a while, and the procession continued. However, the police took firm action by using tear gas and baton charges to disperse the crowd. Nevertheless, some contingents of kar sevaks reached and partially damaged the mosque. In response the police opened fire for the second time in 72 hours, and chased kar sevaks through the alleys around Hanumangarhi. In one place, later named Shaheed Gali or Martyr‚Äôs Alley, police killed many kar sevaksthis included the Kothari Brothers, who were allegedly dragged out of a house. Some Indians have accused the police of disposing of many dead bodies, either by cremating them at unknown places or by dumping them into the Saryu River in sacks. ==Deaths== Among the dead were: * The Kothari Brothers (Kolkata) * Setharam Mali (Jodhpur) * Ramesh Kumar (Ganganagar) * Mahavir Prasad (Faizabad) * Ramesh Pandey (Ayodhya) * Sanjay Kumar (Muzaffarpur) * Professor Mahendranath Arora (Jodhpur) * An unnamed sadhu * Rajendra Dharkar * Babulal Tiwari (from the village of Nemavar) ==Wounded survivors== Wounded survivors of the attack included: * Sangram Keshari Mohapatra (odisha) * Sunil Kumar * Rajnarain Singh (Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh) * Vishwajeet (Patel Nagar, Delhi) * Rambahadur (Badayun, Uttar Pradesh) * Abhay Kumar (Asansol) ==Aftermath== News of the shootings was mostly suppressed from the Indian media, but some local and international media outlets mentioned them. The firing incident had a major impact on Uttar Pradesh and on Indian national politics. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was given the sobriquet ‚ÄòMulla‚Äô Mulayam Singh for his pro-muslim stance during the incident. He lost the 1991 election to the Bhartiya Janata Party. he described his decision to fire on the crowd in Ayodhya as \\"painful yet necessary as it was ordered by the high court to maintain peace, law and order till the judgement come out .\\" People of the Hindu community arranged a memorial meeting for the dead Karsevaks on April4, 1991 at the Boat Club, New Delhi, which attracted a large audience. They also launched a nationwide awareness program displaying the Asthi Kalash (funeral urns) of those who died in the firing incident. In the following years, these organizations and their prominent leaders received both political and moral endorsement. On6 December 1992, a large group of kar sevaks completely demolished Babri Masjid. ==References== Category: Ayodhya dispute Category:Vishva Hindu Parishad Category:1990 in India ","title":"Ayodhya firing incident"},{"id":"54103297","text":"Misk may refer to: ;Geography * Misk Hills, a sandstone plateau in the East Midlands of England * Misk'i, a mountain in the Bolivian Andes ;Other * MiSK Foundation, a non-profit organisation in Saudi Arabia * Abu al-Misk Kafur, a ruler of Ikhshidid Egypt and Syria in the 10th century CE * Fedwa Misk, Moroccan journalist and women's rights campaigner ","title":"Misk"},{"id":"54103302","text":"MyChild App is an Android app that helps parents screen developmental disorders in their children between the age of 1 and 24 months.

It was founded by Jannetto de Tassis in 1495. The Bergamascan Tasso family had built up postal routes throughout Italy since and Jannetto's uncle Ruggiero had worked for Frederick III since the mid-15th century. Ruggiero had already connected Vienna and Innsbruck with Italy, Styria, and Brussels, before Maximilian expanded from those routes throughout his realm. Maximilian's Philip of Burgundy appointed Jannetto's brother Francisco as capitaine et maistre de nos postes in 1502 and it was a payment dispute between the two which caused Francisco to open the family's network to public correspondence in 1506. Charles V confirmed Jannetto's son Giovanni Battista as Postmaster General (chief et maistre general de noz postes par tous noz royaumes, pays, et seigneuries) in 1520. Confirmed by Emperor Rudolph II in 1595, the Imperial postal service remained a monopoly of the Thurn und Taxis family (officially hereditary from 1615 onwards) until it was terminated with the end of the Empire in 1806. The Imperial Reichspost was based in Brussels in the Spanish Netherlands, from where the original (\\"Dutch\\") route led via Namur, Bastogne, Lieser, W√∂llstein, Rheinhausen, and Augsburg to Innsbruck and Trento. It was also used to bypass the Kingdom of France in order to keep in touch with Habsburg Spain during times of hostility. Competing services were prohibited, although the Imperial cities were permitted to maintain their own communication system. After the accession of Rudolph's brother Emperor Matthias in 1612, a second route was established from Cologne via Frankfurt, Aschaffenburg, and Nuremberg to Bohemia and later also to Leipzig and Hamburg. After the Thirty Years' War and the Peace of Westphalia, Postmaster General Count Lamoral II Claudius Franz von Thurn und Taxis and his successors had to deal with the establishment of separate postal agencies, mainly by the Protestant Imperial States of Northern German but also in several lands of the Habsburg Monarchy, leading to long-lasting disputes over their range of authority. In the course of the War of the Spanish Succession, the Thurn und Taxis seat was relocated from Brussels to the Free City of Frankfurt in 1702. Though the dynasty had sided with the Wittelsbach rival Charles VII in the War of the Austrian Succession, their services were indispensable, and Maria Theresa's husband Emperor Francis I officially re-implemented the Thurn und Taxis monopoly in 1746. Two years later, the postal authority moved to Regensburg, seat of the Imperial Diet. The family had accumulated extreme wealth; nonetheless, it was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. The last Postmaster General, Prince Karl Alexander von Thurn und Taxis, lost his office with the Empire's dissolution on 6 August 1806, but his postal authority continued as the Frankfurt-based Thurn-und-Taxis Post until the unification of Germany. == See also == * Postage stamps and postal history of Germany * Deutsche Post * Deutsche Bundespost == Notes  References == * * Category:Postal organizations ","title":"Kaiserliche Reichspost"},{"id":"54103410","text":"The German Whiteheaded Mutton (German: Wei√ük√∂pfiges Fleischschaf) is a breed of sheep developed to live along the North Sea coast of Germany. It is a dual- use breed used for both its fine wool and meat production. They often graze along the North Sea dikes in Northern Europe. ==Origin== As per its name, the German Whitehead Mutton originated in Germany. It was bred in the mid-20th century by crossing the British breeds English Leicester, Cotswold, Hampshire, and Oxford with the local Wilstermarschscha marsh sheep. The breed has been further improved by cross-breeding it with other varieties, primarily the Dutch Texel starting in 1966 and the French Berrichon du Cher in the 1970s. ==Characteristics== The Whiteheaded Mutton is a breed designed to live in the cold, wet regions around the North Sea marshes. Consequently, the sheep was bred for hardiness and durability to cope with the rough weather in the region. Rams typically weigh about 110-130 kg and ewes normally weigh around 70-80 kg. The Whiteheaded Mutton possesses a very long, rough fleece, with average fleece weight being about 7.4 kg for rams and 5.5 kg for ewes, and a fiber diameter of 37-41 microns. Its fleece is also known for its very good crimp, which is exceptionally high considering the roughness of the Whiteheaded Mutton's wool. The Whiteheaded Mutton also possesses very meaty hindquarters and thick loin and rack meats, making it good for meat production as well. Another important characteristic of the Whiteheaded Mutton is its high fecundity. The Whiteheaded Mutton typically reproduces at a rate of 1.5-1.8 lambs per ewe per year. ==Usage== The German Whiteheaded Mutton is a dual-use sheep and is used for both the production of wool and meat. In Germany, the German Whitehead Mutton is commonly grazed along the grassy areas of the North Sea dikes, where they both are fattened off the grass and help to solidify the dikes by trampling and compacting the earth they graze on. In the winter, the sheep are moved behind the dikes and often are grazed on harvested cropland. The German Whiteheaded Mutton has also been utilized for its genetics. In the 1980s a population was exported to New Zealand from Denmark to improve the genetics of local sheep flocks (today the breed is very rare in New Zealand, with only several hundred remaining). The German Whiteheaded Mutton was also the basis for the development of the British Oldenburg breed. ==Conservation status== The German Whiteheaded Mutton is listed as a class III endangered livestock breed according to GEH. There is an estimated world population of roughly 182 rams and 1,734 ewes remaining. ==References== Category:Sheep breeds originating in Germany ","title":"German Whiteheaded Mutton"},{"id":"54103415","text":"Debbie Palmer was the daughter of actress Ann Palmer and worked as a model in California and Texas before her \\"Local Beauty Queen Missing in Texas.\\" Desert Sun [Palm Springs] 13 Feb. 1971, 165th ed.: 1.

She graduated from Palm Springs High School while working as a model in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, California. She intended to start college but waited too late to register and so took a job in a Beverly Hills stock broker's office. Shortly before her 19th birthday, Debbie returned to the Dallas area, getting an apartment with a friend in the Carrawood complex in North Dallas, where her neighbors crowned her \\"Miss Carrawood\\". == Disappearance == While Debbie lived in an apartment in Richardson, TX. her mother was in Europe but receive a call from her father, W.H. Palmer in Terrell, TX that no one heard from Debbie in a week and was expected to be returning from a visit to Janet LaLanne, Jack's daughter but upon Sharon meeting her flight, she was not there. Ann Palmer trove to get a flight out of D√ºsseldorf, Germany but was delayed for a weekend, giving her hope she would get word Debbie was O.K. The following Monday, her mother took a flight from Europe to Dallas. For the month prior to her disappearance, Debbie had been visiting with the daughter of Jack LaLanne in Palm Springs and Hollywood. Debbie Palmer was last seen at 8:30 p.m. on September 8, 1970, walking between apartments in the courtyard of the Carrawood Apartments. When she was reported missing four days later, the Dallas police told her family that they could not do anything about it as Debbie was over 18 years of age, despite the fact that within the previous year four other women had gone missing from the North Dallas area and been found dead, all beaten, stabbed, and mutilated before being left on the side of the road.Cochran, Mike. \\"Seven Unsolved Murders May Be Work of One Killer.\\" Corpus Christi Times 13 Apr. 1971, sec.

Her mother believed that if Debbie was abducted it would have been someone she knew, as she knew and was friends with almost everyone in the area. At the end of September 1970, the Plano Police department called Ann Palmer to tell her that motorists discovered her daughter's suitcase and rings between Richardson and Plano, Texas. The police just wanted Ann to come pick them up and when she did Ann noticed that some of Debbie's items were missing, including her purse. By April 1971, police in Texas suspected that they were dealing with a Serial killers or killers. Between Odessa and Dallas seven women had been murdered under similar circumstances and two, including Debbie, were missing. Captain Robert O. Dixon, head of the Dallas Police Department's homicide division said, \\"... we may have two or three, or even more, maniacs running loose.\\" With the help of three psychiatrists a criminal profile was published in the local newspapers, \\"young man, 20-25, medium to small size, who recently suffered a severely damaging marital experience.\\" Debbie wasn't found alive or dead and there were no other leads, so the case went cold. Lack of publicity may have been a factor in the lack of leads, as late as May 1972, Debbie was still being expected at pageants in the area. Her Mother, Ann Palmer, remained at her parents' home in Texas for almost a year before returning home to California, never giving up hope Debbie would be found through some unexplainable circumstances. == Aftermath == In 1996, Sightings (TV series) featured Debbie's story, bringing in psychic detective Dorothy Allison who then worked with Palmer's family friend and former Sheriff of Kaufman County, Texas, Roy Brockway. Brockway took Allison to Debbie's last known address as Allison wrote down her psychic impressions. According to Allison, Palmer was murdered by a jealous lover she had tried to break up the night of her disappearance and her body was dumped in a wooded area north of the area, the same area Debbie's suitcases had been found twenty-five years previous. She also wrote down several names, which were not made public but shown to Sharon (Debbie's cousin). Sharon confirmed that one of the names was the name of Debbie's boyfriend and that Debbie had confided in Sharon that she was going to \\"have a talk with him\\" about breaking up with him just before her disappearance. When Sharon took the psychic impressions to the Texas State Police with hopes that they would reopen the case based on them, Jim Chandler refused. In 2015, Debbie's mother, Ann Palmer wrote a book about her relationship with her daughter, Intermingled Destinies Between a Mother and Daughter. == References == Category:1951 births Category:People from Dallas Category:Possibly living people ","title":"Debbie Palmer"},{"id":"54103416","text":"Billy Joe Castle (born 14 July 1992 in Marchwood, Hampshire) is an English professional snooker player. ==Career== In May 2017, Castle came through Q-School by winning six matches to earn a two-year card on the World Snooker Tour for the 2017‚Äì18 and 2018‚Äì19 seasons.

After leaving the Navy, Buracker worked as an engineer and was Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works from 1947 to 1949. ==Early life== Buracker was born in Luray, Virginia on July 25, 1897. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1920. He became a Navy pilot and was a member of the squadron which made the first non-stop flight from California to Central America. From 1928 to 1930 he studied aeronautic engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While there he met Dorothy Martin of Winchester, Massachusetts. The two later married. ==World War II== At the outbreak of World War II, Buracker was attached to the staff of Adm. William F. Halsey. Buracker was the operations officer of the carrier task force that transported planes for the Doolittle Raid. He was operations officer in the carrier raids on the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Wake Island and Marcus Island. He was awarded the Silver Star \\"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving on the Staff of the Task Force Commander\\" during the raids. After the Battle of Midway, Buracker returned to the United States. From August 1942 to May 1943 he was commander of the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida. In this role, Buracker oversaw the expansion of the base, which included the construction and expansion of air fields. United States Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal publicly commended Buracker for his work in Pensacola. In 1943, Buracker became the fleet aviation officer on the staff of Adm. Chester Nimitz. In early 1944 he was given command of the USS Princeton. As commander of the Princeton, Buracker launched raids on Hollandia, Formosa, the Philippines, and the Marshall, Ryukyu, and Palau Islands. He was credited with \\"contribut[ing] directly toward destroying a large part of the enemy's navy and air force\\" during the months of September and October 1944. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, a 500-pound Japanese bomb went through the deck of the Princeton and ignited a series of fires. Buracker attempted to save the ship, however he gave the order to abandon ship after it was determined that the best tactical course of action would be to intentionally fire on and sink the ship. Buracker was awarded the Purple Heart, Legion of Merit with the Combat \\"V\\", and the Navy Cross for his actions during the sinking of the Princeton. At the time of the battle, Buracker was scheduled for relief as commander of the ship and his replacement, John Hoskins was already aboard the Princeton when the battle commenced. ==Post-War life== In December 1945, Buracker was assigned to MIT, where he served as a professor of naval science and commanding officer of the naval training school there. On May 1, 1947, Buracker retired from the Navy to become the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works. During his tenure as Public Works Commissioner, Buracker oversaw the expansion of Boston's Logan Airport. He pushed for the construction of a central terminal building, four runways, and two aprons. On January 5, 1949, Buracker resigned so that incoming Governor Paul A. Dever could appoint his own commissioner. After leaving state service, Buracker worked for the engineering firm of Jackson and Moreland until his retirement. Buracker died on March 7, 1977 in Winchester. ==Portrayal in film== Buracker was portrayed by Hayden Rorke in The Eternal Sea, a 1955 film about the life of John Hoskins.

After nearly a decade of service, the station was permanently closed on February 6, 2006. The relocation of Bland Street station, for the LYNX Blue Line, and the already close proximity of East/West Boulevard station made Park Avenue redundant and thus unnecessary.

To finance his real estate purchases, West and abolitionist Alexander Beatty concocted a scheme in which Beatty would sell West back into slavery and then aid in his escape, splitting the profits from the sale. In 1837, after three successful scams, West had enough funds to purchase 177 acres of land in Fayette County, Ohio. There he built his mansion as well as a road known as \\"Abolition Lane\\" where 12 cabins were erected as well as a schoolhouse. Six years after moving to Ohio, he married Harriet Peyton of Culpeper, Virginia. Throughout the 1840s and 50s, these served as shelter for escaped slaves. After the Civil War, they became homes for newly emancipated citizens. As of February 1999, archaeologists and historians have visited the property in hopes of locating artifacts from the cabins. In 2003, Ohio placed a historical marker at the site of the property to honor Augustus West's humanitarianism. ==References== Category:1814 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Date of death missing Category:19th-century African-American people Category:American abolitionists Category:People from Fayette County, Ohio Category:People from Madison County, Virginia ","title":"Augustus West"},{"id":"54103436","text":"Mill Creek converges with West Kill by North Blenheim, New York. == References == Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Schoharie County, New York ","title":"Mill Creek (West Kill)"},{"id":"54103441","text":"Leap Into Life () is a 1924 German silent drama film directed by Johannes Guter and starring Xenia Desni, Walter Rilla and Paul Heidemann.

He was bred by Roll Z Dice Racing Stable. He was sired by Afleet Alex, the 2005 Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes winner. His dam, Lucky Again, is a daughter of inaugural Breeders' Cup Classic winner Wild Again. Lucky Again has also produced Oh So Bella, a full sister to Afleet Again, who is graded stakes-placed. Northern Afleet, Afleet Again's grandsire, is the sire of Breeders' Cup winners Amazombie and World Approval, as well as Afleet Alex. Afleet Again was trained by Robert \\"Butch\\" Reid, Jr. and owned by Cash Is King Racing Stable (owners of Afleet Alex) and Kasey K Racing Stable during his career. == Racing career ==  Juvenile and Sophomore Seasons  Afleet Again broke his maiden as a juvenile in his fourth start at Parx Casino and Racing. Afleet Again opened his sophomore season with a fifth place finish in the Count Fleet Stakes at Aqueduct, and returned to the winner's circle in his next race, an allowance. After running second in the Whirlaway Stakes, he contested his first graded stakes race, the 2010 Gr.III Gotham Stakes, finishing a poor 10th. Afleet Again's first big win came next when he upset the Gr.III Withers Stakes, defeating multiple graded stakes winner D'Funnybone and stakes winner Ibboyee. The following month in March, he finished second in the Spend a Buck Stakes, and then third in the Gr.III Pegasus Stakes. Afleet Again stepped up into Gr.I company for the first time in the Haskell Invitational Stakes. The 2010 Haskell saw a field that included champion Lookin At Lucky, Kentucky Derby winner Super Saver, Preakness-placed First Dude, Kentucky Derby-placed Ice Box, and stakes winner Trappe Shot. Afleet Again finished fifth in a field of six. He ran once more in top company, contesting the Travers Stakes. The race was won by Afleet Express, another son of Afleet Alex, with Fly Down and First Dude behind in second and third; Afleet Again finished a good fourth. Afleet Again's last race of 2010 was the Gr.II Pennsylvania Derby, where he finished fifth. Afleet Again began 2011 with a runner-up finish in an allowance race, followed by a pair of fifth- place runs in the One Count Stakes and Brooklyn Handicap. He then finished second in the Greenwood Cup Stakes.  2011 Breeder's Cup  Despite a string of poor performances in stakes races, Afleet Again was entered in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Marathon, a Gr.II race contested at the distance of 1 3/4 miles. He was the longest shot on the board at 41-1. The field included fellow distance runners Eldaafer, the 2010 Marathon winner, Brooklyn Handicap winner Birdrun, and Clark Handicap winner Giant Oak, among others. Graded stakes winner Pleasant Prince led throughout most of the race, fading around the turn, with a string of horses, including Afleet Again, taking over at the front. Cease, a son of War Front, took the lead down the stretch, but was overtaken by Afleet Again, who was piloted by Cornelio Velasquez, flew on the outside to win by 2 1/4 lengths, defeating Birdrun and Giant Oak. He finished the race in a final time of 3:00.39 and paid $85.20 to win. His win snapped an eight race losing streak. Robert Reid, Afleet Again's trainer, said after the race, ‚ÄúHe ran fabulously. It's so rare to get this kind of distance, so we decided to take a shot. We always thought he could go this far. There's no limit to how far he can run. When I saw a 48 (fraction) for the first half and we were only seven or eight lengths out of it, I thought we were in pretty good shape.‚Äù Afleet Again's final race came in December 2011 at Woodbine Racetrack, when he contested the Valedictory Stakes. He finished fourth behind Queen's Plate winner Eye of the Leopard, Harrods Creek, and Eagle Poise. He retired after 2011 with a record of 25: 4-5-3 and earnings of $695,299. == Stud Career and Death == Afleet Again was consigned as a stallion prospect at the Keeneland 2012 Breeding Stock Sale, and was purchased for $30,000 by Yoon Heung Yul of South Korea. Sent to South Korea, Alfeet Again stood stallion duties at Happy Farm, a small farm home to a broodmare band and other stallions.

He was created by David Chaskin and portrayed by Mark Patton. Making his debut in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge in 1985, Jesse became the first male protagonist of the series. In Freddy's Revenge, Freddy enacts a plan to possess Jesse, using his body to kill in the real world, slowly gaining the strength to manifest his form physically. Outside of the films, Jesse has a main role in the novels. Because of the LGBT representation in a mainstream film, Jesse has developed a large fan base in the gay community and has been called a gay icon. Jesse has been observed by some scholars as a variation of the \\"final girl\\" slasher film archetype, and has been referred to as a \\"final boy\\". ==Appearances== In film In A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, Jesse is a high school student who moves into Nancy Thompson's old house on 1428 Elm Street with his family and begins to have nightmares about Freddy Krueger. Jesse first encounters Freddy in nightmare sequence that takes place on a school bus. Jesse takes his friend Lisa to school and becomes friends with a boy named Ron Grady after they fight. Lisa helps Jesse unpack his things after school and they find a diary from Nancy Thompson explaining her nightmares. Jesse realizes that Freddy wants to possess him and use his body to kill in the real world. Freddy successfully controls him and kills Jesse's coach and attempts to kill Jesse's sister though Jesse is able to resist. He seeks help from Ron and asks him to watch over him while he sleeps but when Ron falls asleep, Freddy regains control and murders Ron. Jesse retreats to Lisa's house during a party but Freddy again takes control, trying to kill her. Jesse fights back against his control and Freddy instead turns on the other teenagers present, murdering seven before disappearing. Freddy travels to the boiler room where he would take his child victims while still alive. Lisa confronts Freddy and Jesse is able to finally regain control, exorcising Freddy. After this incident while travelling on the school bus with Lisa, their friend Kerry is impaled through the chest by Freddy and the bus careens off the road, revealing Freddy is still alive and has again trapped Jesse. His fate is left ambiguous. Jesse briefly appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in Freddy vs. Jason (2003). In literature Jesse is the lead protagonist of the 1992 novelization of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. In 2012, Mark Patton released Jesse's Lost Journal. There are 68 journal entries that span 1982‚Äì1985. The first 30 entries closely follow the events of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, though unveil new details not seen on screen (hints that Jesse's father is a pedophile; Jesse's platonic love for Lisa; his homosexual feelings for a classmate; his feeling of Nancy Thompson as a kindred spirit). There is a different conclusion in that Jesse supposedly kills Lisa Webber at the power plant, rather than the film's final bus sequence (although she is later revealed to have survived). The remaining 38 journal entries focus on Jesse's time at a psychiatric ward, his sentencing for murdering Ron Grady and the apparent disappearance of Lisa's corpse, his escape from the institution, and his efforts to build a new identity. Jesse still wrestles with Freddy Krueger in his mind, and enters into a panic when Hollywood begins making the Nightmare on Elm Street films based on Jesse's and Nancy Thompson's journal entries. ==Development== Conception In an interview, Mark Patton stated, \\"I don't think that [the character] Jesse was originally written as a gay character. I think it's something that happened along the line by serendipity.\\" Casting Mark Patton beat out actors such as Brad Pitt, Christian Slater and Matt Damon for the role of Jesse and revealed that he based certain aspects of the character on Ally Sheedy's character in The Breakfast Club (1985). In an interview with Attitude magazine, Robert Englund stated \\"... the second Nightmare on Elm Street is obviously intended as a bisexual themed film. It was early '80s, pre-AIDS paranoia. Jesse's wrestling with whether to come out or not and his own sexual desires was manifested by Freddy. His friend is the object of his affection. That's all there in that film. We did it subtly but the casting of Mark Patton was intentional too, because Mark was out and had done Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean.\\" Yet, in the documentary Scream, Queen! My Nightmare on Elm Street, Patton describes being a closeted lead actor appearing in a horror film with a gay subtext. After Freddy's Revenge, Patton shouldered the negative publicity as well as his HIV-positive diagnosis. His mental health declined as a result, and he relocated to Mexico from Hollywood to start a new life. The documentary addresses Patton's grudge against screenwriter David Chaskin for his denying that gay elements were purposely written into the script. ==Reception== In his book Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film, Harry M. Benshoff references Jesse, stating the following: :\\"Unlike the other films in the series, the protagonist of Freddy's Revenge is a teenage boy, one whom Freddy spends most of the film trying to \\"get inside of.\\" Jesse is played with a sweet gay boy aura by actor Mark Patton, who played the preoperative transsexual Karen Black in Robert Altman's Come back to the Five-and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982). Jesse is introduced as the new kid in town, a loner and an outcast, and spends much of the film in his jockey-shorts, sweat glistening off his bare chest as he repeatedly wakes up from Freddy Krueger-inspired nightmares, which, as at least one author has noted, also suggests the imagery of AIDS-related night sweats.\\" In The Queer Encyclopedia of Film & Television, Claude J. Summers stated: :\\"...Nightmare on Elm Street 2 (1985) features both an out homosexual in the form of a sadistic gym coach (who is brutally dispatched in a Grand Guignol shower scene) and a coded/closeted queer boy, Jesse (Mark Patton), whose outsiderness attracts the attention of the monster Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Harry Benshoff reads the scene of the coach's death-which occurs through Freddy's inhabiting, that is, penetrating, Jesse-as a version of homosexual panic that results in Jesse himself, an extension of the 1950s theme of the sophisticated older homosexual taking charge of a vulnerable, wavering younger man.\\" In Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Updated Edition, Tony Williams notes that Jesse is a victim of a \\"dysfunctional family situation.\\" Jesse and Freddy's relationship is intended to have a homo-erotic subtext with Freddy representing Jesse's fear of 'coming out'. Commentators point to the lack of interest Jesse shows in Lisa and his retreat to Ron's bedroom after a failed attempt at kissing her, implying Ron is the object of Jesse's affection. At one point in the film, he also ends up in a gay S&M; club where he is confronted by his homosexual gym teacher, Schneider. This plot is not made obvious in the film though Krueger-actor, Robert Englund and writer David Chaskin both admit to the concealed subtext, indicating that the casting of openly gay actor Mark Patton to play the role was intentional.Review In Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies, Jim Harper describes Jesse as \\"the main victim of the film.\\" In Remaking Horror: Hollywood's New Reliance on Scares of Old, James Francis Jr. dubbed the character as a \\"final boy\\" and noted the parallels between Jesse and Nancy Thompson, stating: :\\"In the franchise this production became known as the \\"gay sequel,\\" because the filmmakers presented the audience with a final boy scenario that adhered to final girl rules. In a reversal of conventional gender roles, Jesse wakes from his nightmares screaming in a high-pitched voice, his clothing is feminized (tight jeans, colorful shirts, ornate accessories), and his would-be girlfriend (Lisa) plays the supportive boyfriend role. He dances to cutesy pop music and visits his best male friend (a fit muscular guy clad only in tight briefs) in the dead of the night with the request that he watch over him while he sleeps-in the same manner Nancy petitioned Glen in the original film. Jesse takes Nancy's role as the final \\"girl,\\" and the script befits a female protagonist. ==See also== *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise) characters Category:Fictional diarists Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Fictional gay males Category:Film characters introduced in 1985 Category:Final girls Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Fictional stalking victims Category:Fictional LGBT characters in film Category:Fictional LGBT characters in literature ","title":"Jesse Walsh"},{"id":"54103540","text":"House of Stevan Mokranjac in Belgrade is significant as the house where the famous composer Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac lived and worked, during his stay in Belgrade.Belgrade City Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments It is located on the corner of 16, Dositej Street and Gospodar Jevremova. The house was built as a family house of Jakov Damjanoviƒá, building contractor, in 1872. From July 1878 to May 1879, the house was used for housing the humanitarian organization of the English Institute for Serbian Orphans, later the Institute for Serbian Orphans, which was founded by English physician Dr. Henri Ciman after the Serbian-Turkish wars and for whose needs, a garden wing was added next to the building. In the house, Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac (1856‚Äî1914) lived and worked, as the most prominent Serbian composer and choirmaster, teacher and collector of folk melodies with which he enriched art music. He completed his music studies studied in Germany and Italy.

The building is one-story, but monumental, with a large yard. The horizontal cornices contribute to the harmonious division of the facade, as well as the pilasters which separate the window openings. The house is a good example of quality construction and craftsmanship realization in residential architecture of Belgrade at the beginning of the eighth decade of the 19th century, when the first urban regulation of this part of the city was carried out and when influences of western European architecture were increasingly accepted in the application of decorative elements.

It is an example of Organic Architecture, or Metaphoric architecture. The arched roof panels resemble a shell, or an onion, while the lava rock walls reference ancient Hawaiian temples, or heiau, which are found along the Kona coast. The roof panels are translucent like onion skin, transmitting sunlight into the house during the day and glowing at night. With no exterior walls,http://visualvamp.blogspot.com/2008/09/onion-house-story-of-kendrick- kellogg.html the outdoors are integrated with the living areas, separated only by screen or stained glass. A 70-foot pool wraps around the two main structures. Elizabeth McCormick von Beck commissioned Kellogg to design the home, when he was in his mid-twenties. When they could not find a contractor willing to attempt the project, Kellogg moved to Kona, Hawaii, to construct it himself.http://www.onionhousehawaii.com/william-slatton-metalwork.html William Slatton James Hubbell collaborated with Kellogg on construction of the home, with Hubbell creating 29 stained glass windows and a mosaic tile dining table. William Slatton created metal-work details throughout the home, including the entrance gate and the spires topping the three structures. The roofs of the two main structures are supported by a series of cast-in-place concrete arches, radiating out from a central fireplace in each building. Translucent panels made of fiberglass, called Alsynite, curve between each concrete arch. These roofs are crowned with hand-cut redwood shingles, topped by steel spires. Massive lava rock walls form a high terrace overlooking the ocean. These walls flow uninterrupted from the outside to the interior, right through the glass and screen walls. These rock walls are thicker at the bottom, slanting upward like the walls of Hawaiian temples, or heiau. This very site- specific architecture works in the gentle climate of Kona, where trade winds are buffered by Mount Hualalai, and temperatures range between the 70's and 80's. This was the third home Kellogg designed, and one of his best-known buildings. Kellogg's architectural vision was heavily influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. Kellogg calls the Onion house his 'breakaway house' where he moved away from the horizontal planes that characterized much of Wright's work. Kellogg's aesthetic has been described as \\"an architecture so full of life that it seems to breathe.\\" Elizabeth McCormick von Beck was the niece of the founder of the McCormick spice company. The home was purchased in 1984 by the original owner's niece, Beth McCormick, who renovated the home over a period of 34 years. In 2017 the home was sold to the current owners, while Beth McCormick remains involved providing advice and architectural guidance. In 2000, Beth McCormick began sharing the Onion House with the public as a vacation rental property, and it remains available for guests to visit to this day with the new owners. Information on visiting the Onion House can be found on the Onion House's official website as well as VRBO. == References  External links == * * Category:Architecture in Hawaii Category:Houses in Hawaii County, Hawaii ","title":"Onion House"},{"id":"54103626","text":"The T√ºbingen University Faculty of Law (), located in T√ºbingen, Germany, is one of the original four constituent faculties of Eberhard Karls Universit√§t T√ºbingen.

In 1754, Windham was experiencing a severe drought and the French and Indian War had recently broken out. An attack from French and native forces was also expected from Canada. One night, in June, the frogs began to attack each other over the last remaining water. The resulting noise was so great that the townspeople thought that it was the attack already happening. Many took to arms. This led to mass hysteria of sorts. Numerous people became convinced that Armageddon was upon them. Some sources claim that the names \\"Dyer\\" and \\"Elderkin\\" were heard, the names of two influential lawyers and colonels. Other sources say that the people thought they were Native Americans saying \\"gin\\" and \\"rum.\\" Townsfolk ran into the streets, some with guns and knives. Those who were armed mounted a hill to see the landscape around them. In the morning, the colonists found the cause of the noise. Hundreds of dead and dying bullfrogs lay in the last remaining parts of the pond. Colonel Eliphalet Dyer and Colonel Jedediah Elderkin were both Yale graduates and lawyers who had set up offices in Windham. ==Aftermath== People throughout the colonies heard the story and many were amused. Apparently, one could not go very far from home and hear something about bullfrogs.Payne, Brigham, et al. \\"The Story of Bacchus, and Centennial Souvenir\\". Hartford, Conn., A. E. Brooks, 1876. John Warner Barber wrote in the 1836 book Connecticut Historic Collections that the incident had occurred in July 1758. He wrote that \\"Long and obstinately [fought] was the contest, and many thousands of combatants were found dead on both sides of the ditch the next morning.\\" The people of Windham were ridiculed in the colonies, and the town seal was made to be a bullfrog. The event has become memorialized as a part of the town's folklore. The pond, formerly known as Follett's Pond, was renamed Frog Pond. In the 1993 book The Battle of the Frogs and Fairford's Flies, Jerome Friedman writes that Puritans saw the mass marching of frogs as evidence of God's anger while Anglicans agreed there had been large numbers of frogs, but disputed whether they could march in columns. Frog behavior specialist Susan Z. Herrick, who grew up in Windham, suspects the bullfrogs were making advertisement calls. The bullfrogs, confronted with a shrinking shoreline and being pushed together as they lost physical territory, may have shifted their mating strategy. With so many males in a small pond, Herrick speculates that \\"all the males gave up on having any territory at all and focused strictly on at least getting a female. With no coordination of calls, it must have been a God-awful noise, and I think this is what the villagers heard.\\" ==Accounts== The Windham \\"Bull-Frog Song\\" with introduction In 1857, William Lawton Weaver compiled the 48-page booklet The Battle of the frogs, at Windham, 1758: with various accounts and three of the most popular ballads on the subject. It was published by James Walden in Willimantic. In his introduction, Weaver offers his own interpretation of the events. Account of Samuel Peters Reverend Samuel Peters, then a student at Yale University, wrote an account of the incident in the 1787 History of Connecticut. In his version the frogs were located some five miles from Windham in \\"an artificial pond three miles square.\\" Peters writes that the frogs, having found the water dried up, hopped their way towards the Willimantic River. He states that the frogs \\"filled a road forty yards wide for four miles in length,\\" entered Windham around midnight, and were several hours in their passage. In his account, the residents of Windham fled naked from their beds with \\"worse shrieking than that of the frogs,\\" fearing an earthquake or \\"dissolution of nature.\\" He relates that the men retreated a half mile and upon their return heard from the \\"enemy's camp\\" voices uttering words \\"Wight, Hilderken, Dier, Tete.\\" They only discovered that their attackers were frogs after three men were sent to negotiate. According to a review of his account in American Notes and Queries, his prejudices \\"led him to connive at the dismemberment of Connecticut.\\" Peters, who had Tory sympathies, was forced to leave the country in 1774. The review, noting that Peters exaggerated the area of Frog Pond and its distance from town, also observed that a migration of frogs would likely have sought out the Shetucket River, which was closer than the Willimantic. Account of Sinda Ellen Douglas Larned, in the second volume of her 1880 History of Windham County, Connecticut, relays another account: ==Legacy== The Battle of the Frogs is celebrated in many ways including as a song, bullfrogs as symbols on their heraldic devices and coat of arms.Weaver, William L. The Battle of the Frogs, at Windham, 1758: With Various Accounts and Three of the Most Popular Ballads on the Subject. Willimantic, CT: James Walden, 1857. During a 1902 visit by President Theodore Roosevelt, a banner commemorating the Battle of the Frogs was displayed. Willimantic, Connecticut has a bridge with statues of frogs commemorating the event. Ballads Three ballads have been written about the Battle of the Frogs. Ebenezer Tilden is credited as the author of \\"The Lawyers and Bull-Frogs\\", whose closing stanza says \\"Lawyers, I say, now from this day, be honest in your dealing. And never more increase your store, while you the poor are killing.\\" The ballad is \\"a true relation of a strange battle between some Lawyers and Bull-Frogs, set forth in a new song written by a jolly farmer of New England.\\" There was another ballad called \\"The Frogs of Windham\\". A third ballad entitled \\"The Bull-Frog Fright: A Ballad of the Olden Time\\" had forty-four stanzas and was published in 1851. Banknotes The $1 banknote issued by the Windham Bank includes a depiction of a dead frog with another frog sitting on top of it. The Windham Bank, chartered in 1832, produced banknotes that included a frog vignette. The vignette, featured prominently in the lower right of the notes, depicts a frog sitting atop another overturned, and dead, frog. The bank included the vignette in their $1, $2, $3, $5 and $10 denominations through to the 1870s. The Frogs of Windham Former Willimantic Enterprise owner Nason W. Leavitt and his son Burton Leavitt wrote the comic opera The Frogs of Windham in the 1880s. Published and copyrighted in 1891, the operetta includes a romantic subplot where Colonel Dyer tries to marry his daughter to a \\"weak- minded English youth.\\" A farmer boy smitten with her then plots to have the English lord captured by Mohegan Indians. The show's \\"Frog Ballet\\" was reported to have \\"caused much merriment\\" and the drinking song \\"Good Old Windham Flip\\" honored a local alcoholic concoction. The operetta contains numerous ethnic stereotypes, including an \\"Injun\\" war dance, a German character named Lim Burger, African American characters who are enslaved by Dyer, dancing gypsies, and an English lord with a speech impediment. The battle of the frogs is introduced in the last half of the third act as a mysterious noise. Colonel Dyer is convinced by a parson that the noise is God's way of telling him that he shouldn't stop his daughter from marrying the person she loves. The Frogs of Windham was performed throughout Connecticut in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The operetta's 82-page piano score is held by the Library of Congress. An updated production of The Frogs of Windham was prepared for the sesquicentennial of the incorporation of Willimantic in 1983. The Sesquicentennial Fine Arts Committee used state and city grants to finance the set and costumes. Kramer Middle School teacher Robert Brouillard called the operetta \\"a director's nightmare,\\" noting its amateurish libretto and comparing it to the fictional musical Springtime for Hitler. Brouillard rewrote the story, which was \\"riddled with racial and ethnic epithets.\\" The production included antique muskets and featured the Windham Community Orchestra as well as the choreography of Windham Ballet artistic director Barbara Johnson. University of Connecticut music professor David Maker provided orchestration that the score had previously lacked. The Windham Theatre Guild performed the work again in 1992. Thread City Crossing Willimantic's Thread City Crossing, also known as the Frog Bridge, was completed in 2000 and crosses the Willimantic River. Four 11-foot copper frogs are perched lazily on giant spools on either side of the bridge. Designed by artist Leo Jensen, the metal frogs pay homage to the Battle of the Frogs and are named Manny, Willy, Windy and Swifty. William H. Grover was asked to draw up designs for the bridge, and initially produced a Victorian theme with spools to represent Willimantic having been the home of the American Thread Company. Windham Planning Commission chair David E. Philips, who wrote the 1984 book Legendary Connecticut, suggested adding frogs to the mix. Residents also offered suggestions for the bridge. One returned from Serbia with a travel brochure of a bridge with dragons on either end that supposedly wag their tails when virgins walk over it. Margaret P. Reich, executive director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, said \\"we'd like to create a similar urban legend, but with frogs‚Äîand probably not involving virgins.\\" ==References== Category:1754 animal deaths Category:1754 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Connecticut folklore Category:Fictional battles Category:Frogs Category:Legendary amphibians Category:Windham, Connecticut ","title":"Battle of the Frogs"},{"id":"54103683","text":"Caminho Novo is a village in the north-eastern part of S√£o Tom√© Island in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe.

Roxy Theatre was the final name of a theatre that operated from 1935 to 2006 at 1129 Danforth Avenue, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada's east end. It was designed by the architectural firm Kaplan & Sprachman, which designed dozens of neighbourhood cinemas, and opened under the name Allenby Theatre. In the 1930s the Allenby allowed neighbourhood children to enroll in the Popeye Club, where they could watch a double bill, and two episodes of the popeye cartoon serials, for ten cents. During the 1970s, the theatre was run by Gary Topp and Jeff Silverman, reported to have introduced midnight screenings to Toronto. It was the first theatre to play daring films, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos. In addition to serving as a repertory cinema, the location was an early venue for the performance of punk rock. The Roxy is known for playing cult-classic Rocky Horror Picture Show, every week, from 1976 to 1983. In its final decades the theatre was one of the Festival chain of repertory cinemas of similar age. The building's Art Deco facade earned it a listing as a building of heritage interest. This designation, short of a full heritage designation, only preserved its facade. The building stood vacant, for several years, making the work of conservators more difficult. Following its final period as an English language repertory cinema, it reopened as the Apollo Theatre, and played Greek language films. However, it retained hand-painted Star Wars murals. The bulk of the building was demolished in November 2009, and an Esso gas station, convenience store, and Tim Hortons were constructed on the site. The facade of the building was restored with an Allenby Theatre marquee, including its ticket booth.

The mausoleum was constructed in 1022, where he was most already likely dead. The person who ordered the construction was his mother Chihrazad, whilst the name of the architect was a certain al-Husayn ibn Ali. In the inscription, Shahriyar is labeled as \\"Client of the Commander of the Faithful\\" (mawlƒÅ amƒ´r al-mu æminƒ´n). However, he is not called ispahbad, which was the title used by the Bavandid rulers, and thus it is dubious if he ever ruled. Shahriyar was possibly a grandson of the Bavandid ruler Shahriyar III (r. 986-988), and may have been the Shahriyar that the prominent Persian poet and author of Shahnameh (\\"Book of Kings\\"), Ferdowsi visited in 1010/1. == Notes  References  Sources == * * Category:Bavand dynasty Category:11th-century Iranian people Category:11th-century deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Shahriyar ibn Abbas"},{"id":"54103832","text":"Domenico Toschi (June 11, 1535 ‚Äì March 26, 1620) was an Italian soldier, jurist, and cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was born in Castellarano in Reggio Emilia to a poor family. After having originally served as a soldier, Toschi became a noted canon lawyer. He wrote the multi-volume legal treatise Practicarum conclusionum iuris in omni foro frequentiorum. He served as Vice- Legate in Bologna and was its Governor (1585-1588), and then as a Councillor in Tuscany (1588-1592). He was Bishop of Tivoli from 1595 to 1606. He was created Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Montorio on 3 March 1599 by Pope Clement VIII as a reward for successfully governing Rome while Clement was in Ferrara. He participated in the Papal conclaves of March and May 1605. Toschi was a candidate for the papacy in the May 1605 papal conclave, and was almost acclaimed pope, but Caesar Baronius intervened, objecting that Toschi was unfit for the papacy because his language and dress would cause scandal. Following Baronious' intervention, a scrutiny was taken, and Toschi fell short of election to the papacy by two votes. He transferred his titular church to Sant'Onofrio in 1604, returning to San Pietro in Montorio in 1610. He resigned as Bishop of Tivoli in 1606, and was replaced by his nephew, Giovanni Battista Toschi. He served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals in 1616‚Äì17. He died in Rome. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Italian cardinals Category:1535 births Category:1620 deaths Category:Italian jurists Category:Italian soldiers Category:16th-century jurists ","title":"Domenico Toschi"},{"id":"54103941","text":":For other people named Gordon MacDonald, see Gordon MacDonald.

Sutherland (August 7, 1901 ‚Äì April 20, 1968) was an American animator, screenwriter, and sound editor who is best known as the animator of many classic Warner Bros. cartoons. ==Career== Sid Sutherland - Animator Sutherland's professional life was varied across the entertainment business, ranging from journalism, screenwriting, animation, sound recording, and sound editing. In the 1930s, Sutherland wrote magazine articles, including two for Liberty magazine entitled The Mystery of Sacco and Vanzetti. In 1932, not long after the advent of talkies, Sutherland also broke into the movie business and began a career as a screenwriter at First National Pictures on The Match King, starring Warren William and Lili Damita. Although he soon developed a second career as an animator, he continued working concurrently as a screenwriter over the next fourteen years, his last movie being Wife Wanted (1946). Sutherland first branched into animation in 1935 with At Your Service for the Walter Lantz Studio at Universal Pictures where he worked with Tex Avery, Virgil Ross, and Cecil Surry. When Avery left Lantz later that year to direct animated shorts for Leon Schlesinger at Warner Bros., Avery offered Sutherland, Ross, and Surry the opportunity to join his new unit if they were looking to leave Universal. Lantz was not happy about the departures and told them that they would not be welcome back at his company. At Warner Bros. the four men, along with Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Robert Cannon, and Elmer Wait who were already employed by Schlesinger, moved into their own shabby workspace, a separate run-down building on the lot which became known at Termite Terrace. Away from the watchful eye of Schlesinger who, with the rest of his employees, remained in the building on the north end of the lot near Sunset Boulevard, Sutherland joined Tex and his unit where they all worked day and night, filled with ambition and enthusiasm. Subsequently, Sutherland became animator on dozens of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons until 1942. Starting in 1943 during a changing market caused by World War II, Sutherland decided to take advantage of opportunities to work in the relatively new medium of television and made a career change to a more secure living as a sound supervisor and sound editor. He worked steadily in the sound department on dozens of television episodes over the next 24 years, including work on The Cisco Kid, Highway Patrol, Bat Masterson, and Sea Hunt. Just prior to his retirement in 1966, Sutherland was a sound editor on the motion picture comedy, The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!, starring Carl Reiner. ==References== Category:American animators Category:American screenwriters Category:Warner Bros.

It aired in the United States on Fox on May 21, 2017 and the United Kingdom on Sky 1 on May 26, 2017. This was the last of The Simpsons to be scored by composer Alf Clausen, who had scored the show since 1990 before being fired in August 2017. ==Plot== Homer is driving in his usual manner and style (ineptly and recklessly) when he carelessly drives into an alleyway, with no room to maneuver and faulty brakes, where Santa's Little Helper and the now-homeless Gil are eating out of trash cans. Homer is horrified by the notion of hitting a sweet and lovable dog, so he slams into Gil instead, who ends up with a serious neck injury and plans to sue the Simpsons for everything they've got. The jury accepts the defense argument that dogs are not only as good as humans, but better in many ways, and they dismiss Gil's case. Mayor Quimby decides to ride the pro-pooch sentiment by instituting measures that cater to canines and punish humans who do such things, like round up strays and even run animal medicine places like the poor Dr. Budgie, who gets arrested and put into shackles. Dr. Budgie's plea for Springfield to realize that the dogs will soon notice that humans have advocated their alpha status and turn on the citizens is not taken seriously until it actually happens. Even Santa's Little Helper joins the feral dog pack, as the town hides from the now-vicious dogs, and a town meeting leads to the community begging their most broken-down citizen to help them: Gil. Gil is ready to face down his fellow street creatures, but it is Marge who steps up, and after finding out the leader of the dog pack is a vicious chihuahua named Taquito, kicks Taquito clear out of their showdown park and becomes the new alpha of Springfield. All of the dogs return to their homes and families, from Ned's Baz and Mr. Burns' hounds, to Lisa and Bart's joyous reunion with Santa's Little Helper. In the final scene, Gil thinks he is found a new friend in a weakened Taquito who licks Gil's hand and barks happily. Gil does not realize the Chihuahua is only being friendly so he can get a taste for Gil before the poor ex-salesman finally dies and Taquito eats his corpse. ==Reception== Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ stating, \\"As far as bare bones go, why not? Again, silly and high-concept can work if the jokes are good enough, especially if an episode manages to ground the silliness in some sort of character work. Failing that, a bold stab at self- reflexive meta-comedy can also power things along. But here, the jokes aren‚Äôt good enough to sustain the premise, the character elements are perfunctory and sparse, and, as has been the case for a few years in a row now, the season finale has seemed less like an attempt to go out with a bang, and more like an afterthought.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4/5 stars stating, \\"'Dogtown' panders to puppy love and yet somehow manages to mangle the mutts into a mangy mess of mischievous mayhem. Who doesn‚Äôt love cute puppies, playing piano, getting their snouts stuck in pickle jars or scratching their butts along the concrete to clean their fire hydrant debris?

Since TNT charges produce roughly double the airburst effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing the equivalent of a nuclear weapon surface burst. It was a continuation of the technical co-operation (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests ‚Äì the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, blast valves and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test was to compare the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller configuration in order to study scaling factors. ==Test== The test was performed at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968, at the Watching Hill blast range of the Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility able to carry out large high explosive (HE) test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres but equal in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by styrofoam rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the flame front reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring across filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the ground effects. == References == Category:Explosions in Canada Category:Explosions in 1968 Category:1968 in Canada Category:Military projects of the United States Category:1968 in military history Prairie Flat ","title":"Operation Prairie Flat"},{"id":"54104746","text":"Stop Talking is the second studio album by Chris Price. It was released on May 19, 2017 by Omnivore Recordings. The album was produced, engineered and mixed by Price himself, and was recorded over a five-year period starting immediately after the release of Price's debut, Homesick in 2012. Price reportedly recorded nearly 50 songs during this time, while also devoting time to produce albums for Linda Perhacs in 2014 and Emitt Rhodes in 2016. The album's cover, a painting of a blue dog, was painted by Andrew Scott. ==Reception== The album has received positive reviews. Paste, in an 8.8 out of 10 review says \\"With Stop Talking, [Price] pushes further, reinvigorating the entire singer-songwriter idiom for the 21st century.\\" UNCUT Magazine awarded an 8 out of 10 score, and called the album \\"a breathtaking aerial ballet from a gifted young artist/producer\\". The Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, writing \\"Price is admired in the power pop community, an oft-insular world that lives and dies on catchy hooks and earworm-worthy melodies. But Price‚Äôs brand of stickiness is less rigid and more pessimistic, and recalls the music of songwriters including Alex Chilton, Gene Clark and Aimee Mann, none of whom ever shied away from hard emotion.\\" Writing for Coachella Valley Weekly, Eleni P. Austin says, \\"Back in 1968, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were at a press conference to announce the formation of Apple Corps. Famously, they each named Harry Nilsson as their 'favorite American singer and group.' Nearly 50 years on, if they could answer that question today, there could only be one correct reply, Chris Price. Stop Talking is a masterpiece from start to finish.\\" In an 8 out of 10 review for Powerpopaholic, Aaron Kupferberg writes, \\"Chris Price's Stop Talking is mostly about pain and loss, but told with an elegance and beauty that‚Äôs impossible to ignore. The vignettes of each song reveal something disturbing under the surface of each catchy melody.\\" AllMusic gave a three and a half star review, saying \\"The subject matter can occasionally get heavy -- mental health, grief, and heartache all make themselves known -- but such is the singer/songwriter's milieu, and besides, there's enough Fab Four bubbling up beneath it all to keep things effervescent, even when the tales themselves break bad.\\" Stop Talking appeared on several year-end lists of the best albums of 2017, including a placement on the Los Angeles Times' list \\"California Sounds: the 30 essential Los Angeles records of 2017\\" in which Randall Roberts wrote, \\"The genre-obsessed might call this magnetic, introspective work a power-pop album, filled as it is with guitar-driven hooks and Beatles-circa-1966 inspiration. But to these ears it‚Äôs merely a great rock album, one that has been criminally overlooked on most year-end polls.\\" The album was also cited by KCRW DJ Gary Calamar, Powerpopaholic, PowerPopSquare, BuzzBands.la, 89.5 WPKN DJ Eric Cocks, the Play Me Some Of That! podcast, Eleni P.

He served as a Bishop of the Diocese of Stavanger from 1940 until 1949. Skagestad was a key figure in the resistance movement of the church during the German occupation of Norway. ==Personal life== Gabriel Skagestad was born on 25 November 1879 in Holme in southern Norway. His parents were T√∏nnes Andreas Gulovsen Skagestad and his wife Else Knutsdatter. In 1913 he married Torborg Konsmo. ==Education and career== He began his theological education in 1899 and he received his cand.theol. degree in 1903. His first job was as a chaplain in Hadsel from 1903-1906. Next he was a chaplain in Lyngdal from 1906-1909. He was a priest in Hetland from 1909 until 1913. From 1913-1922, he was the priest for the parish of Pipervika in Oslo. In 1922, he became the parish priest for Mandal. He held that job for four years. In 1926, he was called to become a professor at the MF Norwegian School of Theology seminary in Oslo. From 1933-1940, he served as the parish priest for the Saint Mark's Church in Oslo. In 1940, he was appointed to be the Bishop of the Diocese of Stavanger. As bishop, during the German occupation of Norway, Skagestad worked against the collaborations with the Quisling regime and its interference with the priesthood. Together with the other bishops of the Norwegian Church in 1942, he resigned his official government post as a bishop, but continued his ecclesiastical role as bishop. The government appointed Ole Johan Berntsen Kvasnes in 1942 as the new bishop. He was one of the priests who remained loyal to the new state government. Kvasnes retired as bishop on 5 December 1943. Bishop Kvasnes received little popular acceptance and the majority of the priests regarded themselves as Skagestad's men. During this time, Skagestad was held in Tonstad in Sirdal and later in Helg√∏ya, along with many other bishops. After the war, Skagestad resumed his official role as bishop for the diocese. He retired in 1949 and passed away in 1952. ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Bishops of Stavanger Category:20th-century Lutheran bishops ","title":"Gabriel Skagestad"},{"id":"54104762","text":"Sweetwater is a populated place situated in the far west of Pima County, Arizona.

Based in California, GAVRT is an acronym for the Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope and provides a science investigation program for students K through 12. Students learn how to be part of a science team while they are making a real contribution to scientific knowledge by operating and collecting data on current NASA JPL missions to moons and planets in the Solar System. Using the GoToMeeting platform, students take control of a 34-meter, 500 ton decommissioned NASA radio telescope to collect data for NASA's Jet Propulsion projects. Students collaborate with scientists who are working on the same mission and are recognized as part of the science team. Current campaigns include studying black holes, planets, search for extraterrestrial life (SETI) and helping monitor the health of a space probes such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Cassini-Huygens space probe and the Juno space probe. This provides an opportunity for students to experience real science, to learn that science is an ongoing process, not just memorizing facts (Lewis, 2017). Teacher training and certification is free and is available to all teachers across the world to learn the basics of radio astronomy, and are taught how to control the telescope. Teachers are provided free broad-based, multidisciplinary program curriculum which may be used as is, or individually adapted to fit their classroom environment that meets National Science Education Standards. Ongoing support for Teachers is provided by interactive website, email and phone communications. (Lewis, 2017). Students recognize that they are part of a scientific team and have the opportunity to meet with, ask questions and discuss findings with NASA/JPL scientists and engineers via online communication programs such as SKYPE. Students work together in teams to plan the experiment, assign job responsibilities, collect and analyze the data obtained from the telescope. The radio telescope can be seen to move in real time via a projector. Students collaborate with mission control and take control of the telescope, they can see it move into position real time. ==References== *Lewis Center for Educational Research (2017),GAVR Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope About GAVRT.

It is not a sacramentary in the strict sense, but rather a private collection of libelli missarum (missal booklets) containing only the prayers for certain Masses and not the scriptures, the canon or the antiphons.. It is named after the sole surviving manuscript, Codex Veronensis LXXXV, which was found in the chapter library of the cathedral of Verona by Giuseppe Bianchini and published in his four-volume Anastasii bibliothecarii vitae Romanorum pontificum in 1735. It is sometimes called \\"Leonine\\" because it has been attributed to Pope Leo I (died 461), but while some of the prayers may be his compositions the entire work certainly is not.. The Codex Veronensis LXXXV was copied in the early seventh century outside of Rome, but some of its material is clearly derived from Roman pamphlets (libelli missarum) and dates to the fifth and sixth centuries. Its contents are arranged according to the civil calendar, but the three quires containing the period 1 January ‚Äì 14 April are lost. Thus, there is no information in the earliest Roman liturgical book concerning the Easter Vigil. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Facsimile: Sacramentarium Leonianum: Akademische Druck- u.

Female body length is about 30 mm. Color ranges from green to brown. Males are slightly smaller (around 25 mm), but otherwise look similar. The abdomen can be bent upwards. A. cylindrogaster hunts other spiders, using a simplistic web, which it constructs between trees. In Japan, almost 96% of its prey were found to be spiders in 24 species from 11 families. The species creates an elongated egg sac. == Distribution == A. cylindrogaster is found in Laos, China (including Hong Kong), Korea, Taiwan and Japan.

He was the founder of DanceAfrica, the Chuck Davis Dance Company and the African American Dance Ensemble. == Early life == Charles Rudolph Davis was born on January 1, 1937, in Raleigh, North Carolina to Tony and Anne Davis. He graduated from John W. Ligon High School in 1954 and went on to serve in the United States Navy for two years, also working as a hospital corpsman at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. He received nursing training at George Washington University Hospital. Davis became inspired by African dance while working at the Naval Hospital, dancing to live Afro-Cuban mambo and salsa music at the Dunbar Hotel while he was off-duty. The hotel's booking manager asked him to join the hotel's nightclub revue, leading to him joining an African dance troop. He went on to attend Howard University to study theatre and dance; training in ballet, jazz, and tap. He also studied Caribbean dance technique with Geoffrey Holder and Lorna Hodges- Mafata. In 1963, he took part in the March on Washington. == Career == Davis founded the Chuck Davis Dance Company in New York City in 1968, DanceAfrica in 1977, and the African American Dance Ensemble in Durham, North Carolina in 1983. While living in New York, he was an instructor at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 1974, he joined the faculty of the American Dance Festival. He traveled to Africa over fifty times to study African dance techniques. He served as a panelist for the National Endowment of the Arts and was a recipient of the AARP Certificate of Excellence, the North Carolina Dance Alliance Award, the North Carolina Artist Award, the North Carolina Award in Fine Arts, and was inducted into the North Carolina Order of the Long Leaf Pine. He served on the board of the North Carolina Arts Council from 1991 until his death in 2017. In 1996 he received a $100,000 grant from the National Dance Residency Program for the African American Dance Ensemble. In 1998 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Medgar Evers College. He was an adjunct professor at North Carolina Central University in the Department of Theatre and Duke University. Davis was awarded two Bessie Awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. Along with the Durham dance scene, Davis was an instrumental leader in the African-American community. He led the Hayti Heritage Center's annual celebration of Kwanzaa and served as the grand marshal of one of Durham's first Mardi Gras parades. == Death and legacy == Painting of Davis in downtown Durham. Davis died of cancer on May 14, 2017. A visitation was held on June 2, 2017 at Fisher Memorial United Holy Church in Durham. A community celebration of his life was held the same day at the Hayti Heritage Center. The funeral was held on June 3, 2017 at Union Baptist Church in Durham. The legacy of Davis was honored at the 48th annual Bimb√© Festival and at the 82nd season of the American Dance Festival in 2017. In July 2019 Davis was posthumously inducted into the Wake County Public School System's Hall of Fame. Davis was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham on November 2, 2019.

It opened on 1 May 1876 and closed on 6 January 1964. The former station building is now a restaurant, which from 1984 to 1999 used a Mk 1 railway carriage as extra rooms. The latter is now restored and in use on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. When opened, the station had a single platform and a brick station building on the up side of the line. The building was of a typical North Eastern Railway design and similar to those at Bardsey, Thorner, and Collingham Bridge as well as at Garforth station. A long siding was located opposite to the platform, but there was no passing loop. The small goods yard with two sidings was located north of the station. One siding with a loop served the coal drops, the other a cattle dock. There was no goods shed or crane, only a parcels shed on the platform. The local brickworks, established in 1877 by Isaac Chippindale sr. close to the station, were a main freight customer, but were not permitted their own sidings and had to transport their products to the station by road. Upon doubling of the line in 1901, a second platform with a wooden waiting room was built, and a third goods siding added. In the 1950s the road bridge across the tracks south of the station was reconstructed. While the station closed to passengers on 6 January 1964, it remained open for goods until 27 April 1964. The stationmaster ran a coal sale as a private concern under licence from the railways. Following closure, the business continued from the former goods yard, and moved later to Garforth. It closed upon retirement of the last stationmaster in 1993. The station building was leased to an electrical contractor in the late 1960s and converted into a restaurant in 1979. ==ReferencesLines== Category:Disused railway stations in Leeds Category:Beeching closures in England Category:Former North Eastern Railway (UK) stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1876 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 ","title":"Scholes railway station"},{"id":"54105353","text":"Lassissi is an African surname that may refer to *Ismaila Lassissi (born 1969), Ivorian rugby union footballer *Saliou Lassissi (born 1978), Ivorian football defender ","title":"Lassissi"},{"id":"54105366","text":"Ethan Bear (born June 26, 1997) is a Cree Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Edmonton Oilers in the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== He was drafted in the fifth round in the 2015 Draft by the Edmonton Oilers and played for the Seattle Thunderbirds in the WHL.

On June 28th, 2017, the Raptors promoted assistant general manager Bobby Webster to general manager, while Masai Ujiri remained team president. Webster's promotion came over a month after their previous general manager, Jeff Weltman, left the Raptors to become the President of Basketball Operations for the Orlando Magic, with the Raptors acquiring a second-round pick in 2018 in order for them to release Weltman early. However they would later trade that selection, their first round pick, and DeMarre Carroll to the Brooklyn Nets for the rights to Justin Hamilton. On April 6th, 2018, the Raptors set new franchise records for total wins in a season with 57, home wins in a season with 33, and clinched the 1st seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time in franchise history. They would end the season with a record 59 wins and 34 home wins. They would end up winning their 4th division title in 5 years. In the playoffs, the Raptors faced the eighth seeded Washington Wizards in the first round, winning in six games. They advanced to the semifinals where they faced the Cleveland Cavaliers once again, the team that had eliminated them in the past two NBA playoffs. Just like last season, the Raptors were swept in four games by the Cavaliers. They have now lost 10 straight playoff games to the Cavaliers. This sweep marked the 1st time the top seeded conference team was swept in a playoff series since 2015, where the Atlanta Hawks were also swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals. The Raptors also became the first top seeded conference team since 2013 to have not advanced to the Conference Finals, and the first in NBA history to get swept in the Semifinals. Following yet another disappointing playoff appearance, head coach Dwane Casey was fired on May 11th, 2018\\\\. http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/11/report-toronto-raptors- fire-coach-dwane-casey ==Offseason== Draft { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" Round ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" Pick ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" Player ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" Position ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" Nationality ! style=\\"; width:10%;\\" College - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  1  23   SF   Indiana } ==RosterStandings== Division Conference Record vs opponents {  style=\\"font-size: 100%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=\\"5\\" FF9999;\\"Eastern Conference !colspan=\\"3\\" FF9999;\\"Western Conference - !colspan=\\"5\\" BBBBBB;\\"Atlantic Division !colspan=\\"3\\" BBBBBB;\\"Northwest Division - !colspan=\\"1\\"Team !colspan=\\"2\\"Home !colspan=\\"2\\"Away !colspan=\\"1\\"Team !colspan=\\"1\\"Home !colspan=\\"1\\"Away - !width=170 !width=90 !width=90 !width=90 !width=90 !width=170 !width=90 !width=90 - Boston  bfb;\\"  111‚Äì91  bfb;\\"  96‚Äì78  fbb;\\"  94‚Äì95  fbb;\\"  99‚Äì110 Denver  bfb;\\"  114‚Äì110  fbb;\\"  111‚Äì129 - Brooklyn  bfb;\\"  120‚Äì87  bfb;\\"  116‚Äì112  bfb;\\"  114‚Äì113*  bfb;\\"  116‚Äì102 Minnesota  bfb;\\"  109‚Äì104  fbb;\\"  109‚Äì115 - New York  bfb;\\"  107‚Äì84  bfb;\\"  113‚Äì88  fbb;\\"  100‚Äì108  bfb;\\"  132‚Äì106 Oklahoma City  fbb;\\"  125‚Äì132  fbb;\\"  107‚Äì124 - Philadelphia  bfb;\\"  128‚Äì94  bfb;\\"  102‚Äì86  bfb;\\"  114‚Äì109  fbb;\\"  111‚Äì117 Portland  bfb;\\"  130‚Äì105  bfb;\\"  99‚Äì85 -      Utah  fbb;\\"  93‚Äì97  bfb;\\"  109‚Äì100 - !colspan=\\"1\\" !colspan=\\"2\\"8‚Äì0 !colspan=\\"2\\"4‚Äì4 !colspan=\\"1\\" !colspan=\\"1\\"3‚Äì2 !colspan=\\"1\\"2‚Äì3 - !colspan=\\"1\\"Division !colspan=\\"4\\"12‚Äì4 !colspan=\\"1\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"5‚Äì5 - !colspan=\\"5\\" BBBBBB;\\"Central Division !colspan=\\"3\\" BBBBBB;\\"Pacific Division - !colspan=\\"1\\"Team !colspan=\\"2\\"Home !colspan=\\"2\\"Away !colspan=\\"1\\"Team !colspan=\\"1\\"Home !colspan=\\"1\\"Away - Chicago  bfb;\\"  117‚Äì100  bfb;\\"  119‚Äì114  bfb;\\"  124‚Äì115  bfb;\\"  122‚Äì98 Golden State  fbb;\\"  125‚Äì127  fbb;\\"  112‚Äì117 - Cleveland  bfb;\\"  133‚Äì99   fbb;\\"  129‚Äì132  fbb;\\"  106‚Äì112 L.A.

Language has been the inspiration for both her writing and her art. In her conceptual works - which include drawings, collages, artist books, photo/text works, installations and digital prints - she explores how text informs or changes our perception of images, often with more than a hint of humor and a philosophical bent. With dark humor, her books present characters at odds with themselves and others, sometimes in exotic locales. ==Early life== Roberta Allen is a New York-based artist who was born and raised in New York, NY. At age twenty, she traveled alone to Europe and lived briefly in Athens, Amsterdam and Berlin, later in Mexico. Over the years, she traveled, often alone, to the Peruvian Amazon, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, Mali and countries in Central America. ==Art career== Allen began as a painter living in Amsterdam where she had her first one-person gallery exhibition in 1967. After several one-person shows in New York, she joined John Weber Gallery in 1973 and had one-person exhibitions there in 1974, 75, 77, 79.Jules Heller, Nancy G. Heller (eds), \\"Roberta Allen\\", North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary (Garland Publishing, Incorporated, 1997) During this time, she also had one-person gallery exhibitions in Milan, Dusseldorf, Brussels, Munich and Rome. She had one-person museum exhibitions at MoMA P.S. 1, L.I.C., NY, 1977, 80; the Kunstforum, St√§dtische Galerie in Lenbachhaus, Munich, 1981,, a St√§dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus M√ºnchen and The Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Perth, Western Australia, 1989. Her conceptual works, which combine image and text, include drawings, collages, artist books,, Parasol Press Ltd. 1977 photo/text series and installations.

There is uncertainty about its classification - some sources include South Australia and Western Australia in its range. ==Description== Pterostylis nana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of egg-shaped to heart-shaped leaves, each leaf 5‚Äì20 mm long and 3‚Äì10 mm wide. A single bright green and white flower, 10‚Äì15 mm long and 4‚Äì5 mm wide is borne on a stalk 50‚Äì150 mm high. The dorsal sepal is erect, more or less flat on top and fused to the petals forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The lateral sepals are erect, in close contact with the galea and taper to a thread-like tip about 20 mm long. The sinus between the lateral sepals is more or less flat and has a dark green central area. The labellum is 3‚Äì5 mm long, about 2 mm wide, straight, blunt and hidden inside the flower. Flowering occurs from July to October. The State Herbarium of South Australia lists this species as being present in that state and in Western Australia. The Royal Botanic Garden Melbourne reports that the taxonomy of the species is \\"under investigation\\". ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis nana was first formally described in 1985 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. ==Distribution and habitat== The dwarf snail orchid grows in a range of habitats from coastal heath to forest, mostly in sheltered sites.

PlaySight was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies for consecutive years in both 2017 and 2018.https://www.sporttechie.com/playsight- partners-with-recently-retired-ana-ivanovic-as-tech-platform-continues- growth/https://www.fastcompany.com/company/playsight == Company history == In 2010, PlaySight was founded in Kfar Saba, Israel, using technology with roots in the Israeli military. After years developing weaponry and war simulators for the Israeli army and other defense clients, the three partners looked to apply their skills and knowledge to a new challenge. After one of the partners, Evgeni Khazanov, observed his daughter‚Äôs tennis practice, he wondered why a sport with so much money did not have any advanced technology to help players improve their game. It was from that idea that PlaySight was born. PlaySight has continued to grow through partnerships and investment from players in the tennis industry including Billie Jean King, Ana Ivanovic, Chris Evert, Pete Sampras, Novak Djokovic, Tommy Haas, Paul Annacone, and Darren Cahill. Other notable investors include Bill Ackman, Mark Ein, Dr. James Loehr, Gordon Uehling III, and George Mackin. Since the technology was commercialized in 2013, the technology has been adapted for numerous other sports including soccer, martial arts, volleyball, squash, handball, gymnastics, dancing, hockey and wrestling. So far, PlaySight has raised over $20 million and now has offices in Kfar Saba, New Jersey and Los Angeles. In June 2017, Verizon Ventures and golfer Greg Norman announced an $11 million investment in PlaySight to further SmartCourt expansion in tennis, basketball and other sports and to also introduce the technology to golf.https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellerossingh/2017/06/02/greg-norman- verizon-ventures-invest-11m-in-developing-smart-golf-course/#7175a5196a00 PlaySight installed its first SmartSchool in 2017.

PlaySight makes courts, gyms, fields and rinks 'Smart' by installing its software and connected camera technology. Once set up, SmartCourts provide several benefits to athletes, coaches, teams and fans, from automated HD broadcast live streaming and advanced coaching tools to instant replay video, VAR, and a content platform to store, manage and share video quickly and seamlessly.https://menafn.com/1098545939/College-of-DuPage- Becomes-First-NJCAA-Program-to-Adopt-PlaySights-Smart-Sports-AI-Technology For tennis, the technology uses image processing and analytical algorithms to track strokes, ball trajectory, player movement and shot speed and spin. PlaySight's SmartCourt system provides players and coaches instant multi-angle video and detailed statistics through the court side kiosk and on tablets and mobile devices. The cloud-based platform allows teams to live stream matches and stores all video from SmartCourt sessions for coaches and players to review later from any web enabled device.http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2017/06/entrepreneur-spotlight- chen-shachar,-founder-ceo-of-playsight/ In 2017, PlaySight unveiled its SmartField technology for soccer and also released its SmartTracker technology - an autonomous 4K camera that follows all on-court action automatically. == Automatic Production == PlaySight provides each of its clients with automatic production capabilities: automated live streaming and production tools, scoreboard integration and graphic overlays, as well as full tracking of games without the need for a cameraman or operator.https://playsight.com/automatic- production/https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/production/british-basketball- league-to-test-automated-tv-production/5134744.article == PlayFair and VAR == Cheating has become a prominent issue in tennis particularly on junior circuits where players call their own lines. PlaySight developed the idea of PlayFair Tournaments that use the line-calling feature of PlaySight's SmartCourt technology to tackle the cheating problem in tennis. These tournaments allow players to challenge close line calls and use the PlaySight court side kiosk to access video replay to confirm or overrule the call.

He has also undertaken work in education, public engagement, presenting demonstrations, and acting in The Crown television series. He graduated from Guy's and St Thomas' University of London medical school and was an anatomy demonstrator under Professor Harold Ellis CBE. He holds an Honorary Fellowship of The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (FRAS) and has won a number of scientific and surgical awards, including the Royal College of Surgeons of England Lister Essay Prize and Medal, The Royal College of Surgeons and Worshipful Company of Cutlers Medal, and The Royal Society of Medicine's Norman Tanner Medal. ==Early life and education== Pankaj Chandak was born in Akola, India and moved to the United Kingdom as a child. He received a Corporation of London Scholarship to City of London School, which he attended from 1993 to 1995. His form tutor was Dr Cook. He earned a BSc(Hons) and MBBS from Guy's, King's, and St Thomas' Medical School in 2001, and is noted to have gained M.R.C.S.Eng, FRAS, and FLS (Fellow of the Linnean Society). As a student, he worked on the clinicopathological correlation in paediatric cerebral malaria under Dr Richard Carr and Professor Terrie Taylor in African children, and presented at the 48th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Washington, 1999. ==Medical career== As of 2017, Chandak, is a Specialist Registrar in Transplant Surgery, at Guy's, St Thomas', and Great Ormond Street Hospitals under Professor Nizam Mamode and Professor Anthony Dorling at King's College London who supervise his research fellowship in the therapeutic manipulation of organs using machine perfusion technology and the use of 3D printing in complex transplant surgery. He simultaneously teaches at the Faculty of Surgical Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons of England and was Anatomy Demonstrator under Professor Ellis. Chandak planned the world's first integration of 3D printing into complex paediatric transplantation, for which he won the RSM's Norman Tanner Medal in 2016. Under media coverage, in 2015, a 3D printing of an adult-sized, living- donor kidney from a father was used by Chandak and his team to plan a kidney transplant into his daughter, who was two years old. This 3D kidney model has since been accepted by The Science Museum in London, for permanent exhibition in their new medical galleries which will open in 2019 Chandak's research in donor organ perfusion is also a topic in his public demonstrations. == Public engagement == Chandak has been involved in communicating science to broader audiences. This has included presenting live demonstrations for the BBC, Channel 5, the British Science Festival 2016, and London Open House. The main areas of his discussions focus on minimally invasive surgery, 3D printing and machine perfusion technology in organ transplantation.  The Crown television series  Chandak directed his transplant team and acted alongside them in Stephen Daldry's television series The Crown. The team performed a simulated operation, replicating the 1951 procedure of lung surgery on George VI, originally carried out by Sir Clement Price Thomas. This is believed to be the first time practicing doctors and surgeons have been directly employed as actors to ensure realism in a television production. It was filmed in a period set at Goldsmiths' Hall in London. The surgical model body of King George VI from the series is now used in the Gordon Museum of Pathology as an aid to surgical training for medical students.  3D printing and paediatric organ transplant  Involved with the British Science Association and its Science Festival, Chandak has promoted public engagement of science-inspired projects. In April 2017, Chandak performed live at The Royal Institution on modern-day surgery, 3D printing, perfusion machines, and antibody-suppressing drugs. He was invited to speak at The Royal Society on 3 July 2017 on the applications of 3D-printing to complex surgeries. He continues to lecture on 3D printing in transplantation.  BBC World Service, The Forum  Chandak was invited as one of the key speakers discussing the early history and future innovations of transplant surgery at the BBC World Service Forum in 2017. This programme was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Christiaan Barnard's world's first heart transplant.  Charity  In 2018, Chandak's project to form a choir of children who have had kidney transplants, secured funding from Children in Need. ==Awards== Chandak has been awarded prizes and lectures for his role in 3D printing in transplant surgery, including The Royal Society of Medicine Adrian Tanner Prize, 2013, The Royal College of Surgeons Lister Essay Prize and Medal 2014, The Royal College of Surgeons Ronald Raven Barbers Award 2015, and The Royal College of Surgeons Arnott Lecture and Medal, delivered at the British Transplantation Congress 2016. Chandak was awarded the annual trainee surgical prize for innovation in surgery, The Norman Tanner Medal, by the Royal Society of Medicine in 2016. As well as 3D printing in transplant surgery, he presented at this award session, outcomes in paediatric kidney transplantation surgery. In 2016, for applications, design, and innovation of surgical technology and instruments, Chandak described himself and his team as 'fortunate' to receive the Royal College of Surgeons and Worshipful Company of Cutlers' Medal and Cutlers' Prize 2016. In 2017, he received the inaugural International Paediatric Transplant Young Scholar Award which was presented in Barcelona at The International Paediatric Transplant Association. He has an interest in the history of medicine and has delivered lectures on Joseph Lister and the 'surgical journey from scalpels to robots'.

He was a committed political activist who became a stage and movie actor and, later, a Communist party official. He topped off his unusually varied career, between 1955 and 1960, as a senior director - ultimately General Director - of Interflug, the East German national airline. After this he served, between 1960 and 1965, as a junior Transport Minister. Arthur Pieck's father, Wilhelm Pieck, served as the President of East Germany between 1949 and 1960. == Life ==  Family provenance and early years  Arthur Heinrich Walter Pieck, the second of his parents' three recorded child, was born in Bremen where his father worked as a qualified carpenter and was active in local politics (SPD). Arthur Pieck's parents had married early the previous year: his mother, born Christine H√§fker, worked in the garment industry. His father was an active left wing member of the SPD and a consummate networker, as a result of which Arthur, while still a boy, could come into contact with stars of the contemporary socialist movement without leaving the family home. Visitors included Rosa Luxemburg along with K√§te and Hermann Duncker and Franz Mehring. He attended secondary school in Bremen and then, after the family relocated, in Berlin. Between April 1914 and January 1918 he trained for work as a typesetter.  War years  From an early age Arthur Pieck was also active politically. He was a leader in the Young Socialists in the Steglitz quarter of Berlin in 1914 and then for Greater Berlin from 1915. He joined the antiwar Spartacus League in 1916 which was the year in which he also joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD), a breakaway party formed by SPD members who found the SPD's parliamentary acquiescence in respect of war funding unacceptable. In 1917 he found himself arrested and indicted for \\"high treason\\" (... wegen \\"Hoch- und Landesverrats\\"). At the end of December 1917 he celebrated his eighteenth birthday by refusing to report for \\"military service\\": between February and November 1918 he lived in the Netherlands where the government had managed to avoid direct involvement in the fighting of the First World War An early appetite for journalism was apparent from his production of \\"Der Kampf\\" (\\"The Struggle\\"), a news sheet for German army deserters who had taken refuge in the Netherlands.  Post war political activism  War ended in November 1918 and Pieck immediately crossed the border back into Germany where political, social and economic chaos prevailed. He became a print worker for the Spartacus League. When the USPD, in turn, broke apart, Pieck was one of those participating in the Berlin meeting which took place between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919 which came to be celebrated as the founding conference of the Communist Party of Germany. January 1919 found him working as a type setter in the printing works of the newspaper \\"Vorw√§rts\\". He also became involved in the revolutionary uprising in Berlin. During the revolutionary months from February till the Autumn of 1919 he worked as a typesetter in a succession of illegal printing shops operated by or on behalf of the Communist Party, also serving as a courier for the party leadership. Between January and March 1920 he was detained in Berlin's Moabit Jail. In March 1920 Pieck took on leadership of the party news and information service in Berlin-Steglitz. At the same time he became the local leader for the party's Steglitz district. Between April 1920 and October 1921 he was employed in the party's publishing business. Between 1921 and 1925 he was a member of the Berlin leadership team for the party's news service. He was also employed, between October 1921 and October 1932 by the permanent (and always lavishly staffed) Soviet Trade Mission in Berlin, working first in the transport department and later in the agriculture department. In 1922 he became head of the Workers' Hiking Movement (\\"Arbeiterwanderbewegung\\"), initially in Berlin-Steglitz and later for the whole of Berlin. Organised hiking was, at the time, a more consciously politicised activity in Germany than in the United Kingdom or the United States. At the end of 1922 Pieck was a co-founder of the \\"Proletarian Lecture and Games Community, Steglitz\\" (\\"Proletar. Sprech- u. Spielgem. Steglitz\\"). In 1923 he became a member of the national leadership of the Friends of Natureworkers' hiking association, and in 1924 he took on leadership of the Berlin \\"Sprechchor\\" performing group. In June 1924 Pieck joined the German National Workers' Theatre Group (\\"Arbeiter-Theater-Bund Deutschlands\\" / ATBD) and in 1925/27 he became head of the \\"Red Shirts\\" Berlin Agitprop performance group. In 1927 he also took over leadership of the ATBD for Berlin, becoming Senior Chairman of the group nationally between 1928 and 1932. In 1929 he co- founded the International Workers Theatre Association (\\"Internat. Arbeitertheater-Bund\\" / IATB ), renamed IRTB in 1932 in order to include the adjective \\"revolutionary\\" in the title. He was a member of the presidium of this association till 1938 and head of its West European section (based, at least notionally in Berlin) from 1932.  Nazi years  It seems likely that the IRTB and some or all of these organisations were inspired and possibly financially backed by Moscow. Between 1932 and 1938 Pieck was also a permanent member of the IRTB in Moscow. During 1932, as the Nazi surge in Germany became unstoppable, he appears to have relocated from Berlin to Moscow where during 1932 he studied at the International Lenin School, Between December 1932 and February 1933, the months which covered the Nazi power seizure, Pieck was back in Berlin. From 14 February 1933 till 1934 he was director of the Kolonne Links (\\"Left Column\\") German Agitprop theatre troupe. The German government had lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship, and especially following the Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933, had pursued activist members of the (now illegal) Communist Party of Germany with particular savagery. It is therefore not surprising that sources are unclear over how much time Pieck and other members of the Kolonne Links group spent in Germany and how much time they spent as members of the growing population of German political exiles in Moscow, during 1933 and the years that followed. During May/June 1933 Arthur Pieck headed up the organising committee for the First International Olympiade at the Moscow Review Theatre. From 1934 he worked as an editor with the \\"News sheet for Theatre, Music, Film and Dance\\" (\\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Theater, Musik, Film, Tanz\\") which was the principal publication of the International Revolutionary Theatre Association (IRTB). Between 1935 and 1938 he undertook a considerable amount of overseas travel on behalf of the IRTB. In 1936 he traveled with Erwin Piscator to Paris. Paris, like Moscow, was becoming an informal headquarters location for the German Communist Party in exile. Their objective in Paris - at least as far as Pieck and party comrades in Moscow were concerned - was to set up and develop a western European branch office of the IRTB. However, the project fizzled out when the Germans learned that Piscator was in danger of falling victim to the dictator's paranoia if he returned to Moscow. Piscator stayed in Paris, emigrating to the United States three years later, while Arthur Pieck appears quietly to have returned to Moscow.  Personal setbacks  By 1936 the Piecks had made their home in Moscow, and it was in nearby Podlipiki that at the end of August Arthur Pieck's mother, Christine, who was staying with Arthur's elder sister Elly Winter, fell ill with a serious lung disease. She died on 1 December 1936 at the Kremlin Clinic in Moscow. It was only twenty years later, on 29 December 1956, that her ashes were transferred to Germany and interred in the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery. Meanwhile, in another personal blow, the German government removed Arthur Pieck's German citizenship on 24 March 1937, leaving him prima facie stateless.  War years  Between May 1938 and June 1941 Pieck worked in the Moscow press office of the Comintern. At the start of 1941, as the German government prepared to tear up their non- aggression pact with the Soviet Union and launch an invasion, Arthur Pieck's name was added to the Gestapo's \\"special USSR list\\" of people in the Soviet Union to be sought out and dealt with as a priority. Between 8 July 1941 and May 1945 he served as a Senior Policy Commissar (\\"Oberpolitkommissar\\") and Captain (\\"Hauptmann\\") with the Central Administration (\\"Hauptverwaltung\\") of the Red Army. The focus of his work, as previously, was on propaganda, now working on the military frontline and, increasingly, among German prisoners of war in the internment camps. In December 1941 he was teamed up with Walter Ulbricht and the two of them were sent to work at the prisoner of war encampment at Spaskij Zavod near Karaganda in Kazakhstan. In Summer 1942 he was undertaking propaganda work on the Caucasus Front. From the end of November 1942 till January 1943 he was producing the German language newspaper \\"Neuste Nachrichten\\" (\\"Latest News\\") on the Stalingrad Front, activity for which he was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War medal. During 1943 he organised preparation for the launch of the National Committee for a Free Germany (\\"Nationalkomitee Freies Deutschland\\" / NKFD). War ended, formally, in May 1945. By that time Arthur Pieck had returned with the Red army the previous month to what remained of Berlin.  Soviet Occupation Zone  The victorious nations had already agreed that the western two thirds of Germany should be divided into military occupation zones. A large part of the country surrounding Berlin, including the eastern part of the city itself, was to be administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Pieck's years in the Soviet Union had left him genuinely bilingual, and as he entered Berlin as a Soviet officer in the 5th Shock Army, he was working as a simultaneous translator, assigned to Nikolai Berzarin, who later became city commander of Berlin. He was formally demobilised on 16 May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war. In November 1945 Arthur Pieck married Margarete \\"Grete\\" Lode (1902‚Äì1952), a friend from his IRTB days as an organiser of Agitprop stage shows whom he had known since 1929 or earlier. A succession of well regarded and lucrative jobs followed. In December 1945 he became a member of the Berlin Magistrat (city administration) and Stadtrat (councillor) for personnel and administration matters (\\"Stadtrat f√ºr Personal und Verwaltung\\"), one of the most influential departments of the city administration. In April 1946 he was one of the delegates at the \\"unification party congress\\" at which, under circumstances that would remain contentious, the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), a new united left wing party, was established to ensure that divisions on the political left should never again open the way for a takeover of the state by right wing nationalists. Ironically, by the time, in October 1949, when the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the SED would itself have become the apparently permanent ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship. In 1946 Arthur Pieck was formally acknowledged to have been a victim of fascism. Between March and June 1947 he was employed by the Economics Department of the important party Central Executive (forerunner of the party Central Committee). From 16 June 1947 till 15 October 1949 he served as National Department head of Personnel and Administration for the German Economic Commission (\\"Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission\\" / DWK)). A further senior government job in personnel and training followed between 1949 and 1955. Arthur Pieck gained that position on 16 October 1949, just five days after his father was elected the first (and as matters would turn out only) President of the new German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  Airline boss  With the division of Germany after 1949 looking increasingly permanent, there were practical and legal disputes over which Germany should inherit those German brand names from before the war that still conferred value in the eyes of consumers. One particularly bitter dispute concerned the BMW brand. Another concerned the national airline, known till 1945 as Deutsche Luft Hansa. Directly after the end of the Second World War, one thing on which the Soviet Union and the United States were able to agree was that no new German state should be permitted to operate an airline. The military implications of a German state having access to a permanent pool of trained pilots and air industry expertise were uppermost in the minds of politicians. However, geo-political priorities moved on, and in 1953 Lufthansa was founded, a West German airline with its primary hub reassuringly located next door to a massive US airbase south of Frankfurt am Main. In 1955 the East German government responded, staking a claim to the \\"Lufthansa\\" brand by creating Deutsche Lufthansa. Since the Lufthansa name had already been registered by the West German airline, the East German entity faced a succession of lawsuits and was, in the meantime, not able to register as a member of the International Air Transport Association. Eventually it would be rebranded as Interflug. In the meantime, reflecting the intensely political nature of the airline business, when Deutsche Lufthansa was created in 1955 it made sense that its Director in Chief should be the son of the aging East German President. On 1 July 1955 Arthur Pieck, who had no experience of flying or of the airline business, was appointed \\"Hauptdirektor\\" of the national airline.  Final years  President Wilhelm Pieck faded away and then, in September 1960, died. Arthur Pieck was close to his father both personally and in terms of his career: he was under no illusion that his career as a top airline executive would long outlive his father. It did not, and he went into semi-retirement. One or two less onerous appointments nevertheless still lay ahead. On 1 January 1961 he was appointed a Deputy Minister for Transport. On 15 March 1961 he was appointed Head of the Civil Aviation Board. He became a member of the East German delegation to the Standing Transport Commission of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (\\"Comecon\\"). He was also a member of the Committee of Antifascist Resistance Fighters. In May 1965 Arthur Pieck went into full retirement at his own wish. He died in Berlin slightly less than five years later. == Awards and honours == * 1955 Patriotic Order of Merit in silver * 1957 Ernst Moritz Arndt Medal * 1959 Banner of Labor * 1960 Banner of Labor * 1964 Patriotic Order of Merit in gold * 1969 Patriotic Order of Merit gold clasp ==References== Category:People from Bremen Category:German translators Category:Refugees from Nazi Germany in the Soviet Union Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Category:Aviation in East Germany Category:1899 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century translators ","title":"Arthur Pieck"},{"id":"54106281","text":"Mwana is an African name.

The area has been informally referred to as the \\"triangle of fear\\" (French: triangle de la peur). The crimes took place between 22 August 1984 and 2 April 2005. Although the police have solved some of the murders, they are unsure of whether the remaining unsolved cases are coincidences or the work of one or more serial killers. == The victims == All known victims were females aged between 13 and 37 who disappeared suddenly in the d√©partement of Sa√¥ne-et- Loire in east-central France, all along a 200 km stretch of the A6 in a \\"triangle of fear\\" between M√¢con, Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne and Montceau-les-Mines. Christelle Maillery Christelle Maillery was murdered in December 1986 and was the fourth woman to disappear. In 1990, the examining magistrate ruled that her case would be closed. According to French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, evidence such as the \\"victim's clothes, jewelry and a knife\\" that were found 200 meters from the crime scene were destroyed by the forensics unit of the tribunal de grande instance (roughly equivalent to a Crown Court) in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne. No progress was made in the case until 2003, when a private detective working for the Association Christelle obtained the witness testimony of Christelle's ex-boyfriend, reinvigorating the case. The boyfriend stated that after the murder, a man named Jean-Pierre Mura offered him 300 euros in \\"compensation\\" for the death of his girlfriend. The boyfriend found this unbelievable and so never reported it. Following the murder of Christelle Maillery in 1986, the support group Association Christelle was formed, and now comprises 11 member families. The group stated that its aim is to provide support to families victims of criminal violence. Carole Soltysiak The seventh person to disappear was 13-year-old Carole Soltysiak. Hunters discovered her naked and partially burned body in a forest near Montceau-les- Mines. According to the Gazette de C√¥te-d'Or newspaper, \\"She had been stabbed four times in the chest. However, evidence suggests that strangulation may be the true cause of death\\". The autopsy revealed that she had been intoxicated before being assaulted. Isolated traces of sperm were found on her body. The sperm however contained no spermatozoa, meaning her attacker was infertile. The DNA was neither a match to serial killer Francis Heaulme nor to two other suspects who were known to be in the area at the time. Virginie Bluzet The ninth victim was Virginie Bluzet, a 21-year-old from Beaune who disappeared in February 1997, a few months after Christelle Bl√©try. Bluzet's body was found on 17 March 1997 on the banks of the river Sa√¥ne in Verdun-sur- le-Doubs, having spent five weeks in the water. She had been found bound and gagged, and her head had been covered by a pillow. The investigation into her death was relaunched in February 2010, following advances in forensic technology. Dijon police had investigated Bluzet's boyfriend, but the magistrate closed this line of inquiry on 6 November 2002 due to a lack of evidence. Michel Bluzet, Virginie's father, stated: \\"A spot of blood was found on the gag, and despite all the years that have passed, we know that more evidence can be found; I've got my fingers crossed.\\" Vanessa Theillon The body of 17-year-old apprentice chef Vanessa Theillon was found in 1999, on the banks of the Sa√¥ne in M√¢con. She had been violently beaten and had died from an overdose. She did not appear to have been sexually assaulted. Anne- Sophie Girollet 20-year-old medical student Anne-Sophie Girollet disappeared on 19 March 2005, after a dance gala in M√¢con. Girollet obtained her baccalaur√©at at 17 and was already in her third year at medical school in Lyon. Her body was found floating in the Sa√¥ne on 2 April that year, near a bridge in M√¢con. The medical examiners concluded that she had been sexually assaulted before being strangled, suffocating as a result of being stabbed in the chest. == Convictions ==  Jacky Martin: Anne-Sophie Girollet  Jacky Martin, a man who was already on the FNAEG (France's DNA database) due to convictions for violent crimes, theft and handling stolen vehicles, was arrested in 2012 after his car, a Peugeot 405 registered to the Rh√¥ne d√©partement (where Lyon is located), was fished from the Sa√¥ne and found to contain genetic traces of Anne-Sophie Girollet. Martin was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment (to serve a minimum of 20 years before being considered for parole) for the abduction and murder of Anne-Sophie Girollet. He has appealed the verdict.  Jean-Pierre Mura: Christelle Maillery  The judicial inquiry into Christelle Maillery's murder was officially reopened in 2005. Jean-Pierre Mura, then aged 44, was arrested and questioned. Dozens of knives were discovered at his home. Their blades were compared to the blade of the knife found at the crime scene (the knife itself had been destroyed, but photographs of it still existed). \\"The blades seized and the blade in the photograph had been sharpened by the same grinder and by the same person or persons.\\" The expert's report highlighted \\"four common points featuring sharpening marks\\" that had been made by the grinder, similar to the manner in which ballistics experts compare traces that a bullet leaves the barrel of the gun from which it is fired. These facts, as well as witness statements, led to the magistrate charging the suspect with murder (known in French law as \\"voluntary homicide\\") on 15 December 2011. He was held on remand at the prison in Varennes-le-Grand. Before his arrest by the Dijon Judicial Police, Mura had been held in a psychiatric hospital near Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne. At the request of a close relative and on medical advice, he had been detained under mental health legislation at a hospital in Sevrey by way of a decree from the prefect of the d√©partement. In December 1986, Mura, then a 19-year-old metalworker from the nearby town of Le Creusot, was already a father to a young daughter. He spent most of his time loitering around an impoverished block of flats called Les Charmilles, near the council estate where Christelle Maillery lived. As a teenager, Mura had taken part in burglaries from basements of properties on the estate. He was also known to take drugs and drink a lot of alcohol. Mura was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by the Court of Assizes in Chalon-sur- Sa√¥ne. He appealed the sentence to the Court of Appeal in Dijon, but this court agreed with the original sentence handed down, despite believing that Mura was showing early stages of schizophrenia when he committed the murder. == References == Category:1980s missing person cases Category:1990s missing person cases Category:2000s missing person cases Category:Murdered French children Category:French murder victims ","title":"A6 disappearances"},{"id":"54106411","text":"The canton of Meine au Saintois is an administrative division of the Meurthe- et-Moselle department, northeastern France.

Pasokification is the decline of centre-left social-democratic political parties in European countries and several other Western countries during the 2010s, often accompanied by the rise of nationalist, left-wing and right-wing populist alternatives. In Europe, the share of vote for such parties was at its lowest for 70 years in 2015. The term originates from the Greek party PASOK, which saw a declining share of the vote in national elections‚Äì‚Äìfrom 43.9% in 2009 to 13.2% in May 2012, to 12.3% in June 2012 and 4.7% in 2015‚Äì‚Äìdue to its poor handling of the Greek government-debt crisis and implementation of harsh austerity measures. At the same time, the left-wing anti-austerity Syriza saw a growth in vote share and influence. Since PASOK's decline, it has been applied to similar such declines for numerous other social democratic and Third Way parties. == Overview == Examples of Pasokification include the following countries: * France, where the Socialist Party candidate Beno√Æt Hamon received 6.4% of the vote, placing fifth in the first round of the 2017 presidential election‚Äì‚Äìdown from 28.6% in the 2012 when the party's candidate Fran√ßois Hollande was eventually elected president. In November 2016, Hollande's approval rating was 4%. * Germany, where the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) dramatically fell from 34.2% of the vote in 2005 to 23.0% in 2009: the lowest support for the SPD in post-World War II history. It was further reduced to 20.5% in the 2017 federal election and to 15.8% in the 2019 European Parliament election. This decline has been attributed to its acceptance of Third Way and neoliberal policies as well as coinciding with a series of grand coalitions with the CDU/CSU (2005‚Äì2009; 2013‚Äìpresent). * Greece, where PASOK was once the dominant centre-left party in Greece. PASOK received just 4.8% and 6.3% of the vote in the January 2015 and September 2015 legislative elections due to its enforcement of harsh austerity measures that led to massive social unrest and economic collapse, with much of its former electorate going to the anti-austerity Syriza. Following a series of austerity and bailouts packages, implemented despite rejection in a referendum, that resulted in several splits within the party, Syriza was defeated in the 2019 legislative election while the social democratic alliance KINAL rebounded to 8.10% and gained five seats. * Iceland, where the Social Democratic Alliance received 5.7% of the vote in the 2016 parliamentary election, down from 29.8% in the 2009 parliamentary election. This is their lowest support in any election since the main predecessor of the alliance, namely the Social Democratic Party, first ran for election in August 1916. While the Social Democratic Alliance lost support during the 2016 election, the Left-Green Movement increased its vote share by 5%, becoming the second largest party in Iceland's Althing. * Ireland, where the Labour Party received 6.6% of the vote in the 2016 general election, falling from 33 to 7 seats, their worst result since the 1987 general election and down from 19.5% in the 2011 general election. In the 2020 general election, the party achieved its worst result ever with 4.4% of the vote while the left-wing Sinn F√©in became the most voted party since the 1922 general election. * Italy, where the Democratic Party gained 18.8% of the vote in the 2018 general election, the lowest result for the Italian centre-left. The decline was particularly dramatic considering that just four years before the party received more than 40% of vote in the European Parliament election. Its drastic decline is commonly attributed to its enforcement of austerity measures, a poor economic recovery and a failed attempt to move towards a two-party system in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum. * Luxembourg, where the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party received 20.2% of the vote in the 2013 general election, their lowest support since the 1931 general election. Nonetheless, it took part in several government coalitions since the 2004 general election, the first time since the 1984 general election their share of votes went up. It further went down 2.68% to 17.60% in the 2018 Luxembourg general election, ranking third for number of seats for the first time since the 1999 general election. * Netherlands, where the social democratic Labour Party received 5.7% of the vote in the 2017 Dutch general election, down from 24.8% in the 2012 general election. * Spain, where the 2015 general election resulted in the worst electoral results for the social democratic Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) since the re-establishment of democracy in 1977 as the party received 22% of the vote, losing support to Unidas Podemos. Following the 2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy, the PSOE returned to government. In the April 2019 general election, the PSOE became the largest party since 2008 and obtained its best result since 2011 with 28.7% of the vote. * Sweden, where the 2018 general election resulted in the Swedish Social Democratic Party's lowest level of support since the 1908 general election, with 28.3% of the vote. * Austria, where the Social Democratic Party of Austria lost 5.7 percentage points in the 2019 Austrian legislative election resulting in a share of 21.2%, the party's worst result in a parliamentary election since the Second World War. * Hungary, where he Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) lost significant support in 2010 after a series of corruption scandals affected Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny's government, and has suffered defeats again in 2014 and 2018, falling from 29 to 16 seats in the latter. == Countries ==  France  The Socialist Party has suffered a significant decline after winning the 2012 presidential election. In the 2015 French regional elections, it became the third largest party by vote-share during first round, having previously placed either first or second. In the 2017 presidential election, the Socialist Party's candidate Beno√Æt Hamon suffered a historically poor result, placing fifth with just 6.4% of the vote. The Socialist Party suffered the worst losses of any party in the 2017 legislative election, with the Socialist Party-led centre-left faction receiving just 9.5% of the vote during the first round, winning only 45 seats overall.\\"Montebourg: \\"Le PS est sur la route du Pasok grec\\". In the 2019 European Parliament election, the party allied with a number of minor centre- left parties, but nonetheless suffered major losses. In sixth place, it became the smallest list to win seats, taking only 6.2% of the vote, a decline of 10.7% from 2014. It was surpassed by both Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens and the left-wing populist movement of La France Insoumise.  Germany  Support for the Social Democratic Party started to fade away by the late 2000s (in the 2009 federal election, it achieved just 23% of the votes). The party achieved its worst national result since 1890 in the 2017 federal election, winning just 20.5% of the vote. After the party entered into a grand coalition government with Angela Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, the third since 2005, it suffered a string of electoral setbacks at the Bavarian and Hessian state elections in 2018, losing its status as the second-largest party in each state. The SPD won just 15.8% of the vote in the 2019 European election, falling to third place in a national election for the first time in its history, behind the CDU and the Greens.  Italy  The Democratic Party started to lose support by late 2000s in the Po Valley. First elections when Democratic Party lost to more radical party were 2010 Venetian regional election (20.34 per cent vs 35.16 per cent obtained by Lega Nord). The party lost 185 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 58 seats in the Senate in the 2018 general election, falling from the largest to the third largest faction in the Italian parliament, although the party still came in second place in terms of popular vote.Sondaggi elettorali, continua la crescita del Pd: superato il Movimento 5 Stelle However, the PD entered government in September 2019 with the Five Star Movement after the collapse of the previous M5S‚ÄìLega government.  Netherlands  The Labour Party lost significant support in the 2017 general election with vote share falling from 25% (in the previous election) to 6%.  Sweden  The Swedish Social Democratic Party from the mid-1930s to mid-1980s in half of all general elections got between 44.6% and 46.2% (averaging 45.3%) of the votes, making it one of the most successful political parties in the history of the liberal democratic world.G√∂ran Therborn, \\"A Unique Chapter in the History of Democracy: The Swedish Social Democrats\\", in. K. Misgeld et al (eds.), Creating Social Democracy, University Park Pa., Penn State University Press, 1996 In the late 1990s, the party began to receive just under 40% of the votes. However, after the elections of 2010, their vote share dramatically declined, some of these votes being lost to the right-wing populist party Sweden Democrats. In the 2018 Swedish general election, the Social Democrats' only reached 28.3% support, its lowest level since 1908.  United Kingdom  The Scottish Labour Party held the majority of Scotland's Westminster seats from the 1964 general election until the 2015 general election, where the Scottish National Party won 56 of the 59 seats in 2015 and then 35 of the 59 seats at the 2017 general election. The national Labour Party has responded to the decline of centre-left political parties across Europe by turning to the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn in order to remain relevant in European politics. Corbyn's leadership has been characterized as more left-wing than that of his predecessors of the New Labour era. On the other hand, the Scottish Labour Party had lost support since the creation of the Scottish Parliament (in the 1999 election, the party got 33.6% of votes, while in 2016 it got 19.1%). That allowed the Scottish National Party to overtake the Scottish Labour Party by 2007. == Outside of Europe ==  Israel  The Israeli Labor Party and its predecessor Mapai were dominant in Israeli politics from the founding of the nation in 1948 to 1977. Since then, however, it has declined and currently only holds 6 seats after receiving 4,43% of the vote in the April 2019 Israeli legislative election.  Sri Lanka  The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which lost the 2015 presidential election to Sri Lanka Freedom Party defector Maithripala Sirisena, who campaigned on a broad alliance lead by the United National Party against the decade long rule of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, who faced allegations of corruption and nepotism. The following 2015 parliamentary election saw the formation of a national government, that soon faced major infighting. Rajapaksa went on to form a new party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and successfully contested several local government elections gaining 40.47% and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party only gaining 12.10%, along with the United National Party gaining 29.42%. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna nominated Rajapaksa's younger brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the 2019 presidential election, who gained 52.25% against the United National Party candidate Sajith Premadasa who gained 41.99%. Gotabaya Rajapaksa contested on a pro- nationalistic, economic development and national security platform. Sri Lanka Freedom Party which had hope to have its own candidate for the presidential election, eventually opted to support Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and its Rajapaksa. == References == Category:PASOK Category:Politics of Greece Category:Politics of the European Union Category:Social democracy ","title":"Pasokification"},{"id":"54106552","text":"Gangnapur is a census town in the Ranaghat II CD block in the Ranaghat subdivision of the Nadia district in the state of West Bengal, India. ==Geography== Location Gangnapur is located at Area overview Nadia district is mostly alluvial plains lying to the east of Hooghly River, locally known as Bhagirathi.

The final was played at the Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan, between English sides Chelsea and Arsenal ‚Äì which was the first Europa League final to feature two teams from one city. Chelsea defeated Arsenal 4‚Äì1 and have earned the right to play against Liverpool, the winners of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League, in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup. As winners, Chelsea would also have been qualified for the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Champions League group stage; however, since they had already qualified after finishing third in the Premier League, the berth reserved was given to the third-placed team of the 2018‚Äì19 Ligue 1 (Lyon) ‚Äì the 5th-ranked association according to next season's access list. For the first time, the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used in the competition, where it was implemented in the final. As the title holders of the Europa League, Atl√©tico Madrid qualified for the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League, although they had already qualified before the final through their league performance. They were unable to defend their title as they advanced to the Champions League knockout stage. ==Format changes== On 9 December 2016, UEFA confirmed the reforming plan for the UEFA Champions League for the 2018‚Äì2021 cycle, which was announced on 26 August 2016. As per the new regulations, all teams that are eliminated in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds will get a second chance in the Europa League. ==Association team allocation== A total of 213 teams from all 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League. The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1‚Äì51 (except Liechtenstein) each had three teams qualify. *Associations 52‚Äì54 each had two teams qualify. *Liechtenstein and Kosovo (association 55) each had one team qualify (Liechtenstein organised only a domestic cup and no domestic league; Kosovo as per decision by the UEFA Executive Committee). *Moreover, 55 teams eliminated from the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League were transferred to the Europa League (default number was 57, but 2 fewer teams competed in the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League). Association ranking For the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2017 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2012‚Äì13 to 2016‚Äì17. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: * ‚Äì Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League { +Association ranking for 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League -valign=top style=\\"font-size:90%\\"  {  - !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes - !1  align=right104.998 align=center rowspan=\\"19\\"3  - !2  align=right79.498  - !3  align=right75.962  - !4  align=right73.332  - !5  align=right56.665  - !6  align=right50.532  - !7  align=right49.332  - !8  align=right42.633  - !9  align=right42.400  - !10  align=right39.200  - !11  align=right33.175  - !12  align=right32.075  - !13  align=right31.063  - !14  align=right27.900  - !15  align=right25.350  - !16  align=right25.250  - !17  align=right24.350  - !18  align=right24.000  - !19  align=right19.875  }  {  - !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes - !20  align=right19.750 align=center rowspan=\\"12\\"3  - !21  align=right19.725  - !22  align=right19.375  - !23  align=right18.925  - !24  align=right18.550  - !25  align=right18.325  - !26  align=right17.750  - !27  align=right15.875  - !28  align=right15.375  - !29  align=right15.250  - !30  align=right13.125  - !31  align=right11.750  - !32  align=right11.000 align=center1  - !33  align=right9.500 align=center rowspan=\\"5\\"3  - !34  align=right9.500  - !35  align=right8.375  - !36  align=right7.650  - !37  align=right6.625  }  {  - !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes - !38  align=right6.575 align=center rowspan=\\"14\\"3  - !39  align=right6.500  - !40  align=right6.375  - !41  align=right6.125  - !42  align=right5.625  - !43  align=right5.250  - !44  align=right5.250  - !45  align=right5.125  - !46  align=right4.875  - !47  align=right4.500  - !48  align=right4.125  - !49  align=right4.000  - !50  align=right3.875  - !51  align=right3.500  - !52  align=right2.500 align=center rowspan=\\"3\\"2  - !53  align=right1.165  - !54  align=right0.333  - !55  align=right0.000 align=center1  } } Distribution In the default access list, originally 17 losers from the Champions League first qualifying round were transferred to the Europa League second qualifying round (Champions Path). However, one fewer loser would be transferred since the Champions League title holders already qualified for the group stage via their domestic league. Therefore, only 19 teams entered the Champions Path second qualifying round (one of the losers from the Champions League first qualifying round would be drawn to receive a bye to the third qualifying round). In addition, originally three losers from the Champions League second qualifying round (League Path) were transferred to the Europa League third qualifying round (Main Path). However, one fewer loser would be transferred since the Europa League title holders already qualified for the group stage via their domestic league. As a result, the following changes to the access list was made: *The cup winners of association 18 (Denmark) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. *The cup winners of association 25 (Norway) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round. *The cup winners of associations 50 and 51 (Wales and Faroe Islands) entered the first qualifying round instead of the preliminary round. {  +Access list for 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League - !colspan=\\"2\\" !Teams entering in this round !Teams advancing from previous round !Teams transferred from Champions League - !colspan=\\"2\\"Preliminary round (14 teams)  *4 domestic cup winners from associations 52‚Äì55 *6 domestic league runners-up from associations 49‚Äì54 *4 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 48‚Äì51   - !colspan=\\"2\\"First qualifying round (94 teams)  *26 domestic cup winners from associations 26‚Äì51 *30 domestic league runners-up from associations 18‚Äì48 (except Liechtenstein) *31 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 16‚Äì47 (except Liechtenstein)  *7 winners from preliminary round  - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Second qualifying round !Champions Path (19 teams)    *16 losers from Champions League first qualifying round *3 losers from Champions League preliminary round - !Main Path (74 teams)  *7 domestic cup winners from associations 19‚Äì25 *2 domestic league runners-up from associations 16‚Äì17 *3 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 13‚Äì15 *9 domestic league fourth-placed teams from associations 7‚Äì15 *2 domestic league fifth-placed teams from associations 5‚Äì6 (League Cup winners for France) *4 domestic league sixth-placed teams from associations 1‚Äì4 (League Cup winners for England)  *47 winners from first qualifying round  - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Third qualifying round !Champions Path (20 teams)   *10 winners from second qualifying round (Champions Path)  *10 losers from Champions League second qualifying round (Champions Path) - !Main Path (52 teams)  *6 domestic cup winners from associations 13‚Äì18 *6 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 7‚Äì12 *1 domestic league fourth- placed team from association 6  *37 winners from second qualifying round (Main Path)  *2 losers from Champions League second qualifying round (League Path) - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Play-off round !Champions Path (16 teams)   *10 winners from third qualifying round (Champions Path)  *6 losers from Champions League third qualifying round (Champions Path) - !Main Path (26 teams)   *26 winners from third qualifying round (Main Path)  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Group stage (48 teams)  *12 domestic cup winners from associations 1‚Äì12 *1 domestic league fourth-placed team from association 5 *4 domestic league fifth-placed teams from associations 1‚Äì4  *8 winners from play-off round (Champions Path) *13 winners from play-off round (Main Path)  *4 losers from Champions League play-off round (Champions Path) *2 losers from Champions League play-off round (League Path) *4 losers from Champions League third qualifying round (League Path) - !colspan=\\"2\\"Knockout phase (32 teams)   *12 group winners from group stage *12 group runners-up from group stage  *8 third-placed teams from Champions League group stage } Redistribution rules A Europa League place was vacated when a team qualified for both the Champions League and the Europa League, or qualified for the Europa League by more than one method. When a place was vacated, it was redistributed within the national association by the following rules: *When the domestic cup winners (considered as the \\"highest-placed\\" qualifier within the national association with the latest starting round) also qualified for the Champions League, their Europa League place was vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions qualified for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finished above them in the league moving up one \\"place\\". *When the domestic cup winners also qualified for the Europa League through league position, their place through the league position was vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions qualified for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finished above them in the league moving up one \\"place\\" if possible. *For associations where a Europa League place was reserved for either the League Cup or end-of-season European competition play-offs winners, they always qualified for the Europa League as the \\"lowest-placed\\" qualifier. If the League Cup winners had already qualified for European competitions through other methods, this reserved Europa League place was taken by the highest-placed team in the league which had not yet qualified for European competitions.

Ferry House is a private house located at 514 Lafayette Street in Grand Haven, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== This house was constructed in 1871 or 1871-72 by or for Phillip Wooley, about whom little is known. However, Wooley apparently never lived in the house, as he sold it to Edward Payson Ferry in June 1872. Ferry was born in 1837 in Grand Haven, the son of Rev. William M. Ferry, who participated in the platting of Grand Haven and was one of its first settlers. William Ferry was involved in a range of Grand Haven enterprises, including stores, banking, shipping, shipbuilding, land speculation, and lumbering. William's sons, including Edward, were often partners in his ventures. Specifically, William and Edward Ferry partnered with George E. Dowling to found Ferry, Dowling & Co. This firm platted the nearby village of Montague, Michigan in 1865; the town became a bustling lumbering center in the 1870s. After the elder Ferry's death in 1867, Edward Ferry inherited shares in his father's businesses, including the lumbering business of Ferry & Son managed by Edward's brother (and later US Senator) Thomas W. Ferry. Edward Ferry continued as one of Grand Haven's most prominent businessmen through the 1870s and into the 1880s. In the mid-1880s, as the lumber business sagged, Ferry moved from this house to Wisconsin, and later to Park City, Utah to take up silver mining. Ferry sold the house in Grand Haven in 1885. ==Description== The Edward P. Ferry House is a narrow-front two-story Italianate structure with a hip roof on a brick foundation. The exterior has fanciful, Italian- inspired detailing about the main cornice, the west-side bay window, and the doorway and window openings. These details were likely added by Ferry some time after the house was constructed. The windows have round heads, and the front entrance is a double door arrangement with large panels of frosted glass in each door. On the interior, the first floor is a side hall plan, with a high-ceilinged stair hall in the corner. Off the side hall are a front parlor and a dining room. Both rooms have plaster ceilings with heavy molded cornices and a central rectangular panel and marble mantlepieces. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1871 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Grand Haven, Michigan ","title":"Edward P.

In the making of the breed, the purpose was to produce a hardy sheep that could produce a reasonable amount of meat being primarily grassfed, while it could be used for recreational purposes, landscaping and vegetation management. It is expected that eves in springtime may wean-off 2 lambs, in 6-8 months, with a slaughter weight of 20-28 kg. == The story of the S√•ne-sheep == The breeding began in 1971 in the little place called S√•ne, at Esrum Lake, in the northern part of Zealand. To start with, Shropshire sheep were crossed with Karakul sheep. The shropshire contributed with its size, plus the fact, that the shropshire is known for not eating twigs and bark of trees and shrubs, unlike most other sheep breeds, a feature that is somewhat preserved in the S√•ne-sheep. The Karakul sheep contributed with its good health qualities, its moderation and coat color. Since then, the norvegian Rygja sheep was added to increase stomach capacity, in order for it to better absorb large amounts of lean diet, and to a lesser extent to improve wool quality. The breed was officially approved in 1991. Since then the Suffolk-sheep, to a lesser extent, has been used in an attempt to reduce and prevent inbreeding. However, not all breeders recognize animals with Suffolk blood as being pure-blooded. == Characteristics == The head of the S√•ne-sheep, is be black and likewise the hoofs. The lambs are born with black fur, which, however, turns into a brown pelt when they grow up. In older animals, the fur usually begins to turn grayish. In addition, the breed is polled in both sexes.

Diekema, lawyer (134 West 12th Street) *George Hummer of the West Michigan Furniture Company (191 West 12th Street) *Bert Keppel, a coalyard owner (12 West 13th) *Gerrit Kellen, president of Hope College (18 East 12th) *Dr. Henry Kremers, physician, surgeon and vice- president of the Holland Sugar Company (8 East 12th) *Henry Kiekintveld, owner of a bookstore (11 West 14th) *Cornelius Lokker, owner of the Holland Crystal Creamery (80 East 13th) *F. N. Jonkman, a prominent Holland contractor and builder (79 East 14th) *M. G. Manting, a printer and publisher of the ottawa County Times (93 West 14th) *Charles McLean, President of the Holland-St. Louis Sugar Company, a sugar beet-processing firm *Bert Pratt, drygoods (51 East 14th) *John Raven, jeweler (109 West 12th Street) *Andries Steketee of A. Steketee and Sons General Store (66 West 11th Street) *Bert Slagh, wallpaper and paints (349 College Avenue) *Herman Van Ark of the Bayview Furniture Company (214 West 12th Street) *Walter Zylstra, a grocer (333 College Avenue) ==Description== The Holland Historic District is located west and south of Holland's primary business district and the adjacent Hope College. It is a primarily residential district, with a smattering of commercial, educational, municipal and religious structures. The district contains a total of 194 buildings, of which 158 are considered as contributing to the historic nature of the district. Most of these are single-family residential houses. The houses in the district are significant as good representations of architectural styles characteristic of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in particular the range of fine Queen Anne structures. In addition to the houses, the district also contains Holland's Centennial Park and multiple significant public buildings. These include: *Third Reformed Church of Holland (1874), 111 West 13th Street. *Hope Reformed Church, (1874-1902), 79 West 11th Street. *Holland High School (1912), 96 West 15th Street. *Holland Junior High School (1923) 372 River Avenue. *Post Office (1914) 31 West 10th Street. *Woman's Literary Club (913) 235 Central Avenue. *Masonic Temple building (1921) 17 W. 10th Street. *Holland City Hall (1909) 270 River Avenue. *Bell Telephone Building (1929) 13 West 10th Street. ==Gallery== File:Holland Historic District A.JPG File:Holland Historic District C.JPG File:Holland Historic District D.JPG ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Georgian architecture in Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:Queen Anne architecture in Michigan Category:Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"Holland Historic District (Holland, Michigan)"},{"id":"54107170","text":"Title page of the 1993 edition Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon (Biographical Dictionary of Singers, literally: Large singers' lexicon) is a single-field dictionary of singers in classical music, edited by Karl-Josef Kutsch and Leo Riemens and first published in 1987.

As with similar orchids, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants lack a rosette at the base but have up to eight tiny green, white and brown flowers. ==Description== Pterostylis parviflora is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of three to eight egg- shaped to heart-shaped leaves which lie flat on the ground. Each leaf is 3‚Äì15 mm long and 3‚Äì7 mm wide. Flowering plants have up to eight well-spaced flowers 7‚Äì10 mm long and 3‚Äì4 mm wide borne on a thin, wiry spike 80‚Äì250 mm high. Up to three leaf rosettes are arranged on the side of the flowering spike. The flowers are green and white, sometimes brown on the petals. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward and has a short point. The lateral sepals are erect, held closely against the galea with thread-like tips about 3mm long that do not project above the galea. The sinus between the bases of the lateral sepals bulges forward and has a small notch in the centre. The labellum is about 4 mm long, 1.5 mm wide and barely visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from February to May. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis parviflora was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. ==Distribution and habitat== The tiny greenhood grows in a range of habitats from coastal heath to forest in moist, well-drained soils. It is widespread on the coast and ranges of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and most of Victoria. It also occurs in Queensland but is rare in South Australia. ==References== parviflora Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1810 ","title":"Pterostylis parviflora"},{"id":"54107202","text":"A Soshu school katana attributed to Etchu Norishige.

Whitfield Mills\\" or \\"W. W. Mills\\", was an English surveyor of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line who is best known for naming a waterhole in Central Australia Alice Spring, from which the town of Alice Springs now takes its name. He also named Heavitree Gap as a tribute to his old school in Devon, England. ==Early life== Mills was born on 19 November 1844 at Plymouth in England. He went to school at Heavitree School in Devon. Mills immigrated to Australia on board the Atlanta from England, arriving in South Australia on 8 April 1866 at the age of 21. ==Goyder's Expedition== Mills was a surveyor on George Goyder's mission to survey a northern capital Palmerston, later renamed Darwin. He arrived on the Moonta on 5 February 1869 leaving just short of a year later, the team having surveyed more than 2700 square kilometres of land. ==Surveying the Overland Telegraph Line== On 5 September 1870, he joined Charles Todd's party to build the central section of the Overland Telegraph Line. On 7 March 1871, Mills and his companion Gilbert McMinn, having found a gap in the McDonnell Ranges through which to feed the telegraph line, and which he named Heavitree Gap, then came across a string of waterholes along what is now called the Todd River, which were already frequented by local Arrernte people. Mills named one Alice Spring, after the wife of Charles Todd, from which the town of Alice Springs now takes its name. ==Later life== Mills married Mary Jane Mullen on 24 March 1879. They had two daughters Alice Thornton and Ethel May. After completion of the telegraph line, Mills returned to the Northern Territory to work in mining and undertake further surveying. In the early 1880s, he managed a camel transport company carrying freight from Farina to Peake and Charlotte Waters. He delivered 30 camels from Beltana Station to Northampton in Western Australia for Sir Thomas Elder. He went across the centre of Australia on the Canning Stock Route before heading to Northampton. They went for long periods without water but after 25 weeks, completed the journey. Mary Jane died on 1 October 1888 at just 30 years of age. The Mills children were then brought up by extended family, while Mills spent time in Broken Hill before eventually moving to Western Australia. Mills died on 18 August 1916 at the age of 72. He is buried in the Widgiemooltha Cemetery in Western Australia. Mills Street in East Side in Alice Springs is named after Mills. ==References== Category:1916 deaths Category:1844 births Category:People from Plymouth Category:Australian surveyors Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia ","title":"William Mills (surveyor)"},{"id":"54107305","text":"Chakrit Rawanprakone (, born 3 March 1991), is a Thai professional footballer who plays as a Forward. ==Honours== Club ;Muangthong United * Thai League 1 (1): 2009 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Chakrit Rawanprakone Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Phuket F.C. players Category:Buriram F.C. players Category:Ratchaburi Mitr Phol F.C. players Category:Nakhon Pathom United F.C. players Category:TTM Phichit F.C. players Category:Nakhon Ratchasima F.C. players Category:Port F.C. players ","title":"Chakrit Rawanprakone"},{"id":"54107310","text":"\\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\" (English: \\"People Life Dance World\\") is a song by the German satirist Jan B√∂hmermann. It was presented as part of the TV show Neo Magazin Royale on 6 April 2017 and released on the same day. The song makes fun of vapid pop lyrics and product placement in music videos. Its lyrics consist of advertising slogans, celebrity tweets, and common idioms or sayings; the song was \\"written\\" by chimpanzees. The song ended up in the German single charts. ==Background== On 6 April 2017, B√∂hmermann criticised the German pop industry and the Echo Award ceremony, which was planned for the next day, on his show Neo Magazin Royale. The 20-minute long monologue had already been released on YouTube the day before. Among other things, he criticized Max Giesinger, Tim Bendzko and Matthias Schweigh√∂fer who, according to B√∂hmermann, did not write their own lyrics and focused more on the revenue their songs could earn rather than meaningful content. He refers to them as the \\"new German pop poets\\" and claims that their songs have \\"trivial lyrics,\\" sounding like \\"advertising messages\\". Furthermore, their music videos contain numerous product placements. To prove how standardised and replaceable German pop songs are, B√∂hmermann and his production team collected advertising slogans, phrases from current pop songs and tweets of the German YouTubers Bianca Heinicke and Sami Slimani. These text fragments were then randomly put together at ZOOM Erlebniswelt Gelsenkirchen by five chimpanzees, creating the finished song lyrics. The pseudonym \\"Jim Pandzko,\\" a pun made up of \\"Tim Bendzko\\" and \\"chimpanzee,\\" was used to identify the song's singer. The songwriters registered with GEMA, Bono Beau and Olaf Utan, are also word plays made up of \\"Bonobo\\" and \\"Orangutan\\", too. \\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\" was recorded at Studio Debussy in Essen. Audio mixing was done at Klangwelt Studio, also in Essen. B√∂hmermann's aim is that the song will win the Echo Award 2018. All revenues will go to the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne.\\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\": Jan B√∂hmermann will Einnahmen an K√∂lner Musikschule spenden , Rheinische Post, 15. April 2017 ==Music and Content== \\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\" is composed in verse‚Äìchorus form with content from different, randomly combined text fragments. B√∂hmermann says that the words in the title Menschen (English: people), Leben (life), Tanzen (dance) and Welt (world) describe the four most-used themes in German pop music. In addition, the chorus uses the lyrics \\"Oh oh eh oh oh\\" to make remembering and singing along to the song easier. == Reception and Reactions == The media responded positively to \\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\". Stern wrote: \\"you cannot illustrate the state of German pop music in 2017 any better than with a song that was written in such a short time and composed by apes.\\" In a review which discusses the satirical vein of the song, Musikexpress claims that the song is the most emotional one you can listen to today and is unusually catchy. The singer of the German band Die Toten Hosen, Campino, said during the 2017 Echo Award Ceremony in a reference to the video: \\"It's better to be uncool than a cool asshole, who cannot be constructive in any way.\\" He also talked about the \\"B√∂hmermann Zeitgeist banter\\".Campino √ºber B√∂hmermann: ‚ÄûLieber uncool, als ein cooles Arschloch\\" . In: abendzeitung-muenchen.de, 7. April 2017. Abgerufen am 10. April 2017. B√∂hmermann responded on his Facebook page, still impersonating a rising young musician, with empty phrases and quotes from songs of German pop poets and Die Toten Hosen. Max Giesinger says that he \\"can see the humour in the video.\\" ==Commercial success== Shortly after its release, \\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\" temporarily reached number one on the German iTunes- and Amazon-charts. One day later, the song entered the official German charts in 84th place. In its second week on the charts, it broke into the top ten reaching 10th place. It is B√∂hmermann's second top ten success in Germany following \\"Ich hab Polizei\\". During its third week on the charts, \\"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt\\" dropped to 33rd place and was not listed in the charts after that. The √ñ3 Austria Top 40 charts listed the song in 46th place for one week. {  - class=\\"hintergrundfarbe8\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" ! Charts ! Highest Ranking !

Albania has an embassy in Budapest and Hungary has an embassy and a consular office in Tirana. The history of diplomatic relations of Albania and Hungary dates back to 1912, when Albania declared its independence in November 28, 1912. The countries are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe. As a European Union (EU) member, Hungary supports Albania in its euro-integration path. ==History== Historically, Albanian-Hungarian relations were strong in the Middle Ages due to dynastic ties (common governance by members of the Angevin family in the 14th century followed by the marriage of many other Albanian nobles to Hungarians), religious ties, and common interests, especially the prevention of Venetian domination of the Adriatic coast. Hungary played a significant role in the development and spread of Catholicism in Albania during the 13th to 15th centuries. Both countries then experienced Ottoman rule, with Hungarians and Albanians allying against the Ottomans at numerous points, famously including the alliance between John Hunyadi and Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. In the Great Turkish War, Albanian Catholic leaders Pjet√´r Bogdani and Toma Raspasani rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause. After the Great Turkish War, Hungary was absorbed into the Hapsburg domain, while Albanian inhabited regions remained part of the Ottoman Empire and experienced a period of economic and societal breakdown, which saw large numbers of Catholics from Kosovo flee to north to arrive in Budapest,Pahumi, Nevila (2007). \\"The Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism\\". Page 18: \\"The pasha of Ipek forcibly removed Catholic inhabitants of northern Albania into the plains of southern Serbia after a failed Serb revolt in 1689 and the flight of many Serbs to the Habsburg Empire. The transferred villagers were forced to convert over to Islam.\\" and the widespread Islamization due to extremely steep increases in the poll tax by Ottoman authorities as well as instances of forced conversion.Marmullaku, ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbania and the Albanians‚Äô‚Äô.

Pages 80‚Äì81.Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian Identities‚Äô‚Äô. Page 22 Albanian Catholicism survived in the mountainous Northwest of Albania with significant aid from Austro-Hungarian clerics. Austro-Hungarian funded Catholic schools were the only schools where Albanians were able to study in their native language during Ottoman rule, and as a result many of their students would contribute to the emergence of Albanian nationalism, as did some Hungarian intellectuals such as Franz Nopcsa. Austro-Hungary was a key proponent of Albanian independence and opposed attempts by Slavic nations to dominate Albanian lands. Austro- Hungarian diplomatic assistance was critical for the expulsion of the Serbian and Montenegrin armies from Durres and Shkoder in 1912. After Albanian independence, King Zog married a Hungarian woman. In the early 20th century, Albania and Hungary shared a situation where large numbers of Albanians and Hungarians resided outside of their respective new borders, and both saw the rise of irredentist movements that aimed to create Greater Hungary and Ethnic Albania, but were obstructed by the relative strength of surrounding countries. During World War II, both countries came under the control of Axis- allied regimes, followed by the domination of Communist parties allied to Moscow. Albanian-Hungarian relations came to a halt after the Soviet-Albanian split, but were resuscitated after the fall of Communism. Middle Ages Albanian-Hungarian relations date back to the Middle Ages. Especially after Hungary was converted to Catholicism and northern Albanian rulers increasingly also converted and converted their subjects to Catholicism as well during the High Middle Ages especially after the Fourth Crusade, Hungary often had relationships with Albanian principalities. Academics such as Muhamet Mala and Edmond Malaj have argued that the foundation of the state of Hungary had far reaching political effects that proved critical for the survival of Albanians despite repeated Slavic invasions. Their domination of the Danube preempted any possibility of large unifying Slavic states in the Balkans, which would have \\"with certainty\\" have brought about a \\"definitive Slavicization of the Balkan\\", changing the ethnic structure in favor Slavic domination at the expense of the survival of Albanians, Greeks and Romanians.Malaj, Edmond. Rreth marredhenieve ndermjet shqiptareve dhe hungarezeve gjate mesjetes. Page 272-273 Albano-Hungarian relations existed in two realms, the secular and the religious. In the religious realm, Hungarian assistance was critical for the growth of Albanian Catholicism. Malaj, Edmond. Rreth marr√´dh√´nieve nd√´rmjet shqiptar√´ve dhe hungarez√´ve gjat√´ Mesjet√´s.

Page 268 Intensive clerical relations began in the 12th century and were first documented in 1177 by Gregori, the prelate of Tivar.Malaj, 270 The establishment of Hungarian domination by Bela III over the Dalmatian cities of Split, Zadar and Trogir ultimately caused the promotion of Albanian ecclesiastic structures to direct subordination to Rome, rather than having been dependent on the Dalmatian city of Ragusa, as they were previously. After this point, the dioceses of Ulcinj (Ecclesia Dulcignensis), Shas (Suaciensis), Shkod√´r-Pult (Scodrensis/Pulatensis), Baleƒç (Beleacensis), Drivasto (Drivastensis), Deje (Dagnesnsis), and et cetera were reorganized into an \\"Albanian archbishopric\\" directly under Rome, as Malaj notes, an important development in the growth of Albanian Catholicism in the Balkans.Malaj, Page 270 Hungary provided a \\"definitive role\\" in the development of Albanian Catholicism, because it wished to replace the influence of its rival Ragusa in Albania, which had remained outside the control of the Hungarian crown. With the rise of Serbia under Stefan Du≈°an and the beginning of Du≈°an‚Äôs persecution of Catholics; notably, when the Bishop of Shas was accused of murder by Serbian authorities, he found refuge in Hungary. Hungary would also provide Albanian Catholics with aid in their polemical fight against \\"schismatics\\" (such as Bogomils), sending its own Dominican priests to Albania for this purpose. In 1278, Dominican priests convened for a summit in Durr√´s which resulted in the construction of the first Dominican monastery in Albania, a significant event in the deepening of ties with the Albanian noble Thopia family of Central Albania with the Dominican Order and the growth of the latter in Northern and Central Albania.Malaj, pages 271-272 Diplomatic relations Relations between Albania and Hungary became more intensive in the 14th century, during the rule of Albania by Charles of Anjou. After 1308, another Angevin (Anzhu as Albanians call the family) ruled Hungary and Croatia as Angevins also remained on the Albanian throne, bringing the three nations into a period of political convergence.Malaj, Edmond. Rreth marredhenieve ndermjet shqiptareve dhe hungarezeve gjate mesjetes. Page 273 Ottoman conquest During the Ottoman conquests of the Balkans, Albanian national hero Skanderbeg and Hungarian national hero John Hunyadi were aligned together against the Ottoman Army. Late Ottoman era As a unified state, Austro-Hungary helped provide education to Northern Albanians, especially those of Catholic faith, by helping build schools in the vicinity of Shkod√´r. Unlike all other schools in the country at the time, it allowed students to learn in Albanian. The expansion of Albanian education helped the stimulate the Albanian National Awakening. A Hungarian noble Franz Nopcsa was influential in the emerging field of Albanology which fueled the rise of Albanian nationalism, and he gave his support to Albanian independence. Austro-Hungary supported Albanian aspirations, particularly against Serbian claims to Albanian territory, motivated by a desire to restrain the power of Pan-Slavism under the aegis of the Russian Empire, which was a particular threat to Hungary which had to contend with Slovak nationalism, Croatian nationalism and Serbian nationalism. After Albanian Independence King Zog chose as his wife, a Hungarian noblewoman named Geraldine. Communist era During the Soviet era, both countries were part of the Eastern Bloc and COMECON until Albania's withdrawal in 1961. == See also == * Foreign relations of Albania * Foreign relations of Hungary * Accession of Albania to the European Union == References  External links == * Albanian Embassy in Budapest * Hungarian Embassy in Tirana Hungary Category:Bilateral relations of Hungary ","title":"Albania‚ÄìHungary relations"},{"id":"54107340","text":"1,1-Diiodoethane is an organic saturated haloalkane containing iodine with formula CHCHI. ==Preparation== 1,1-diiodoethane can be synthesized from gem- dihaloalkanes. The starting material is 1,1-dichloroethane, and iodoethane is a source of iodine. In the presence of aluminium trichloride, 1,1-dichloroethane will converted to 1,1-diiodoethane. The preparation of 1,1-diiodoethane from gem-dihaloalkanes To be specific, mix 0.4 mol (~39.6 g) of 1,1-dichloroethane with 1.2 mol(~187 g) of ethyl iodide, and ~2.0 g of aluminum chloride. Heat for three hours using steam bath. Then, wash the mixture with HO and NaHSO respectively, and dry with MgSO.

On December 21, 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that a new democratic government must create laws to protect LGBTI rights and change existing laws that were tantamount to discrimination.365gay.com, \\"Nepal High Court Issues Landmark Gay Ruling,\\" 21 December 2007 Nepal court rules on gay rights BBC News, 21 December 2007 In September 2015, several articles mentioning the rights of gender and sexual minorities in the country's new constitution were approved by Parliament after lengthy deliberation. Amongst these: * Article 12 states that people have the right to have citizenship identification that reflects their preferred gender. * Article 18 covers rights to equality and states that the State will not \\"discriminate [against] any citizens based on origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, gender, language or ideological conviction or any other status.\\" * Article 18 also lists \\"minorities, marginalized, youth, children, senior citizens, gender and sexual minorities, handicapped persons\\" asdisadvantaged groups that are recognized by the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 20 September 2015. These changes mean that Nepal is likely the most progressive country in South Asia, for LGBT rights. Nevertheless, numerous difficulties are reported by intersex people in Nepal, including the right to change gender assignment, the right to bodily autonomy, and the right to health. In February 2018, Asian intersex activists published the Statement of Intersex Asia and the Asian Intersex Forum, setting out local demands. Intersex issues in Nepal may often be thought to be third sex issues, and the most well-known third-gender group in South Asia is perhaps the hijra. Serena Nanda writes that: \\"There is a widespread belief in India that hijras are born hermaphrodites [intersex] and are taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the hijras I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens.\\"Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. xx. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999 This belief has an impact when infants are born. Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear about the possible future life of their child. == Physical integrity and bodily autonomy == thumbright260px Intersex persons are not protected from violations to physical integrity and bodily autonomy. A 2016 book of personal stories by intersex people from Nepal identifies a range of bodily autonomy and health issues, including \\"Intersex genital mutilation as a growing practice and lack of information and access to reproductive health information or care\\" and \\"Lack of access to necessary health care for those experiencing health difficulties as a result of their intersex variation\\". In June 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child questioned the Nepalese government, and identified concerns about: The Committee called for investigations of human rights violations, education of medical professionals, and access to redress. ==Protection from discrimination== thumbright260px While the 2015 constitution provides protection for sexual and gender minorities, disabled people, and minorities more generally, Esan Regmi has identified a number of issues facing intersex people in Nepal, including discrimination, and a lack of intersex-specific research and actions within Nepal's LGBTI movement. Access to marriage and inheritance rights are also concerns. ==Identification documents== According to local intersex activists, intersex people are not able to change name or gender marker on Nepalese birth certificates, and also have difficulties in updating academic transcripts and citizenship certificates. Intersex people are often confused as 'third gender' which creates barrier in recognition. ==Rights advocacy== On February 8‚Äì9, 2016, and with the support of the UNDP and other organizations, the Blue Diamond Society hosted a first national meeting on intersex issues. The meeting was led by Esan Regmi, with 13 participants from around Nepal.

R. Ambedkar. On 5 May 2017, a group of Rajputs entered into dalit colony when they were on their way to a garlanding ceremony in honour of Maharana Pratap in spite of denial by administration to enter this colony and on this occasion the violence escalated, resulting in death of one rajput, several injuries and the burning of as many as 25 Dalit houses. The Dalits claimed that the 20-25 strong Rajput group was an unauthorised procession. Security forces were subsequently deployed to monitor the locality. == Aftermath == An attempt by Dalits to protest on 9 May in Gandhi Park against the troubles was denied permission by city authorities, leading to more violence as the people turned instead to the streets. It was alleged that the Dalit protestors set fire to a police base and various vehicles. Subsequently, on 22 May, around 5000 Dalits peacefully protested at Jantar Mantar, led by the Bhim Army. Organisers later claimed that the actual attendance was around 1500-2000 people. On the same day as the Jantar Mantar event, 180 families from Rupdi, Kapurpur, Ighri and Unali villages near Shabbirpur protested by immersing Hindu worshipping elements in a river and converting to Buddhism. They claimed that Hinduism did not give them equal status. Raj Babbar, an Indian National Congress politician, later said that the \\"UP government failed to protect victims of caste-based violence\\". The Dalit leader Mewani said, \\"When the procession was being taken out, preventive measures should have been taken by the police and the administration. But nothing of the sort was done. And now Dalits are being targeted and are being hunted down. It is evident that CM Yogi and PM Modi want to replace the Constitution with Manusmriti.\\" Violence broke out again between Dalits and Thakurs on 23 May 2017 at three different places.

He is best known for sailing with Thomas Tew. ==History== Ireland was sailing between New York and Boston in 1694 when he was hired by privateer Thomas Tew to pilot his ship Amity up the coast. Ireland testified that the crew mutinied, demanding Tew take up piracy instead, and forcing Ireland to act as navigator. The crew told them ‚Äúthey came out for money and money they would have before they went home again.‚Äù Tew asked that they put him and Ireland ashore and offered them the sloop to do with as they wanted, but they refused, saying ‚Äúif he would not pilot them to Madagascar he should be starved.‚Äù This would be Tew‚Äôs second ‚ÄúPirate Round‚Äù voyage to the area. Tew sailed with fellow pirates Joseph Faro, Thomas Wake, William May, Richard Want, and Henry Every in August 1695 to attack Mughal Empire treasure ships in the Indian Ocean. Most of the Moorish fleet slipped past in the night but two stragglers ‚Äì the massive Gunsway and its escort, Fateh Mohammed ‚Äì were caught and attacked. Tew sailed ahead of the others in the Amity, attacking the Fateh Mohammed early. A cannonball killed Tew during the battle, and Amity surrendered. After Every and the others defeated Gunsway and Fateh Mohammed both, the Amity was freed. Ireland was now master of the 70-ton, 60-man, 8-gun Amity. They sailed to Adam Baldridge‚Äôs pirate trading post near Madagascar to repair and refit in December 1695. Baldridge tipped them off that the Charming Mary under captain Richard Glover left shortly before and was still nearby. Ireland pursued the Charming Mary, capturing it and putting Glover on the Amity. The crew elected Richard Bobbington as Captain of the Charming Mary. Glover and Amity would eventually by captured by Dirk Chivers, who stripped Amity and used it to repair his own ship, leaving Amity‚Äôs hulk stranded on a reef. Unknown to Bobbington or Ireland, that very same month William Kidd had been issued a commission to hunt down several named pirates, including Tew, Wake, May, and John Ireland himself. Tew was already dead by the time Kidd received his commission, and Kidd turned to piracy before encountering any of the others. Ireland later testified that he‚Äôd tried to go with Glover aboard the Amity but was forced by the crew to remain on the Charming Mary. After refitting in May 1696, Bobbington raided the Red Sea and near Tellicherry and Rajapur. Bobbington was captured by Persians while ashore near Jask. The crew sailed Charming Mary off without waiting for him, possibly electing Joseph Skinner captain, or possibly with no formal captain and Ireland as ship‚Äôs master again. After briefly sailing alongside Ralph Stout and Robert Culliford's Mocha they returned to Barbados in 1697 to divide their loot. The Charming Mary put in again at Madagascar in late 1699 under captain William May, who‚Äôd led the Pearl during the attack on Gunsway. A squadron of British warships appeared, forcing May to return to New York by early 1700. Ireland was called to testify in New York in May 1701 but was never tried in court for lack of witnesses against him. In his testimony he steadfastly maintained that he had been forced into piracy at every turn, the pirates ‚Äúsetting a watch over him for feare he would make his escape.‚Äù Ireland‚Äôs own testimony regarding the end of his piracy career differs from other records: he claims that in late 1696 their ship (presumably Charming Mary) was lost in a storm. The remaining crew took over a Portuguese ship a few months later, marooning Ireland and others, who escaped in small boats. He claimed he spent months making his way back to Malacca, where he was wounded in a quarrel with a former crewmate, imprisoned, and eventually sent back to London. ==See also== *Admiralty court - the venue in which Ireland was tried. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:17th- century pirates Category:Pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"John Ireland (pirate)"},{"id":"54107773","text":"Cherry River may refer to: * Cherry River (Quebec) * Cherry River (West Virginia) ","title":"Cherry River"},{"id":"54107777","text":"ROAR!

Herriot joined Blackbeard‚Äôs crew, while Teach placed his associate Israel Hands in command of the Adventure. Captain Stede Bonnet of the Revenge had also joined Blackbeard recently, recuperating after being wounded fleeing a Spanish warship. During his later trial Herriot would testify that Blackbeard intentionally grounded his flagship Queen Anne‚Äôs Revenge at Topsail Inlet in order to break up his growing fleet and escape with all its collected loot. The Adventure was also grounded and lost while trying to reach the Queen Anne's Revenge. Bonnet‚Äôs boatswain Ignatius Pell confirmed his testimony, though historians still debate the matter. During the incident Herriot and a number of others were put ashore while Teach sailed away in a captured sloop with all their treasure. Bonnet resumed his command of the ship Revenge (renamed Royal James), rescuing Teach‚Äôs stranded crew and taking Herriot with him as his new sailing master. Bonnet tried to chase down the fleeing Teach but missed him and plundered merchant vessels throughout July instead. Merchants of South Carolina had armed two sloops under Colonel William Rhett to hunt down pirate Charles Vane. Rhett missed capturing Vane and engaged Bonnet instead, capturing him and the Royal James‚Äô crew in September 1718 at Cape Fear. Back in Charleston in late October, Herriot testified against Bonnet in exchange for clemency, along with Pell. Despite his pardon, Herriot escaped from jail alongside Stede Bonnet with the help of corrupt local merchant Richard Tookerman. That November in the marshes of Sullivan‚Äôs Island, Bonnet was recaptured by Rhett while Herriot and two others were shot and killed. Bonnet was hung in Charleston in December 1718. ==Further reading== *The Tryals of Major Stede Bonnet and other Pirates (full original text) ==See also== *Turneffe Atoll - the location where Blackbeard captured Herriot's ship ==References== Category:18th-century pirates Category:Pirates Category:People executed for piracy Category:1718 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Caribbean pirates ","title":"David Herriot"},{"id":"54107961","text":"LTG Charles Nicholas PedeMartindale-Hubbell Law Directory is a military lawyer who currently serves as the 40th Judge Advocate General of the United States Army.

The kingdom was virtually isolated before the 1850s, with limited contacts through Dutch traders. The Meiji Restoration was a political revolution that installed a new leadership that was eager to borrow Western technology and organization. The government in Tokyo carefully monitored and controlled outside interactions. Japanese delegations to Europe brought back European standards which were widely imposed across the government and the economy. Trade flourished, as Japan rapidly industrialized. European-style imperialism and colonialism were borrowed, as in the late 19th century Japan defeated China, and acquired numerous colonies, including Formosa and Okinawa. The rapid advances in Japanese military prowess stunned the world in 1904‚Äì1905 when it decisively defeated Russia and gained recognition as a world power. Imperialism continued as it took control of Korea, and began moving into Manchuria. Its only military alliance was with Great Britain. During 1902‚Äì1923. In the First World War, it joined the Allies, and seized many German possessions in the Pacific and in China. Japan put heavy pressure on China, but China resisted. Although the political system was formally democratic, the Army increasingly seized control in Japan. Indeed, in the 1930s, separatist Army elements in Manchuria largely shaped foreign-policy. The League of Nations criticized Japan's takeover of Manchuria in 1931, so it withdrew. It joined the Axis alliance with Germany, but there was little close cooperation between the two nations until 1943. Japan opened a full-scale war in China, in 1937, taking control of the major cities and economic centers with a long record of atrocities. Two puppet regimes were nominally in charge in China and Manchuria. Military confrontations with the Soviet Union were disappointing to Japan, and it turned its attention to the south. American economic and financial pressures, joined by Britain and the Netherlands, climaxed in the cut off of vitally needed oil supplies in 1941. Japan declared war, and in three months scored spectacular successes against the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, as well as continuing the war with China. The Japanese economy could not support the large-scale war effort, especially with the rapid buildup of the American navy. By 1944, Japan was heavily on the defensive, as its Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere collapsed, its navy was sunk, and American bombing started to devastate major Japanese cities. The final blow came in August 1945 with two American atomic bombs and the Russian invasion. Japan surrendered, and was occupied by the Allies, or more particularly by the United States. Its political and economic system was rebuilt on the basis of greater democracy, no military capability, and a weakening of traditional monopolistic corporations. Japan was a very minor player in international affairs in the late 1940s, but its economy revived in part as a supply base for the Korean War. Non-involvement became the central focus of Japanese foreign policy, together with very rapid growth of its industrial exports. By the 1990s, Japan, with the second-largest economy in the world behind the United States, reached a peak and leveled off economically. It retained very close relations with the United States, which basically provided it with military protection. South Korea, China, and other countries in the Western Pacific traded on a very large scale with Japan, but still deeply resented the wartime atrocities. :See also Military history of Japan The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942 ==Meiji Restoration == Beginning with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which established a new, centralized regime, Japan set out to \\"gather wisdom from all over the world\\" and embarked on an ambitious program of military, social, political, and economic reforms that transformed it within a generation into a modern nation- state and major world power. The Meiji oligarchy was aware of Western progress, and \\"learning missions\\" were sent abroad to absorb as much of it as possible. The Iwakura Mission, the most important one, was led by Iwakura Tomomi, Kido Takayoshi and ≈åkubo Toshimichi, contained forty-eight members in total and spent two years (1871‚Äì73) touring the United States and Europe, studying every aspect of modern nations, such as government institutions, courts, prison systems, schools, the import-export business, factories, shipyards, glass plants, mines, and other enterprises. Upon returning, mission members called for domestic reforms that would help Japan catch up with the West. European powers imposed a series of \\"unequal treaties\\" in the 1850s and 1860s that gave privileged roles to their nationals in specially designated treaty ports. Representative was the 1858 Treaty with the United States, called the \\"Harris Treaty.\\" It opened the ports of Kanagawa and four other Japanese cities to trade, And provided for the exchange of diplomats. It granted extraterritoriality to foreigners, So that they govern themselves and were not under the control of Japanese courts or authorities. There were numerous trading stipulations favorable to the Americans. The Dutch, British and Russians quickly followed suit with their own treaties, backed up by their own powerful naval forces. Walter LaFeber, The Clash: U.S.-Japanese Relations throughout History (1997), 21‚Äì23 The unequal treaties were part of the series imposed on non-Western countries, such as Persia 1857, Turkey 1861, Siam 1855, and China 1858. The inequality was not quite as severe as suffered by these other countries, but it rankled so much that ending the inequality became a priority that was finally achieved in the 1890s. The humiliation was not as bad as China suffered, but it energized anti-foreign forces inside Japan. On the other hand, the new treaties, provided for tariffs on imports from Europe; imports multiplied by a factor of nine between 1860 and 1864, and the tariff revenue provided major financial backing for the Meiji regime. Exports of tea, silk and other Japanese products multiplied by a factor of four in four years, dramatically stimulating the local economy while causing galloping inflation that drove up the price of rice.Marius B. Jansen, ed., The Emergence of Meiji Japan (1995) pp. 171‚Äì77. The Meiji leaders sketched a new vision for a modernized Japan's leadership role in Asia, but they realized that this role required that Japan develop its national strength, cultivate Japanese nationalism among the population, and carefully craft policies toward potential enemies. The skills and tricks of negotiation had to be learned, so they could compete on an equal basis with experienced Western diplomats. No longer could Westerners be seen as \\"barbarians\\"; In time, Japan formed a corps of professional diplomats and negotiators.Michael Auslin, Negotiating with Imperialism: The Unequal Treaties and the Culture of Japanese Diplomacy (2004) ==Japan becomes a power== Starting in the 1860s Japan rapidly modernized along Western lines, adding industry, bureaucracy, institutions and military capabilities that provided the base for imperial expansion into Korea, China, Taiwan and islands to the south.Andy Dailey, Move to Global War (2015) pp. 9‚Äì53 on Japan's expansion It saw itself vulnerable to aggressive Western imperialism unless it took control of neighboring areas. It took control of Okinawa and Formosa. Japan's desire to control Taiwan, Korea and Manchuria, led to the first Sino-Japanese War with China in 1894‚Äì1895 and the Russo- Japanese War with Russia in 1904‚Äì1905. The war with China made Japan the world's first Eastern, modern imperial power, and the war with Russia proved that a Western power could be defeated by an Eastern state. The aftermath of these two wars left Japan the dominant power in the Far East with a sphere of influence extending over southern Manchuria and Korea, which was formally annexed as part of the Japanese Empire in 1910. Okinawa Okinawa island is the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, and paid tribute to China from the late 14th century. Japan took control of the entire Ryukyu island chain in 1609 and formally incorporated it into Japan in 1879.George Kerr, Okinawa: The history of an island people (Tuttle Publishing, 2013). War with China Friction between China and Japan arose from the 1870s from Japan's control over the Ryukyu Islands, rivalry for political influence in Korea and trade issues.Langer, The Diplomacy of imperialism: 1890-1902 (1960) pp. 167‚Äì94. Japan, having built up a stable political and economic system with a small but well-trained army and navy, easily defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894. Japanese soldiers massacred the Chinese after capturing Port Arthur on the Liaotung Peninsula. In the harsh Treaty of Shimonoseki of April 1895, China recognize the independence of Korea, and ceded to Japan Formosa, the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaotung Peninsula. China further paid an indemnity of 200 million silver taels, opened five new ports to international trade, and allowed Japan (and other Western powers) to set up and operate factories in these cities. However, Russia, France, and Germany saw themselves disadvantaged by the treaty and in the Triple Intervention forced Japan to return the Liaotung Peninsula in return for a larger indemnity. The only positive result for China came when those factories led the industrialization of urban China, spinning off a local class of entrepreneurs and skilled mechanics. Taiwan The island of Formosa (Taiwan) had an indigenous population when Dutch traders in need of an Asian base to trade with Japan and China arrived in 1623. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) built Fort Zeelandia. They soon began to rule the natives. China took control in the 1660s, and sent in settlers. By the 1890s there were about 2.3 million Han Chinese and 200,000 members of indigenous tribes. After its victory in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894‚Äì95, the peace treaty ceded the island to Japan. It was Japan's first colony.Jonathan Manthorpe, Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan (2008) excerpt and text search, Ch. 10‚Äì12 Japan expected far more benefits from the occupation of Taiwan than the limited benefits it actually received. Japan realized that its home islands could only support a limited resource base, and it hoped that Taiwan, with its fertile farmlands, would make up the shortage. By 1905, Taiwan was producing rice and sugar and paying for itself with a small surplus. Perhaps more important, Japan gained Asia-wide prestige by being the first non-European country to operate a modern colony. It learned how to adjust its German-based bureaucratic standards to actual conditions, and how to deal with frequent insurrections. The ultimate goal was to promote Japanese language and culture, but the administrators realized they first had to adjust to the Chinese culture of the people. Japan had a civilizing mission, and it opened schools so that the peasants could become productive and patriotic manual workers. Medical facilities were modernized, and the death rate plunged. To maintain order, Japan installed a police state that closely monitored everyone. In 1945, Japan was stripped of its empire and Taiwan was returned to China.Manthorpe, Forbidden Nation: A History of Taiwan (2008) ch. 13 War with Russia 1904‚Äì1905 In 1895, Japan felt robbed of the spoils of her decisive victory over China by the Western Powers (including Russia), which revised the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Boxer Rebellion of 1899‚Äì1901 saw Japan and Russia as allies who fought together against the Chinese, with Russians playing the leading role on the battlefield.Petr E. Podalko, \\"‚ÄòWeak ally‚Äô or ‚Äòstrong enemy?‚Äô: Japan in the eyes of Russian diplomats and military agents, 1900-1907.\\" Japan Forum 28#3 (2016). In the 1890s Japan was angered at Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria. Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government decided on war to stop the perceived Russian threat to its plans for expansion into Asia. After negotiations broke down in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur, China, in a surprise attack. Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan. Tsar Nicholas II kept on with the expectation that Russia would win decisive naval battles, and when that proved illusory he fought to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \\"humiliating peace\\". The war concluded with the Treaty of Portsmouth, mediated by US President Theodore Roosevelt. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European one. Takeover of Korea In 1905, the Empire of Japan and the Korean Empire signed the Eulsa Treaty, which brought Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence as a protectorate. The Treaty was a result of the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War and Japan wanting to increase its hold over the Korean Peninsula. The Eulsa Treaty led to the signing of the 1907 Treaty two years later. The 1907 Treaty ensured that Korea would act under the guidance of a Japanese resident general and Korean internal affairs would be under Japanese control. Korean Emperor Gojong was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Sunjong, as he protested Japanese actions in the Hague Conference. Finally in 1910, the Annexation Treaty was signed, formally annexing Korea to Japan.Hilary Conroy, The Japanese seizure of Korea, 1868-1910: a study of realism and idealism in international relations (1960). ==Political leaders== Prime Minister Ito Prince It≈ç Hirobumi (1841‚Äì1909) was prime minister for most of the period 1885‚Äì1901 and dominated foreign policy. He strengthened diplomatic ties with Western powers including Germany, the United States and especially Great Britain through the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1905. In Asia he oversaw the short, victorious war against China 1894‚Äì95. He negotiated Chinese surrender on terms aggressively favourable to Japan, including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the Chinese tribute system. He also gained control of the Liaodong Peninsula with Darien and Port Arthur, but was immediately forced by Russia, Germany and France acting together in the Triple Intervention to give that back to China. In the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1894, he succeeded in removing some of the onerous unequal treaty clauses that had plagued Japanese foreign relations since the start of the Meiji period. His major breakthrough was the Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in 1902. It was a diplomatic milestone, it saw an end to Britain's splendid isolation. The alliance was renewed and expanded in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911, before its demise in 1921. It was officially terminated in 1923.Ian Nish, The Anglo- Japanese Alliance: The diplomacy of two island empires 1894-1907. (1966) It≈ç sought to avoid a Russo-Japanese War through the policy of Man-Kan k≈çkan ‚Äì surrendering Manchuria to the Russian sphere of influence in exchange for the acceptance of Japanese hegemony in Korea. A diplomatic tour of the United States and Europe brought him to Saint Petersburg in November 1901, where he was unable to find compromise on this matter with Russian authorities. Soon the government of Katsura Tar≈ç elected to abandon the pursuit of Man-Kan k≈çkan, and tensions with Russia continued to escalate towards war.Edward, I. \\"Japan's Decision to Annex Taiwan: A Study of It≈ç-Mutsu Diplomacy, 1894‚Äì95.\\" Journal of Asian Studies 37#1 (1977): 61‚Äì72. Prime Minister Katsura Tar≈ç Prince Katsura Tar≈ç (1848‚Äì1913) was an unpopular prime minister in his three terms stretching off and on from 1901 to 1911. During his first term (1901‚Äì1906) Japan emerged as a major imperialist power in East Asia. In terms of foreign affairs, it was marked by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 and victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. During his tenure, the Taft‚ÄìKatsura agreement with the U.S. acknowledged Japanese hegemony over Korea. His second term (1908‚Äì1911) was noteworthy for the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty of 1910. ==1910‚Äì1941== The Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced European models. They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. the most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminum, 85 percent of the iron ore, and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies. It was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States Britain and the Netherlands, which supply the oil and iron. John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, and Albert M. Craig. East Asia: The modern transformation (1965) pp. 501‚Äì4. World War I Japan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains. Together with the British Empire it divided up Germany's scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference at the end of the war, Japan frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its demands for racial parity, and an increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system, and favored internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. East Asia: The modern transformation (1965) pp. 563‚Äì612, 666. Japan put heavy pressure on China in 1915, especially in the Twenty-One Demands. The U.S. helped China push back, thus moderating the pressure. LaFeber, Clash pp 109-16.Akagi, Japan's Foreign Relations 1542-1936 (1936) pp. 335‚Äì56. As the Russian pro- Allied state collapsed into Bolshevik central control and multiple civil wars on the Russian periphery, United States sent 8000 troops to Siberia, and Japan, sent 80,000. Japan's goal was to take control of the trans-Siberian Railroad, and adjacent properties, giving it massive control over Manchuria. The Americans were originally sent to help check prisoners escape, but increasingly, their role was to watch and block Japanese expansion. Both nations remove their troops in 1920, as Lenin's Bolsheviks solidified their control over Russia. LaFeber, Clash pp. 116‚Äì27. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Japan was given the mandate over a number of smaller islands that had been part of the German Empire. Japan was disappointed when its draft resolution condemning racism in international affairs, was dropped from the agenda. However, its main demand, which it pursued relentlessly, was to obtain permanent control of Germany's holdings in Shantung, China. which Japan had captured early in the war. China protested furiously, but have little leverage. The Shandong Problem appeared to be a Japan victory, but Tokyo soon had second thoughts as widespread protests inside China led to the May Fourth Movement led by angry radical students. Finally in 1922 with mediation by the U.S. and Britain Japan returned Shantung to China. Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six months that changed the world (2001) pp. 316‚Äì20, 332‚Äì44. Noel H. Pugach, \\"American Friendship for China and the Shantung Question at the Washington Conference,\\" Journal of American History (1977) 64#1 pp. 67‚Äì86. in JSTOR 1920s A sort of rapprochement took place between Washington and Tokyo, although there were still philosophical differences in their approaches. The Japanese operated in terms of traditional Power diplomacy, emphasizing control over distinct spheres of influence, while the United States adhered to Wilsonianism based on the \\"open door\\" and internationalist principles. Both sides compromised, and were successful in diplomatic endeavors such as the naval limitations at the Washington conference in 1922. The conference set a naval ratio for capital warships of 5:5:3 among the United States, Britain and Japan. The result was a de-escalation of the naval arms race for a decade. Sadao Asada, \\"Between the Old Diplomacy and the New, 1918‚Äì1922: The Washington System and the Origins of Japanese-American Rapprochement.\\" Diplomatic History 30.2 (2006): 211-230. Japan was outraged at the racism inherent in the 1924 American immigration laws, which reduced the long-standing Japanese quota of 100 immigrants annually to zero.Izumi Hirobe, Japanese pride, American prejudice: Modifying the exclusion clause of the 1924 Immigration Act (2001). Japan was likewise annoyed at similar restrictions imposed by Canada and Australia. David C. Atkinson, The Burden of White Supremacy: Containing Asian Migration in the British Empire and the United States (2016). Britain, responding to anti--Japanese sentiment in its Commonwealth, and in the United States, did not renew its two-decade-old treaty with Japan in 1923.Ian Nish, Alliance in Decline: A Study of Anglo- Japanese Relations, 1908-23 (1972). In 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy. Japan's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japan's prime minister and the military took more power, leading to the rapid decline in democracy. Japan seizes Manchuria In September 1931, the Japanese Army--acting on its own without government approval--seized control of Manchuria, an anarchic area that China had not controlled in decades. It set up a puppet government of Manchukuo. Britain and France effectively control the League of Nations, which issued the Lytton Report in 1932, saying that Japan had genuine grievances, but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province. Japan quit the League, Britain took no action. The US Secretary of State announces that it would not recognize Japan's conquest as legitimate. Germany welcomed Japan's actions.David Wen-wei Chang, \\"The Western Powers and Japan's Aggression in China: The League of Nations and 'The Lytton Report'.\\" American Journal of Chinese Studies (2003): 43‚Äì63. onlineShin'ichi Yamamuro, Manchuria under Japanese Dominion (U. of Pennsylvania Press, 2006); online review in The Journal of Japanese Studies 34.1 (2007) 109‚Äì114 online The civilian government in Tokyo tried to minimize the Army's aggression in Manchuria, and announced it was withdrawing. On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. The new Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi tried to negotiate with China, but was assassinated in the May 15 Incident in 1932, which Ushered in an era of ultranationalism led by the Army and supported by patriotic societies. It ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945. The Army, however, was itself divided into cliques and factions with different strategic viewpoints. One faction saw The Soviet Union is the main enemy, the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalized. Large-scale warfare, known as the Second Sino-Japanese War, began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the Nanking Massacre in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape. By 1939 military lines had stabilized, with Japan in control of the almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up. Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. East Asia: The modern transformation (1965) pp 589-613 In the U.S. government and public opinion -- even including those who were isolationist regarding Europe--was resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China. Meanwhile, the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with Soviet forces in Mongolia at Battles of Khalkhin Gol in summer 1939. The USSR was too powerful. Tokyo and Moscow signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941, as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently needed oil fields.Herbert Feis, The Road to Pearl Harbor: The Coming of the War Between the United States and Japan (1960) pp. 8‚Äì150. Army's role 1919‚Äì1941 The Army increasingly took control of the government, assassinated opposing leaders, suppressed the left, and promoted a highly aggressive foreign policy with respect to China.Andy Dailey, Move to Global War (2015) 205pp; pp. 9‚Äì53 on Japan's expansion Japanese policy angered the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.Roy Hidemichi Akagi, Japan's Foreign Relations 1542-1936: A Short History (1979) pp. 481‚Äì550 online Japanese nationalism was the primary inspiration, coupled with a disdain for democracy.James B. Crowley, Japan's quest for autonomy: National security and foreign policy, 1930-1938 (2015) ch 1. The extreme right became influential throughout the Japanese government and society, notably within the Kwantung Army, which was stationed in Manchuria along the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railroad. During the Manchurian Incident of 1931, radical army officers conquered Manchuria from local officials and set up the puppet government of Manchukuo there without permission from the Japanese government. International criticism of Japan following the invasion led to Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations.Kenneth Henshall, A History of Japan (2012) pp 114‚Äì115.Peter Duus et al. eds. The Japanese informal empire in China, 1895-1937 (2014). Japan's expansionist vision grew increasingly bold. Many of Japan's political elite aspired to have Japan acquire new territory for resource extraction and settlement of surplus population.Henshall, A History of Japan, 119‚Äì120. These ambitions led to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. After their victory in the Chinese capital, the Japanese military committed the infamous Nanking Massacre. The Japanese military failed to destroy the Chinese government led by Chiang Kai-shek, which retreated to remote areas. The conflict was a stalemate that lasted until 1945.S. C. M. Paine, The Wars for Asia, 1911-1949 (2012) pp. 123‚Äì70. Japan's war aim was to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a vast pan-Asian union under Japanese domination.Henshall, A History of Japan, 123‚Äì124. Hirohito's role in Japan's foreign wars remains a subject of controversy, with various historians portraying him as either a powerless figurehead or an enabler and supporter of Japanese militarism.Mark Weston, Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women (2002) pp. 201‚Äì203. The United States grew increasingly worried about the Philippines, an American colony, within easy range of Japan And started looking for ways to contain Japanese expansion.Greg Kennedy, \\"Filling the Void?: Anglo-American Strategic Relations, Philippine Independence, and the Containment of Japan, 1932‚Äì1937.\\" The International History Review (2017): 1‚Äì24. ==World War II== American attack lines against Japan, 1942‚Äì1945This map is at Biennial Reports of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army to the Secretary of War 1 July 1939-30 June 1945 p. 156 See full War Department Report American public and elite opinion‚Äîincluding even the isolationists‚Äîstrongly opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937. President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel in needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the Tripartite Pact, which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments‚ÄîJapan had little oil of its own.Conrad Totman, A History of Japan (2005). pp. 554‚Äì556. Japan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of coastal China by 1939, but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests and stepped up their commitment.Herbert Feis, China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission (1953) contents President Franklin Roosevelt arranged for American pilots and ground crews to set up an aggressive Chinese Air Force nicknamed the Flying Tigers that would not only defend against Japanese air power but also start bombing the Japanese islands.Daniel Ford, Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942 (2016). Diplomacy provided very little space for the adjudication of the deep differences between Japan and the United States. The United States was firmly and almost unanimously committed to defending the integrity of China. The isolationism that characterized the strong opposition of many Americans toward war in Europe did not apply to Asia. Japan had no friends in the United States, nor in Great Britain, nor the Netherlands. The United States had not yet declared war on Germany, but was closely collaborating with Britain and the Netherlands regarding the Japanese threat. United States started to move its newest B-17 heavy bombers to bases in the Philippines, well within range of Japanese cities. The goal was deterrence of any Japanese attacks to the south. Furthermore, plans were well underway to ship American air forces to China, where American pilots in Chinese uniforms flying American warplanes, were preparing to bomb Japanese cities well before Pearl Harbor.

Great Britain, although realizing it could not defend Hong Kong, was confident in its abilities to defend its major base in Singapore and the surrounding Malaya Peninsula. When the war did start in December 1941, Australian soldiers were rushed to Singapore, weeks before Singapore surrendered, and all the Australian and British forces were sent to prisoner of war camps. S. Woodburn Kirby, The War Against Japan: Volume I: The Loss of Singapore (HM Stationery Office, 195) pp. 454‚Äì74. the Netherlands, with its homeland overrun by Germany, had a small Navy to defend the Dutch East Indies. Their role was to delay the Japanese invasion long enough to destroy the oil wells, drilling equipment, refineries and pipelines that were the main target of Japanese attacks. Decisions in Tokyo were controlled by the Army, and then rubber-stamped by Emperor Hirohito; the Navy also had a voice. However, the civilian government and diplomats were largely ignored. The Army saw the conquest of China as its primary mission, but operations in Manchuria had created a long border with the Soviet Union. Informal, large-scale military confrontations with the Soviet forces at Nomonhan in summer 1939 demonstrated that the Soviets possessed a decisive military superiority. Even though it would help Germany's war against Russia after June 1941, the Japanese army refused to go north. The Japanese realized the urgent need for oil, over 90% of which was supplied by the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. From the Army's perspective, a secure fuel supply was essential for the warplanes, tanks and trucks‚Äîas well as the Navy's warships and warplanes of course. The solution was to send the Navy south, to seize the oilfields in the Dutch East Indies and nearby British colonies. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power.Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Willmott, A Gathering Darkness: The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific (2004) While the admirals were also dubious about their long-term ability to confront the American and British navies, they hoped that a knockout blow destroying the American fleet at Pearl Harbor would bring the enemy to the negotiating table for a favorable outcome. Dorothy Borg and Shumpei Okamoto, eds. Pearl Harbor as History: Japanese-American Relations, 1931-1941 (1973). Japanese diplomats were sent to Washington in summer 1941 to engage in high-level negotiations. However, they did not speak for the Army leadership that made the decisions. By early October both sides realized that no compromises were possible between the Japan's commitment to conquer China, and America's commitment to defend China. Japan's civilian government fell and the Army took full control, bent on war.

In 1937, the Japanese Army invaded and captured most of the coastal Chinese cities such as Shanghai. Japan took over French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) in 1940‚Äì41. After declaring war on the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands in December 1941, it quickly conquered British Malaya (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore) as well as the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). Thailand managed to stay independent by becoming a satellite state of Japan. In December 1941 to May 1942, Japan sank major elements of the American, British and Dutch fleets, captured Hong Kong,Oliver Lindsay, The Battle for Hong Kong, 1941‚Äì1945: Hostage to Fortune (2009) Singapore, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and reached the borders of India and began bombing Australia. Japan suddenly had achieved its goal of ruling the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.C.A. Bayly and T. N.

The caption reads: \\"With the help of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, the world can be in peace.\\" The ideology of Japan's colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two contradictory impulses. On the one hand, it preached the unity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, United States, and Europe in general. This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the crass materialism of the West.Jon Davidann, \\"Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period,\\" in Richard Jensen, et al. eds., Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century (2003) pp 21‚Äì43 In practice, it was a euphemistic title for grabbing land and acquiring essential natural resources.Ronald Spector, Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan (1985) pp 42, 62-64 The Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems.Aaron Moore, Constructing East Asia: Technology, Ideology, and Empire in Japan's Wartime Era, 1931‚Äì1945 (2013) pp 226‚Äì27 Economist Akamatsu Kaname (1896‚Äì1974) devised the \\"Flying geese paradigm\\" in the late 1930s that provided a model of imperialistic economic behavior. Corr√™a Malafaia, 2016 Japan (the lead goose) would specialize in high technology, high-value manufacturing. It would purchase food, cotton, and iron ore at artificially low prices from the trailing Co-Prosperity Sphere geese, and sell them high- priced final products such as chemicals, fertilizers, and machinery. These dealings were carried out by the powerful zaibatsu corporations and supervised by the Japanese government. The Flying geese paradigm was revived after 1950 and was given credit for the rapid economic growth of Japan's East Asia trading partners.Bruce Cumings, \\"The origins and development of the Northeast Asian political economy: industrial sectors, product cycles, and political consequences.\\" International Organization 38.01 (1984): 1‚Äì40. The Japanese Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas, but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil, but Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under Sukarno.Laszlo Sluimers, \\"The Japanese military and Indonesian independence,\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies (1996) 27#1 pp 19‚Äì36 Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.Bob Hering, Soekarno: Founding Father of Indonesia, 1901‚Äì1945 (2003) The Dutch destroyed their oil wells but the Japanese reopened them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan's oil shortage became increasingly acute. Puppet states in China Japan set up puppet regimes in Manchuria (\\"Manchukuo\\") and China; proper; they vanished at the end of the war.Frederick W. Mote, Japanese-Sponsored Governments in China, 1937‚Äì1945 (1954) Sh≈çwa Steel Works was a mainstay of the Economy of Manchukuo Manchuria, the historic homeland of the Manchu dynasty, had an ambiguous character after 1912. It was run by local warlords. The Japanese Army seized control in 1931, and set up a puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932 for the 34,000,000 inhabitants. Other areas were added, and over 800,000 Japanese moved in as administrators. The nominal ruler was Puyi, who as a small child had been the last Emperor of China. He was deposed during the revolution of 1911, and now the Japanese brought him back in a powerless role. Only Axis countries recognized Manchukuo. The United States in 1932 announced the Stimson Doctrine stating that it would never recognize Japanese sovereignty. Japan modernized the economy and operated it as a satellite to the Japanese economy. It was out of range of American bombers, so its factories were expanded and continued their output to the end. Manchukuo was returned to China in 1945.Margaret S. Culver, \\"Manchuria: Japan's Supply Base\\" Far Eastern Survey (20 June 1945), 14#12 12 pp. 160-163 in JSTOR When Japan seized control of China proper in 1937‚Äì38, the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army set up the Reorganized National Government of China, a puppet state, under the nominal leadership of Wang Ching-wei (1883‚Äì1944). It was based in Nanjing. The Japanese were in full control; the puppet state declared war on the Allies in 1943. Wang was allowed to administer the International Settlement in Shanghai. The puppet state had an army of 900,000 soldiers, and was positioned against the Nationalist army under Chiang Kai- shek. It did little fighting.Gerald E. Bunker, Peace Conspiracy: Wang Ching- wei and the China War, 1937‚Äì41 (1972)David P. Barrett and Larry N. Shyu, eds. Chinese Collaboration with Japan, 1932‚Äì1945: The Limits of Accommodation (2001) ==1945‚Äì1990s== American Occupation The Americans under General Douglas MacArthur were in ultimate command of Japanese affairs 1945‚Äì51. The other allies and former colonial possessions of Japan demanded revenge, but MacArthur operated a highly favorable system in which harsh measures were limited to war criminals, who were tried and executed.Philip R. Piccigallo, The Japanese on trial: Allied war crimes operations in the East, 1945‚Äì1951 (1980). Japan lacked sovereignty and had no diplomatic relations--its people were not allowed to travel abroad. MacArthur worked to democratize Japan along the lines of the American New Deal, with the destruction of militarism and monopolistic corporations, and the inculcation of democratic values and electoral practices. MacArthur worked well with Emperor Hirohito, who was kept on the throne as a symbolic constitutional ruler. In practice, the actual administration of national and government was handled by the Japanese themselves under Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru. His policy, known as the Yoshida Doctrine was to focus Japanese energies on rebuilding the economy, while relying entirely on the United States to handle defense and foreign policy generally. Yoshida shared and implemented MacArthur's goals was to democratize Japanese political, social and economic institutions, while completely de-militarizing the nation and renouncing its militaristic heritage. MacArthur ordered a limited rearmament of Japan the week after the war broke out in June 1950, calling for a national police reserve of 75,000 men, which would be organized separately from the 125,000 police force that already existed. The Coast Guard grew from 10,000 to 18,000. The argument that these were police forces for domestic internal use carried the day over the objections of the anti-militarists. However, Washington envisioned a quasi- military force that would use military equipment on loan from the United States. Japan now had a small army of its own. Japan became the logistical base for the American and allied forces fighting in Korea, with a surge in orders for goods and services that jump-started the economy.Richard B. Finn, Winners in peace: MacArthur, Yoshida, and postwar Japan (1992). pp. 263‚Äì69. The occupation culminated in the Peace Treaty of 1951, signed by Japan, the United States, and 47 other involved nations, not including the Soviet Union or either Chinese government. The occupation officially ended in April 1952.J.W. Dower, Empire and Aftermath: Yoshida Shigeru and the Japanese Experience, 1878-1954 (1988) pp. 369‚Äì70. American diplomat John Foster Dulles was in charge of drafting the peace treaty. He had been deeply involved in 1919, when severe reparations and the guilt clause was imposed against Germany at the Paris Peace Conference. Dulles thought that was a terrible mistake that energized the far right and the Nazis in Germany, and he made sure it never happened again. Japan was therefore not obligated to pay reparations to anyone.Seigen Miyasato, \\"John Foster Dulles and the Peace Settlement with Japan,\\" in Richard H. Immerman, ed., John Foster Dulles and the Diplomacy of the Cold War (1990): 189‚Äì212. \\"Economic Miracle\\" of 1950s From 1950 onward, Japan rebuilt itself politically and economically. The U.S. and its allies used Japan as their logistics base during the Korean War (1950‚Äì53), which poured money into the economy. Historian Yone Sugita finds that \\"the 1950s was a decade during which Japan formulated a unique corporate capitalist system in which government, business, and labor implemented close and intricate cooperation\\".Yoneyuki Sugita, \\"Enigma of U.S.-Japan Relations in the 1950s\\", Reviews in American History (2002) 30#3 pp. 477‚Äì485 in JSTOR, quoting p. 483 Japan's newfound economic power soon gave it far more dominance than it ever had militarily. The Yoshida Doctrine and the Japanese government's economic intervention, spurred on an economic miracle on par with that of West Germany a few years earlier. The Japanese government strove to spur industrial development through a mix of protectionism and trade expansion. The establishment of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was instrumental in the Japanese post-war economic recovery. By 1954, the MITI system was in full effect. It coordinated industry and government action and fostered cooperative arrangements, and sponsored research to develop promising exports as well as imports for which substitutes would be sought (especially dyestuffs, iron and steel, and soda ash). Yoshida's successor, Hayato Ikeda, began implementing economic policies which removed much of Japan's anti- monopoly laws. Foreign companies were locked out of the Japanese market and strict protectionist laws were enacted.Chalmers Johnson, Miti and the Japanese Miracle: The Growth of Industrial Policy, 1925-1975 (1982) Meanwhile, the United States under President Eisenhower saw Japan as the economic anchor for Western Cold War policy in Asia. Japan was completely demilitarized and did not contribute to military power, but did provide the economic power. The US and UN forces used Japan as their forward logistics base during the Korean War (1950‚Äì53), and orders for supplies flooded Japan. The close economic relationship strengthened the political and diplomatic ties, so that the two nations survived a political crisis in 1960 involving left-wing opposition to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The left failed to force the removal of large American military bases in Japan, especially on Okinawa.Sugita, \\"Enigma of U.S.-Japan Relations in the 1950s\\", Reviews in American History (2002) Shimizu argues that the American policy of creating \\"people of plenty\\" was a success in Japan and reached its goal of defusing anti-capitalist protest on the left.Sayuri Shimizu, Creating People of Plenty: The United States and Japan's Economic Alternatives, 1950-1960 (2001) In 1968 Japan's economy surpassed West Germany to become the second-largest economic power in the world after the United States. Japan ascended to great power status again. It kept the 2nd biggest economy position until 2011, when the economy of China surpassed it. ==See also== * History of Japan * Causes of World War II * Cold War ** History of Sino-Japanese relations, China ** France‚ÄìJapan relations ** Germany‚ÄìJapan relations ** Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, 1930‚Äì1945 ** History of Japan‚ÄìKorea relations ** Japanese foreign policy on Southeast Asia ** Empire of Japan‚ÄìRussian Empire relations to 1917 *** Japan‚ÄìSoviet Union relations, 1917‚Äì1991 *** Japan‚ÄìRussia relations, since 1991 ** Japan‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations ** Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations ==Notes Further reading== * Akagi, Roy Hidemichi.

It closed in 2000.Greyhound Derby Opening Dunmore was opened as Belfast's second track after Celtic Park by the United Greyhound Association (Northern Ireland) Ltd. The directors were James McKee (responsible for the McKee/Jim Scott electric hare) and Captain John Ross. The hare system was the first to use an underground wire and it was such a success that McKee and Scott started the M.S Cable Hare Company. McKee also introduced the automatic trap release. The circuit was located near the Antrim Road at Alexandra Park Avenue, North Belfast. Pre War History The track established itself as one of the largest circuits in greyhound racing with a huge 575 yard circumference and 22 feet wide, the test of a greyhound's stamina was quite tough being such a big galloping track but this also resulted in minimal racing injuries. A tote was installed in 1930 but only lasted until 1932 due to the government ban that year which forced tracks to shut down the betting facility. Second World War During World War II the stadium suffered severe damage which resulted in the main stand being burned down in the 1942 Belfast Blitz. The racing operation moved to across the city centre to Celtic Park for the remainder of the season before being able to race again the following year. It was in 1943 that the Irish National Sprint over 435 yards was introduced and this event earned classic status for sprinters. The first winner was Fair Mistress. Post War History The war ended and a rebuild took place in 1946 but without a tote because although UK tracks were allowed to operate totes the government ban in Northern Ireland remained in place. In 1951 the Smirnoff Puppy Cup started and in 1962 the National Sprint champion Tanyard Chief was drowned in the Belfast floods. Sixty on course bookmakers were operating on course in 1960, an unusually high amount but tote betting was still illegal in Northern Ireland at the time. In 1961 the Sean Graham 700 was introduced and Ian Ross was Racing Manager for thirty years. A leading greyhound called Yellow Printer made his racing debut on 6 June 1967. By 1974 the troubles were having a considerable bearing on business and financial problems began to mount, a new board of directors consisting of the Jim Delargy, Sean & Brian Graham took over at Dunmore on 1 April 1977. The board included Jack McKee and Jack Hynds. The same Delargy/Graham group would take over Celtic Park less than a year later. Guinness stepped in as the sponsors of the Irish National Sprint and the track became all sand in 1978. Sean Graham owned a bookmaking firm called Belfast Sporting and Leisure and they controlled the track in the 1980s, Sam Young became Racing Manager and an Australian Bramich hare was used, racing continued on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings. In 1981 the track introduced a new marathon distance of 1,005 yards, over six bends which indicated just how big the circumference of the track was. A totalisator was finally introduced in 1990. In 1983 the track was the first in Europe to install a Bramich hare. The track received no support from the Bord na gCon or support from the National Greyhound Racing Club adding to financial problems.

Granite-Bimetallic Mining Company of Philipsburg completed construction of the Georgetown Dam and powerhouse in 1900. By 1906, the powerhouse was supplying electricity to the smelter in Anaconda. In 1909 the Anaconda Copper Mining Company bought the dam and powerhouse. The Montana Power Company assumed control of power generation in 1912. The powerhouse operated until 1990, when Montana Power mothballed the facility and sold the dam and generation facilities to Granite County. The lake assumed the name of Georgetown when the dam flooded the area known as Georgetown Flats. Georgetown Flats was the location of a placer mining camp operated by George Cameron from 1867.

He was the president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Company from May 2017 to October 2020. He currently serves as Special Advisor to the company ==Early life, education, and family== The Hackett family originally moved to Central Ohio via County Carlow and County Galway in Ireland. Hackett is a 1977 graduate of the University of Michigan, where he played center on the football team. He holds a bachelor's degree in general studies. He and his wife, Kathy, have two sons. They reside in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ==Career== From 1977 to 1981, Hackett held sales and management positions at Procter & Gamble in Detroit, Michigan. Hackett spent thirty years with the Grand Rapids- based office furniture company Steelcase. He joined Steelcase in 1981, holding a variety of sales and marketing positions. In 1994, Hackett was named CEO at age 39, making him the youngest leader in the history of the company. He held the position for nearly twenty years before retiring in 2014. During his tenure, Steelcase eliminated nearly 12,000 employees as part of a downsizing and restructuring of the business; he also led the company to acquire a majority stake in IDEO in 1996. During this time Hackett became a proponent of design thinking, which focuses on how humans experience a product. Hackett stayed on as vice chairman of the company from 2014 to 2015. He was interim director of athletics at the University of Michigan, his alma mater, from October 31, 2014 to March 11, 2016. Hackett led the hiring of former San Francisco 49ers's coach and fellow U-M alumnus Jim Harbaugh as the university's football coach. He donated $300,000 of his annual $600,000 salary as interim athletic director to \\"Athletes Connected,\\" a program that's designed to support the mental health of student-athletes. In 2013, Hackett joined the Ford Motor Company's board of directors. He served on its Sustainability and Innovation Committee and the Audit and the Nominating and Governance committees. Hackett oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs at Ford Motor Company, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry. On May 22, 2017, Hackett succeeded Mark Fields as president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. He is also a member of the company's board of directors. The move came as Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10 percent reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018. Hackett serves on the board of directors for Northwestern Mutual Life in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the Steelcase Foundation in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He is a member of the executive committee of the board of directors for the National Center for Arts and Technology, as well as the boards of advisors to the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and the Life Sciences Institute at the University of Michigan. Additionally, he is a past president of the Institute of Design Board of Overseers at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In January 2019, Hackett sent an email to Ford employees that read, \\"2018 was mediocre by any standard. Yes, we made $7 billion last year. But think of it this way: this represents a 4.4 percent operating margin, about half what we believe is an appropriate margin. So we are aiming for much closer to $14 billion.‚Äù On August 4, 2020, Ford announced that COO Jim Farley will succeed Jim Hackett as the CEO of Ford on October 1, 2020. Jim Hackett will retire and become a special adviser. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Category:Ford executives Category:Living people Category:American manufacturing businesspeople Category:American chief operating officers Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:American people of Irish descent Category:1955 births Category:American chief executives in the automobile industry ","title":"James Hackett (businessman)"},{"id":"54108075","text":"The Tony Nancy Wedge was two different streamliner dragsters.Taylor, Thom. \\"Tony Nancy Gas Dragster\\", in \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\", p. 34.

He studied at Princeton University, which had a strong track and field team under coach Keene Fitzpatrick. In 1922, his junior year, Taylor won the 220-yard hurdles in 23.9 at the intercollegiate (IC4A) championships and in 24.6 at the AAU national championships; in the AAU meet he represented the New York Athletic Club. The following year he repeated as IC4A champion in the low hurdles (23.8) and placed a close second behind Allen Woodring in the 440 yards; his estimated time, 48.4, ranked him third in the world that year. Taylor won the 400 meters at the 1924 United States Olympic Trials in Cambridge, Massachusetts; he ran his lifetime best, 48.1, in the heats and repeated that time in the final, defeating the eventual Olympic silver medalist Horatio Fitch. At the Olympics in Paris Taylor qualified for the final; he remained in medal contention until his sore ankle gave way just before the finish.

Second Edition, Wild Nature Press, Plymouth, UK is a small marine red alga in the division of Rhodophyta. ==Description== Melanothamnus harveyi is a small marine alga which grows in tufts no more than high. The erect branches are formed by a central axis surrounded by four perecentral cells of the same length. A cortex may develop by cells growing downwards in the grooves between the perecentrals. Latteral branches are usually dense. The holdfast is a disk of downgrowing filaments from which further erect branches develop. The general appearance is very variable.Maggs, C.A. and Hommersand, M.H. 1993. Seaweeds of the British Isles Volume 1 Rhodophyta Part 3A Ceramiales The Natural History Museum, London ==Reproduction== This species is dioecious, meaning that individuals either have male or female reproductive systems. Spermatangial axes develop on trichoblasts. The cystocarps are globular borne on wide stalks. Tetrasporangia occur in series near the tips of the branches. ==Habitat== Melanothamnus harveyi grows epiphytically on other algae as well as on artificial material. ==Distribution== This species can be found in England, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, France,Denmark and the east coast of North America.Morton, O. 2003.

(August 28, 2020). Emotet: Why did the ‚Äòmost wanted‚Äô malware go on a 5-month hiatus? The Hindu. Retrieved: October 12, 2020. The malware, also known as Geodo and Mealybug, was first detected in 2014 and remains active, deemed one of the most prevalent threats of 2019. First versions of the Emotet malware functioned as a banking trojan aimed at stealing banking credentials from infected hosts. Throughout 2016 and 2017, Emotet operators updated the trojan and reconfigured it to work primarily as a \\"loader,\\" a type of malware that gains access to a system, and then allows its operators to download additional payloads. Second-stage payloads can be any type of executable code, from Emotet's own modules to malware developed by other cybercrime gangs. Initial infection of target systems often proceeds through a macro virus in an email attachment. The infected email is a legitimate-appearing reply to an earlier message that was sent by the victim. It has been widely documented that the Emotet authors have used the malware to create a botnet of infected computers to which they sell access in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, referred in the cybersecurity community as MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service), Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS), or Crimeware. Emotet is known for renting access to infected computers to ransomware operations, such as the Ryuk gang. As of September 2019, the Emotet operation continues to be active, running on top of three separate botnets called Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3. In July 2020, Emotet campaigns were detected globally, infecting its victims with TrickBot and Qbot, which are used to steal banking credentials and spread inside networks. Some of the malspam campaigns contained malicious document file with names dubbed ‚Äúform.doc‚Äù or ‚Äúinvoice.doc‚Äù. According to security researchers, the malicious document launches a PowerShell script to pull the Emotet payload from malicious websites and infected machines. == Noteworthy infections == * Allentown, Pennsylvania, city located in Pennsylvania, United States (2018) * Heise Online, publishing house based in Hanover, Germany (2019) * Kammergericht Berlin, the highest court of the state of Berlin, Germany (2019) * Humboldt University of Berlin, university in Berlin, Germany (2019) * Universit√§t Gie√üen, university in Germany (2019) * Department of Justice of the province of Quebec (2020) https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/09/12/les-pirates-informatiques-ont-pu- voler-tous-les-courriels * Lithuanian government (2020) == References == Category:Malware Category:Hacking in the 2010s ","title":"Emotet"},{"id":"54108261","text":"Uwe Marx (born 26 June 1964) is a German physician and biotechnologist, and is one of the world's leading researchers in the fields of organ-on-a-chip technology and antibody production.

It was originally established as an iron works in Dartford, Kent in 1785, with products including papermaking machines, steam engines and gun carriages, before it started producing refrigeration machinery in the 1880s. During the early 20th century, the company diversified to produce commercial vehicles (branded as Hallford, 1906‚Äì1926), lifts and escalators, before refocusing on its core refrigeration and air conditioning products in the late 1960s. The company retains a head office and some R&D; facilities in Dartford. ==History== The company was originally established in 1785 in Lowfield Street, Dartford by smith and millwright John Hall (1764‚Äì1836). Originally from Alton, Hampshire, the second son of a millwright who had previously worked in Dartford, Hall moved to Dartford in 1784, and was employed to repair a mill on the River Darent in Hawley, after which he set up his own business, repairing and maintaining machinery used in corn, paper, oil and powder mills in and around Dartford. Bryan Donkin was one of the firm's earliest apprentices. Around 1800, the firm moved to larger premises in Waterside (now Hythe Street) on land which had once formed part of Dartford Priory, where its association with Donkin, now involved in the area's papermaking industry, helped it expand in partnership with the Fourdrinier brothers and John Gamble, to make paper machines. Donkin, Hall and Gamble also collaborated on canning food in metal containers. Hall acquired Peter Durand's patent in 1812 and after various experiments, Donkin, Hall and Gamble set up a canning factory in Blue Anchor Lane in Bermondsey, the first cannery to use tinned iron containers. By late spring 1813 they were appointing agents on the south coast to sell the preserved food to outbound ships, and the British Admiralty placed large orders with the firm of Donkin, Hall and Gamble for tinned meat. The firm later merged into Crosse & Blackwells. As an iron foundry business, Hall's company subsequently built steam engines and gun carriages, and in 1881 developed horizontal dry air refrigeration machinery suitable for use on ships. Refrigeration ultimately became the company's core business. Commercial vehicles, lifts and escalators However, it also produced, from 1906 until 1926, parts for and then complete petrol-driven commercial vehicles. Initially, it manufactured chassis for heavy motor vehicles, including London buses, later also producing engines, with the vehicles branded as Hallfords (after its telegraphic address, a conflation of 'Hall' and 'Dartford'). Brewers and haulage contractors equipped their fleets with Hallfords, and the British Army deployed Hallford lorries during World War I. They continued to be sold until 1926. In the 1920s Halls started to manufacture passenger and goods lifts, taking over the Medway Safety Lift Company, and during World War II installing lifts in Royal Navy ships. Halls' lifts were also installed in buildings. During the 1930s Halls started to produced escalators under licence from a German company, with its products installed in Harrods and Selfridges, among other locations. In 1951, Halls were responsible for the modernisation of the Babbacombe Cliff Lift. They continued to make lifts and escalators until 1968 when that part of the business was sold to Otis. Refrigeration In 1886, J & E Hall's first cold air machines were used to freeze 30,000 mutton carcasses being shipped from the Falkland Islands to the UK. Three years later, installed a two-stage carbon dioxide compressor for a frozen meat store at London‚Äôs Smithfield Market. In 1910, it supplied refrigeration equipment to the National Skating Palace. Its machinery was used extensively on land: in London hospitals and hotels, by brewers, and in shops. In 1910, ammonia refrigeration was added to the Hall company refrigeration range. By the early 1920s J & E Hall had installed more than half of the world‚Äôs marine cargo refrigeration, while on land it was regarded as a world leader, expanding into CO2, methyl chloride and the use of fluorocarbons. In 1931 it provided compressors for the Grimsby Ice Factory, once the largest factory of its kind, supplying ice to fishing fleets in the world's largest fishing port. Merger and acquisition A June 1959 merger of Hall with Thermotank and Vent-Axia to form Hall-Thermotank proved a disaster. Profits fell, subsidiaries were sold, and the foundry closed. In 1968 the company decided to focus on the production of concentrate refrigeration units and air conditioners, producing small automatic compressors using methyl chloride as the refrigerant. The company's financial situation began to improve after a major reorganization in the 1970s. In 1976 Hall-Thermotank was acquired by the APV group and renamed APV Hall. In 1984 it was awarded a Queen's Award for Industry for the development of the Hallscrew single refrigeration compressor. In 1992 Vent-Axia, excepting its industrial division at Milton Keynes, was sold by APV to Smiths Industries. In 1994 APV Hall was acquired by McQuay International, then part of the Malaysian OYL group, and the J & E Hall name was reinstated. OYL became part of Japanese Daikin Industries Ltd in 2006. J & E Hall no longer has a factory in Dartford (the Hythe Street site is now a retail park), but retains a head office (in Hawley Road) and some R&D; facilities in the town. ==Association with Richard Trevithick== Plaque at St Edmund's Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford. It reads: \\"Richard Trevithick. Approximately 25ft from this wall lie the remains of Richard Trevithick. The great engineer and pioneer of high-pressure steam. He died at the Bull Inn, Dartford and was carried here by fellow workers of Halls Engineering Works. To a paupers grave. Born Illogan, Cornwall April 13th 1771. Died Dartford, Kent April 22nd 1833\\" J & E Hall is strongly associated with the late career of steam engine pioneer Richard Trevithick. In 1832, he was invited by John Hall to work on a steam engine at the Dartford works, and lodged nearby at The Bull (today The Royal Victoria and Bull Hotel) in High Street. In early 1833, Trevithick was taken ill with pneumonia and died at the Bull on the morning of 22 April 1833. Colleagues at Hall's works made a collection for his funeral expenses, acted as bearers, and paid a night watchman to guard his grave at night to deter grave robbers. Trevithick was buried in an unmarked grave in St Edmund's Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford. The burial ground closed in 1857, with the gravestones being removed in the 1960s. A plaque marks the approximate spot believed to be the site of the grave. The plaque lies on the side of the park, near the East Hill gate, and an unlinked path. ==Other notable engineers connected with J & E Hall== *Bryan Donkin *Thomas Pullinger *Walter Gordon Wilson ==ReferencesExternal links== * J & E Hall International Category:1785 establishments in England Category:Commercial vehicles Category:Companies based in Kent Category:Borough of Dartford Category:Elevator manufacturers Category:Food preservation Category:Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning companies Category:Daikin Category:Escalator manufacturers ","title":"J &amp; E Hall"},{"id":"54108278","text":"The canton of Bugey savoyard is an administrative division of the Savoie department, southeastern France.

Its purpose was to greatly increase the number of cadavers available for legal dissection in medical schools. ==History== The bill was proposed by John William Draper, co- founder and president of what is now the New York University School of Medicine. He noted a significant deficit in the number of cadavers available for dissection by medical students in his classes. Under previous state law, only executed criminals could be used. Draper proposed that \\"all vagrants dying, unclaimed, and without friends, are to be given to the institutions in which medicine and surgery are taught for dissection\\". A grace period of 24 hours before donation would allow families to claim those whom they wished to bury. Proponents of the bill argued that it ensured that criminals and the poor \\"will make some returns to those whom they have burdened by their wants, or injured by their crimes\\", and would further prevent body snatching. Protests against the bill took place in poorer areas of the city, and an anti- bill banner was included in the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade. The bill saw extensive debate in the legislature and in the media of the time. It was eventually passed by a single vote and made law on 3 April 1854. Outcomes of the bill were mixed: it succeeded in making more cadavers available for dissection and incidence of body snatching did decline, but enforcement was uneven and \\"commerce in bodies\\" as well as \\"anatomy scandals\\" continued for the next several decades. ==See also== * Anatomy Act 1832 * Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883 ==NotesReferences== * * Category:New York (state) law Category:Healthcare in New York (state) ","title":"Bone Bill"},{"id":"54108326","text":"Ruth Catlow (born 1968) is an English artist-theorist and curator whose practice focuses on critical investigations of digital and networked technologies and their emancipatory potential.

Wiggins began playing professionally at a young age. As Eddy Arnold's first hire, he developed a signature \\"ting-a-ling\\" sound that helped make Arnold the most popular country entertainer for a period. As Arnold moved towards pop music, Wiggins' instrumental work was faded to the background, and then dropped entirely. Wiggins then made several solo instrumental recordings, and toured with other country musicians. Late in life he played for tourists in Tennessee. ==Biography== Early life and career Wiggins was born Ivan Leroy Wiggins on June 27, 1926 in Nashville, Tennessee. At the age of six, Wiggins became fascinated with the Hawaiian guitars he heard on Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, and particularly the playing of Burt Hutcherson, who was also a family friend. Soon afterwards his mother purchased a guitar for him from a traveling salesman, and he began taking lessons from Robert E. Martin. He developed his skills quickly enough that by age fifteen he was playing professionally for Paul Howard and his Arkansas Cotton Pickers. Here Wiggins earned the moniker \\"Little\\" for both his youth and his small stature. In 1943 he joined Pee Wee King's band the Golden West Cowboys, an outfit which included Eddy Arnold. When King's regular guitarist, Clell Summey, returned from participation in World War 2, Wiggins was out of a job. With Eddy Arnold Soon after, still in 1943, Arnold left the Golden West Cowboys to pursue a solo career, and on the advice of King he hired Wiggins as the first musician in his new backing band. At the beginning of his time with Arnold, Wiggins played a Gibson EH-125, but he soon upgraded to the Gibson Console Grande model. Arnold promised Wiggins lifetime employment in 1945, on condition that Wiggins not embarrass Arnold. Arnold's sound, built around Wiggins' steel guitar playing, became enormously successful to the point that Arnold held the number-one position on Billboards country chart for forty weeks in 1948. As a result, Wiggins became one of the most-heard instrumentalists in country music, but he was considerably younger than most of his co-performers. He therefore felt ostracized by the other musicians, and he believed it adversely affected him psychologically. By 1952 Arnold was trending towards a more popular sound, and Wiggins' guitar work was moved towards the background. Further adding to Wiggins' discomfort were the actions of Arnold's manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Wiggins had been receiving $100 a week in sales commissions, but Parker began to claim all music and record sales commissions for himself. Although Arnold benefited financially from Parker's management, Wiggins did not replace the lost income. Wiggins did not appear at all on 1954's \\"I Really Don't Want to Know\\", and by 1955 Arnold had determined that his future was directly tied to popular music; thus Wiggins was utilized less and less as the 1950s progressed. Finding less to do with Arnold, Roy began making instrumental records in the mid-1950s. Some of these records were for significant mainstream labels such as Dot, others were for budget labels such as Diplomat, and others were for niche country labels large and small such as Starday and Stoneway. He also joined Arnold's accountant, Charles Mosley, in an insurance and real estate establishment in Brentwood, Tennessee. He became employed by Vox Instruments not only as a spokesperson, but as an agent to acquire the endorsements of other country-music instrumentalists. On Arnold's recordings, Steve Sholes would often mute Wiggins' guitar, which led to resentment on Wiggins' part. His last recording with Arnold took place in 1961, but Wiggins continued to tour with Arnold, was given a piece of Arnold's publishing company, and remained employed by him until 1968. Arnold would have kept Wiggins on his payroll, honoring the lifetime contract, but Wiggins desired a more active role in the music world. Wiggins took it personally that he was no longer needed by Arnold, and for years had dreams that Arnold would give him a call for another session or tour. Later career and life Wiggins owned and operated a music store close to the Grand Old Opry's Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville beginning in 1968, after leaving Arnold. He continued to work with the Opry, backing Ernest Ashworth, The Willis Brothers, and most significantly George Morgan, with whom he recorded and toured until Morgan's death. In 1972, Wiggins began hosting a radio show for WTMS in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The show, entitled Little Roy Wiggins Music City Show, originated from his music shop in Nashville. In 1973 Morgan recorded a tribute to Wiggins, \\"Mr. Ting-a-Ling (Steel Guitar Man)\\" which featured Wiggins' playing. Wiggins shut down his music store in 1974 when the Opry moved out of Ryman. In the 1980s he moved to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where he used to earn money by playing for tourists. He was included in the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1985. Later in life he suffered from severe diabetes, complications from which caused his death on August 3, 1999. ==Style== Wiggins' playing was highly influenced by the Hawaiian guitar, emphasizing sweetness in tone. His \\"ting-a-ling\\" sound, a \\"high-pitched, vibrating effect\\", was developed from listening to acoustic dobro players, particularly Brother Oswald, but the technique had not been used on the electric steel guitar until Wiggins adapted it at an octave higher for the style with which he was associated for his entire career. Wiggins' effect was accomplished by using the index finger and thumb to create a fast tremolo on adjacent strings, while simultaneously vibrating the steel bar to add additional vibrato. Wiggins continued to use the non-pedal steel long after the pedal steel guitar became the norm. Along with Jerry Byrd, Wiggins is considered the most influential of the early steel guitar players. He was a significant influence on Lloyd Green. ==Solo discography== Albums * \\"Little Roy Wiggins Salutes Eddy Arnold\\" (Starday, 1962) * \\"Songs I Played for Eddy Arnold\\" (Diplomat, 1963) * \\"The Fabulous Steel Guitar of Little Roy Wiggins\\" (Starday, 1964) * \\"18 All Time Hits\\" (Starday, 1966) Singles * \\"Bouquet of Roses\\" (Dot) ==References== Category:Dot Records artists Category:Starday Records artists Category:1926 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Musicians from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Guitarists from Tennessee Category:American country guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Steel guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Country musicians from Tennessee Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Roy Wiggins"},{"id":"54108525","text":"The canton of Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin is an administrative division of the Savoie department, southeastern France.

This painting seems to have been directly inspired by a Vermeer he would have seen in Amsterdam, Woman in Blue Reading a Letter. The use of the hairstyle, pose, table and indirect light all recall this painting, and the reduction of household items to a bare minimum of objects is typical of 17th-century Dutch interiors. This painting was painted a year after Hammershoi moved into his apartment at Strandgade 30 in Copenhagen. ==Description and interpretation== The work shows the artist's wife Ida reading a letter. She is standing near a table laid with a double coffee pot with one cup. The table, closed door behind her and the open door in front of her serve to anchor her position in the otherwise gray space. These and other architectural elements of this apartment were often painted by Hammershoi in this period.

Barron, ‚ÄòForster , Agnes (d. 1484)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 22 May 2017 It has been said that Stephen at some time in his life spent time in Ludgate Prison. His widow, Agnes, renovated and extended Ludgate and the Debtor's Prison and the practice of making the debtors pay for their own food and lodging was abolished. Her gift was commemorated by a brass wall plaque, which read: Devout souls that pass this way, For Stephen Foster, late mayor, heartily pray; And Agnes, his spouse, to God consecrate, That of pity this house made, for Londoners in Ludgate; So that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay, As their keepers shall answer at dreadful doomsday! Agnes' second marriage was to Robert Moreton. She was lending hundreds of pounds to others as well as keeping two French knights. They had been captured and they were waiting a ransom to be paid before they could return. The knights were considered an asset and she gave them to her son Robert. However we know from accounts that he had to pay to have one buried in 1482. She was close to her son Robert and when she died in 1484 she chose to be buried close to him. ==In literature== Agnes appears as a central character in William Rowley's (15861626) play A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed, based on her life.

An expanded system based on this program became the city's first ambulance brigade, transporting the sick and injured to Bellevue Hospital; the service was in operation by 4 June 1869. The initial ambulances were stagecoaches filled with \\"stretchers, a cabinet stocked with whiskey and bandages, a stomach pump for the poisoned and suicidal, and a straitjacket\\".
