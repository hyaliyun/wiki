Ltd., issued 1920 A train of the South Manchuria Railway The South Manchuria Railway' (: Japanese ; Chinese ), officially , or (') for short ( in Chinese), was a large of the Empire of Japan whose primary function was the operation of railways on the Dalian–Fengtian (Mukden)–Changchun (called Xinjing from 1931 to 1945) corridor in northeastern China, as well as on several branch lines. In 1905, after Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, this area was taken over by Japan as the South Manchuria Railway Zone. Mantetsu was established in 1906 to operate the railways taken over from the Russians. Subsequently, Mantetsu expanded by building new lines for itself and for Chinese-owned undertakings, and after the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo was established in 1932, it was also entrusted with the management of the Manchukuo National Railway. Between 1917 and 1925, Mantetsu was also responsible for the management of the Chosen Government Railway in Japanese- occupied Korea. However, it was also involved in nearly every aspect of the economic, cultural and political life of Manchuria,Kinney, Henry W., Manchuria Today, Dairen, December 1930 from power generation to agricultural research, for which reason it was often referred to as \\"Japan's East India Company in China\\". Nisshō Inoue, the founder of the interwar Japanese far-right militant organization Ketsumeidan (血盟団, League of Blood), was employed by Mantestu from 1909-1920. In 1945, the Soviet Union invaded and overran Manchukuo, and following Japan's defeat in the Pacific War, Mantetsu itself was dissolved by order of the American occupation authorities in occupied Japan. The railway was operated by the Soviets for a time, and handed over to China Railway after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Fengtian has been called Shenyang since 1945, and the line from there to Dalian is today part of the Shenda Railway from Changchun to Dalian, whilst the Shenyang–Changchun section is now part of the Jingha Railway; the branch lines have also been part of China Railway since then. History Locomotive for Asia Express Xinjing (Changchun) Railway Station Dining car of South Manchuria Railway The main line from Changchun to Port Arthur, as Luishun was called under Russian rule, was built between 1898 and 1903 by the Russians as the southern branch of their Chinese Eastern Railway according to the 1896 secret treaty and the 1898 lease convention between Qing China and Imperial Russia in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War. Following the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War and the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, most of the southern branch (Harbin—Port Arthur) of the China Eastern Railway was transferred to Japanese control. The last station remaining in Russian hands was at Kuanchengzi () in modern-day Changchun. The northernmost Japanese-controlled station was the Changchun railway station.Changchun Ⅱ- Le chemin de fer de Changchun \\"Provisional Convention ... concerning the junction of the Japanese and Russian Railways in Manchuria\\" – June 13, 1907. Under the authorization of Emperor Meiji, Japan then established a new semi-privately held company, the South Manchurian Railway Company (a.k.a. Mantetsu), with a capitalization of 200 million yen to operate the railroad and to develop settlements and industries along its route.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp 25 The organizing committee was headed by General Kodama Gentarō, and after his death, by General Terauchi Masatake. Count Gotō Shimpei, formerly the Japanese governor of Taiwan, was appointed the first president of the company, and the headquarters was established in Tokyo before relocated to Dalian in 1907.Coox, Nomonhan pp.6 One of the first tasks of the new company was to change the railway gauge. The rail line was originally built according to the gauge of , during the war it had been converted by the advancing Japanese troops to the Japanese gauge, in order to facilitate the use of rolling stock brought from Japan. But once the new Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company took possession of the line, it had the tracks re- gauged again, now to the gauge of , Luis Jackson, Industrial Commissioner of the Erie Railroad. \\"Rambles in Japan and China\\". In Railway and Locomotive Engineering, vol. 26 (March 1913), pp. 91-92 presumably with an eye to connecting the system to other railways of China. In 1907, an agreement was reached between the Japanese and Russian authorities about connecting the Japanese South Manchuria Railway with the line to the north, which remained in the hands of Russian China Far East Railway. According to the agreement, Russian gauge tracks would continue from the \\"Russian\\" Kuanchengzi Station to the \\"Japanese\\" Changchun station, and vice versa, tracks on the \\"gauge adapted by the South Manchuria Railway\\" (i.e., the standard gauge) would continue from the Changchun Station to the Kuancheng Station. By the end of 1907, the company employed 9,000 Japanese and 4,000 Chinese. By 1910, those numbers had increased to 35,000 and 25,000 respectively. The railway used a significant amount of U.S.-made rails and signaling equipment, as well as some steam locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company at Dunkirk, NY. A visiting executive from the Erie Railroad was quite impressed with the arrangement, and described South Manchurian Railway ca. 1913 as \\"the only railroad in the whole world that is like our American railroads (and they are, fairly speaking, the best)\\". Promotional postcard from the 1920s Mantetsu quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions, building coal mines at Fushun and Yantai, and harbor facilities at Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian. At each station, Mantetsu built hotels for travelers and warehouses for goods. Japanese settlers were encouraged through the construction of schools, libraries, hospitals and public utilities. The Mantetsu Research Wing was the centerpiece of Japan's colonial program, and instigated agricultural research into development of soybean farming. Land under cultivation expanded 70% in 20 years.Coox, Nomonhan pp.21 From 1916, Mantestu began to spin off a number of subsidiary companies, including Showa Steel Works, Dalian Ceramics, Dalian Oil & Fat, South Manchurian Glass, as well as flour mills, sugar mills, electrical power plants, shale oil plants and chemical plants.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp32 On 31 July 1917, the management of the Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu) in Japanese-occupied Korea was transferred from the Railway Bureau of the Government-General of Korea to Mantetsu, which established the Mantetsu Gyeongseong Railway Administration (, ; , Mancheol Gyeongseong Gwalliguk), and under Mantetsu control Korea's railway network was expanded rapidly. On 1 April 1925, management of Sentetsu was returned to the Railway Bureau, though Mantetsu retained control of the line along the Korea–Manchuria border from the port of Najin in Korea to Tumen in Manchuria and to Sangsambong in Korea. Mantetsu called this line the North Chosen Line, and it remained under Mantetsu control until 1945. Company assets rose from 163 million yen in 1908 to over a billion yen in 1930. Mantetsu was by far the largest corporation in Japan, and also its most profitable, averaging rates of return from 25-45 percent per year. During the 1920s, Mantetsu provided for over a quarter of the Japanese government's tax revenues.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp 31-32 Over 75% of Mantetsu's income was generated by its freight business, with the key to profitability coming from soybean exports, both to Japan proper and to Europe. Soybean production increased exponentially with increasing demand for soy oil, and for soy meal for use in fertilizer and animal feed. By 1927, half of the world's supply of soybean was from Manchuria and the efforts by Mantetsu to expand production and to ship to export ports was a classic example of an extractive colonial economy dependent on a single product. Advertisement in 1937 Mantetsu was also charged with a government-like role in managing the rail transportation system after the formation of Manchukuo in 1932, including management of the (theoretically independent) Manchukuo National Railway. By 1938, Mantetsu had 72 subsidiary companies, development projects in 25 urban areas and carried 17,515,000 passengers per year.Coox, Nomonhan, pp 1078 Between 1930-1940, the Japanese population of Manchukuo rose by 800,000 making ethnic Japanese the majority in many of the towns and cities served by Mantetsu. Mantetsu prided itself on state-of-the-art urban planning, with modern sewer systems, public parks, and creative modern architecture far in advance of what could be found in Japan itself. These things were possible due to Mantetsu's tremendous profitability, and its political power to seize property and silence opposition and dissent at will through its political connections to the military and totalitarian national leadership.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp.250 In 1934, Mantetsu inaugurated the \\"Asia Express\\", a high speed train from Dalian to the Manchukuo capital of Xinjing (Changchun). Reaching a top speed of , the \\"Asia Express\\" was the fastest scheduled train in Asia at the time. Changchun remained the break of gauge point between the Russian and standard gauges in the 1930s,Yesterday and To- day, The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 6, Issue 8 (April 1, 1932.) until the Chinese Eastern railway itself was bought by Manchukuo and converted to the standard gauge in the mid-1930s. In 1945, the Soviet Union invaded and overran Manchukuo. Rolling stock and movable equipment was looted and taken back to the Soviet Union; some was returned when the Chinese Communist government came into power. Mantetsu itself was dissolved by order of the American occupation authorities in occupied Japan. The People's Republic of China government later merged the northern half of the South Manchuria Railway's mainline (the Renkyō Line) with other railway lines to form the present Beijing–Harbin railway.

A Peltier cooler, heater, or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid-state active heat pump which transfers heat from one side of the device to the other, with consumption of electrical energy, depending on the direction of the current. Such an instrument is also called a Peltier device, Peltier heat pump, solid state refrigerator, or thermoelectric cooler (TEC). It can be used either for heating or for cooling, although in practice the main application is cooling. It can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools. This technology is far less commonly applied to refrigeration than vapor-compression refrigeration is. The primary advantages of a Peltier cooler compared to a vapor-compression refrigerator are its lack of moving parts or circulating liquid, very long life, invulnerability to leaks, small size, and flexible shape. Its main disadvantages are high cost for a given cooling capacity and poor power efficiency. Many researchers and companies are trying to develop Peltier coolers that are cheap and efficient. (See Thermoelectric materials.) A Peltier cooler can also be used as a thermoelectric generator. When operated as a cooler, a voltage is applied across the device, and as a result, a difference in temperature will build up between the two sides. When operated as a generator, one side of the device is heated to a temperature greater than the other side, and as a result, a difference in voltage will build up between the two sides (the Seebeck effect). However, a well-designed Peltier cooler will be a mediocre thermoelectric generator and vice versa, due to different design and packaging requirements.  Operating principle  Peltier element schematic. Thermoelectric legs are thermally in parallel and electrically in series. Thermoelectric coolers operate by the Peltier effect (which also goes by the more general name thermoelectric effect). The device has two sides, and when a DC electric current flows through the device, it brings heat from one side to the other, so that one side gets cooler while the other gets hotter. The \\"hot\\" side is attached to a heat sink so that it remains at ambient temperature, while the cool side goes below room temperature. In special applications, multiple coolers can be cascaded together for lower temperature, but overall efficiency drops significantly.  Construction   Design  Two unique semiconductors, one n-type and one p-type, are used because they need to have different electron densities. The alternating p & n-type semiconductor pillars are placed thermally in parallel to each other and electrically in series and then joined with a thermally conducting plate on each side, usually ceramic removing the need for a separate insulator. When a voltage is applied to the free ends of the two semiconductors there is a flow of DC current across the junction of the semiconductors causing a temperature difference. The side with the cooling plate absorbs heat which is then transported by the semiconductor to the other side of the device. The cooling ability of the total unit is then proportional to the total cross section of all the pillars, many are connected electrically in series to reduce the current needed to practical levels. The length of the pillars is a balance between longer pillars which will have a greater thermal resistance between the sides and allow a lower temperature to be reached but produce more resistive heating, and shorter pillars which will have a greater electrical efficiency but let more heat leak from the hot to cold side by thermal conduction. For large temperature differences longer pillars are far less efficient than stacking separate, progressively larger modules, the modules get larger as each layer must remove both the heat moved by the above layer and the waste heat of the layer.  Materials  ZT values for various materials and bismuth alloys. Requirements for thermoelectric materials: * Narrow band-gap semiconductors because of room-temperature operation; * High electrical conductivity (to reduce electrical resistance, source of waste heat); * Low thermal conductivity (so that heat doesn't come back from the hot side to the cool side); this usually translates to heavy elements * Large unit cell, complex structure; * Highly anisotropic or highly symmetric; * Complex compositions; Materials suitable for high efficiency TEC systems must have a combination of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. The combined effect of different material combinations is commonly compared using a figure of merit known as ZT, a measure of the system’s efficiency. The equation for ZT is given below, where alpha is the Seebeck coefficient, sigma is the electrical conductivity and kappa is the thermal conductivity. \\\\Z\\\\Tau=(\\\\alpha^2\\\\sigma\\\\Tau)/\\\\kappa There are few materials that are suitable for TEC applications since the relationship between thermal and electrical conductivity is usually a positive correlation. Improvements in reduced thermal transport with increased electrical conductivity are an active area of material science research. Common thermoelectric materials used as semiconductors include bismuth telluride, lead telluride, silicon germanium, and bismuth-antimony alloys. Of these bismuth telluride is the most commonly used. New high-performance materials for thermoelectric cooling are being actively researched. The working elements must be in an isolated casing, and the best geometry is a plane. Usually this will be them being sandwiched between a pair of ceramic plaques, sealed (or not).  Identification and characteristics  Peltier elements all conform to a universal identification specification The vast majority of thermoelectric coolers have an ID printed on the cooled side. These universal IDs clearly indicate the size, number of stages, number of couples, and current rating in amps, as seen in the adjacent diagram. Very common Tec1-12706, square of 40 mm size and 3-4 mm high, are found for a few dollars, and sold as able to move around 60 W or generate a 60°C temperature difference with a 6 A current. Their electrical resistance will be of 1-2 ohm magnitude.  Strengths and weaknesses  There are many factors motivating further research on TEC including lower carbon emissions and ease of manufacturing. However, several challenges have arisen.  Benefits  A significant benefit of TEC systems is that they have no moving parts. This lack of mechanical wear and reduced instances of failure due to fatigue and fracture from mechanical vibration and stress increases the lifespan of the system and lowers the maintenance requirements. Current technologies show the mean time between failures (MTBF) to exceed 100,000 hours at ambient temperatures. The fact that TEC systems are current- controlled leads to another series of benefits. Because the flow of heat is directly proportional to the applied DC current, heat may be added or removed with accurate control of the direction and amount of electrical current. In contrast to methods that use resistive heating or cooling methods that involve gasses, TEC allows for an equal degree of control over the flow of heat (both in and out of a system under control). Because of this precise bidirectional heat flow control, temperatures of controlled systems can be precise to fractions of a degree, often reaching precision of milli Kelvin (mK) in laboratory settings. TEC devices are also more flexible in shape than their more traditional counterparts. They can be used in environments with less space or more severe conditions than a conventional refrigerator. The ability to tailor their geometry allows for the delivery of precise cooling to very small areas. These factors make them a common choice in scientific and engineering applications with demanding requirements where cost and absolute energy efficiency are not primary concerns. Another benefit of TEC is that it does not use refrigerants in its operation. Prior to their phaseout some early refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), contributed significantly to ozone depletion. Many refrigerants used today also have significant environmental impact with global warming potential or carry other safety risks with them.  Disadvantages  TEC systems have a number of notable disadvantages. Foremost is their limited energy efficiency compared to conventional vapor-compression systems and the constraints on the total heat flux (heat flow) that they are able to generate per unit area. This topic is further discussed in the performance section below.  Performance  Peltier (thermoelectric) performance is a function of ambient temperature, hot and cold side heat exchanger (heat sink) performance, thermal load, Peltier module (thermopile) geometry, and Peltier electrical parameters. The amount of heat that can be moved is proportional to the current and time. :Q = PIt, where P is the Peltier coefficient, I is the current, and t is the time. The Peltier coefficient depends on temperature and the materials the cooler is made of. Magnitude of 10 watt per ampere are common, but this is offset by two phenomena: * According to Ohm's law, a Peltier module will produce waste heat itself, :Q_{waste} = RI^2 t, where R is the resistance. * Heat will also move from the hot side to the cool side by thermal conduction inside the module itself, an effect which grows stronger as the temperature difference grows. The result is that the heat effectively moved drops as the temperature difference grows, and the module becomes less efficient. There comes a temperature difference when the waste heat and heat moving back overcomes the moved heat, and the module starts to heat the cool side instead of cooling it further. A single-stage thermoelectric cooler will typically produce a maximal temperature difference of 70 °C between its hot and cold sides. Another issue with performance is a direct consequence of one of their advantages: being small. This means that * the hot side and the cool side will be very close to each other (a few millimeters away), making it easier for the heat to go back to the cool side, and harder to insulate the hot and cool side from each other * a common 40 mm x 40 mm can generate 60 W or more, that is, 4 W/cm² or more, requiring powerful radiator to move the heat way In refrigeration applications, thermoelectric junctions have about 1/4 the efficiency compared to conventional means: they offer around 10–15% efficiency of the ideal Carnot cycle refrigerator, compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression- cycle systems (reverse Rankine systems using compression/expansion). Due to this lower efficiency, thermoelectric cooling is generally only used in environments where the solid-state nature (no moving parts), low maintenance, compact size, and orientation insensitivity outweighs pure efficiency. While lower than conventional means, efficiency can be good enough provided * temperature difference is kept as small as possible, and, * the current is kept low, because the ratio of moved heat over waste heat (for same temperature on the hot and cool side) will be \\\\frac{Q}{Q_{waste}} = \\\\frac{P}{RI}. However, since the low current also means low amount of moved heat, for all practical purpose coefficient of performance will be low.  Uses  A USB-powered beverage cooler Thermoelectric coolers are used for applications that require heat removal ranging from milliwatts to several thousand watts. They can be made for applications as small as a beverage cooler or as large as a submarine or railroad car. TEC elements have limited life time. Their health strength can be measured by the change of their AC resistance (ACR). As a cooler element wears out, the ACR will increase. Consumer products Peltier elements are commonly used in consumer products. For example, they are used in camping, portable coolers, cooling electronic components and small instruments. They can also be used to extract water from the air in dehumidifiers. A camping/car type electric cooler can typically reduce the temperature by up to 20 °C (36 °F) below the ambient temperature, which is 25°C if the car reaches 45°C under the sun. Climate- controlled jackets are beginning to use Peltier elements. Thermoelectric coolers are used to augment heat sinks for microprocessors. Industrial Thermoelectric coolers are used in many fields of industrial manufacturing and require a thorough performance analysis as they face the test of running thousands of cycles before these industrial products are launched to the market. Some of the applications include laser equipment, thermoelectric air conditioners or coolers, industrial electronics and telecommunications,Using Peltier modules for thermal management of electronic systems. Electronics Weekly, 4 October 2017 automotive, mini refrigerators or incubators, military cabinets, IT enclosures, and more. Science and imaging Peltier elements are used in scientific devices. They are a common component in thermal cyclers, used for the synthesis of DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a common molecular biological technique, which requires the rapid heating and cooling of the reaction mixture for denaturation primer annealing and enzymatic synthesis cycles. With feedback circuitry, Peltier elements can be used to implement highly stable temperature controllers that keep desired temperature within ±0.01 °C. Such stability may be used in precise laser applications to avoid laser wavelength drifting as environment temperature changes. The effect is used in satellites and spacecraft to reduce temperature differences caused by direct sunlight on one side of a craft by dissipating the heat over the cold shaded side, where it is dissipated as thermal radiation to space. Since 1961, some unmanned spacecraft (including the Curiosity Mars rover) utilize radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that convert thermal energy into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. The devices can last several decades, as they are fueled by the decay of high- energy radioactive materials. Peltier elements are also used to make cloud chambers to visualize ionizing radiation. Just by passing an electric current, they can cool vapors below -26° C without dry ice or moving parts, making cloud chambers easy to make and use. Photon detectors such as CCDs in astronomical telescopes, spectrometers, or very high-end digital cameras are often cooled by Peltier elements. This reduces dark counts due to thermal noise. A dark count occurs when a pixel registers an electron caused by thermal fluctuation rather than a photon. On digital photos taken at low light these occur as speckles (or \\"pixel noise\\"). Thermoelectric coolers can be used to cool computer components to keep temperatures within design limits or to maintain stable functioning when overclocking. A Peltier cooler with a heat sink or waterblock can cool a chip to well below ambient temperature.Fylladitakis, E. (September 26, 2016) The Phononic HEX 2.0 TEC CPU Cooler Review. Anandtech.com. Retrieved on 2018-10-31. In fiber-optic applications, where the wavelength of a laser or a component is highly dependent on temperature, Peltier coolers are used along with a thermistor in a feedback loop to maintain a constant temperature and thereby stabilize the wavelength of the device. Some electronic equipment intended for military use in the field is thermoelectrically cooled.

Singapore exemplifies a case of a numerically weak opposition; South Africa under the apartheid regime maintained a long-term imbalance in the parliament. In some cases tame \\"opposition\\" parties are created by the governing groups in order to create an impression of democratic debate.

It lives on the islet Round Island (Mauritius), and typically dwells on different palm trees. The Round Island day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. Etymology The specific name, guentheri, is in honor of German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Phelsuma guentheri, pp. 110-111). Description P. guentheri is one of the largest living day geckos. Males can reach a total length of about , but often are much smaller. Females of this species are generally very much smaller than males. The body color is grayish or grayish brown. A dark-brown stripe extends from the nostril to above the ear opening. On the back, dark spots may be present. In some individuals, the legs and toes have light-yellow bars. The ventral side is white or yellowish. Geographic range P. guentheri originally occurred on Mauritius before rats and cats were introduced. Now, it inhabits only Round Island, north-northeast of Mauritius. Habitat P. guentheri is often found on bottle palms, fan palms (Latania loddigesii ), and Pandanus. Since much of the original vegetation is destroyed, by tropical cyclones, P. guentheri is forced to live in rocky crevices. Diet Round Island day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. Reproduction The females lay up to four pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after about 58–104 days. The juveniles measure . The eggs are laid normally in June, but can be laid from February to September. Care and maintenance in captivity These animals are endangered and were bred and kept by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust at Durrell Wildlife Park until 1999.

A drive-in is a facility (such as a restaurant or movie theater) where one can drive in with an automobile for service. At a drive-in restaurant, for example, customers park their vehicles and are usually served by staff who walk or rollerskate out to take orders and return with food, encouraging diners to remain parked while they eat. Drive-in theaters have a large screen and a car parking area for film- goers. It is usually distinguished from a drive-through, in which drivers line up to make an order at a microphone set up at window height, and then drive to a window where they pay and receive their food. The drivers then take their meals elsewhere to eat. Notably however, during peak periods, patrons may be required to park in a designated parking spot and wait for their food to be directly served to them by an attendant walking to their car, resulting in the perceived relationship between the two service-types. In the German-speaking world, the term is now often used instead of \\"drive-through\\" for that kind of service. In Japan, the term refers to a rest area. In France, this term has become popular because of American movies showing that kind of service, and more recently due to the expansion of fast-food restaurants. The first drive- in restaurant was Kirby's Pig Stand, which opened in Dallas, Texas, in 1921. In North America, drive-in facilities of all types have become less popular since their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, with drive-throughs rising to prominence since the 1970s and 1980s. The largest Drive-In still in operation is The Varsity of Atlanta, Georgia.  In popular culture  As a symbol of the 1950s, a drive-in is featured in many films and TV series about this period. The film American Graffiti (1973) has several scenes in or around a drive-in, while in Happy Days, \\"Arnold's Drive-In\\" is one of the main settings for much of the series.

Large diesel V20 engines have been used in diesel locomotives, haul trucks, electric generators and marine applications.  History  Mercedes-Benz MB 511 marine diesel engine Beginning in the late-1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced several large V20 diesel engines for use in marine applications. The first engine was the MB 501 which was based on the MB 500 V12 engine and was installed in the 1937 class Schnellboot (fast attack boat) and several submarines. Later versions included the supercharged MB 511 engine and the MB 518, which also added an intercooler. A copy of the MB 511 was produced by VEB Motorenwerk in Ludwigsfelde and called the VEB 20 KVD 25. Production of the MB 518 resumed in 1951, and a version of the engine was also manufactured by MTU, called the MB 20 V 672. The EMD 645E3 two-stroke V20 turbo-disel engine was used in 1960s diesel-electric locomotives such as the EMD SD45. The engine has a displacement of and produces a net traction of .

It portrays the lives of a group of anthropomorphic stuffed toys, robots, and pets. Many of the characters live together in the home of their owner, Chris, at the fictional address of 62 Achewood Court. The events of the strip mostly take place in and around the house, as well as around the town of Achewood, the fictional suburb which gives its name to the comic. The comic's humor is most often absurdist, typically lacking a traditional set punchline, and very often moves to the highly surreal. The world of the strip is expansive, featuring many major and minor characters with detailed backstories, and often references previous events, making it an ongoing narrative. As Onstad is a food and cooking enthusiast, many Achewood strips contain some reference to food or drink. Originally published regularly, the comic began to skip days in late 2010, and in March 2011 Onstad announced that Achewood would be going on indefinite hiatus.Hiatus, Explained Tenderly and with a Great Gentleness, 20 March 2011 \\"Chris Onstad's blog\\" In November 2011 the comic returned, followed by an announcement in December that the hiatus was over. However, Chris Onstad has stated that no regular schedule will be in effect, and new strips have been sporadic. Chris Onstad indicated in 2012 his plans for pitching Achewood as an animated series. No further news has come on this front, and the comic itself was not updated between April 7, 2014, and December 24, 2015. The strip returned on December 24, 2015, and was updated most subsequent Fridays. On December 25, 2016, Onstad announced that the strip was again on hiatus. History and overview The first Achewood strip (\\"Philippe is standing on it\\"Philippe is standing on it, 1 October 2001, Achewood) was released on October 1, 2001. The strip sets the tone for future strips with its nonsensical humor and flat visual punchline. In this particular strip, Mr. Bear and Téodor are discussing Téodor's confusion over a drum machine. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual. However, Philippe is standing on it. Throughout Achewood, there is no distinguishable underlying storyline—aside from, perhaps, the general passing of time and development of the comic's characters and their interrelationships. Onstad's preferred method of story-telling is to develop his characters through one-off strips and short story arcs. Strips are humorous, relying upon bizarre and chaotic humor as well as social stereotypes, obscure burlesque literary and historical references, and strong characterization of the comic's many quirky individuals. The humor often depends on an in-depth knowledge of the characters and their interactions; a drop-down box on the lower right side of the home page links to the beginning of 46 story arcs from 2002 to 2010. Story arcs are often interrupted as the main action \\"cuts away\\" to the activity of other Achewood characters, which may or may not tie in with the main storyline. Most strips include an alt text, a one-sentence aside written in Onstad's voice that appears when the reader hovers the cursor over the strip. The first alt-text was the word \\"snif\\" on Christmas, 2001. The first of the regular full-sentence alt-text appeared on January 2, 2002, apparently excusing a weak strip: \\"whatever. it was late and a friend was over.\\" The most frequently used font in the strip is Blue Highway, which does not contain any italic characters. Chris Onstad has self-published sixteen books: seven collections of Achewood comics, two books by character Nice Pete (\\"A Wonderful Tale\\" and \\"A Hilarious Comedy\\"), six 'zines by another named Roast Beef, and Recipes for a Lady or a Man: The Achewood Cookbook with recipes from several of the main characters. A second cookbook, titled \\"The Achewood Cookbook II\\" was announced and paid pre-orders were taken, but it never shipped. In October 2002, Achewood 's \\"Sunday Edition\\" became part of the online alternative comics anthology Serializer. In their review of serializer.net, The Comics Journal wrote: \\"It's a pleasure to see strips like Achewood's \\"Sunday\\" strip ... use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work ... would be perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper.\\" Achewood is sometimes featured in the Chaparral, Stanford University's humor publication, of which Onstad is an editor emeritus. On April 30, 2003, Onstad introduced a new feature to the Achewood universe—an advice column written by the character Ray called Ray's Place. The column has developed characters, mainly as perceived by Ray. It also allows for an interaction between reader and character, a novelty in comic art. July 2004 saw the introduction of several in-character blogs. The main characters all began writing (using Blogger) to speak to their audience. Onstad stated in an interview that he found the blogs easier to maintain than the strip, as they do not require as much refining. In late 2004, it was announced that Checker Book Publishing Group was to release a collection of Achewood comics later that year.Perigar, Mark A. (13 August 2004). \\"Checker-ed Past; Publisher keeps vintage, beloved works in print\\". The Boston Herald. The Edge; Pg. e35 Checker had signed Chris Onstad to a three-book deal that was to begin in November 2004. However, the deal was canceled soon after due to creative differences. On September 12, 2007, Achewood was named \\"Funniest Webcomic\\" by humor website Cracked.com. Chris Onstad participated in Song Fight! by creating cover art and title for \\"What We Need More of is Science\\", \\"Red Skates\\", and \\"Livin' At The Corner Of Dude And Catastrophe\\". The first title originated as a Roast Beef expression on merchandise. One Song Fight entry was performed by Milwaukee Youth Center Choir, who also wrote and recorded a theme for Ray's Place, Ray's advice column. An entry by MC Frontalot won the latest Song Fight and is now the current theme song for the comic. Time Magazine named Achewood its #1 Graphic Novel of 2007. On September 10, 2008 Dark Horse Comics published a 104-page extended version of \\"The Great Outdoor Fight\\" story arc, with a deleted scene, background material on the Fight and other original content. As the strip has developed, individual comics have become generally longer, moving from three to four panels on a single line per comic to large comics incorporating dozens of panels on 10 or more lines. Dark Horse has subsequently published, in October 2009, the first several years of Achewood comics under the title of Achewood Volume Two: Worst Song, Played On Ugliest Guitar, including notes on each strip by Onstad. A third volume, Achewood Volume Three: A Home For Scared People, was published in December 2010 and contains strips up to the end of October 2002. The regular appearance of new comics slowed considerably in late 2010. On March 20, 2011, Chris Onstad posted on his blog that Achewood would be on indefinite hiatus. Between November 2011 and June 2012, Onstad posted comics on an erratic basis, with up to four comics per month, then resumed regular, weekly new comics from August 2013 to April 7, 2014. Onstad resumed posting comics on December 24, 2015, with the first new strip in 20 months, and continued to update the site on most subsequent Fridays throughout 2016. On December 25, 2016, Onstad announced that he was \\"walking away\\" from the strip and it would be entering another extended hiatus period. Etymology According to the comic's official website, \\"achewood\\" was an ingredient used by slaves during the United States of America antebellum in the production of \\"achewater\\", a now outlawed Southern drink with psychedelic properties, similar to the use of wormwood in the production of absinthe. This liquor would supposedly induce melancholia in the drinker, hence the name. The Underground The Achewood Underground is an underground version of the human city above, inhabited and run by animals both stuffed and real, as well as several robots. The underground has its own businesses and establishments that parallel those above ground, and its inhabitants often steal or borrow things from their human counterparts aboveground. Aside from Achewood, it is assumed that most cities around the world have their own undergrounds as well.Lore Day One, 10 October 2003, Achewood The Overground The geography of the Achewood OvergroundMap of Achewood Overground, 3 January 2005, Achewood is based on that of the Palo Alto/Stanford area. Dexter University corresponds to Stanford University, Achewood Heights is equivalent to Menlo Park, East Achewood is analogous to East Palo Alto, and the Achewood Estates/Achewood areas refer to different areas of Palo Alto. Major characters  Raymond Quentin Smuckles  Raymond Quentin \\"Ray\\" SmucklesRay's Baseball Card, June 25, 2007, Achewood is a cat, specifically, an American Curl, a breed that originated from Lakewood, California. Ray is financially successful after selling his soul to the devil in exchange for success in pop music. He claims to have expertise in such diverse fields as cookery, alcohol, underground street dancing, piano playing, entrepreneurship, and women. Ray made his first appearance on January 10, 2002. Along with his best friend Roast Beef, Ray has become the central character of the strip; their relationship lies at the heart of Achewood. Ray can be identified by his designer glasses, his habitual wearing of a thong since the January 14, 2002, strip,Dirty-talk montage, January 14, 2002, Achewood the occasional fur coat, and a gold medallion which once belonged to the fictitious Incan Fun God, \\"King Chochacho\\".King Chochacho, June 1, 2005, Achewood Ray often speaks of his heritage: his mother's family, the Culpeppers, are French Catholic Southern gentry, while his father's, the Smuckles, are a diverse collection of tough, philosophical underworld characters (more below). Ray tends to be rather lucky, acquiring money in a variety of ways, including a record contract with Sony (after selling his soul to the devil for a piano that grants the buyer musical geniusRay and the Piano, November 4, 2002, Achewood), an auspicious eBay purchase of vintage erotica valued at 600 million dollars, and various business ventures. Ray is Founder, President and CEO of Prime Time Records, which releases mostly rap music. Through eBay Platinum Reserve, he now owns Airwolf, Keith Moon's head, and the world's biggest laser. He enjoys throwing lavish parties with unusual themes. Ray drives a Cadillac Escalade. He is very generous to his friends and to people in general, but on an entirely random basis and interspersed with long periods of outright rudeness and total insensitivity. He also has a very serious obsession with Ketel One and Zinfandel alcohols. Although Ray personally obtained his musical skills from a deal with the devil, there has been at least one other musical genius in his lineage: his paternal grandfather Antonyne Cheops Smuckles, better known as the legendary bluesman Rustmouth Chafings. On the other hand, he has a weakness for gambling, and often loses up to thousands of dollars while playing golf and pool with his friends. Ray has a penchant for prank calls, whether outgoing (Marmaduke, Cathy) or incoming (telemarketers). Although he has never openly admitted it, it is clear that he has a sexual fetish for women sitting on birthday cakes, as the subject has come up several times in connection with Ray. Ray drinks alcohol throughout the day; numerous strips imply that he is an alcoholic, and his physician, Dr. Andretti, has repeatedly warned him that he is in severe danger of becoming diabetic. (Ray is somewhat overweight and potbellied.) A few years into the strip Ray learned his father, Ramses Luther Smuckles, won the 1973 \\"Great Outdoor Fight\\", a fictional free- for-all combat challenge that allows only one entrant among three thousand to emerge victorious. This inspired Ray to enter the 2006 Fight, where he defeated everyone else in the Fight except for Roast Beef (see below), and demolished the Fight grounds when he discovered that Fight regulations required that he beat Beef to unconsciousness in order to win. Ray has at least one half-brother, named Dornheim Smuckles who is also the son of Ramses Luther Smuckles. A young cat who lives with Ray—Charley \\"Little Nephew\\" SmucklesRay Discovers Little Nephew, November 4, 2005, Achewood—refers to him as \\"Uncle.\\" Little Nephew's parentage has never been clearly established. Recently, Little Nephew began a friendship with Molly's long-deceased brother Taffy. Molly's father Iowerth appears to have killed Little Nephew in order to bring him back to what is either 17th-century Wales or an afterlife which resembles it, in order to keep Taffy company. When threatened with legal action based on Little Nephew's truancy, Ray traveled through time to retrieve him, and though he later had a change of heart and gave Charley his blessing to return to ancient Wales, the magic poncho he used no longer works, and it can be assumed that Little Nephew still lives with Ray. Ray writes an advice column \\"Ray's Place\\" on the Achewood site, though there is a disclaimer at the bottom warning that the advice is in fact from a cartoon cat, and perhaps should not be taken very seriously. Ray's Place had appeared to have been abandoned in 2007, however a new one was written in July 2010. Ray was originally introduced as a minor supporting character, part of a trio of cats (along with Roast Beef and Pat) who were always seen together, and fancied themselves \\"the dirtiest dudes in town\\" due to their reputed penchant for foul language.The dirtiest dudes in town, January 10, 2002, Achewood As time passed, Onstad began to give the three cats individual personalities, and before long the focus of Achewood began to move away from the four stuffed animals living in the Onstad residence and onto Ray and Beef, making them breakout characters. The increasingly abrasive Pat remained in a supporting role, eventually turning the trio into a duo. Ray is a member of a Syndicate of other flamboyantly rich, jive-talking cats, including \\"AKKOLADE\\" and Bensington Butters, his rival. They spend their time at theme parties and weekend retreats while plotting to sabotage each other's images. \\"Roast Beef\\" Kazenzakis Roast Beef Kazenzakis' birth name was \\"Cassandra\\", Beef's Real Name, December 2, 2002, Achewood as he was born intersex and the doctor mistakenly predicted that he would develop female characteristics. It has never been explained where the \\"Roast Beef\\" nickname originated, though he was seen to have it in flashbacks to his early childhood. Beef, like Ray, is a cat, and is interested in computer programming. He has a wife, Molly Sanders, whom he met in heaven during a near-death experience. Beef \\"visited\\" Molly there twice: once after being shot by Pat and once after driving a golf cart off a cliff while high on marijuana.runaway golf cart, June 27, 2003, Achewood Molly eventually moved to Earth to be with Beef, who asked her to marry him on June 7, 2007,Nick Hornby said it first, June 7, 2007, Achewood with the wedding taking place on 5 July 2008Wedding Invitation., May 23, 2008, Achewood (the actual wedding comic was posted on 15 July,The Math., July 15, 2008, Achewood but subscribers to Achewood's Premium Updates were able to follow the wedding taking place on the 5th). Roast Beef has one brother, Michael Kazenzakis, who goes by the name 'Showbiz' and enjoys drinking Tequizas. Showbiz attempted to sabotage Roast Beef's wedding, for the sole reason that he believed that once married, Molly would prevent Beef from loaning him any more money. Fortunately, he was foiled in this endeavor, as Beef anticipated such action from Showbiz and arranged things so he'd be arrested and stay in jail for the duration of the wedding.Bachelor Pre-Party., June 20, 2008, Achewood Roast Beef had a desperately unhappy and impoverished childhood,Roast Beef's Mom Shoots His Dad, June 30, 2005, AchewoodLittle League Drinks, July 22, 2005, AchewoodHumorous Baby Onesies, April 19, 2005, Achewood ranging from simple lack of food due to poverty to an incident where he overheard his mother killing his father, apparently in self-defense. He does not like to discuss his childhood, generally referring to it simply by saying he is \\"from Circumstances\\". Beef has seemingly incurable depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and/or Avoidant personality disorder, and considers suicide often, though no one seems to care. Recently however, his depression seems to have improved, particularly since he met Molly. Molly has also gotten him a light therapy lamp,Beef, Depression, Toast, December 5, 2006, Achewood which helps when he remembers to use it.Beef's Anti-Depression Lamp, November 20, 2006, Achewood For a long time he lived in a trailer with his abusive grandmother, Gramma K., but has since moved out of the trailer and into Ray's pool shed. His speech balloons use a slightly smaller font than that of other characters and rarely include punctuation, to emphasize his timidity and unique manner of speech. Roast Beef possesses an impressive vocabulary and will, on occasion, sprinkle words such as \\"insatiable\\", \\"phenomena\\", or \\"corpulent\\" into his normally slang-filled dialogue. He has been shot at least four times. One shootingGunshy, September 16, 2002, Achewood lodged a bullet in his spine, which grants him permanent wireless Internet access (though this has only been mentioned onceCode Levels of Dating Beef, September 23, 2002, Achewood since, and he still uses physical computers to access the net). Another shooting resulted in his cardio-pulmonary system being replaced by that of an AIBO.The Six Hundred Dollar Man, March 18, 2003, Achewood He has also been shot at least one additional time by Ray and once fatally by Lie BotChickenheads Eating Domino's Crazy Stix, 3 June 2004, Achewood (who was masquerading as Ray's uncle Culpepper). Roast Beef's birthday is April 22.Roast Beef's Birthday, April 22, 2002, Achewood Some of his accomplishments include a program that determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed to get into the Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the Moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet.Butterball Hotline, December 10, 2003, Achewood He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even Got To Do A Thing. Roast Beef has written a number of poems, both in the strip and on his blog. A recurrent theme involves weapons disguised as food, and these normally conclude with 'OHHH SHIIIT!'. According to Onstad, Roast Beef is one of several important foils to the increasingly central character of Ray. Ray's consistent optimism, sexual bravado, unwavering confidence, privileged upbringing, simple attitudes, and good luck makes him seem on the surface a complete antithesis of character to Roast Beef. Regardless, the two have been close friends since childhood, and it may be observed that as the strip progresses, each occasionally adopts the attitudes and perspectives of the other. The two do, of course, have a few points of dissent: Roast Beef is somewhat more sympathetic to Little Nephew than his Uncle Ray, and has taken issue with Ray's alcoholism. Philippe Philippe is an undyingly optimistic and naïve young otter who resides in the house with Cornelius Bear, Lyle and Téodor, as well as Chris and Chris's family. His housemates collectively raise him with varied success,King Piss!, October 19, 2005, Achewood with Téodor acting as a nurturing motherly-type, Lyle as a neglectful big brother, and Mr. Bear as a stern but gentle father. He is separated from his mother, who lives in Ohio,Philippe's Text Adventure, March 4, 2008, Achewood but they talk on the phone frequently and have a close relationship. (At the time the Achewood cookbook came out, she was in Iowa.) Other than the fact that he is deceased, nothing is known about Philippe's father, although he appeared in one strip thus far in a dream. He is implied to be of French descent, and to have fought in a war as a youth. From time to time, Philippe's mother sends him unusual presents.Philippe's New Shoes, June 10, 2002, Achewood Philippe seems to be perpetually five years old, and celebrates his fifth birthday every year. A strip which revealed the future of the Achewood charactersThe Future, October 2, 2007, Achewood showed that Philippe will still be the same age, even after the other characters grow old and die. A later comic has Philippe returning home to live with his mother once again, with further evidence toward his agelessness.The Arithmetic, April 13, 2010, Achewood A song by the synth-pop band Freezepop titled \\"Here Comes a Special Boy\\" about the character of Philippe can be downloaded from Freezepop's website.Here Comes a Special Boy , Freezepop Additionally, the Song Fight! entries for \\"What We Need More Of Is Science\\" by Brody and Octothorpe are two different versions of the same song about Philippe.

He also owned (and presumably played) a French horn, though Ray wound up stepping on it by mistake.Ray's Lolcat Regrets, 18 July 2007, Achewood Mr. Bear seems to command respect from nearly every member of the cast — with the noteworthy exception of the brash and petulant Lyle.

The naming of said pub has been the subject of much deliberation between the two characters although at the time of writing it was designated \\"The Dude and Catastrophe\\". Onstad said that the pub is \\"like a Cheers-type place.\\" Cornelius has recently begun dating a stripper named Polly. She is literally half his age, but appears to be far more socially adjusted than expected, and this openly baffles the rest of the cast.

He recently returned from Scotland where he meant to learn how to make Scotch, but instead became trapped at a finishing school, where it was revealed that when he is not completely soused, Lyle is surprisingly intelligent and erudite, concocting an elaborate plan to escape from the finishing school that involved spicing the bland meals in the cafeteria to make them more delicious, so that the staff would feel more relaxed before he even attempted to leave. Despite this, he is clearly far more comfortable with himself while intoxicated; the blog entry that confirmed the success of his escape was supposedly written from a bar, and was a barely legible mess. He's also often seen wearing a Misfits T-shirt. He lives at 62 Achewood Court. Due to a combination of an illegal u-turn and some word salad, Lyle is a Registered Asshole in the State of California, complete with card and legal obligation to inform all neighbors within a five-block radius of his new statusLyle in traffic court, August 27, 2007, Achewood He is an extremely heavy drinker, who often vomits around the house after drinking, sometimes deliberately.Yet Another Alternative Energy Source, June 8, 2007, Achewood In the Achewood cookbook, Lyle says that he has held every kind of kitchen job, \\"from dishwasher to sous\\" (meaning sous chef). Lyle is close friends with Todd T. Squirrel, who shares his love of inebriation. Téodor Orezscu Téodor is a teddy bear, as evidenced by his portrait. He and his family originate from Minsk, Belarus (his father was an actuary) and is apparently of Jewish descent.Jewish Supplies, March 7, 2007, Achewood He is a skilled cook, musician and graphic designer, and is also an all around friendly guy. He was originally quite crazy and uninhibited, exhibiting nudist tendenciesHey, you're the best!, January 25, 2002, AchewoodWe're into education now., January 28, 2002, Achewood in early Achewood strips, though he seems to have calmed down a bit over the years. While talented and intelligent, Téodor is also portrayed as lacking motivation and direction. A large exception to this is the considerable amount of time he is shown exercising or cooking, of which he is especially fond (every Achewood character has at least a slight interest in cooking, but Téodor's talent in this area is the most proficient). He had an online relationship with a girl named Penny, and eventually it is shown how the relationship ended up. Penny made Téodor the T-emblazoned sweater he wears, leaving it as a gift for him in the April 18, 2002, comic. While the other stuffed animals of the house treat Phillipe as a roommate, Téodor instead fills the role of Phillipe's guardian while the young otter is separated from his mother; he goes as far as to buy numerous child-care books, and, after being forced to expose the boy to Chick Tracts, diffused the effect of the prejudiced papers by making his own, nonsensical tracts to mix in with them.Achewood \\"Educating Phillipe\\", August 19th, 2008 He has appeared in numerous strips recreationally using marijuana and seems to also be a user of psychedelic mushrooms.Who ate my 'shrooms?, October 4, 2001, Achewood Téodor's birthday is in early October.Téodor's birthday presents, October 2, 2001, Achewood In 2001, Lie Bot predicted Téodor's death would be on April 28, 2005.Achewood, \\"Old home movies\\", December 28th, 2001 Téodor did in fact die on that date,Téodor dies., April 28, 2005, Achewood after he choked on a Grolsch bottle cap whilst watching a pornographic film.

Onstad has claimed in at least one interview that Téodor is the most autobiographical of the strip's characters, as they are both self- conscious cooks. Patrick Reynolds Pat is one of the three original cat characters, along with Roast Beef and Ray. Over the years, his role has receded into the background, but his is still a notable presence. He is a generally unpleasant character — he typically plays the antagonist — and seems to hate anyone that does not live up to his impossibly high standards of behavior. He seems to suffer from Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and has some anger management problems, for which he attends a support group. Raymond's mother revealed that Pat also suffers from Crohn's disease, though this could be attributed to some slight senility of hers. Pat's interests in veganism, Zen Buddhism and his unusual stances on various issues seem to be driven less by an appreciation of the philosophies, but more by a desire to feel superior to his friends, and indeed the rest of the world; a \\"magical Mexican realism\\" camera, which shows people as they truly feel about themselves, rather than printing an actual photograph of the person, revealed that despite his aggressive veganism, Pat would prefer to eat large quantities of meat.Magical realism camera from Mexico, July 31, 2006, Achewood He will often boycott companies at the slightest perceived provocation. His elitist, negative attitude extends to a particular focus on barbers and hairstylists, whom he absolutely despises, for reasons that are never made clear, as well as toll booth operators, Mexican motorists,Pat is quick to generalize, December 2, 2004, Achewood and employees with disabilities. Pat constructed the rocket that Roast Beef stole and rode to the moon. He is technically on the run after escaping from jail (he was convicted for shooting Roast Beef, and later shot Mr. Bear as well, probably by accidentCornelius Is Grappa-Shot, November 22, 2004, Achewood), but it does not seem to have affected his lifestyle due to Ray's connections getting him off the hook. He lives quite comfortably on the lam with Peter \\"Nice Pete\\" Cropes, a serial killer he met in jail. Nice Pete also attends his support group, implying that the two are quite close. After being electrocuted due to a prank by Lyle and Philippe, he temporarily became much nicer.,Nice Pat, September 24, 2003, Achewood only to turn back to his usual unpleasant self after being shocked again.

(Pat's Father), August 12, 2005, Achewood The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time.Support Group...Did Pat Cry?, July 8, 2005, Achewood In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced out into the open by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle,Gladdington Castle, August 7, 2006, Achewood wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason to be angry at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star. Molly Sanders A cat, and Roast Beef's wife. Molly was born in seventeenth-century Wales. She died in the wreck of the Gwynqeathe in 1676 and went to Heaven, where she was able to keep up on developments in the living world and became interested in modern technology.Interview: Molly Sanders AKA Miss Lady, January 23, 2007, Achewood Roast Beef first met her in Heaven after Pat shot him. Molly now resides on Earth, living in Ray's pool shed with Roast Beef. Roast Beef's lack of social skills means their relationship is often strained, but Molly's extraordinary patience and tolerance (and Beef's willingness to go along with her sexual adventurousness) often win out. Molly may have been a programmer while in Heaven (presumably self-taught), but since she died long before computers and coding were invented she has no \\"earthly\\" qualifications as such. She has been working in the service industry since coming back to life; she has implied in her blog that she is unable to get better work because she does not have a social security card. She has held jobs at various bars and restaurants, including Applebee's, Taco Bell (from which she was fired), and The Smoke (a local bar in the Underground). For a time, Molly worked at an \\"upscale tex-mex place\\" called Butte, until a fire forced its closure. Molly was involved in \\"sandwich porn\\" for Vlad when she worked at his Subway restaurant, eating client-ordered sandwiches on a live webcam show, fully clothed and in a broom closet, though Beef demanded that she stop once he found out.Vlad's Latest Subway Venture, January 20, 2005, Achewood Molly has now secured a job at Starbucks which she claims makes her \\"the hub of Achewood's social universe.\\" She has been running the \\"Achewood A-List\\" off and on since December 2005 (officially named on December 19, 2005). On June 7, 2007, Roast Beef asked Molly to marry him. Their wedding was just over a year later on July 5, 2008.The Math., 15 July 2008, Achewood Early development of the series In the early months of Achewood, the strip takes place entirely at Chris Onstad's house, and the four original characters—Philippe, Téodor, Lyle and Cornelius Bear—are implied to be essentially trapped there. Philippe's appearance at the front door causes some Trick-or-Treaters to exclaim in fear, \\"HOLY CHRIST IS THAT AN ALIVE STUFFED ANIMAL\\",Halloween. October 31, 2001, Achewood and the friends are forced to hide when the pizza they ordered is delivered. There is no mention of having jobs, money or any real responsibilities. After Ray, Roast Beef and Pat are introduced, however, the characters begin to assume more complex personalities and exercise greater independence. This trend is accelerated during an extended story arc called \\"The Party\\",The Party: Day I. March 12, 2002. Achewood the first of the long-form storylines which would become a staple of Achewood. The transition from what had essentially been a gag-a-day comic was fairly abrupt – there is no run-up to \\"The Party.\\" Instead, on March 12, 2002, all of the characters are shown lined up outside the Onstad residence waiting for Téodor to let them in and the comic concluded with the note \\"continued tomorrow.\\" \\"The Party\\" introduces several supporting characters, including the robots, Ultra Peanut and Phillipe's mother.

Originally, only Ray and Pat were given names. As time passed, Ray and Beef were given more and more panel time, eventually becoming the central characters of the strip, with the original four main characters taking on supporting roles. Other features Chris Onstad has also produced other material within the Achewood 'universe', including: * Various blogs written by some of the comic's characters. * A zine, Man Why You Even Got to Do a Thing, purportedly written by Roast Beef (publication halted since Issue 6). * Two novellas by the character Nice Pete. * An Achewood Cookbook, aimed mainly at beginners, in which the characters provide recipes and cooking advice. Onstad was frustrated by The French Laundry Cookbook, finding it \\"essentially useless to any home cook\\", and wrote his own cookbook aimed at \\"guys who are just out of college and have one pan and one electric burner\\". Onstad believed that doing such a task would be entertaining and challenging. Onstad visited a supermarket chain store and bought eggs, ground beef, and mustard, and created around 50 recipes based around them. The book includes recipes for cocktails, Scotch eggs, hot dogs, chicken, orzo, and other foods and drinks. Ray Smuckles presents all of the cocktails. Danielle Maestretti of Utne Reader said that the recipes range in appeal and complexity.\\"From the Stacks: April 20, 2007\\". Utne Reader. April 20, 2007. Retrieved on July 23, 2011. * A former feature called \\"Current Kid Status\\", in which Onstad documented the joys, travails and current events of raising his daughter. It ran from his daughter's birth in March 2005, until 27 November 2007. A compendium of these bits has been packaged into a book and is available for purchase at The Achewood Store. * The Achewood Store, which includes such items as clothing, cookbooks, aprons, glasses and other assorted goods. * A Twitter page, once featuring tweets about the daily activities of the Achewood characters, but now focusing on the life of Onstad himself.Twitter / achewood Reception As of April 10, 2007, Achewood received about ten million page views monthly. James Norton of Salon.com said that the \\"well-developed cast of characters, many of whom just happen to be seriously into good food\\" get the attention of the audience. Awards Achewood received the Ignatz Award in 2007 and 2008 for Outstanding Online Comic. Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it Number One of the Top 10 Graphic Novels of 2007, praising its emotional range, the lyrical beauty of its otherwise at-times crude art, and referred to the series as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"profoundly genius.\\" Grossman explained that it deserved to be listed, despite the fact that it was technically an Internet comic rather than a traditional hardcopy or even a graphic novel at all.Grossman, Lev (2007). \\"Top 10 Graphic Novels.\\" Time.

Onstad attended Stanford University, where he edited the Stanford Chaparral humor magazine. Onstad has published several books: nine anthologies of Achewood comics; a humorous cookbook featuring recipes purportedly invented by the strip's characters; A Wonderful Tale, a book written from the perspective of a character from the strip; and that same character's second novel A Hilarious Comedy. He has also published six editions of Man Why You Even Got to Do a Thing, an Achewood-centric zine. Onstad reveals little of his private life online, but it is known that he currently lives in Portland, Oregon. His wife, Liz, assisted him as an accountant on the sale of Achewood merchandise. They have a daughter, born on March 14, 2005. Onstad formerly had a section on his website about his daughter, titled \\"current kid status,\\" which he updated regularly with stories and happenings. These are collected in the self- published book Current Baby Status – The Collected Archive. In a February 23, 2012, interview with The Believer Onstad revealed that he had divorced from his wife. In September 2013, Onstad launched a new business, Portland Soda Works. Influences Onstad remarked in an interview that \\"You can't help but be affected by Mark Twain books, Lay's Potato Chip ads, a fat lady who is yelling outside, David Letterman, etc.\\" And elsewhere, to Brian M. Palmer, \\"The reader would likely be a better judge.\\" He has expressed admiration for Chris Ware and Tony Millionaire.

Onstad said that when he met his wife, she was \\"a bit more of a cook\\" than he was; she had traveled to Italy to study abroad. Since he was, in his words, \\"mostly omnivorous\\" and she is a vegetarian, the two have to find food that can appeal to both of them. Onstad added that he is \\"competitive\\" and aims to \\"do a good job with these things and impress people.\\" In addition, since Onstad's wife was an employee of Williams Sonoma, the two received discounted high end cookware that they normally would not have bought.

The enclave currently occupies the area in and around Gerrard Street. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in Limehouse in the East End. History The first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the Limehouse area of the East End of London.Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. \\"London's Chinatown\\" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change. Routledge. pp. 45–58. At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in Docklands. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of slum housing and (the then-legal) opium dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during the Blitz in the Second World War, although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of Chinese cuisine and an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere. The present Chinatown, which is off Shaftesbury Avenue did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with Gerrard Street the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, Harrison Marks' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street,In the 1950s, followed by SeeWoo, a Chinese supermarket, still serving the community today. Lisle Street was the Mecca of electronic junk, attracting hifi and television enthusiasts from all over southern England parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.\\"Giles Coren reviews Empress of Sichuan\\". The Times. 20 February 2010. In 2005, the property developer Rosewheel proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in protest of violent tactics by immigration officers from the Home Office. The London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the Hippodrome Casino. On 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on Wardour Street was opened by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. It was made by Chinese artisans and assembled in London. The gate is in the style of the Qing dynasty.http://chinatown.co.uk/en/about-us/ There was a Chinese-style pavilion at Newport Place from the 1980s which was a popular meeting point, but it was demolished in 2016 after more than thirty years, despite protests. The development authorities had plans to renovate and enlarge the square.http://westendextra.com/article/chinatown-pagoda-is- demolished-as-part-of-regeneration-scheme The construction of a new pavilion at a different location was announced.https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-11/16/content_27399386.htm Geography Chinatown has no officially defined size, but it has commonly been considered to approximately encompass Gerrard Street, the bottom half of Wardour Street, Rupert Street and Rupert Court, a section of Shaftesbury Avenue and Lisle Street, Macclesfield Street and Newport Place, Newport Court and Little Newport Street. * Charing Cross Road – built 1887, and named as it led to the cross at Charing, from the Old English word \\"cierring\\", referring to a bend in the River ThamesFairfield, S.

History TAM Pionir (1957) In 1938, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia launched a competition to find a truck design that would be license produced in the country. The competing vehicles had to complete a journey across Yugoslav roads of poor quality. The RN won and in 1938, the Zavodi Aleksandar Ranković (ZAR), ancestor of post WWII Industrija Motora Rakovica (IMR) plant near Belgrade, started to receive parts for assembly, the first Yugoslav manufactured vehicle rolling off the production line in 1940. Unfortunately, production was cut short by the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. Production resumed in 1947 with the name Pionir, but by 1950 less than 1,200 had been made. Production was therefore moved from Serbia to Tovarna avtomobilov Maribor in Maribor. The origin of the Maribor factory lies with the German occupying forces. In 1942 a site outside the city was set up to manufacture aircraft parts. To maintain production under allied air attacks, some of the plant was in tunnels.http://www.sloveniatimes.com/maribor-vehicles-factory- celebrating-70th-anniversary Some 17,146 vehicles, known as TAM Pionir, were produced during the next fifteen years. The majority were flatbed trucks, but a number of fire engines, buses and other vehicles were also produced. TAM's first model, the TAM Pionir, was built under license from the Czechoslovak company Praga, and was manufactured until 1962, with a total of 17,416 produced in that period. TAM quickly became Yugoslavia's leading truck manufacturer. In 1958, it began manufacturing vehicles under license from the German company Magirus-Deutz. In 1961, the company was renamed to Tovarna Avtomobilov in Motorjev Maribor (\\"Maribor Automobile and Engine Factory\\"), however the TAM acronym and logo were retained. At its height, it employed more than 8,000 workers; however, the economic decline of the 1980s saw financial difficulties, and in 1996 the company was dissolved. TAM was succeeded by TVM (Tovarna vozil Maribor – translated: Maribor Vehicle Factory) in 2001, producing MAN trucks under license primarily for the Slovenian Army. TVM became part of the Viator & Vector group, and continued for some years until the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. The company ended in bankruptcy in 2011 with debts totaling over €62 million. The company was resuscitated in 2014 under the name TAM - Europe with Chinese investment from China Hi-Tech Group Corporation group. Its main product line is airside buses for airports, followed by coaches and electric buses called \\"VERO\\". https://www.sustainable- bus.com/news/tam-vero-slovenian-midibus-ipt-inductive-charging/ Past Product Line *TAM 110 T7 B/BV (1976–1991) *TAM 150 T11 B/BV (1979–1991) Tam gasilec.JPGTAM 125 T10 fire truck TAM kamion HV Tigrovi.jpgTAM 150 T11 military transport truck TAM 110 slovenski.jpgTAM 110 T7 military light truck TAM75 fire truck.jpgTAM 75 TAM 80 T5.jpgTAM 80 T5 Bus TAM 232 A 116 M in Bratislava.JPGTAM 232 A 116 M Bus in Bratislava.JPG Logo The TAM logo resembles a three-leafed clover standing on point, with each lobe containing one letter of the acronym and a small five-pointed star occupying the center.

TAM logo.jpg TAM logo vojaski.jpg TAM new.png Past vehicle naming convention In the past, TAM used to have a special naming convention for its trucks. However, this naming convention is no longer used for its modern bus product lines. TAM trucks were assigned a string of three variables, number- letter-number; for example, model 190 T 11. *The first number represents engine power (in hp). *The letter T stands for the Slovenian word \\"tovornjak\\" (truck). *The second number (11) represents the maximum payload (in tons). TAM buses were assigned a string of four variables, number-letter-number-letter, for example: 260 A 116 M. *The first number represents engine power. *The letter A stands for the word \\"avtobus\\" (bus). *The second number represents the length of the bus in decimetres (in this case it is 11,6 m). *The second letter could be either M, P, or T, for \\"mestni\\" (city bus), \\"primestni\\" (suburban bus), or \\"turistični\\" (tourist bus).

In this conception of the world, the earth is shouldered by an angel, who stands on a slab of gemstone, which is supported by the cosmic beast (ox) sometimes called Kuyutha'(/Kuyuthan)/Kiyuban/Kibuthan (most likely from a corruption or misrendering of Hebrew לִוְיָתָן \\"Leviathan\\"). The fish/whale Bahamut carries this bull on its back, and is suspended in water for its own stability. Balhūt is a variant name found in some cosmographies. In the earliest sources, the name is Lutīyā, with Balhūt given as a byname and Bahamūt as a nickname. Orthography Bahamūt is the spelling given in al- Qazwini (d. 1283)'s cosmography., p. 216 and note 198. \\"Bahamoot\\" is Edward Lane's transcribed spelling. This name is thought to derive from the biblical Behemoth. It has thus been translated as Behemot (German for \\"Behemoth\\") by Ethé. However, the original biblical Behemoth never appeared as a fish., pp. 237–238 and note 271, citing Heinen, Islamic Cosmology, p. 235 for the statement \\"in none of these ancient texts is Behemoth a fish\\" A reshaping of its nature must have occurred in Arab storytelling, some time in the pre- islamic period. One proposed scenario is that a pair of beasts from the bible were confused with each other; the behemoth mis-assigned to the fish, and the aquatic leviathan to the bull. Balhūt is the alternate spelling given in Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)'s geographic work and copies of Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348)'s work. Lane's summary Bahamut, according to Edward William Lane's abstract of a particular Islamic work on cosmography, is a giant fish acting as one of the layers that supports the earth. It is so immense \\"[all] the seas of the world, placed in one of the fish's nostrils, would be like a mustard seed laid in the desert.\\" Above the fish stands a bull called Kuyootà, on the bull, a \\"ruby\\" rock, on the rock an angel to shoulder the earth. Lane's primary Islamic source for his summary is unclear, as Lane merely refers to it ly as \\"the work of one of the writers above quoted\\". Arabic sources There are a number of Islamic cosmographical treatises, of more or less similar content. There can occur certain discrepancies in Western translations, even when there are no textual differences in the Arabic. The creature, named Bahamut or Balhut in these sources, can be described as a fish or whale according to translation, since the original Arabic word hūt (حوت) can mean either. Also, the gem comprising the slab beneath the angel's feet, in Arabic yāqūt () is of ambiguous meaning, and can be rendered as \\"ruby\\", or variously otherwise. Cosmography Qazwini group Al-Damiri (d. 1405) on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih was one of Lane's sources, possibly the source of his main summary. His description of \\"Bahmût\\" (French translation) matches Lane's summary down to certain key details. However, there seems to be discrepancies in using \\"a heap of sand\\" (instead of \\"mustard\\") in the size analogy, and the bull's name given (\\"Rakaboûnâ\\") is rather different.: Note 14 to p. 457 by Perron Al-Qazwini (d. 1283)'s cosmography The Wonders of Creation on the contrary agrees with Lane on these points. However, it disagrees somewhat with Lane's on the description, on what lies below the fish: water, air, then a region of darkness, and with respect to the bull's appendages, It should be cautioned that Qazwini's cosmography is known to exist in a variety of different manuscripts., \\"al-Ḳazwīnī\\", Encyclopedia of Islām, p. 841. Both cosmographies provide the story as words spoken by Wahb ibn Munabbih,, p. 216 and note 199. so the descriptions should be similar at the core. In fact, Al- Damiri's version is considered to be mere redactions of Qazwini printed onto its margins., \\"al-Ḳazwīnī\\", Encyclopedia of Islām, p. 844. Yakut group Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348) (Kharīdat al-ʿAjā'ib, \\"The Pearl of Wonders\\") is another source used by Lane, to give variant readings. Its chapter that includes the cosmography has been deemed a copy of Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)'s Mu'jam al-Buldan, with similar wording, with some rearrangements, and very slight amounts of discrepant information., p. 19, note 4. \\"Balhūt\\" is the name of the great fish given in both Ibn al-Wardi, p. 216, note 198. (Kharīdat, Cairo edition of AH1358/AD1939, published by Maṭbaʿat Muṣtafā al-Bābī al- Ḥalabī, pp. 16, 15)\\"Belhut\\" in the Latin translation of Kharīdat and Yaqut. Yakut and al-Wardi both say there is a layer of sandhill between the bull and the fish.: Ibn al-Wardī, Kharīdat al-ʿajāʾib, p. 16. They also describe what lies under the fish is again somewhat differently., p. 107, note 3. These texts connect the cosmic fish and bull with phenomena of nature, namely the waxing and ebbing of tides, maintenance of the sea-level, and earthquakes. The account which only connects concerns the bull states that its breathing causes the waxing and ebbing of the tides. And since the fish and the bull drink the water running off the earth into the sea, they counteract the tap-off causing sea-level to rise. But the beasts will eventually become engorged, when they will become agitated, or, it marks the advent of Judgment Day (Ibn al-Wardi, Yaqut). Lives of prophets There are two Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ (\\"Lives of the Prophets\\"), one by al-Tha'labi, known otherwise for his Tafsir al-Thalabi, the other by Muḥammad al-Kisāʾī which are considered the oldest authorities containing a similar cosmographical description concerning the big fish and bull., note 1. In al-Tha'labi's text is an on the whale having several names, as follows: \\"God created a large fish (nūn) which is a huge whale whose name (ism) is Lutīyā, by-name (kunyah) Balhūt, and nickname (laqab) Bahamūt\\". Earthquakes Yakut also gives the account that Iblis almost incited the whale Balhūt into causing a quake, but God distracted it by sending gnats to its eyes. Or alternatively, God had sent a sword-like fish that bedazzled and captivated the giant fish. This account is also found in al-Tha'labi's Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ, but in that version God forces the whale (Lutīyā) into submission by sending a creature that invaded through its nose and reached its brain; it also claims to be an anecdote on authority of Kaʿb al-Aḥbār (d. 650s A.D.), a convert considered the earliest informant of Jewish-Muslim tradition to Arab writers. Although this is an instance of an Arabic tale that ascribes the origins of earthquakes to the cosmic whale/fish supporting the earth, more familiar beliefs in medieval Arab associate the earthquake with the bull, or with Mount Qaf. Jorge Luis Borges has drawn parallels between Bahamut and the mythical Japanese fish \\"Jinshin-Uwo\\",, citing Wheeler, Post (1952) The Sacred Scriptures Of The Japanese, p. 495. although the correct term is . Japanese folklorist has explained that the traditional belief in the earthquake-causing bull is heavily concentrated in Arab regions (Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, Malay),Taryō, Ōbayashi, (1979) Shinwa no hanashi, pp. 84–89. whereas the motif of \\"World-Fish's movement causes earthquake\\" is found mostly in parts of Indochina, China, and throughout Japan.Taryō, Ōbayashi, (1979) Shinwa no hanashi, pp. 93–96. Borges According to Jorge Luis Borges's work, the Book of Imaginary Beings (1957), Bahamut is \\"altered and magnified\\" from Behemoth and described as so immense that a human cannot bear its sight. Borges placed Bahamut as the identity of the unnamed giant fish which Isa (Jesus) witnessed in the story of the 496th night of One Thousand and One Nights (Burton's edition). This giant fish supports a bull, the bull a rock, and the rock an angel, exactly as in the traditional Perso-Arabic medieval model of the world.. Borges appropriated the description of the Bahamut from Edward Lane's Arabian Society in the Middle Ages. and Hurley's note to it, p. 221, saying that the passage \\"The earth was, it is said...\\" is from Lane, Arabian Society. In popular culture * In the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game, Bahamut is the dragon god of justice, and is the first instance of the name being used for a dragon. * In Rage of Bahamut collectible card game and its anime adaptation, Bahamut is an ancient dragon with the capability to destroy the world. In the anime, preventing or aiding Bahamut's release is the goal of most of the story's factions. * In Shadowverse collectible card game, Bahamut is one of the Legendary follower cards, which upon being played destroys all other cards. Both artwork and lore depict it as a dragon. * In the Final Fantasy video game series, Bahamut is one of the most prominent summons – monsters that can be brought into battle to fight for their summoner. It appears in almost all installments of the series, with the exception of Final Fantasy XII, where its name is used for the game's final dungeon, Sky Fortess Bahamut. * In Granblue Fantasy video game, the Bahamut Weapons are a set of extremely powerful weapons that boost character stats based on the character's species. These can be acquired from Bahamut himself, who is the same as Rage of Bahamut incarnation. * In Megazone 23 original video animation, the central artificial intelligence is named Bahamut and is responsible for propping up a fake reality. * In Bahamut (album) of the New York based musical group Hazmat Modine, the third track named \\"Bahamut\\" too, gives a description of the Bahamut in spoken word at 2:34 See also *Makara or Kar Mahi an analogue from Indo-Iranian cultural sphere *Gaokerena the mythical white haoma tree being guarded by analogue mythical creatures *Atlas (mythology), a rough analogue from Greek mythology *Dandan, another large fish in Arabian mythology *Falak Notes References ;Bibliography ;(primary sources) * * ** ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al- mawjūdāt (عجائب المخلوقات و غرائب الموجودات), plain text redaction * * *; translation * ;(secondary sources) * * Category:Arabian legendary creatures Category:Persian legendary creatures Category:Esoteric cosmology Category:World-bearing animals Category:Dragons Category:Legendary serpents ","title":"Bahamut"},{"id":"310638","text":"Cheyne Walk seen from across the river Cheyne Walk is a historic road, in Chelsea, London, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It runs parallel with the River Thames. Before the construction of the Chelsea Embankment reduced the width of the river, it fronted the river along its whole length. Location At its western end, Cheyne Walk meets Cremorne Road end-on at the junction with Lots Road. The Walk runs alongside the River Thames until Battersea Bridge where, for a short distance, it is replaced by Chelsea Embankment with part of its former alignment being occupied by Ropers Gardens. East of Old Church Street and Chelsea Old Church, the Walk runs along the north side of Albert Bridge Gardens and Chelsea Embankment Gardens parallel with Chelsea Embankment. At the north end of Albert Bridge, the Walk merges with Chelsea Embankment. The Walk ends at Royal Hospital Road. At the western end between Lots Road and Battersea Bridge is a collection of residential houseboats that have been in situ since the 1930s. At the eastern end is the Chelsea Physic Garden with its cedars. It marks the boundary of the, now withdrawn, extended London Congestion Charge Zone. The section west of Battersea Bridge forms part of the A3220 road. History Cheyne Walk circa 1800. Cheyne Walk takes its name from William Cheyne, Viscount Newhaven who owned the manor of Chelsea until 1712. Most of the houses were built in the early 18th century. Before the construction in the 19th century of the busy Chelsea Embankment, which now runs in front of it, the houses fronted the River Thames. The most prominent building is Carlyle Mansions. Chelsea Old Church dates from 1157 and Crosby Hall is a reconstructed medieval merchant's house relocated from the City of London in 1910. In 1951, the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea planned to construct a new river wall straightening the river bank west of Battersea Bridge. On the reclaimed land behind the wall a new arterial road and public gardens was to be constructed. Cheyne Walk was to remain unchanged to the north of the new public gardens. The works would have reduced the foreshore and required the removal of the house boat births. The works did not take place. In the 1960s, plans for the Greater London Council's London Motorway Box project would have seen the West Cross Route, a motorway standard elevated road, constructed from Battersea to Harlesden through Earl's Court. A spur road would have been constructed from the motorway to the junction of Cheyne Walk and Lots Road. The plans were abandoned because of the cost and opposition from local communities. In 1972, number 96 Cheyne Walk, the then home of Philip Woodfield, a British civil servant, was the site of a top secret meeting between the British government and the leadership of the Provisional IRA aimed at ending the violence in Northern Ireland.

A book of The d'Artagnan Romances, it is a sequel to The Three Musketeers (1844) and precedes the 1847–1850 novel The Vicomte de Bragelonne (which includes the sub-plot Man in the Iron Mask). The novel follows events in France during the Fronde, during the childhood reign of Louis XIV, and in England near the end of the English Civil War, leading up to the victory of Oliver Cromwell and the execution of King Charles I. Through the words of the main characters, particularly Athos, Dumas comes out on the side of the monarchy in general, or at least the text often praises the idea of benevolent royalty. His musketeers are valiant and just in their efforts to protect young Louis XIV and the doomed Charles I from their attackers. Synopsis D'Artagnan and Mazarin The action begins during the regency of Queen Anne of Austria (term 1643–1651), with Cardinal Mazarin as First Minister. D'Artagnan, who seemed to have a promising career ahead of him at the end of The Three Musketeers, has for twenty years remained a lieutenant, and seems unlikely to progress despite his ambition and the debt the queen owes him. He is summoned by Mazarin, who requires an escort; the French people detest Mazarin, and are on the brink of rebellion (La Fronde). D'Artagnan is sent to the Bastille to retrieve a prisoner, who turns out to be his former adversary, the Comte de Rochefort. After renewing his acquaintance with d'Artagnan and making a promise to aid his advancement, Rochefort is brought to his audience with Mazarin, where he learns that the cause for his imprisonment was his refusal to serve Mazarin at an earlier stage. He does, however, remember his promise, and though he offers his own service to Mazarin, he refuses to watch over the Duc de Beaufort, who is imprisoned at the time, and soon learns that, in consequence, he is to be returned to the Bastille, though this does not deter him from speaking highly of the achievements of d'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers. Having determined that d'Artagnan is the man he seeks, Mazarin enters the chambers of the Queen to let her know that he has enlisted the man who had served her so well twenty years earlier. The Queen, feeling guilty for having forgotten d'Artagnan's service, gives Mazarin a diamond ring to return to d'Artagnan, one which she had previously given him that d'Artagnan sold. The avaricious Mazarin merely uses the diamond to show d'Artagnan that he is once again to enter the Queen's service. He commissions d'Artagnan to go in search of his friends. Reunion of the Four Musketeers D'Artagnan is at a loss; he has completely lost touch with his friends, who have resumed their real names. Athos, the Comte de la Fère, had returned to his estate near Blois; Porthos, Monsieur du Vallon, had married a lawyer's widow; and Aramis became a priest, the Abbé d'Herblay. Fortune intervenes when Planchet, his old servant, enters d'Artagnan's chambers, attempting to escape arrest for aiding the escape of Rochefort. Through Planchet, he locates Bazin, Aramis' old servant, now beadle at Notre Dame. Though Bazin is unwilling to help, d'Artagnan is able to find out, through an altar boy, that Bazin makes frequent visits to Noisy. D'Artagnan and Planchet go there, where they are set upon by a group who think them Frondeurs while outside the house of Madame de Longueville. When this group is satisfied that d'Artagnan is not the man they seek, Aramis surprises Planchet by dropping onto his horse from the tree in which he had been hiding. D'Artagnan finds that the former musketeer, who had thought of little other than being a priest, is now a priest who thinks of little other than being a soldier. Aramis is not willing to enter into Mazarin's service, however. D'Artagnan leaves but waits in hiding, suspecting that Aramis is both the Frondeur who had been sought earlier and the lover of Madame de Longueville. His suspicions are confirmed. The visit to Aramis was not fruitless, as it yielded the address of Porthos. When d'Artagnan arrives at Porthos' estate he finds Mousqueton, who is overjoyed to meet d'Artagnan and Planchet. He finds that Porthos, despite his wealth and life spent in pursuit of amusement, is not happy. Porthos desires to become a baron, and with this bait d'Artagnan lures him into Mazarin's service. D'Artagnan then continues his search for Athos, whom he finds almost completely changed, to be an example to his ward, Raoul. Though Athos will not be enlisted into Mazarin's service, and indeed reveals that his sympathies lie against Mazarin, the two arrange to meet again in Paris; Athos wishes to bring Raoul there to help him to become a gentleman, and also to separate him from Louise de la Vallière, with whom Raoul is obsessively in love. In Paris, Athos visits Madame de Chevreuse, the former mistress of Aramis, with whom, under the name Marie Michon, Aramis had much communication in The Three Musketeers. Athos reveals, discreetly, that Raoul is the son born of a chance encounter that Athos had with her, and through her gets a letter of recommendation for Raoul to join the army. The Duc de Beaufort The scene then changes, to focus on the Duc de Beaufort, Mazarin's prisoner at Vincennes, who finds a new jailer, Athos' servant, the silent Grimaud. Grimaud instantly makes himself disagreeable to the Duc, as part of an escape plot. Using messages passed to Rochefort using tennis balls, they arrange to have a meal on Whitsuntide, to which La Ramée, second in command of the prison, is invited. The escape is successful, but d'Artagnan and Porthos are in pursuit. After a race against time, and having defeated several adversaries along the way, Porthos and d'Artagnan find themselves in the dark, surrounded, with swords crossed against adversaries equal to them, who are revealed to be Athos and Aramis. The four arrange to meet in Paris at the Place Royale; both parties, now finding themselves enemies, enter fearing a duel, but they reconcile and renew their vows of friendship. Enter Mordaunt As this is going on, Raoul is travelling to join the army. Along the road he sees a gentleman of around the same age, and tries to make haste to join him. The other gentleman reaches the ferry before him, but has fallen into the river. Raoul, who is used to fording rivers, saves the gentleman, the Comte de Guiche, and the two become friends. Further along the road, the debt is repaid when the Comte saves Raoul when they are attacked by Spanish soldiers. After the fight, they find a man close to death who requests the last rites. They help him to a nearby inn and find a traveling monk. This monk is unpleasant to them and does not seem inclined to perform this service, so they force him to go to the inn. Once there, the monk hears the confession. The dying man reveals that he was the executioner of Béthune and confesses his part in the execution of Milady de Winter. The monk reveals himself as her son, John Francis de Winter, who calls himself Mordaunt after Charles I stripped him of all his titles. Mordaunt stabs the executioner. Grimaud, who is to join Raoul, comes upon the inn just as this is taking place, though too late to prevent it, or to detain the monk. After hearing what happened from the dying man, making his excuses to Raoul, he departs to warn Athos about the son of Milady. After his departure, Raoul and Guiche are forced to retreat when the Spanish come upon the town. After joining the army of the Prince de Condé, Raoul provides assistance in interrogating the prisoner brought by Guiche and him, when the prisoner feigns to misunderstand them in several languages. Once they have learned the location of the Spanish army, they set out for battle, Raoul accompanying the Prince. Meanwhile, d´Artagnan and Porthos help Queen Anne of Austria, the young Louis XIV and Mazarin escape Paris after its citizens finally start a rebellion by using children's slings (frondes) to hurl stones at the windows of Mazarin's associates. The champion of the French populace and parliament, Pierre Broussel, is arrested, but then released when it becomes clear that his imprisonment has only served to stir the crowd up worse. D´Artagnan meets the young king and watches over him as some Frondeurs - including Planchet, under a false name - who wanted to make sure that the king and queen were not about to escape, enter the king's bedroom demanding to see him. Immediately after this, he contrives for all of the royal household to escape from Paris anyway, bluffing his way past Planchet at the gates (the two men retain their friendship despite their differing allegiances in this conflict). After that, Mazarin sends d'Artagnan and Porthos to England with a message for Cromwell and orders them to stay there for some time under Cromwell's command. At the same time, Queen Henrietta of England meets the Musketeers' old English friend, Lord de Winter - a Royalist come to ask for French assistance for King Charles I of England, her husband, in the English Civil War and sends Athos and Aramis to England as well. So once again the two pairs of Musketeers find themselves on opposite sides: but Athos and Aramis, on the occasion of departing, are recognised by Mordaunt, who has been following Lord de Winter in the hope of finding his friends. In England Milady's son, Mordaunt, now twenty-three, reprises his role as one of the chief antagonists, and sets about avenging his mother's death. He seeks not only Lord de Winter, but the other four unknown conspirators who took part in his mother's clandestine \\"trial\\" and execution. He murders his uncle, Lord de Winter, who was Milady's brother-in-law, during the same battle in which King Charles I is captured. Athos and Aramis are captured by d'Artagnan and Porthos who are fighting alongside Mordaunt and Cromwell's troops. As soon as they can have a conversation, Athos talks d'Artagnan and Porthos into helping save Charles I. D'Artagnan and Porthos free their friends and start making plans in order to try to save the king. In the end, all their plans fail and Mordaunt turns to regicide, executing King Charles I after d'Artagnan and the three former Musketeers have kidnapped the real executioner in order to prevent this. D'Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell's London residence, but in the course of a duel with d'Artagnan he escapes through a secret passage. The Frenchmen and their servants leave England by ship, but Mordaunt gets aboard and blows it up. Unfortunately for him, the Musketeers' servants discover the explosives on board, rouse their masters, and contrive to steal the only lifeboat before the ship can blow up, leaving Mordaunt aboard. Mordaunt escapes the blast, and pleads with the Musketeers to let him into their boat. With the exception of Athos, they contemptuously reject his appeals. Athos insists on saving him, but as he helps him into the boat, Mordaunt deliberately drags him under the water where they struggle and Mordaunt is killed. Athos rejoins the others stating: \\"I had a son. I wanted to live.\\" This seems to confirm what d'Artagnan has long suspected, that the reason Athos's ward, Raoul de Bragelonne whom he adopted after he was abandoned by his mother, bears such a resemblance to him is because he is Athos's natural son.http://www.online- literature.com/dumas/twenty_years, Chapter XV Athos further states that \\"It was not me who killed him. It was fate.\\" Finale Once back in France, the four friends go separate ways. D'Artagnan and Porthos head to Paris through a different route from Athos and Aramis, knowing that Mazarin will not forgive their disobedience. Aramis and Athos reach Paris only to find out that their friends have not. After looking for D'Artagnan and Porthos, they learn the duo has been imprisoned by Mazarin in Rueil. Athos tries to persuade Queen Anne to free his friends, but is imprisoned as well. After this, d'Artagnan manages to escape with Porthos and capture Mazarin. Mazarin is taken to one of Porthos's castles and he makes some concessions to the four friends in exchange for his freedom. These include creating Porthos a baron and making d'Artagnan a Captain of Musketeers. Athos asks for nothing: Aramis asks for concessions towards himself and his friends in the Fronde. These concessions are later accepted by Queen Anne, who finally realizes she has been rather ungrateful to d'Artagnan and his friends. At the end of the novel, the first Fronde comes to an end and Mazarin, Queen Anne, and Louis XIV enter Paris. A riot takes place during which d'Artagnan accidentally kills Rochefort and Porthos kills Bonacieux (who in the earlier novel was d'Artagnan's landlord and an agent of Richelieu and is now a beggar and Frondist). At the end the four friends once again go their separate ways. D'Artagnan stays in Paris with Mazarin and Queen Anne; Athos returns to la Fère; Aramis returns to his abbey in Noisy le Sec; and Porthos returns to his castle to enjoy his baronage.

It originates in several forks in southwestern Washington, flows east, then north, then west, in a large curve, before emptying into Grays Harbor, an estuary of the Pacific Ocean. It was once much larger during the Ice Age when the tongue of the glacial ice sheet covering the Puget Sound terminated near Olympia and glacial runoff formed a large torrent of meltwater. This carved a large oversized valley that is much larger than the current river could have produced. The river's mouth was out near current Westport until rising sea levels at the end of the ice age flooded the broad Chehalis Valley to form a ria, known today as Grays Harbor. Course The Chehalis River begins at the confluence of the West Fork Chehalis River and East Fork Chehalis River, in southwestern Lewis County. From there the Chehalis flows north and east, collecting tributary streams that drain the Willapa Hills and other low mountains of southwestern Washington. The South Fork Chehalis River joins the main river a few miles west of the city of Chehalis. The Newaukum River joins the Chehalis River at Chehalis, after which the river turns north, flowing by the city of Centralia, where the Skookumchuck River joins. After Centralia, the Chehalis River flows north and west, collecting tributaries such as the Black River, which drains the Black Hills to the north, then in the Chehalis Gap collects the Satsop River and Wynoochee River, which drain the southern part of the Olympic Mountains. The Wynoochee River joins the Chehalis near Montesano, after which the Chehalis River becomes increasingly affected by tides and widens into Grays Harbor estuary. The city of Aberdeen lies at the mouth of the Chehalis River. Just east of Aberdeen, the Wishkah River joins the Chehalis, and just west, between Aberdeen and Hoquiam, the Hoquiam River joins. At this point the river has become Grays Harbor. Before the estuary of Grays Harbor empties into the Pacific Ocean, the Humptulips River joins.

The recommended detour added about four hours and 280 miles (450 km). It was not expected to reopen for several days. However, upon breaching a dike on Dec. 5, 2007, the water receded more quickly than anticipated. Amtrak train service between Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia, was also disrupted. Washington governor Chris Gregoire declared a state of emergency on December 3. January 7, 2009, floods During the January 7, 2009, Pacific Northwest storms, a stretch of Interstate 5 was closed between exits 68 and 88 because of flooding from the Chehalis River, causing the roadway to be under several feet of water. Since the main east/west mountain passes were also closed during this event, the flooding from the Chehalis River essentially cut off traffic to the Puget Sound area and no detour was available.

Shin Akuma's appearance is very similar to Akuma's; for example, in the Street Fighter Alpha series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma's introduction in Super Street Fighter II Turbo stemmed from the development team's desire to introduce a \\"mysterious and really powerful\\" character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions. When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom's fighting games, Capcom's Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, \\"Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely\\". Matt Edwards of Capcom Europe considered Akuma the most powerful Street Fighter character. Rich Knight of Complex described Akuma as \\"a character who must constantly be on the offense, because he takes a shit ton of damage when he's not.\\" Akuma's appearance remained consistent until Street Fighter V where his hair reaches far longer and has grown around his face. Takayuki Nakayama explained that the staff considered multiple designs that were scrapped such as a shirtless look, multiple scars within the body, one with a broken shirt and one where he carried a baby. Appearances Street Fighter game series Akuma made his debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, the fifth arcade iteration of the Street Fighter II games, where he appears as a hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player's final match with M. Bison and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be . He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison, and another against himself. While these endings were omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of Super Turbo Revival for the Game Boy Advance. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival, as well as the Japan-only Dreamcast version of the game, Super Street Fighter II X for Matchmaking Service. In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as Tien Gouki can also be selected. Akuma appears in Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in Super Turbo. Akuma was added to the immediate roster in Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3, with a powered-up version of the character named \\"Shin Akuma\\" appearing as a hidden opponent. The character's relation with other Street Fighter characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with Guy, Adon, Gen and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than \\"Final Bison\\", is Evil Ryu's final boss in the console versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3. Akuma and Shin Akuma are featured in Street Fighter EX as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of Street Fighter: The Movie despite not appearing in the movie. Oni in alt= Akuma is featured in the Street Fighter III sub-series beginning with Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack. Like in his debut in Super Turbo, Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the \\"Shin Akuma\\" incarnation introduced in Alpha 2. He is a regular character in Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future. Akuma reappears in Street Fighter IV, once again as a hidden boss in the Single Player Mode as well as an unlockable secret character in both the arcade and home console versions. Shin Akuma also returns as a hidden boss in Super Street Fighter IV. Both secret boss and playable versions of a new form of Akuma, known as , were confirmed in Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition by leaked videos.Shoryuken: Clear Video and Ultras of Oni and Evil Ryu in Super Street Fighter 4 Unlike Shin Akuma, Oni is the being that would consume Akuma after mastering the Satsui no Hadou. Akuma returns in Street Fighter V as a downloadable character. Other video games Akuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the Street Fighter franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game X-Men: Children of the Atom, where Akuma (in his Super Turbo incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He would appear in the later Marvel-licensed fighting games (see Marvel vs. Capcom series). In X-Men vs. Street Fighter, he is a regular character but–in a nod to his hidden character status in other games–his select box is hidden. In Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, he appears both as a selectable character and as \\"Cyber Akuma\\", a mechanized version enhanced by Apocalypse acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. He is absent from Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes; in his stead, Ryu has a Hyper Combo that changes his fighting style to incorporate Akuma's moveset. He reappears as a playable character in the sequels: Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. He is also an unlockable character in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. He also appears in Namco x Capcom. He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken. Akuma also appears in the fighting video game Street Fighter X Mega Man, as a hidden boss. In the SNK vs. Capcom series, Akuma appears in Capcom vs. SNK and SVC Chaos as both regular Akuma and as a version of \\"Shin Akuma\\". In Capcom vs. SNK 2, a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying Rugal Bernstein pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as , with the \\"Shin\\" character meaning \\"God\\" instead of the usual \\"True\\". Akuma also appears in Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo as the final boss, Pocket Fighter, and in the Japanese console version of Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness as a mecha named \\"Zero Gouki.\\" Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash series. He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game Asura's Wrath, alongside Ryu as an opponent. Akuma appears as a special guest character in Tekken 7. In the game's story, he seeks to repay a debt to Kazumi Mishima for saving his life from an unknown critical situation, who asks him to kill her husband Heihachi and his son Kazuya for her if she dies. When Heihachi is finally dead for good at the hands of Kazuya, he is Akuma's only target left. Similar to his appearances in the Street Fighter series, Akuma replaces Kazumi as a secret arcade mode final boss if certain conditions are met. Other media Akuma made cameo appearances in Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie and in the Japanese TV series Street Fighter II V. Actor and martial artist Joey Ansah played Akuma in the short film Street Fighter: Legacy. Akuma also appears in Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist, an online series by Capcom and the creators of Street Fighter: Legacy with Ansah reprised his role from Legacy and Gaku Space as Young Gouki. In Assassin's Fist, both of Akuma's names are used; Akuma being the moniker Gouki had assumed after the Satsui no Hado took him over completely. Both Ansah and Space will return for the second season titled Street Fighter: World Warrior. Akuma's first speaking appearance in animation was in an episode of the American Street Fighter animated series titled \\"Strange Bedfellows\\". He reappears in another episode, \\"The World's Greatest Warrior\\", in which he defeats Ryu and Ken's master Gouken, and challenges Gouken's two students to a duel. Akuma also figures in the Japanese OVA Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, where Ryu's encounters with Akuma triggers the \\"Dark Hadou\\" in Ryu. Akuma is also the central focus in the OVA Street Fighter Alpha: Generations, which explores his past and ties the character's past with Ryu's. He appears in the beginning of the movie Street Fighter 4: The Ties That Bind, where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him. UDON Entertainment's line of Street Fighter comics sets Akuma in his origin story on how he became a demon and murdering Goutetsu with the power of the Dark Hadou; he fights against Gouken ten years later, as they fight, Gouken eventually wins against Akuma as he falls off a cliff; Gouken tries to save him, but Akuma willingly drops himself into a river, only for him to survive the drop. In July 2012, the band MegaDriver released a song about Akuma's character, called \\"Wrath Of The Raging Demon\\". In 2014, band Skelator released a song about Akuma, called \\"Raging Demon\\". In 2015, rapper Tauz released a tribute song to Akuma, called \\"Rap do Akuma\\". Reception Akuma has received much critical acclaim from various gaming media outlets. Japanese magazine Gamest named him one of their \\"Top 50 Characters of 1996\\", in a three-way tie for 37th. He placed first in Game Informer's 2009 list of their \\"Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters\\". Ryan Clements of IGN said in 2009: \\"Although M. Bison might be thought of as a notorious Street Fighter villain, Akuma is clearly the fan-favorite 'bad guy'\\". Elton Jones of Complex deemed Akuma the \\"most dominant fighting game character\\" in 2012: \\"Anybody that can lay out M. Bison with ease gets the number-one spot in everything.\\" GamesRadar said of the character in 2013: \\"He differs from other villains in that his motives aren't inherently evil—but ... he has no qualms with killing his teacher or his own brother in combat.\\" Alex Eckman-Lawn of Topless Robot deemed him the \\"most diabolical\\" fighting-game boss: \\"Few experiences from the pre-Internet video-game era made as striking an impression as the time Akuma literally just glided in, murdered M. Bison in a blink, and challenged you, the player, to a real fight.\\" Bryan Dawson of Prima Games commented, \\"It's hard to imagine any new Street Fighter game without this man, as he adds a sense of evil that even M. Bison can't replicate.\\" Robert Workman of GameDaily rated Akuma eleventh in his 2008 selection of the \\"Top 25 Capcom Characters of All Time\\", as he \\"summons some of the sickest attacks ever seen in a fighting game.\\" GameSpot readers chose Akuma for the ninth spot in their 2008 selection of the ten best video game villains, and the site itself deemed Akuma \\"the toughest fighter\\" in the Street Fighter series. Rich Knight of Complex, in 2012, placed Akuma's SSFII Turbo appearance runner-up to Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat II as the \\"coolest boss battle ever\\": \\"Akuma rushed into our lives and onto the screen ... and then demolish[ed] you in seconds.\\" Akuma placed 43rd in IGN's selection of the top 100 video game villains, for his \\"always intimidating\\" appearance. Ben Lee of Digital Spy named him the sixth-best series character on the grounds that he was \\"truly exciting to fight against\\" in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, \\"and his cold, emotionless personality was utterly terrifying.\\" Paste rated Akuma 23rd in their 2016 ranking of Street Fighter's 97 total playable characters, describing him as \\"a great anti-hero to offset Ryu and Ken.\\" Chad Hunter of Complex ranked Akuma's \\"Raging Demon\\" among the \\"25 Most Revolutionary Kill Moves in Video Games\\" at third: \\"Akuma radiates flames, grabs his opponent and the screen goes black and all you [hear] is a flurry of hits.\\" Prima Games named it the seventh-\\"greatest fighting move in video game history\\" out of fifty in 2014, and Arcade Sushi's Angelo Dargenio considered it \\"one of the most well-known super moves in videogame history, spawning several parody moves in multiple fighting games over the years.\\" Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek, in 2016, named Akuma in X-Men: Children of the Atom as the top fighting-game guest character, and while Jason Fanelli of Arcade Sushi considered it \\"the best guest turn he's ever done,\\" he simultaneously criticized his cameo in Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness: \\"Akuma doesn't need to be a giant mech for extra exposure.\\" Chris Hoadley of VentureBeat labeled Akuma one of the \\"best fighting game clones\\" in 2014: \\"Capcom is no stranger to reusing [character] models. Ryu has had Ken as a rival since the first Street Fighter, and over time he would meet more 'shotos' who had an affinity for karate gis, fireballs, and uppercuts.\\" GamesRadar's David Houghton rated Akuma's Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike stage among the \\"27 most amazing fighting game backgrounds\\": \\"Gloomily ethereal, black-skied woodland setting with subliminally oppressive fisheye-lens effect? You are definitely going to die.\\" However, Akuma has often been criticized for his perceived status as an excessively powerful character in the Street Fighter series. Scott Baird of Screen Rant named him the second-\\"most unfairly overpowered fighting game character\\" behind Meta Knight of Super Smash Bros. in 2016, for the potency of his offensive attacks that resulted in Akuma being banned from SSFII Turbo tournaments. GamePro considered Akuma one of the \\"Most Broken Characters in Videogame History\\", for his \\"ridiculously powerful\\" moves that were \\"the bane of newbies and veterans alike,\\" a sentiment that was echoed by Christopher Hooton of Metro in 2013. In 2014, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar ranked Akuma eleventh in his list of \\"12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit\\" in 2014. \\"Even if you ever do manage to finally defeat Akuma, it somehow doesn't feel earned. It's more like the computer felt sorry for you.\\" Additionally, Akuma was named by CBR as the \\"Strongest Street Fighter Character\\", with comments \\"In 1996’s Street Fighter Alpha 2, Akuma evolved into a more powerful form, Shin Akuma, and he evolved into the even more powerful Oni in 2010’s Super Street Fighter IV. Since he’s able to split mountains in that form, that version of Akuma stands as the most powerful being the Street Fighter universe.\\" Akuma's Oni incarnation has received a mixed reception. Both characters shared the top spot in Screen Rant's rating of the \\"12 Most Powerful Street Fighter Characters\\" the same year. \\"Akuma alone has destroyed an entire island, so whoever has to stand against the unbridled destructive force of Oni, all we can say is God help them.\\" In another Screen Rant's list \\"Street Fighter: 8 Most Powerful (And 8 Most Worthless) Characters\\", Akuma placed first. \\"Whether he is Oni, Akuma, or something in-between (Shin Akuma, for instance), the dark master easily proves that he is at the top of the SF heap in terms of both in-universe power and effectiveness among players who have mastered using him.\\" However, Imran Khan of Paste rated Oni as one of the \\"all-time worst\\" series characters: \\"Oni strips away the few bits of Akuma that are actually interesting as a character and turns him into a castaway from a Dragon Ball Z movie in design and development.\\" Randolph Ramsay of GameSpot considered Oni \\"one of the least interesting additions\\" to Super Street Fighter IV, as he utilized moves similar to those of other characters.

Nolan and George Clayton Johnson. Published in 1967, the novel depicts a dystopic ageist future society in which both population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by requiring the death of everyone reaching the age of 21. The story follows the actions of Logan, a Sandman charged with enforcing the rule, as he tracks down and kills citizens who \\"run\\" from society's lethal demand—only to end up \\"running\\" himself. Plot The introduction to the book says: In the world of 2116, a person's maximum age is strictly legislated: 21 years, to the day. When people reach this Lastday they report to a Sleepshop in which they are willingly executed via a pleasure-inducing toxic gas. A person's age is revealed by their palm flower crystal embedded in the palm of their right hand that changes color every seven years; yellow (age 0–6), then blue (age 7–13), then red (age 14–20), then blinks red and black on Lastday, and finally turns black at 21. Runners are those who refuse to report to a Sleepshop and attempt to avoid their fate by escaping to Sanctuary—a place where they can live freely in defiance of society's dictates. Logan 3 is a Deep Sleep Operative (also called a Sandman) whose job is to terminate Runners using a special weapon called simply 'the gun', a handgun with selectable ordnance keyed to self-destruct if touched by an individual who is not the proper owner. Runners are most terrified of a weapon called the 'Homer', which homes in on body heat and ignites every pain nerve in the body, killing the target. Sandmen practice Omnite, a hybrid type of martial arts. On his own Lastday, Logan becomes a Runner himself in an attempt to infiltrate an apparent underground railroad for runners seeking Sanctuary. For most of the book, Logan is an antihero; however, his character develops a sympathy towards Runners, and he becomes more of a traditional hero figure. Jessica 6, a contact that Logan made after he chased her Runner brother, Doyle 10, into Cathedral, where he was killed by the vicious, pre-teen \\"Cubs\\", helps him, despite her initial distrust of him. Francis, another Sandman, and friend of Logan, catches up with Logan and Jessica after they have managed to make it to the final-staging area before Sanctuary. Francis reveals that his true identity is that of the legendary Ballard, who has been helping arrange their escape. Francis tells them he is actually aged 42, but due to his faulty palm flower, which does not change colour and through use of plastic-surgery shops, he has been able to disguise his true age and appearance. He is working from within the system, as he believes the computer controlling the global infrastructure, buried beneath Crazy Horse Mountain, is beginning to malfunction, and the society will die with it. Sanctuary turns out to be Argos, a previously abandoned space colony near Mars. Logan and Jessica escape to the colony on a rocket, which departs from a former space program launch site in Florida, while Ballard remains to help others escape. Sequels and spin-offs Nolan wrote two sequels, Logan's World and Logan's Search, published after the film's release (respectively in 1977 and 1980). There is also a novelette, Logan's Return, that was published as an e-book in 2001. Two other novels, Logan's Journey and Logan Falls, have been co-written (respectively with Paul McComas and with Jason V Brock), but not yet published. Logan's World deals with events following Logan's return to Earth, amidst the survivors and ruins of the system he escaped in the first novel, while Logan's Search deals with Logan going to an alternate reality (with the assistance of aliens) to once again stop the government system he escaped in the first novel, albeit with some minor changes. George Clayton Johnson's long-rumored personal sequel to Logan's Run, titled Jessica's Run: A New Sequel for the Logan's Run Universe, was said to be \\"in development\\". It was still in development at the time of George Clayton Johnson's death on Christmas Day 2015. Reception David Pringle gave Logan's Run two stars out of four and praised the novel as \\"a good SF thriller\\"; he also stated it was superior to the film version.David Pringle, The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction. New York: Pharos Books: St. Martin's Press, 1990. (p.185-6). Adaptations Film The novel was adapted in 1976 as a film, directed by Michael Anderson and starring Michael York as Logan 5 (not 3), Jenny Agutter as Jessica 6, and Richard Jordan as Francis 7. The film was produced by Saul David, a former MGM executive and well-known science fiction supporter (having produced and developed Fantastic Voyage in 1966 at Fox, and developed Westworld at MGM). The film only uses the basic premise from the novel (everyone must die at a specific age, Logan runs with Jessica as his companion while being chased by Francis). The film's world is a post-apocalyptic, dystopian one, in which people now live inside a huge domed city and are oblivious to the world outside, believing it to be a barren, poisonous environment. The motivations of the characters are also quite differentin the film, the age of planned death is 30instead of reporting to a Sleepshop, citizens must take part in a ritual called in which they are incinerated with the chance of being \\"renewed\\". Logan is a 26-year-old Sandman, sent by the computer to find and destroy Sanctuary. The computer alters his palm flower (here called a \\"life clock\\") to show him as approaching Lastday, and he becomes a runner and escapes from the city. Sanctuary turns out not to exist (it is revealed that Runners have actually been murdered by a malfunctioning food processing robot just outside the city). The only other person that Logan and Jessica encounter outside the city is an old man (Peter Ustinov) who lives with a large number of cats in the Senate Chamber of the largely intact ruins of Washington, D.C.. Logan kills Francis, who is simply a Sandman in the movie and not a rebel leader, and leads the old man back to remain just outside the domed city, returning to try to lead a revolt against the culling. No one believes or listens to him or Jessica, and instead he is captured by Sandmen. In his interrogation by the computer, his information of there being no Sanctuary causes the computer to malfunction and self-destruct. Logan and Jessica then flee. As the young population leave the confines of the burning and exploding domed city, they meet the old man outsidethe first time they have seen anybody of that age. Remake Though a remake has not yet been produced, talk of a remake has been discussed almost continuously from the mid-1990s until as recently as 2015. In the mid-1990s, Warner Bros. began development of a remake of the movie. In April 2000, director Skip Woods entered negotiations with the studio and producer Joel Silver to write and direct the remake. The director planned to make it closer to the novel than the original film, restoring elements including Crazy Horse Mountain and sky gypsies. In March 2004, director Bryan Singer was brought in to develop and direct Logan's Run. Singer had begun working with production designer Guy Dyas from his previous film X2. Screenwriters Ethan Gross and Paul Todisco were hired to write the script with the director, with the film being slated for a 2005 release. In October, the director said he had begun previsualization of Logan's Run, which would be completed by the time he finished production of his project at the time, Superman Returns. The following December, screenwriter Dan Harris said that he and the director had turned in a first draft for Logan's Run. Harris said that further development of the project would take place in Sydney after production for Superman Returns, for which he also collaborated, was finalized. The screenwriter said that the remake would contain more action than the original film, describing the premise to be \\"a remake of the concept of the movie plus the book\\". In February 2005, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie was hired to rewrite the script, with filming to take place in Australia. In February 2006, Logan's Run was scheduled to begin production in September/October 2006 in Vancouver. The following May, Singer's availability to direct Logan's Run was rendered questionable by scheduling conflicts with filming the sequel to Superman Returns. By May, Singer confirmed that he would not direct Logan's Run, seeking a vacation from the demands of his job. Directors Robert Schwentke and James McTeigue were approached for the project, but neither ultimately signed on. In August 2006, production offices for Logan's Run were taken over by the production for the 2008 box office bomb Speed Racer. In April 2007, producer Joel Silver reiterated his plan to remake the original film. The following July, Silver said that since Singer's departure, no new director had come aboard the project. In August 2007, the project was reinvigorated with Joseph Kosinski hired as the new director and a new script being written by screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton. Kosinski had made a presentation to Warner Bros. including graphic art and animated previsualization that illustrated his plan for the film, whose low budget appealed to the studio. No progress was made, and Kosinski moved on to make Tron: Legacy (2010). In May and June 2010, Carl Erik Rinsch was hired to direct, and screenwriter Alex Garland was hired to write the film. Rinsch ultimately pulled out of the project due to scheduling conflicts. As of August 2011, Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn was attached to direct the remake starring actor Ryan Gosling and Rose Byrne with screenwriter Andrew Baldwin.Blastr.com (Syfy) - \\"Want a Wonder Woman movie? Better hope that Logan's Run is a hit!\\" (August 16, 2011) In October 2012, Justin Kroll of Variety tweeted that Gosling was no longer attached to the project. As of June 2013, video game developer Ken Levine, creator of the Bioshock series, was confirmed to be attached to write the screenplay. On April 6, 2015, it was revealed from The Tracking Board that the latest concept for the film was based on a female lead. Television A television series spin-off from the film, starring Gregory Harrison as Logan 5 and Heather Menzies as Jessica 6, lasted one season of 14 episodes, from September 16, 1977, through January 16, 1978, on U.S. television (CBS-TV). D. C. Fontana served as story editor and employed several other writers from Star Trek, as well as the original novel's authors. The series pilot was produced by Saul David, who was replaced by CBS with veteran television producers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts.

These birds remain fairly common despite continuing loss of habitat, but are secretive by nature and more often heard than seen. They are also considered a game species in some provinces and states, though rarely hunted. The Ecuadorian rail is often considered a subspecies, but some taxonomic authorities consider it distinct. Description R. l. aequatorialis (left) and nominate (right) Adults are mainly brown, darker on the back and crown, with orange-brown legs. To walk through dense vegetation, they have evolved a laterally compressed body and strong forehead feathers adapted to withstand wear from pushing through vegetation. Virginia rails have the highest ratio of leg-muscle to flight-muscle of all birds (25% - 15% of body weight respectively). They have long toes used to walk on floating vegetation. Their tail is short and they have a long slim reddish bill. Their cheeks are grey, with a light stripe over the eye and a whitish throat. Chicks are black. Juveniles are blackish brown on upperparts with rufous on the edge of feathers and brownish bill and legs. Their underparts are dark brown to black, while the face is grayish brown. Both sexes are very similar, with females being slightly smaller. Adults measure 20–27 cm, with a wingspan of 32–38 cm, and usually weigh 65-95 g. Taxonomy The Virginia rail is in the genus Rallus, a genus of other long-billed rails. It is thought to be closely related to R. semiplumbeus and R. antarcticus. There currently two recognized species of Rallus limicola: *R. l. limicola Vieillot, 1819 * R. l. friedmanni Dickerman, 1966 Habitat and Distribution The Virginia rail lives in freshwater and brackish marshes, sometimes salt marshes in winter. Northern populations migrate to the southern United States and Central America. On the Pacific coast, some are permanent residents. Its breeding habitat is marshes from Nova Scotia to Southern British Columbia, California and North Carolina, and in Central America. It often coexists with Soras. Behavior The Virginia rail often runs to escape predators, instead of flying. When it does fly, it is usually short distances or for migration. It can also swim and dive using its wings to propel itself. Vocalizations This bird has a number of calls, including a harsh kuk kuk kuk, usually heard at night. It also makes grunting noises. In spring, it will make tick-it or kid-ick calls. Diet The Virginia rail probe with its bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. It mainly eat insects and other aquatic invertebrates, like beetles, flies, dragonflies, crayfish, snails and earthworms. It can also eat aquatic animals like frogs, fish and some small snakes, as well as seeds. Animal preys constitute the biggest part of this bird's diet, but vegetation contributes to its diet in the fall and winter. Reproduction Courtship starts around May. The male will raise his wings and run back and forth next to the female. Both sexes bow, and the male feeds the female. Before copulation, the male approaches the female while grunting. Virginia rails are monogamous. Both parents build the nest and care for the young, whereas only the male defend the territory. The nest is built as the first egg is laid and consists of a basket of woven vegetation. The nest is made using plants like cattails, reeds and grasses. They also build dummy nests around the marsh. They nest near the base of emergent vegetation in areas with vegetation creating a canopy above the nest. This birds lays a clutch of 4 to 13 white or buff eggs with sparse gray or brown spotting. The eggs generally measure . They are incubated by both parents for a period of 20 to 22 days, in which the parents continue to add nesting material to conceal the nest. When the eggs hatch, the parents feed the young for two to three weeks, when the chicks become independent. The young can fly in less than a month. The pair bond between the parents breaks after the young become independent.

It was fought near Wiju (modern village of Sinuiju, North Korea) on the lower reaches of the Yalu River, on the border between Korea and China. The Russian situation The Imperial Russian Army commander in the Far East, General Alexei Kuropatkin followed a strategy of stalling while waiting for enough reinforcements to come up to the front via the incomplete single-track Trans- Siberian Railway to take the offensive. He estimated that it would take at least 6 months to build his forces up to suitable levels. The Viceroy of the Russian Far East, Yevgeni Alekseyev, had given General Kuropatkin strict orders not to hinder the Japanese northward progress through Korea, but to hold the line of the Yalu River to prevent the Japanese from crossing into Manchuria. On 22 April 1904 Kuropatkin dispatched the \\"Eastern Detachment\\" under the command of Lieutenant-General Mikhail Zasulich with 16,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and some 62 artillery pieces to fight a static delaying action on the north bank of the river. However, Zasulich's force was spread out piecemeal over a 170-mile front, whereas the Imperial Japanese Army could concentrate its efforts on any single point of its choosing. General Zasulich did not hold the Japanese in very high regard. Most of the Russian forces were deployed near Wiju, blocking the main road from Korea to Manchuria. Small detachments guarded the bank up and down the river. The Japanese situation The crossing of the Yalu River by Marshal Baron of Kuroki's troops. The picture also shows the construction of a bridge over barges by the Japanese on the Korean side near the island of Housan for the passage of the 2nd Army Division (Angelo Agostini, O Malho, 1904). After the success of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Chemulpo Bay on 9 February 1904, the way was clear for the Imperial Japanese Army to deploy the 2nd, the 12th, and the Guards Divisions of the Japanese 1st Army, commanded by Major-General Baron Tamemoto Kuroki, into Korea. The total strength of Japanese force was about 42,500 men. The Japanese 1st Army advanced quickly northwards from Chemulpo (modern Incheon), with advance units entering Pyongyang on 21 February 1904 and Anju by 18 March 1904. Learning their lessons in logistics and transport from the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army hired some 10,000 local laborers at wages well above the local norms, and paid also for any food and supplies procured locally. This contrasted greatly with the behavior of the Russian troops previously in northern Korea. By seizing the port of Chinampo (modern Nampo, North Korea) at the mouth of the Taedong River outside of Pyongyang with the spring thaw, the Japanese were able to land the remaining components of the 1st Army by 29 March. Japanese troops landing on Nampo By 21 April 1904 the Japanese 1st Army was concentrated and hidden south of Wiju. The Japanese were in the same positions on the southern bank of the Yalu River that they had been in August 1894. The Japanese knew the exact locations of the Russians' deployment from intelligence by forward scouts disguised as Korean fishermen, the Russians made no effort to conceal their positions.Connaughton, p.75 By 23 April, the Japanese knew the layout of the Russian trench line and details of the defensive positions around the area of Antung. Intelligence was so effective that the Japanese estimate of the Russian troop strength was only exceeded by 1000 and the estimate of the guns which was only two less than the actual number. The Japanese made every effort to keep their positions hidden. Screens of trees, millet and bushes were used to conceal activity as well as roads, artillery and other equipment. Prelude Picture of Our Valorous Military Repulsing the Russian Cossack Cavalry on the Bank of the Yalu River by Watanabe Nobukazu (1874–1944), March 1904 Japanese Troops crossing the Yalu River The prelude to major action took place at 21:45 (9:45 pm) on the night of 25 April 1904, when two battalions of the Japanese 2nd Division seized two islands in the Yalu River without opposition. After reinforcement at 0400 on 26 April by units from the Guards Division and a brief firefight, the forward Russian observation post withdrew to the main Russian lines on the north shore. Japanese engineers determined that ten bridges 1,630 yards (1490.5m) would be required to span the river. A third of these were steel prefabricated pontoons which weighed 100 pounds each.Connaughton, p.76 The remainder were made from local resources. In full view of Russian positions, the Japanese began constructing a causeway across the Yalu River, which was immediately targeted by two Russian batteries. With the Russians so engaged, the Japanese prepared nine other bridges that could quickly be moved into position for a rapid assault across the river at other locations. Once the midstream islands were secured, General Kuroki ordered a feint on the lower Yalu River when Japanese gunboats engaged Cossack detachments at the river mouth. This convinced General Zasulich that the main Japanese attack would fall on the vicinity of the town of Antung, and he concentrated his forces there. Kuroki was thus able to maneuver against the weak Russian left, and deployed the 12th Division and Guards Division across the Yalu River at a fordable point. The Russians observed these movements with trepidation, and General Kashtalinsky informed General Zasulich that the Japanese were about to assault the position in force and his position was in danger of being flanked. Zasulich chose to ignore the reports, thinking that the attack was only a feint, and redeployed a single battalion with four guns. Zasulitch remained convinced that the main Japanese attack would fall at Antung, and kept his main force as well as his reserves at that location. The main battle Map of the crossing over the Yalu River by the Japanese 1st. Army. Russian map depicting positions of the Eastern detachment and Japanese advance. The Japanese main attack began in the early morning hours of 27 April 1904. By 0300, the balance of the 12th Division had crossed the river and was advancing in three columns. While the Japanese 12th Division advanced on the right, the Guards Division was moving into position in the center. By 0400, the artillery of the Guards Division was within range of the exposed Russian lines. The Japanese First Army continued its three-pronged advance and was across the Yalu by midnight of 29 April 1904 with very little opposition. Limited visibility masked the Japanese movements from Russian observation. When the fog finally lifted about 0500, the Japanese artillery opened up on the Russian formations. The 2nd Division took its position on the center, advancing on the newly erected causeways leading from the town of Wiju and thus catching the Russians in a pincer movement at the hamlet of Chuliengcheng, on the Manchurian-side of the Yalu River opposite Wiju. By 1000, the Russians were in full retreat, with a Japanese attempt to block their escape towards Fenghuangcheng to the north. The Japanese had a number of 4.7 inch howitzers, custom-made by Krupp, which they used with devastating effect on the exposed Russians. In light of these developments, General Zasulitch was strongly encouraged by his staff to pull back to a more defensible position. However, the general stubbornly refused to concede, even sending a telegram to Tsar Nicholas II in Saint Petersburg informing that victory was soon certain. He chose to ignore General Kuropatkin's phased withdrawal orders (as confirmed by Kuropatkin's chief of staff, General V.V. Sakarov). General Kuroki had planned to continue the advance of the 12th Division to envelop the Russian left. However, now that the enemy artillery had been neutralized, he decided to engage the Guards and the 2nd Division in a simultaneous assault. It was at this point the Japanese encountered the first serious resistance from the Russian lines. The advance of the 2nd Division was disrupted for a time, and had any of the Russian artillery survived, the outcome might have been different. The Russians were driven from their trenches with severe losses, and the survivors fell back to the tops of the hills, the position that Zasulitch's advisors had unsuccessfully encouraged him to fall back to earlier. During the retreat, a counterattack was made by elements of the Russian 12th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, which was cut to pieces and opened further the breaks in the Russian lines. The Russian position now became wholly untenable, and remaining formations now were in danger of being encircled. General Zasulich was ordered to retreat. The 11th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, which was covering a retreat, was cut off by the Japanese and suffered large casualties during its breakthrough back to the other Russian forces. At the appearance of the Japanese 12th Division, the Russian left flank panicked and collapsed. At 1730 on 1 May 1904, remnants of the Russian Eastern Detachment either surrendered or escaped towards Fenghuangcheng to the north and the Battle for the Yalu River came to an end. Outcome The Battle of the Yalu River ended in victory for Japan. The combat had cost the Japanese 1036 dead and wounded out of the total 1st Army strength of 42,500.Connaughton, p.64 The Russian Eastern Detachment suffered some 2700 casualties overall, including about 500 killed, 1000 wounded, 600 prisoners and the loss of 21 of 24 field guns. Significance The Battle of the Yalu River was the first major land campaign of the Russo-Japanese War. The defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed the perception that the Japanese would be an easy enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor.Connaughton, p.65 Notes References * Connaughton, Richard (2003).

He is best known for his \\"Elling\\" tetralogy: Utsikt til paradiset (1993), Fugledansen (1995), Brødre i blodet (1996), and Elsk meg i morgen (1999). Brødre i blodet (\\"Blood brothers\\") was turned into a successful movie, entitled Elling, which received an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category in 2001. The English translation of the novel is called Beyond the Great Indoors. Born in Tønsberg and raised in Larvik, his semi-autobiographical debut novel23-salen (\\"The 23rd Row\\"), criticized mental health care in Norway. All of his novels take the side of the outsider, including his break-through novel Hvite Niggere (\\"White Niggers\\", 1986). The novel is about a young man who leads a life somewhat on the edges of normal society. He is also known for his series for young people \\"Pelle og Proffen\\" which focuses on two teenage detectives who get involved in all kinds of mysteries and crimes involving drugs, pollution and neo-Nazism among other things. He started this project after reading some of Franklin W. Dixon's books about The Hardy Boys. The books Døden på Oslo S, Giftige Løgner, and De Blå Ulvene of this series were also turned into successful movies. In 2005 the book Drapene i Barkvik (\\"The murders in Barkvik\\") appeared, about the teenager Fillip Moberg attempting to solve an axe murder in a small Norwegian village. In 2010 Ambjørnsen stopped writing novels; Farvel til romanen. 24 timer i grenseland, published in 2014, is about that decision and about how he came to write his novels. Ambjørnsen has received many prizes for his writing. Among them are the Norwegian Booksellers Association's prize for the best book of the 1980s for children and young adults (Pelle and Proffen books), the Tabu prize in 2001, the Telenor Culture Award in 2002, and the Brage Prize in 1995. His three Samson and Roberto books have become particularly popular in Russia, in part due to the illustrations by Nikolay Vorontsov, which also contribute carefully orchestrated local Russian-related colloquialisms to the stories. Until 2014, Ambjørnsen frequently reviewed books for the Norwegian newspaper VG. Since 1985 he has lived in Hamburg with his German wife and translator, Gabriele Haefs. In 2009 he was made an honorary citizen of Larvik.

Dilworth for Cartoon Network and the eighth of the Cartoon Cartoons. It was produced by Dilworth's animation studio, Stretch Films. The title character is a pink, anthropomorphic dog who lives with an elderly couple in a farmhouse in the middle of \\"Nowhere\\". In each episode, the trio are thrown into bizarre, frequently disturbing and often paranormal or supernatural-type misadventures. The series is known for its dark, surreal humor and atmosphere. Dilworth pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animated shorts showcase What a Cartoon! and a pilot titled \\"The Chicken from Outer Space\\" aired on Cartoon Network on February 18, 1996. The segment was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to Wallace and Gromit's A Close Shave. The short was greenlit to become a series, which premiered on November 12, 1999, and ended on November 22, 2002, with four seasons each consisting of thirteen episodes. During its run, the series was nominated for three Golden Reel Awards and one Annie Award. Merchandise based on the series has also been produced, such as home media releases, toys, and clothing.  Premise  Courage the Cowardly Dog follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), a kind yet easily frightened pink dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were forcibly sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian. Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea White), a friendly, sweet-natured Scottish woman, who decided to take Courage in as her own, and was inspired by the nature of this first meeting to give him his name. In the present, he lives with the now elderly Muriel and her also elderly husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson episodes 1–33, Arthur Anderson episodes 34–52), a grumpy, selfish and greedy farmer who regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and refers to him as \\"stupid dog\\". The entire family lives in a small, isolated farmhouse in what consists of a large, desert-like area in the middle of Kansas: the nearest town to the farmhouse is a fictional town with the literal name of Nowhere. Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, demons, mad scientists, zombies, vampires, and other such perils involving the paranormal or supernatural. The plot generally uses conventions common to horror films. Although most of the creatures that the three face are hostile, some only appear that way, but are simply suffering from distress and/or acting in desperation, and can even turn out to be friendly to them. The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks. Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show's cast, including Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer (Simon Prebble); the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (Paul Schoeffler); a fortune-telling chihuahua named Shirley the Medium (Mary Testa); Eustace's mother \\"Ma\\" (Billie Lou Watt); and villains Katz and Le Quack (both voiced by Schoeffler).  Production   Creation  Originally, Courage the Cowardly Dog was created as a seven-minute animated short, \\"The Chicken from Outer Space\\". Dilworth started the animated short with Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced Courage. Dilworth graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1985. He became an art director and founded his own animation studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994. The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons in 1996, a Hanna-Barbera Cartoons innovation by then-president Fred Seibert. The short served as a de facto pilot for the future series. The original animated short had no dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had a more authoritative voice than in the series. It was uttered by voice actor Howard Hoffman who also provided all the other vocal sounds and effects for the short. An alien chicken was the villain in this short, who later reappears in the series to seek revenge. His sons also attempt to seek revenge in a later episode. The short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards. In 1999, Cartoon Network gave Dilworth permission to turn the short into an animated series. Hanna-Barbera was responsible for the What a Cartoon! anthology and intended on developing the series. However, Dilworth insisted on taking the production to his Stretch Films Studios. The stories' plots were written by the show's head writer, David Steven Cohen, in addition to Irv Bauer, Craig Shemin, Lory Lazarus, Bill Marsilii, Allan Neuwirth, Bill Aronson and Michelle Dilworth.  Sound design  When deciding on sound effects, Dilworth tried to avoid pre-made stock sounds. He contributed a substantial amount of new material to sound designer Michael Geisler and only looked for sounds that made him laugh. The composition of the series' music relied on what was being portrayed: suspense, comedy, or action. The production crew worked together to come up with new music for the series that had not previously been used. There were a few sections on one particular piece that Dilworth exceptionally liked. The production crew was able to isolate these sections and expand them into a usable theme. Dilworth further complicated the crew's job by suggesting layering the theme with a variety of funny sounds, a strange tempo and a voice-over of a crazed laugh or person singing to give the music and sound effects their own personality beyond anything else out there. Original music featured in Courage the Cowardly Dog was composed by Jody Gray and Andy Ezrin. Classical music can be heard at times, which pays homage to classic Warner Bros. animation and the scores of Carl Stalling. In several episodes, Gray arranged various famous classical pieces, such as Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\", and wrote up to 15 songs.  Broadcast history  Courage the Cowardly Dog originally was premiered as a short on February 18, 1996. The show premiered on November 12, 1999, and became the highest-rated premiere in Cartoon Network history at the time. It last aired on November 22, 2002, with 52 episodes produced in four seasons.  Episodes  In total, there were 52 episodes in four seasons produced, plus a pilot episode and a special episode. The series ran from November 12, 1999, to November 22, 2002.  Reception  John G. Nettles of PopMatters reviewed the show and called it, \\"a fascinating and textured mixture of cartoon and horror-movie conventions, and a joy to watch.\\" Alex Mastas of Lights Out Films reviewed the show gave it a grade \\"A−\\" and described it: \\"The backgrounds are rich and imaginative—they composite a lot of the show over real photos and occasionally integrate CGI into the cartoon. The look is weird and ethereal, just like the show itself.\\" KJ Dell Antonia of Common Sense Media gave three stars out of five with the summary, \\"Cult fave 'toon plays over-the-top violence for laughs.\\" Antonia warned parents that the series contains graphic animated violence, including \\"exploding organs, growing extra limbs, turning inside out, you name it\\". Randy Miller III of DVD Talk said that shows aimed at younger audiences \\"usually don't go for thrills and chills, so it's good to see a genuinely surreal and slanted series develop a decent following.\\" Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics reviewed the first season DVD and felt a bit disappointed about its lack of the original Hanna-Barbera short \\"The Chicken from Outer Space\\". Swindoll felt that the lack of special features still should not deter fans from buying the season since the other episodes have appeared on other releases of the series.

In 1989, Renault took the complete ownership of IMV's car manufacturing division under the name Revoz, while its touring caravan and motor home division was established as separate business entity in 1995 under the name Adria Mobil.

When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if another contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. Triggers may occur if one- tenth of the insect is within contact. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption. Dionaea is a monotypic genus closely related to the waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa) and sundews (Drosera), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae. Although widely cultivated for sale, the population of the Venus flytrap has been rapidly declining in its native range. The species is currently under Endangered Species Act review by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Etymology The plant's common name refers to Venus, the Roman goddess of love. The genus name, Dionaea (\\"daughter of Dione\\"), refers to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, while the species name, muscipula, is Latin for both \\"mousetrap\\" and \\"flytrap\\". The Latin word muscipula (\\"mousetrap\\") is derived from mus (\\"mouse\\") and decipula (\\"trap\\"), while the homonym word muscipula (\\"flytrap\\") is derived from musca (\\"fly\\") and decipula (\\"trap\\"). Historically, the plant was also known by the slang term \\"tipitiwitchet\\" or \\"tippity twitchet\\", possibly an oblique reference to the plant's resemblance to human female genitalia. The term is similar to the term tippet-de-witchet which derives from tippet and witchet (archaic term for vagina). In contrast, the English botanist John Ellis, who gave the plant its scientific name in 1768, wrote that the plant name tippitywichit was an indigenous word from either Cherokee or Catawba. The plant name according to the Handbook of American Indians derives from the Renape word titipiwitshik (\\"they (leaves) which wind around (or involve)\\"). Discovery On 2 April 1759, the North Carolina colonial governor, Arthur Dobbs, penned the first written description of the plant in a letter to English botanist Peter Collinson. In the letter he wrote: \\"We have a kind of Catch Fly Sensitive which closes upon anything that touches it. It grows in Latitude 34 but not in 35. I will try to save the seed here.\\" A year later, Dobbs went into greater detail about the plant in a letter to Collinson dated Brunswick, 24 January 1760.The Nature Conservancy – Venus Flytrap This was the first detailed recorded notice of the plant by Europeans. The description was before John Ellis' letter to The London Magazine on 1 September 1768, and his letter to Carl Linnaeus on 23 September 1768, in which he described the plant and proposed its English name Venus's Flytrap and scientific name Dionaea muscipula.Directions for Bringing over Seeds and Plants, from the East Indies and Other Distant Countries, in a State of Vegetation: Together with a Catalogue of Such Foreign Plants as Are Worthy of Being Encouraged in Our American Colonies, for the Purposes of Medicine, Agriculture, and Commerce. To Which is Added, the Figure and Botanical Description of a New Sensitive Plant, Called Dionæa muscipula: or, Venus's Fly-trap – (London, printed and sold by L. Davis, 1770).  Description  The Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year; longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than seven leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground. Illustration from Curtis's Botanical Magazine by William Curtis (1746–1799) The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair- like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant's close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera. The holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape, presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them. If the prey is too small and escapes, the trap will usually reopen within 12 hours. If the prey moves around in the trap, it tightens and digestion begins more quickly. Speed of closing can vary depending on the amount of humidity, light, size of prey, and general growing conditions. The speed with which traps close can be used as an indicator of a plant's general health. Venus flytraps are not as humidity-dependent as are some other carnivorous plants, such as Nepenthes, Cephalotus, most Heliamphora, and some Drosera. The Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground or extends up at an angle of about 40–60 degrees. The four major forms are: 'typica', the most common, with broad decumbent petioles; 'erecta', with leaves at a 45-degree angle; 'linearis', with narrow petioles and leaves at 45 degrees; and 'filiformis', with extremely narrow or linear petioles. Except for 'filiformis', all of these can be stages in leaf production of any plant depending on season (decumbent in summer versus short versus semi-erect in spring), length of photoperiod (long petioles in spring versus short in summer), and intensity of light (wide petioles in low light intensity versus narrow in brighter light). The plant also has a flower on top of a long stem, about 6 inches long. The flower is pollinated from various flying insects such as sweat bees, longhorn beetles and checkered beetles. Habitat and distribution Habitat Map of the original distribution of the Venus flytrap The Venus flytrap is found in nitrogen- and phosphorus-poor environments, such as bogs and wet savannahs. Small in stature and slow- growing, the Venus flytrap tolerates fire well and depends on periodic burning to suppress its competition. Fire suppression threatens its future in the wild. It survives in wet sandy and peaty soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is native only to the coastal bogs of North and South Carolina in the United States, specifically within a 100-kilometer (60 mi) radius of Wilmington, North Carolina.Darwin, C. R. 1875. Insectivorous Plants. One such place is North Carolina's Green Swamp. There also appears to be a naturalized population of Venus flytraps in northern Florida as well as an introduced population in western Washington.Giblin, D. Nd. Dionaea muscipula. Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. The nutritional poverty of the soil is the reason it relies on such elaborate traps: insect prey provide the nitrogen for protein formation that the soil cannot. They tolerate mild winters, and Venus flytraps that do not go through a period of winter dormancy will weaken and die after a period of time. They are full sun plants, usually found only in areas with less than 10% canopy cover. The microhabitat where it thrives is typically sparse with grasses, herbs, sphagnum, and often bare patches where there aren't enough nutrients for noncarnivorous plants to survive, or where fires regularly clear competition and prevent cover from forming. Thus, natural fires are an important part of its habitat, required every 3–5 years in most places for D. muscipula to thrive. After fire, D. muscipula seeds germinate well in ash and sandy soil, with seedlings growing well in the open post-fire conditions. The seeds germinate immediately without a dormant period.  Distribution  Dionaea muscipula occurs naturally only along the coastal plain of North and South Carolina in the U.S, with all known current sites within 90 km of Wilmington, North Carolina. A 1958 survey of herbaria specimens and old documents found 259 sites where the historical record documented the presence of D. muscipula, within 21 counties in North and South Carolina. As of 2019, it was considered extirpated in North Carolina in the inland counties of Moore, Robeson, and Lenoir, as well as the South Carolina coastal counties of Charleston and Georgetown. Remaining extant populations exist in North Carolina in Beaufort, Craven, Pamlico, Carteret, Jones, Onslow, Duplin, Pender, New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, Bladen, Sampson, Cumberland, and Hoke counties, and in South Carolina in Horry county.  Population  A large-scale survey in 2019, conducted by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, counted a total of 163,951 individual Venus flytraps in North Carolina and 4,876 in South Carolina, estimating a total of 302,000 individuals remaining in the wild in its native range. This represents a reduction of more than 93% from a 1979 estimate of approximately 4,500,000 individuals. A 1958 study found 259 confirmed extant or historic sites. As of 2016, there were 71 known sites where the plant could be found in the wild. Of these 71 sites, only 20 were classified as having excellent or good long-term viability. Carnivory A closing trap Prey selectivity A time lapse showing Venus flytrap catching prey Most carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. The Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects. Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects, whereas Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs. Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs. This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form. Mechanism of trapping Closeup of one of the hinged trigger hairs The Venus flytrap is one of a very small group of plants capable of rapid movement, such as Mimosa pudica, the Telegraph plant, sundews and bladderworts. The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. The trap only shuts when there have been two stimulations of the trigger hairs; this is to avoid inadvertent triggering of the mechanism by dust and other wind-borne debris. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions—see calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them. It is hypothesized that there is a threshold of ion buildup for the Venus flytrap to react to stimulation. The acid growth theory states that individual cells in the outer layers of the lobes and midrib rapidly move 1H+ (hydrogen ions) into their cell walls, lowering the pH and loosening the extracellular components, which allows them to swell rapidly by osmosis, thus elongating and changing the shape of the trap lobe. Alternatively, cells in the inner layers of the lobes and midrib may rapidly secrete other ions, allowing water to follow by osmosis, and the cells to collapse. Both of these mechanisms may play a role and have some experimental evidence to support them.Williams, S. E. 2002. Comparative physiology of the Droseraceae sensu stricto – How do tentacles bend and traps close? Proceedings of the 4th International Carnivorous Plant Society Conference. Tokyo, Japan. pp. 77–81. Flytraps show a clear example of memory in plants, the plant knows if its hair has been touched, and remembers that for a few seconds. The plant then recalls that incident if a second touch happens during that time frame, and closes. After closing, the flytrap counts additional stimulations of the trigger hairs, to five total, to start the production of digesting enzymes. Muscoid fly. Paria. Digestion If the prey is unable to escape, it will continue to stimulate the inner surface of the lobes, and this causes a further growth response that forces the edges of the lobes together, eventually sealing the trap hermetically and forming a \\"stomach\\" in which digestion occurs. Release of the digestive enzymes is controlled by the hormone jasmonic acid, the same hormone that triggers the release of toxins as an anti-herbivore defense mechanism in non-carnivorous plants. (See Evolution below) Once the digestive glands in the leaf lobes have been activated, digestion is catalysed by hydrolase enzymes secreted by the glands. Oxidative protein modification is likely to be a pre-digestive mechanism used by Dionaea muscipula. Aqueous leaf extracts have been found to contain quinones such as the naphthoquinone plumbagin that couples to different NADH-dependent diaphorases to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide upon autoxidation. Such oxidative modification could rupture animal cell membranes. Plumbagin is known to induce apoptosis, associated with the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. When the Dionaea extracts were pre-incubated with diaphorases and NADH in the presence of serum albumin (SA), subsequent tryptic digestion of SA was facilitated. Since the secretory glands of Droseraceae contain proteases and possibly other degradative enzymes, it may be that the presence of oxygen- activating redox cofactors function as extracellular pre-digestive oxidants to render membrane-bound proteins of the prey (insects) more susceptible to proteolytic attacks. Digestion takes about ten days, after which the prey is reduced to a husk of chitin. The trap then reopens, and is ready for reuse. Evolution Drosera falconeri, with short, wide, sticky leaf traps Carnivory in plants is a very specialized form of foliar feeding, and is an adaptation found in several plants that grow in nutrient-poor soil. Carnivorous traps were naturally selected to allow these organisms to compensate for the nutrient deficiencies of their harsh environments and compensate for the reduced photosynthetic benefit. Phylogenetic studies have shown that carnivory in plants is a common adaptation in habitats with abundant sunlight and water but scarce nutrients. Carnivory has evolved independently six times in the angiosperms based on extant species, with likely many more carnivorous plant lineages now extinct. The \\"snap trap\\" mechanism characteristic of Dionaea is shared with only one other carnivorous plant genus, Aldrovanda. For most of the 20th century, this relationship was thought to be coincidental, more precisely an example of convergent evolution. Some phylogenetic studies even suggested that the closest living relatives of Aldrovanda were the sundews. It was not until 2002 that a molecular evolutionary study, by analyzing combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences, indicated that Dionaea and Aldrovanda were closely related and that the snap trap mechanism evolved only once in a common ancestor of the two genera. A 2009 study presented evidence for the evolution of snap traps of Dionaea and Aldrovanda from a flypaper trap like Drosera regia, based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data imply that Dionaea and Aldrovanda snap traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with Drosera. Pre-adaptations to the evolution of snap traps were identified in several species of Drosera, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap trap evolved from the flypaper traps, driven by increasing prey size. Bigger prey provides greater nutritional value, but large insects can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; the evolution of snap traps would therefore prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive benefit from it), and would also permit a more complete digestion. In 2016, a study of the expression of genes in the plant's leaves as they captured and digested prey was published in the journal, Genome Research. The gene activation observed in the leaves of the plants gives support to the hypothesis that the carnivorous mechanisms present in the flytrap are a specially adapted version of mechanisms used by non-carnivorous plants to defend against herbivorous insects. In many non-carnivorous plants, jasmonic acid serves as a signaling molecule for the activation of defense mechanisms, such as the production of hydrolases, which can destroy chitin and other molecular components of insect and microbial pests. In the Venus flytrap, this same molecule has been found to be responsible for the activation of the plant's digestive glands. A few hours after the capture of prey, another set of genes is activated inside the glands, the same set of genes that is active in the roots of other plants, allowing them to absorb nutrients. The use of similar biological pathways in the traps as non- carnivorous plants use for other purposes indicates that somewhere in its evolutionary history, the Venus flytrap repurposed these genes to facilitate carnivory. Proposed evolutionary history Carnivorous plants are generally herbaceous, and their traps the result of primary growth. They generally do not form readily fossilizable structures such as thick bark or wood. As a result, there is no fossil evidence of the steps that might link Dionaea and Aldrovanda, or either genus with their common ancestor, Drosera. Nevertheless, it is possible to infer an evolutionary history based on phylogenetic studies of both genera. Researchers have proposed a series of steps that would ultimately result in the complex snap-trap mechanism: * Larger insects usually walk over the plant, instead of flying to it, and are more likely to break free from sticky glands alone. Therefore, a plant with wider leaves, like Drosera falconeri, must have adapted to move the trap and its stalks in directions that maximized its chance of capturing and retaining such prey—in this particular case, longitudinally. Once adequately \\"wrapped\\", escape would be more difficult. * Evolutionary pressure then selected for plants with shorter response time, in a manner similar to Drosera burmannii or Drosera glanduligera. The faster the closing, the less reliant on the flypaper model the plant would be. * As the trap became more and more active, the energy required to \\"wrap\\" the prey increased. Plants that could somehow differentiate between actual insects and random detritus/rain droplets would have an advantage, thus explaining the specialization of inner tentacles into trigger hairs. * Ultimately, as the plant relied more on closing around the insect rather than gluing them to the leaf surface, the tentacles so evident in Drosera would lose their original function altogether, becoming the \\"teeth\\" and trigger hairs—an example of natural selection utilizing pre-existing structures for new functions. * Completing the transition, the plant eventually developed the depressed digestive glands found inside the trap, rather than using the dews in the stalks, further differentiating it from genus Drosera. Phylogenetic studies using molecular characters place the emergence of carnivory in the ancestors of Dionaea muscipula to 85.6 million years ago, and the development of the snap-trap tn the ancestors of Dionaea and its sister genus Aldrovanda to approximately 48 million years ago. Cultivation Dionaea muscipula 'Akai Ryu', Japanese for 'Red Dragon', in cultivation Plants can be propagated by seed, taking around four to five years to reach maturity. More commonly, they are propagated by clonal division in spring or summer. Venus flytraps can also be propagated in vitro using plant tissue culture. Most Venus flytraps found for sale in nurseries garden centers have been produced using this method, as this is the most cost-effective way to propagate them on a large scale. Regardless of the propagation method used, the plants will live for 20 to 30 years if cultivated in the right conditions. Cultivars Venus flytraps are by far the most commonly recognized and cultivated carnivorous plant, and they are frequently sold as houseplants. Various cultivars (cultivated varieties) have come into the market through tissue culture of selected genetic mutations, and these plants are raised in large quantities for commercial markets. The cultivars 'Akai Ryu and 'South West Giant' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Conservation Although widely cultivated for sale as a houseplant, D. muscipula has suffered a significant decline in its population in the wild. The population in its native range is estimated to have decreased 93% since 1979.  Status  The species is under Endangered Species Act review by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. The current review commenced in 2018, after an initial \\"90-day\\" review found that action may be warranted. A previous review in 1993 resulted in a determination that the plant was a \\"Potential candidate without sufficient data on vulnerability\\". The IUCN Red List classifies the species as \\"vulnerable\\". The State of North Carolina lists Dionaea muscipula as a species of \\"Special Concern–Vulnerable\\". In 2010, CITES listed it as an Appendix II species. NatureServe classified it as \\"Imperiled\\" (G2) in a 2018 review. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not indicated a timeline to conclude its current review of Dionaea muscipula. The Endangered Species Act specifies a two-year timeline for a species review. However, the species listing process takes 12.1 years on average.  Threats  The Venus flytrap is only found in the wild in a very particular set of conditions, requiring flat land with moist, acidic, nutrient-poor soils that receive full sun and burn frequently in forest fires, and is therefore sensitive to many types of disturbance. A 2011 review identified five categories of threats for the species: agriculture, road-building, biological resource use (poaching and lumber activities), natural systems modifications (drainage and fire suppression), and pollution (fertilizer). Habitat loss is a major threat to the species. The human population of the coastal Carolinas is rapidly expanding. For example, Brunswick County, North Carolina, which has the largest number of Venus flytrap populations, has seen a 27% increase in its human population from 2010 to 2018. As the population grows, residential and commercial development and road building directly eliminate flytrap habitat, while site preparation that entails ditching and draining can dry out soil in surrounding areas, destroying the viability of the species. Additionally, increased recreational use of natural areas in populated areas directly destroys the plants by crushing or uprooting them. Fire suppression is another threat to the Venus flytrap. In the absence of regular fires, shrubs and trees encroach, outcompeting the species and leading to local extirpations. D. muscipola requires fire every 3–5 years, and best thrives with annual brush fires. Although flytraps and their seeds are typically killed alongside their competition in fires, seeds from flytraps adjacent to the burnt zone propagate quickly in the ash and full sun conditions that occur post a fire disturbance. Because the mature plants and new seedlings are typically destroyed in the regular fires that are necessary to maintain their habitat, D. muscipula's survival relies upon adequate seed production and dispersal from outside the burnt patches back into the burnt habitat, requiring a critical mass of populations, and exposing the success of any one population to metapopulation dynamics. These dynamics make small, isolated populations particularly vulnerable to extirpation, for if there are no mature plants adjacent to the fire zone, there is no source of seeds post-fire. Poaching has been another cause of population decline. Harvesting Venus flytraps on public land became illegal in North Carolina in 1958, and since then a legal cultivation industry has formed, growing tens of thousands of flytraps in commercial greenhouses for sale as household plants. Yet in 2016, the NY Times reported that demand for wild plants still exists, which \\"has led to a 'Venus flytrap crime ring.'\\" In 2014, the state of North Carolina made Venus flytrap poaching a felony. Since then, several poachers have been charged, with one man receiving 17 months in prison for poaching 970 Venus flytraps, and another man charged with 73 felony counts in 2019. Poachers may do greater harm to the wild populations than a simple count of individuals taken would indicate, as they may selectively harvest the largest plants at a site, which have more flowers and fruit and therefore generate more seeds than smaller plants. Additionally, the species is particularly vulnerable to catastrophic climate events. Most Venus flytrap sites are only 2–4 meters (6.5 –13 feet) above sea level and are located in a region prone to hurricanes, making storm surges and rising sea levels a long-term threat.  Designations  In 2005, the Venus flytrap was designated as the state carnivorous plant of North Carolina. In alternative medicine Venus flytrap extract is available on the market as an herbal remedy, sometimes as the prime ingredient of a patent medicine named \\"Carnivora\\". According to the American Cancer Society, these products are promoted in alternative medicine as a treatment for a variety of human ailments including HIV, Crohn's disease and skin cancer, but \\"available scientific evidence does not support the health claims made for Venus flytrap extract\\".

R. R. Tolkien, originally told in 1925, about the adventures of a young dog, Rover. In the story, an irritable wizard turns Rover into a toy, and Rover goes to the Moon and under the sea in order to find the wizard again to turn him back into a normal-sized dog. The author wrote Roverandom for his son Michael to amuse him upon the loss of his favourite toy, a little leaden dog which he lost on a beach of grey shingle stones the same size and colour as the toy. The work is in tone a children's story, but contains many allusions and references in the manner of Farmer Giles of Ham. It was submitted for publication in 1937 after the success of The Hobbit, but was not published for over sixty years, finally being released in 1998. Roverandom was included in the collection Tales from the Perilous Realm from its 2009 reprinting onwards.  Characters  Major * Rover(andom) - The main character. A young puppy that is white with black ears. He is rather rude and excitable when first introduced. This is what causes him to irritate Artaxerxes in the first place. * Artaxerxes - The wizard who meets Roverandom while on holiday. Wears a green hat with a blue feather in it. Comes from Persia but got lost and now lives in Pershore. * Psamathos Psamathides - The chief of all Psamathists (sand-sorcerers). He is described as being the size of a large dog and being very ugly, with long ears that stick up. Days and nights he hides closely under the surface of the cove's sands, taking a nap - or two. He snuggles himself into the sand as into a warm blanket and only comes out when the sky begins to look like teatime or when some amusement is going on: a dance of the mermaids, for example. Otherwise one can hardly find him, tucked up amidst the endlessly stretching covesands. (This being somewhat resembles the Psammead from E. Nesbit's Five Children and It.) * Mew - A seagull that carries Roverandom down the moon path to the Moon. * The Man in the Moon - The greatest of all magicians. He gives Rover the name Roverandom, so as not to confuse the two Rovers. * Rover the Moon Dog - The Man in the Moon's dog. * Rover the Sea Dog - The Dog under the Sea. Minor * Tinker - The cat whom Rover lived with before becoming a toy. * Little Boy Two - The boy who owned Rover as a toy. An allusion to Michael Tolkien, the author's second son. * the Great White Dragon - The chief of the Moon's dragons. * the Sea-serpent * Uin - The right whale that takes Roverandom under the Sea. * Grandmother - Roverandom's first owner. It is revealed at the end that she is the grandmother of Little Boy Two. * the mer-king - ruler of the mer-folk * Mrs. Artaxerxes - Daughter of the mer-king and wife of Artaxerxes.  Places  * The Moon - Rover goes to the Moon seeking the Man in the Moon's help. The Moon is highly fantasized; envisioned by Tolkien as a place full of mythical creatures reminiscent of those found in the works of Lewis Carroll. Traits of the Moon's trees foreshadow those of the mallorn trees of Lothlórien.Christina Scull & Wayne G. Hammond (1998, editors), Roverandom, 2013 pocket edition, Harper Collins, Notes p. 177; * The Cove - Where Psamathos lives and Roverandom is accidentally left by Boy Two. It is located on the north-east coast of England. Its description as a \\"queer cove\\", an allusion to the English expression meaning 'odd fellow, rogue', is one of many plays-on-words in the book. * The Isle of Dogs - An island Mew and Rover fly over on the way to the moon. Mew describes it as a place lucky or deserving lost dogs go. A place where they can make as much noise as they want, with bone trees growing everywhere. It is a fanciful allusion to the Isle of Dogs and the Dogger Bank. * Under the Sea - The mer-king's realm * Faery: the tale's brief glimpse of the Shadowy Seas and Elvenhome links it to Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.

It is in the London Borough of Newham. The community centres around Maryland Station and borders Leytonstone to the north, Stratford New Town to the west and Forest Gate to the east, with Stratford town centre to the south- west. History Maryland's earliest known recorded appearance is on a map of Essex published by J. Oliver in 1696, where it is marked as 'Maryland Point'. The origin of the name is uncertain. One popular theory is that it originated with a rich local merchant who bought land and built in the area having returned from the American colony of Maryland (itself named for Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I). If true, then London's Maryland would be unusual example of a place in Britain named after an American location, rather than vice versa. (Various attempts have been made to identify the merchant. The most likely candidate seems to be Richard Lee (1617-1664, great-great- grandfather of Confederate General Robert E. Lee), who emigrated to Virginia around 1640. He became a tobacco planter, trader, an owner and trader of slaves, and an employer and importer of English indentured servants. His estate there included land on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, near a place known as Maryland Point (later to be the site of the Maryland Point Light). On returning to England in 1658, Lee bought land in Stratford, and in 1662 was recorded as owning a large house there.) However, retired history professor Ged Martin has questioned the American name-origin theory, finding limited documentary support for the story. Professor Martin put forward an explanation that the name derives from Old English words for a boundary - cognate to the Anglo-Saxon words maere and mearc. With the growth of Stratford in the mid-19th century the vicinity was built up as Stratford New Town and Maryland gained a prosperous shopping thoroughfare. Maryland station opened in 1874.

On 29 June 1881, he was proclaimed the first Mahdi of the three. He led a successful war against Ottoman-Egyptian military rule and achieved a remarkable victory over the British, in the Siege of Khartoum. He then created a vast Islamic state extending from the Red Sea to Central Africa and founded a movement that remained influential in Sudan a century later. From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until 1898,Holt, P.M.: \\"The Mahdist State in Sudan, 1881-1898\\". Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970. p. 45. many of the theological and political doctrines of the Mahdiyya were established and promulgated among the growing ranks of the Mahdi's supporters, the Ansars. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, his chief deputy, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad took over the administration of the nascent Mahdist state. Following Ahmad's death, Abdallahi ruled as Khalifa. However, while the Mahdi had created one of the few nineteenth-century African states to have defeated a foreign colonial power, the Khalifa's autocratic rule, as well as directly applied British military force, destroyed the Mahdi state following the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan in 1899. Despite that, the Muhammad Mahdi remains a respected figure in the Sudan, and a direct descendant of Ahmad, Sadiq al-Mahdi, was twice prime minister of Sudan (1966–1967 and 1986–1989) and pursued democratizing policies. Early life Muhammad Ahmad was born on 12 August 1844 at Labab Island, Dongola in northern Sudan to a humble Nubian family of boat-builders who trace their descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the line of his grandson Hassan.Holt, P.M. The Mahdist State in Sudan, 1881-1898. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970. pp 45 cf. When Muhammad Ahmad was still a child, the family moved to the town of Karari, north of Omdurman, where Muhammad Ahmad's father, Abdullah, could find an adequate supply of timber for his successful boat-building business. While his siblings joined his father's trade, Muhammad Ahmad showed a proclivity for religious study. He studied first under Sheikh al-Amin al-Suwaylih in the Gezira region around Khartoum, and subsequently under Sheikh Muhammad al-Dikayr 'Abdallah Khujali near the town of Berber in North Sudan. Determined to live a life of asceticism, mysticism and worship, in 1861 he sought out Sheikh Muhammad Sharif Nur al-Dai'm, the grandson of the founder of the Samaniyya Sufi sect in Sudan. Muhammad Ahmad stayed with Sheikh Muhammad Sharif for seven years, during which time he was recognized for his piety and asceticism. Near the end of this period, he was awarded the title of Sheikh himself, and began to travel around the country on religious missions. He was permitted to give tariqa and Uhūd to new followers. In 1870, his family moved again in search for timber, this time to Aba Island on the White Nile south of Khartoum. On Aba Island, Muhammad Ahmad built a mosque and started to teach the Qur'an. He soon gained a notable reputation among the local population as an excellent speaker and mystic. The broad thrust of his teaching followed that of other reformers, his Islam was one devoted to the words of Muhammad and based on a return to the virtues of strict devotion, prayer, and simplicity as laid down in the Qur'an. In 1872, Muhammad Ahmad invited Sheikh Sharif to move to al- Aradayb, an area on the White Nile neighboring Aba Island. Despite initially amicable relations, in 1878 the two religious leaders had a dispute motivated by Sheikh Sharif's resentment of his former student's growing popularity. As a result, Sheikh Sharif expelled his former student from the Samaniyya order, and despite numerous attempts at reconciliation by Muhammad Ahmad, his mentor refused to make peace. After recognizing that the split with Sheikh Sharif was irreconcilable, Muhammad Ahmad approached another respected leader of the Samaniyya order named Sheikh al-Qurashi wad al-Zayn. Muhammad Ahmad resumed his life of piety and religious devotion at Aba Island. During this period, he also traveled to the province of Kordofan, west of Khartoum, where he visited with the notables of the capital, El-Obeid, who were enmeshed in a power struggle between two rival claimants to the governorship of the province. On 25 July 1878, Sheikh al-Qurashi died and his followers recognized Muhammad Ahmad as their new leader. Around this time, Muhammad Ahmad first met Abdallahi bin Muhammad al-Ta'aishi, who was to become his chief deputy and successor in the years to come. Announcement of the Mahdiyya On 29 June 1881, Muhammad Ahmad publicly announced his Mahdiyya so as to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa (Jesus).Holt, 54. In part, his claim was based on his status as a prominent Sufi sheikh with a large following in the Samaniyya order and among the tribes in the area around Aba Island.Warburg, Gabriel. Islam, Sectarianism and Politics in Sudan since the Mahdiyya. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003. pp. 30-42. Yet the idea of the Mahdiyya had been central to the belief of the Samaniyya prior to Muhammad Ahmad's manifestation. The previous Samaniyya leader, Sheikh al- Qurashi Wad al-Zayn, had asserted that the long-awaited-for redeemer would come from the Samaniyya line. According to Sheikh al-Qurashi, the Mahdi would make himself known through a number of signs, some established in the early period of Islam and recorded in the Hadith literature, and others having a more distinctly local origin, such as the prediction that the Mahdi would ride the sheikh's pony and erect a dome over his grave after his death.Ibrahim, Ahmed Uthman. \\"Some Aspects of the Ideology of the Mahdiyya.\\" See also PM Holt, p 50 cf Drawing from aspects of the Sufi tradition that were intimately familiar to both his followers and his opponents, Muhammad Ahmad claimed that he had been appointed as the Mahdi by a prophetic assembly or hadra (Arabic: Al-Hadra Al-Nabawiyya, الحضرة النبوية). A hadra, in the Sufi tradition, is a gathering of all the prophets from the time of Adam to Muhammad, as well as many Sufi holy men who are believed to have reached the highest level of affinity with the divine during their lifetime. The hadra is chaired by the Prophet Muhammad, known as Sayyid al-Wujud, and at his side are the seven Qutb, the most senior of whom is known as Ghawth az-Zaman. The hadra was also the source of a number of central beliefs about the Mahdi, including that he was created from the sacred light at the centre of the Prophet's heart, and that all living creatures had acknowledged the Mahdi's claim since his birth. Muhammad Ahmad framed the Mahdiyya as a return to the early days of Islam, when the Muslim community, or Ummah, was unified under the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad and his immediate successors. Later, in order to distinguish his followers from adherents of other Sufi sects, he forbade the use of the word darwish (commonly known as \\"dervish\\" in English) to describe his followers, replacing it with the title Ansar, the term the Prophet Muhammad used for the people of Medina who welcomed him and his followers after their flight from Mecca. Response of the 'Ulema Despite his popularity among the clerics of the Samaniyya and other sects, and among the tribes of western Sudan, some of the Ulema, or orthodox religious authorities, rejected Muhammad Ahmad's claim to be the Mahdi. Among his most prominent critics were the Sudanese Ulema loyal to the Ottoman Sultan and employed by the Turco-Egyptian government, such as the Mufti Shakir al-Ghazi, who sat on the Council of Appeal in Khartoum, and the Qadi Ahmad al-Azhari in Kordofan. These critics were careful not to deny the concept of the Mahdi as such, but rather to discredit Muhammad Ahmad's claim to it.Islah and Tajdid. They pointed out that Muhammad Ahmad's manifestation did not conform to the prophecies laid out in the Hadith literature. In particular, they argued for the political interests of the Turco-Egyptian government and its British rulers, that his manifestation did not conform with the \\"time of troubles\\" \\"when the land is filled with oppression, tryanny, and enmity\\".Kapteijns, The Religious Background of the Mahdi Advance of the rebellion Extent of the Mahdi rebellion in 1885 (green hatching) Egyptian authorities attempted to arrest him for inciting the Sudanese people to achieve their independence and overthrow their oppressors. A military expedition was sent to reassert the government's authority on Aba Island, but the government's forces were ambushed and nearly annihilated by the Mahdi's followers. The Mahdi and a party of his followers, the Ansār (helpers, known in the West as \\"the Dervishes\\"), made a long march to Kurdufan. There he gained a large number of recruits, especially from the Baqqara, and notable leaders such as Sheikh Madibbo ibn Ali of Rizeigat and Abdallahi ibn Muhammad of Ta'aisha tribes. They were also joined by the Hadendoa Beja, who were rallied to the Mahdi by an Ansār captain in east of Sudan in 1883, Osman Digna. A Sudanese man wearing the typical Mahdist clothing in Omdurman, 1936 The Mahdist revolution was backed by the Northern and western regions of Sudan, and it also found a great support from the Nuer, Shilluk and Anuak tribes from southern Sudan in addition to the tribes of Bahr Alghazal, a thing which affirmed that the Mahdist revolution was a national revolution and not a regional one. In addition to unifying different tribes, the revolution also cut across religious divides, despite its religious origins. The Mahdi was supported by non-Muslims and Muslims alike. This had important implications for the slave trade, because the Mahdi, going against traditional Islamic injunctions, allowed the enslavement of free Muslims who did not support him and forbade the enslavement of the traditionally hunted non-Muslims who did support him. Late in 1883, the Ansār, armed only with spears and swords, overwhelmed a 4,000-man Egyptian force not far from El-Obeid, and seized their rifles and ammunition. The Mahdi followed up this victory by laying siege to El-Obeid and starving it into submission after four months. The town remained the headquarters of the Ansar for much of the decade. The Ansār, now 40,000 strong, then defeated an 8,000-man Egyptian relief force led by British officer William Hicks at Sheikan, in the battle of El Obeid. The defeat of Hicks sealed the fate of Darfur, which until then had been effectively defended by Rudolf Carl von Slatin. Jabal Qadir in the south was also taken. The western half of Sudan was now firmly in Ansārī hands. Their success emboldened the Hadendoa, who under the generalship of Osman Digna wiped out a smaller force of Egyptians under the command of Colonel Valentine Baker near the Red Sea port of Suakin. Major-General Gerald Graham was sent with a force of 4,000 British soldiers and defeated Digna at El Teb on February 29, but were themselves hard-hit two weeks later at Tamai. Graham eventually withdrew his forces. Khartoum After much debate the British decided to abandon the Sudan in December 1883, holding only several northern towns and Red Sea ports, such as Khartoum, Kassala, Sannar, and Sawakin. The evacuation of Egyptian troops and officials and other foreigners from Sudan was assigned to General Gordon, who had been reappointed governor general with orders to return to Khartoum and organize a withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons there. Arrival of Gordon Gordon reached Khartoum in February 1884. At first he was greeted with jubilation as many of the tribes in the immediate area were at odds with the Mahdists. Transportation northward was still open and the telegraph lines intact. However, the uprising of the Beja soon after his arrival changed things considerably, reducing communications to runners. Gordon considered the routes northward to be too dangerous to extricate the garrisons and so pressed for reinforcements to be sent from Cairo to help with the withdrawal. He also suggested that his old enemy Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur, a fine military commander, be given tacit control of the Sudan in order to provide a counter to the Ansār. London rejected both proposals, and so Gordon prepared for a fight. In March 1884, Gordon tried to stage an offensive to clear the road northward to Egypt but a number of the officers in the Egyptian force went over to the enemy and their forces fled the field after firing a single salvo. This convinced him that he could carry out only defensive operations and he returned to Khartoum to construct defensive works. By April 1884, Gordon had managed to evacuate some 2500 of the foreign population that were able to make the trek northwards. His mobile force under Colonel Stewart then returned to the city after repeated incidents where the 200 or so Egyptian forces under his command would turn and run at the slightest provocation. Siege A depiction of the British square at the Battle of Abu Klea, during the Mahdist War, 1885 That month the Ansār reached Khartoum and Gordon was completely cut off. Nevertheless, his defensive works, consisting mainly of mines, proved so frightening to the Ansār that they were unable to penetrate into the city. Stewart maintained a number of small skirmishes using gunboats on the Nile once the waters rose, and in August managed to recapture Berber for a short time. However, Stewart was killed soon after in another foray from Berber to Dongola, a fact Gordon only learned about in a letter from the Mahdi himself. Under increasing pressure from the public to support him, the British Government under Prime Minister Gladstone eventually ordered Lord Garnet Joseph Wolseley to relieve Gordon. He was already deployed in Egypt due to the attempted coup there earlier, and was able to form up a large force of infantry, moving forward at an extremely slow rate. Realizing they would take some time to arrive, Gordon pressed for him to send forward a \\"flying column\\" of camel-borne troops across the Bayyudah Desert from Wadi Halfa under the command of Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Stuart. This force was attacked by the Hadendoa Beja, or \\"Fuzzy Wuzzies\\", twice, first at the Battle of Abu Klea and two days later nearer Metemma. Twice the British square held and the Mahdists were repelled with heavy losses. At Metemma, north of Khartoum, Wolseley's advance guard met four of Gordon's steamers, sent down to provide speedy transport for the first relieving troops. They gave Wolseley a dispatch from Gordon claiming that the city was about to fall. However, only moments later a runner brought in a message claiming the city could hold out for a year. Deciding to believe the latter, the force stopped while they refit the steamers to hold more troops. Fall of Khartoum They finally arrived in Khartoum on 28 January 1885 to find the town had fallen during the Battle of Khartoum two days earlier. When the Nile had receded from flood stage, one of Gordon's pashas (officers), Faraz Pasha, had opened the river gates and let the Ansār in. The garrison was slaughtered, the male population massacred, the women and children enslaved, and Gordon was killed fighting the Mahdi's warriors on the steps of the palace, hacked to pieces and beheaded. When Gordon's head was unwrapped at the Mahdi's feet, he ordered the head transfixed between the branches of a tree \\"where all who passed it could look in disdain, children could throw stones at it and the hawks of the desert could sweep and circle above.\\" When Wolseley's force arrived, they retreated after attempting to force their way to the center of the town on ships, being met with a hail of fire. The Mahdi Army continued its sweep of victories. Kassala and Sannar fell soon after and by the end of 1885 the Ansār had begun to move into the southern regions of Sudan. In all Sudan, only Suakin, reinforced by Indian troops, and Wadi Halfa on the northern frontier remained in Anglo-Egyptian hands. Death and succession The rebuilt tomb of Muhammad Ahmad in Omdurman Six months after the capture of Khartoum, Muhammad Ahmad died of typhus. He was buried in Omdurman near the ruins of Khartoum. The Mahdi had planned for this eventuality and chose three deputies to replace him. After the final defeat of the Khalifa by the British under General Kitchener in 1898, Muhammad Ahmad's tomb was destroyed to prevent it from becoming a rallying point for his supporters, and his bones were thrown into the Nile. General Kitchener was said to have retained his skull.Undoing the Mahdiyya: British Colonialism as Religious Reform in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1914 by Noah Salomon (University of Chicago Divinity School) Allegedly the skull was later buried at Wadi Halfa. The tomb was eventually rebuilt. Aftermath Political heritage 23px The flag of Sudan. The black represents Sudan; in Arabic 'Sudan' means black. It also represents the black flag of nationalists who fought colonial rule during the Mahdist Revolution, late in 19th century. Muhammed Ahmad's posthumous son, Abd al-Rahman al- Mahdi, whom the British considered important as a popular leader of the Mahdists, became a leader of the neo-Mahdist movement in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Sudanese considered Abd al-Rahman to be the King of Sudan when the country gained independence, but he declined the title for spiritual reasons. 'Abd al-Rahman sponsored the Umma (Nation) political Party in the period before and just after Sudan became independent in 1956. In modern-day Sudan, Muhammad Ahmad is sometimes seen as a precursor of Sudanese nationalism. The Umma party claim to be his political descendants.Ummah party official website Their leader Imam Sadiq al-Mahdi, is the great-great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmad, and also the imam of the Ansar, the religious order that pledges allegiance to Muhammad Ahmad.

Although the title had the literal meaning of head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara was constitutionally only a de jure chief executive, acting as a vice-regal representative in lieu of the typical Governor- General.The head of state in Singapore: An historical perspective in Managing Political Change in Singapore: The Elected Presidency', Kevin Tan, Peng Er Lam, Routledge, 1997, page 9 Under a transitional arrangement, the last Governor of Singapore, Sir William Goode, served as the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara from June 3, 1959, to December 3, 1959.The Istana, K. K. Seet, Peter Mealin, Times Editions, 2000, page 88 He was succeeded by Yusof bin Ishak, who was sworn into office on the same day as the country's national flag, coat of arms, and national anthem were adopted. The title was retained when Singapore became the fourteenth state of Malaysia in 1963. The office holder then acted as the vice-regal representative of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. On August 9, 1965, Singapore was separated from the federation to become an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations. On December 22 of that year, the Constitution was amended to make the country a republic, and change the title to President with retroactive effect from the date of independence.Republic of Singapore Independence Act (Original Enactment: Act 9 of 1965) * Sir William Goode - June 3, 1959 to December 3, 1959 (previously Governor of Singapore from 1957) * Yusof bin Ishak - December 3, 1959 to August 9, 1965 (then President of Singapore to 1970) Brunei In Brunei, the Sultan of Brunei is also known as the Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam.

When using this method, each year is assigned a letter (or pair of letters for leap years) depending on which day of the week the year starts on. Dominical letters are derived from the Roman practice of marking the repeating sequence of eight letters A–H (commencing with A on 1 January) on stone calendars to indicate each day's position in the eight-day market week (nundinae). The word is derived from the number nine due to their practice of inclusive counting. After the introduction of Christianity a similar sequence of seven letters A–G was added alongside, again commencing with 1 January. The dominical letter marks the Sundays. Nowadays they are used primarily as part of the computus, which is the method of calculating the date of Easter. A common year is assigned a single dominical letter, indicating which lettered days are Sundays in that particular year (hence the name, from Latin dominica for Sunday). Thus, 2017 is A, indicating that all A days are Sunday, and by inference, 1 January 2017 is a Sunday. Leap years are given two letters, the first valid for January 1 – February 28 (or February 24, see below), the second for the remainder of the year. In leap years, the leap day may or may not have a letter. In the Catholic version it does, but in the 1662 and subsequent Anglican versions it does not. The Catholic version causes February to have 29 days by doubling the sixth day before 1 March, inclusive, because 24 February in a common year is marked \\"duplex\\", thus both halves of the doubled day have a dominical letter of F.Peter Archer, The Christian Calendar and the Gregorian Reform (New York: Fordham University Press, 1941) p. 5.Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, The Oxford Companion to the Year (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 829.Calendarium (Calendar attached to the papal bull \\"Inter gravissimas\\"). This is coincidental: until 1970 24 February (25 February in leap years) was the feast day of St Matthias, a \\"Double of Second Class\\", hence duplex. The Anglican version adds a day to February that did not exist in common years, 29 February, thus it does not have a dominical letter of its own.\\"Anno vicesimo quarto Georgii II. c. 23\\" (1751), The Statutes at Large, from Magna Charta to the end of the Eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, Anno 1761, ed. Danby Pickering, p. 194.J. K. Fotheringham, \\"Explanation: The Calendar\\", The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1931, pp. 735-747, p. 745, ... 1938, pp. 790–806, p. 803. After the 1662 reform there was correspondence between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the printer of the Book of Common Prayer, in which it was explained that the feast day of St Matthias now fell on 24 February every year. In either case, all other dates have the same dominical letter every year, but the days of the dominical letters change within a leap year before and after the intercalary day, 24 February or 29 February.  History and arrangement  Per Thurston (1909), dominical letters are: Another one is \\"Add G, beg C, fad F,\\" and yet another is \\"At Dover dwell George Brown, Esquire; Good Christopher Finch; and David Fryer.\\"  Dominical letter cycle  {  - !Months -  Jan Oct  A -  May  B -  Aug  C -  Feb Mar Nov  D -  Jun  E -  Sept Dec  F -  Apr July  G } *If the letter () of the first day of a month is the dominical letter of the year, the month will have a Friday the 13th. That is to say, if the first day is Sunday, the 13th day will be Friday. Thurston continues: Of course, \\"24 February\\" is not \\"counted twice\\". The 23rd is ante diem vii kalendas Martias, the next day in a leap year is a.d. bis sextum kal. Mart., the next day is the regular a.d.vi kal. Mart., and so to the end of the month. For example, in 2020 (=ED), all days preceding the leap day will correspond to a common-year E calendar, and all days afterward will correspond to a common-year D calendar. The relevant line of the Februarius page in the Kalendarium of a 1913 Breviarium Romanum reads: > :5 fvj24S. MATHIAE APOSTOLI, dupl. 2. class. The first column is the epact, a replacement for the golden number, from which the age of the moon was computed and announced in some English cathedrals prior to the Reformation. The second column is the letter, the third the Roman date and the fourth the modern date. A note at the foot of the page reads: > In anno bissextili mensis Februarius est dierum 29\\\\. et Festum S. Mathiae > celebratur die 25\\\\. Februarii et bis dicitur sexto Kalendas, id est die 24\\\\. > et die 25\\\\. et littera Dominicalis, quae assumpta fuit in mense Januario, > mutatur in praecedentem; ut si in Januario littera Dominicalis fuerit A, > mutatur in praecedentem, quae est g. etc.; et littera f bis servit, 24\\\\. et > 25\\\\. (In a bissextile year the month February is of 29 days and the Feast of > St Matthias is celebrated on 25 February, and twice is said on the sixth > Kalends, that is on the 24th and 25th, and the Sunday letter, which was > assumed in the month of January, is changed to the preceding; so if in > January the Sunday letter may have been A, it is changed to the preceding, > which is g. etc.; and letter f twice serves, 24th and 25th.) Dominical letters of the years The dominical letter of a year provides the link between the date and the day of the week on which it falls. The following are the correspondences between dominical letters and the day of the week on which their corresponding years is beginning and ending: { -  * A: common year starting on Sunday (or ending on Sunday) * B: common year starting on Saturday (or ending on Saturday) * C: common year starting on Friday (or ending on Friday) * D: common year starting on Thursday (or ending on Thursday) * E: common year starting on Wednesday (or ending on Wednesday) * F: common year starting on Tuesday (or ending on Tuesday) * G: common year starting on Monday (or ending on Monday)  * AG: leap year starting on Sunday (or ending on Monday) * BA: leap year starting on Saturday (or ending on Sunday) * CB: leap year starting on Friday (or ending on Saturday) * DC: leap year starting on Thursday (or ending on Friday) * ED: leap year starting on Wednesday (or ending on Thursday) * FE: leap year starting on Tuesday (or ending on Wednesday) * GF: leap year starting on Monday (or ending on Tuesday) } The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (i. e., every four centuries). Of the 400 years in one Gregorian cycle, there are: * 44 common years for each single Dominical letter D and F; * 43 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, E, and G; * 15 leap years for each double Dominical letter AG and CB; * 14 leap years for each double Dominical letter ED and FE; * 13 leap years for each double Dominical letter BA, DC, and GF. The Julian calendar repeats every 28 years. Of the 28 years in one Julian cycle, there are: * 3 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, D, E, F, and G; * 1 leap year for each double Dominical letter BA, CB, DC, ED, FE, GF, and AG. Calculation The dominical letter of a year can be calculated based on any method for calculating the day of the week, with letters in reverse order compared to numbers indicating the day of the week. The solar cycle and dominical letter on the Jubilee clock of the Zimmer tower For example: *ignore periods of 400 years *considering the second letter in the case of a leap year: **for one century within two multiples of 400, go forward two letters from BA for 2000, hence C, E, G. **for remaining years, go back one letter every year, two for leap years (this corresponds to writing two letters, no letter is skipped). **to avoid up to 99 steps within a century, the table below can be used. {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! Year mod 28  -  00 06 12 17 23 0 -  01 07 12 18 24 6 -  02 08 13 19 24 5 -  03 08 14 20 25 4 -  04 09 15 20 26 3 -  04 10 16 21 27 2 -  05 11 16 22 00 1 } Red for the first two months of leap years. For example, to find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913: *1900 is G and 13 corresponds to 5 *G + 5 = G − 2 = E, 1913 is E Similarly, for 2007: *2000 is BA and 7 corresponds to 6 *A + 6 = A − 1 = G, 2007 is G For 2065: *2000 is BA and 65 mod 28 = 9 corresponds to 3 *A + 3 = A − 4 = D, 2065 is D The odd plus 11 method A simpler method suitable for finding the year's dominical letter was discovered in 2010. It is called the \\"odd plus 11\\" method.Chamberlain Fong, Michael K. Walters: \\"Methods for Accelerating Conway's Doomsday Algorithm (part 2)\\", 7th International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2011). The procedure accumulates a running total T as follows: # Let T be the year's last two digits. #If T is odd, add 11. #Let T = . #If T is odd, add 11. #Let T = T mod 7. #Count forward T letters from the century's dominical letter (A, C, E or G see above) to get the year's dominical letter. The formula is : \\\\left( \\\\frac{y+11(y \\\\bmod 2)}{2} + 11 \\\\left(\\\\frac{y+11(y \\\\bmod 2)}{2}\\\\bmod 2\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\bmod 7. De Morgan's rule This rule was stated by Augustus de Morgan: #Add 1 to the given year. #Take the quotient found by dividing the given year by 4 (neglecting the remainder). #Take 16 from the centurial figures of the given year if that can be done. #Take the quotient of III divided by 4 (neglecting the remainder). #From the sum of I, II and IV, subtract III. #Find the remainder of V divided by 7: this is the number of the Dominical Letter, supposing A, B, C, D, E, F, G to be equivalent respectively to 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. So the formulae (using the floor function) for the Gregorian calendar is :1\\\\. \\\\left(1 + \\\\text{year} + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year}}{4}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year} - 1600}{400}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor - \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year} - 1600}{100}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor\\\\right) \\\\bmod 7. It is equivalent to :2\\\\. \\\\left(\\\\text{year} + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year}}{4}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year}}{400}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor - \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year}}{100}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor - 1\\\\right) \\\\bmod 7 and :3\\\\. \\\\left(y + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{y}{4}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor + 5(c\\\\bmod4) -1\\\\right) \\\\bmod 7 (where \\\\text{y} = last two digits of the year, \\\\text{c} = century part of the year). For example, to find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913: *(1 + 1913 + 478 + 0 − 3) mod 7 = 2 *(1913 + 478 + 4 − 19 − 1) mod 7 = 2 *(13 + 3 + 15 -1) mod 7 = 2 Therefore, the Dominical Letter is E. De Morgan's rules no. 1 and 2 for the Julian calendar: :1. and 2\\\\. \\\\left(\\\\text{year} + \\\\Big\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\text{year}}{4}\\\\Big\\\\rfloor - 3\\\\right) \\\\bmod 7 To find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913 in the Julian calendar: *(1913 + 478 − 3) mod 7 = 1 Therefore, the Dominical Letter is F in the Julian calendar. In leap years the formulae above give the Dominical Letter for the last ten months of the year. To find the Dominical Letter for the first two months of the year to the leap day (inclusive) subtract 1 from the calculated number representing the original Dominical Letter; if the new number is less than 0, it must be changed to 6. Dominical letter in relation to the Doomsday Rule The \\"doomsday\\" concept in the doomsday algorithm is mathematically related to the Dominical letter. Because the letter of a date equals the dominical letter of a year (DL) plus the day of the week (DW), and the letter for the doomsday is C except for the portion of leap years before February 29 in which it is D, we have: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{C} &= (\\\\text{DL} + \\\\text{DW}) \\\\bmod 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{DL} &= (\\\\text{C} - \\\\text{DW}) \\\\bmod 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{DW} &= (\\\\text{C} - \\\\text{DL}) \\\\bmod 7 \\\\end{align} Note: G = 0 = Sunday, A = 1 = Monday, B = 2 = Tuesday, C = 3 = Wednesday, D = 4 = Thursday, E = 5 = Friday, and F = 6 = Saturday, i.e. in our context, C is mathematically identical to 3. Hence, for instance, the doomsday of the year 2013 is Thursday, so DL = (3 − 4) mod 7 = 6 = F. The dominical letter of the year 1913 is E, so DW = (3 − 5) mod 7 = 5 = Friday. {  ! rowspan=2 valign=\\"bottom\\"  Doomsday !! colspan=2  Dominical letter - !Common year!!Leap year -  Sunday  C  DC -  Monday  B  CB -  Tuesday  A  BA -  Wednesday  G  AG -  Thursday  F  GF -  Friday  E  FE -  Saturday  D  ED } All in one table If the year of interest is not within the table, use a tabular year which gives the same remainder when divided by 400 (Gregorian calendar) or 700 (Julian calendar). In the case of the Revised Julian calendar, find the date of Easter Sunday (see the section \\"Calculating Easter Sunday\\", subsection \\"Revised Julian calendar\\" below) and enter it into the \\"Table for days of the year\\" below. If the year is a leap year, the dominical letter for January and February is found by inputting the date of Easter Monday. Note the different rules for leap years: *Gregorian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4, but of century years only those which divide exactly by 400; therefore ignore the left-hand letter given for a century year which is not a leap year. *Julian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4. *Revised Julian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4, but of century years only those which give the remainder 200 or 600 when divided by 900. {border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:0;background:inherit;color:#222;border:none;padding:0;line- height:normal\\" -valign=\\"top\\"  { style=\\"margin:.8em 0;background:#FFF;color:#222;text-align:center\\" - !

Some examples  * 1582: Many Catholic countries switched to the Gregorian calendar Friday 15 October. The table above indicates that year 1582 had the dominical letter G in the Julian calendar and C in the Gregorian one. So the dominical letters for 1582 in these Catholic countries became GC for mixing the two calendars used in this legal year, a special combination not seen before and after with a single calendar used in the same legal year. * 1752: Great Britain and her colonies switched to the Gregorian calendar Thursday 14 September. The leap year 1752 had in the Julian calendar dominical letters ED and in the Gregorian one dominical letters BA. So year 1752 had in Great Britain and her colonies the dominical letters EDA, a very special combination which also only applies to this legal year.  Calculating Easter Sunday  Enter the \\"all in one table\\" to find the date of the paschal full moon, then use the \\"week table\\" below to find the day of the week on which it falls. Easter is the following Sunday.  Week table: Julian and Gregorian calendars for AD years since AD 42  Note that this table does not work for AD years at the early stage of the real Julian calendar before year AD 42 or for any BC year, except when using the Julian calendar rules for proleptic dates (which are different from effective historic dates, whose effective calendar in use depend on the location of dated events, sometimes differently between political/civil or religious purposes in places where both calendars can still coexist). The duration of months, and the number and placement of intercalated days in February also changed inconsistently before AD 42 in the early Julian calendars, depending on places and years, causing finally lot of confusion in the population (so dating events precisely in that period is often difficult, unless they are correlated with observed lunar cycles, or with days of the week, or with another calendar). In these early AD years and in all BC years, with the effective Julian calendars used locally to align the counting of years (but still with the tradition inherited from the earlier Roman calendar for noting days in each year), a variable number of days at end of the months (after the last day of its ides but before the last day of calends which started the next month) were also still counted relatively from the start of the next named month (on the last day of its calends), and years were theoretically starting on 1 March (but with the last days of the year in February also counted from the New Year's Day in March). As well, all these early years were effectively counted inclusively and positively from a different, much earlier epoch in other eras, such as the supposed foundation of Rome, or the accession to power of a local ruler (and still not relatively to the supposed date of birth of Christ, which was fixed later arbitrarily by a Christian reform for the modern Julian calendar so that this epoch for the Christian era starts now on 1 January in proleptic year AD 1 of the modern Julian calendar, but the real date of birth of Christ is still not known precisely but certainly falls before, somewhere in the last few BC years). Instructions For Julian dates before 1300 and after 1999 the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 700 years should be used. For Gregorian dates after 2299, the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 400 years should be used. The values \\"r0\\" through \\"r6\\" indicate the remainder when the Hundreds value is divided by 7 and 4 respectively, indicating how the series extend in either direction. Both Julian and Gregorian values are shown 1500–1999 for convenience. The corresponding numbers in the far left hand column on the same line as each component of the date (the hundreds, remaining digits and month) and the day of the month are added together. This total is then divided by 7 and the remainder from this division located in the far left hand column. The day of the week is beside it. Bold figures (e.g., 04) denote leap year. If a year ends in 00 and its hundreds are in bold it is a leap year. Thus 19 indicates that 1900 is not a Gregorian leap year, (but bold 19 in the Julian column indicates that it is a Julian leap year, as are all Julian x00 years). 20 indicates that 2000 is a leap year. Use bold Jan and Feb only in leap years. { class= !colspan=2 style=\\"line-height:10px; border-bottom:none\\"Century digitscolspan=18 rowspan=2Remaining year digitscolspan=5 rowspan=2Monthcolspan=1 rowspan=2Day of weekcolspan=1 rowspan=2Number - ! style=\\"border-top:none; line- height:10px\\"Julian (r ÷ 7) ! style=\\"border-top:none; line-height:10px\\"Gregorian (r ÷ 4) - r5 1916 20 r0 (00)  06  —  17  23  28  34  —  45  51  56  62  —  73  79  84  90  — Jan    OctSat0 - r4 1815 19 r3 01  07  12  18  —  29  35  40  46  —  57  63  68  74  —  85  91  96    May  Sun1 - r3 17 02  —  13  19  24  30 —  41  47  52  58  —  69  75  80  86  —  97  Feb   Aug Mon2 - r2 1618 22 r2 03  08  14  —  25  31  36  42  —  53  59  64  70  —  81  87  92  98  Feb Mar   NovTue3 - r1 15 —  09  15  20  26  —  37  43  48  54  —  65  71  76  82  —  93  99    Jun  Wed4 - r0 1417 21 r1 04  10  —  21  27  32  38  —  49  55  60  66  —  77  83  88  94  —    Sep DecThu5 - r6 13 05  11  16  22  —  33  39  44  50  —  61  67  72  78  —  89  95  —  Jan Apr Jul  Fri6 } For determination of the day of the week (1 January 2000, Saturday) *the day of the month: 1 *the month: 6 *the year: 0 *the century mod 4 for the Gregorian calendar and mod 7 for the Julian calendar 0 *adding .

If it is Sunday, the Sunday Letter is A, if Saturday B, and similarly backwards through the week and forwards through the alphabet to Monday, which is G. Leap years have two letters, so for January and February calculate the day of the week for 1 January and for March to December calculate the day of the week for 1 October. Leap years are all years that divide exactly by four, with the following exceptions: Gregorian calendar – all years divisible by 100, except those that divide exactly by 400. Revised Julian calendar – all years divisible by 100, except those with a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. Clerical utility The dominical letter had another practical utility in the period prior to the annual printing of the Ordo divini officii recitandi, in which period, therefore, Christian clergy were often required to determine the Ordo independently. Easter Sunday may be as early as 22 March or as late as 25 April, and consequently there are 35 possible days on which it may occur; each dominical letter includes 5 potential dates of these 35, and thus there are 5 possible ecclesiastical calendars for each letter. The Pye or Directorium which preceded the present Ordo took advantage of this principle by delineating all 35 possible calendars and denoting them by the formula \\"primum A\\", \\"secundum A\\", \\"tertium A\\", et cetera. Hence, based on the dominical letter of the year and the epact, the Pye identified the correct calendar to use. A similar table, adapted to the reformed calendar and in more convenient form, is included in the beginning of every breviary and missal under the heading \\"Tabula Paschalis nova reformata\\". Saint Bede does not seem to have been familiar with dominical letters, given his \\"De temporum ratione\\"; in its place he adopted a similar device of Greek origin consisting of seven numbers, which he denominated \\"concurrentes\\" (De Temp. Rat., Chapter LIII). The \\"concurrents\\" are numbers that denote the days of the week on which 24 March occurs in the successive years of the solar cycle, 1 denoting Sunday, 2 (feria secunda) for Monday, 3 for Tuesday, et cetera; these correspond to dominical letters F, E, D, C, B, A, and G, respectively. Use for computer calculation Computers are able to calculate the Dominical letter for the first day of a given month in this way (function in C), where: * \`m\` = month * \`y\` = year * \`s\` = \\"style\\"; 0 for Julian, otherwise Gregorian. char dominical(int m, int y, int s) { int leap = y % 4  0 && (s  0  y % 100 != 0  y % 400  0), a = (y % 100) % 28, b = (s  0) * ( (y%700)/100 + a/4 * 2 + 4 + ((a%4+1)*!leap + (m+9)/12*leap) * 6 ) % 7 \\\\+ (s != 0) * ( ((y%400)/100 + a/4 + 1) * 2 + ((a%4+1)*!leap + (m+9)/12*leap) * 6 ) % 7; b += (b  0) * 7; return (char)(b + 64); } Years are also given a dominical letter or pair of dominical letters according to the first day in January and last day in December: when they are equal, only the first letter is given. The dominical letter of the last day of December just precedes in the ordered cycle (G,F,E,D,C,B,A), the dominical letter of the first day in January for the next year.

Dolbeare - 1998 - Page 523 most famous for her theory (and book of the same title) on The Death of Nature, whereby she identifies the Enlightenment as the period when science began to atomize, objectify and dissect nature, foretelling its eventual conception as inert. Her works were important in the development of environmental history and the history of science.Carolyn Merchant BerkeleyA conversation with Carolyn Merchant (2002) RUSSELL SCHOCH / California Monthly* v.112, n.6, Jun02 She is Professor of Environmental History, Philosophy, and Ethics at UC Berkeley.  Education and career  In 1954, as a high school senior, Merchant was a Top Ten Finalist for the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. She received her A.B. in Chemistry from Vassar College in 1958. She then went to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. in the History of Science. There, she was one of the first to be awarded the E. B. Fred Fellowship, to demonstrate that women could make significant contributions to professional fields. In 1963, Merchant, along with 13 other women out of a pool of 114 applicants, was awarded a three-year grant to fund field non-specific graduate research. She was a lecturer in the History of Science, Department of Physics and Natural Sciences Interdisciplinary Program at the University of San Francisco from 1969 to 1977. She was a visiting professor at Oregon State University in the History of Science Department and General Science Department in 1969. Merchant has been a member of the History of Science Society since 1962. From 1971–1972 she was co-president of the West Coast History of Science Society. She was chair of the Committee on Women of Science from 1973–1974 and co-chair from 1992–1994. She has been a member of the American Society for Environmental History since 1980 and has held positions such as vice-president and president in addition to serving as associate Editor of the Environmental Review and as a member of the Rachel Carson Prize Committee for best dissertation. In 1984 she was a Fulbright Senior Scholar at the University of Umeå in Umeå, Sweden, where she taught in the Department of History of Ideas. Since 1986, Merchant has been a professor of environmental history, philosophy, and ethics at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Death of Nature  The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology and the Scientific Revolution (1980) is Merchant's most well-received book. In this book, she emphasizes the importance of gender in the historiography of modern science. Additionally, she focuses her book on \\"the sexist assumptions that informed sixteenth- and seventeenth-century conceptions of the universe and human physiology.\\" Merchant expresses the importance of gender in early modern writing on nature too, and its use of environmental, social, and literary history to have a context for the history of science.  Philosophy  Merchant argues that prior to the Enlightenment, nature was conceived of as the benevolent mother of all things, albeit sometimes wild. This metaphor was gradually replaced by the \\"dominion\\" model as the scientific revolution rationalized and dissected nature to show all her secrets. As nature revealed her secrets, so too she was able to be controlled. Both this intention and the metaphor of \\"nature unveiled\\" is still prevalent in scientific language. Conceptions of the Earth as nurturing bringer of life began slowly to change to one of a resource to be exploited as science became more confident that human minds could know all there was about the natural world and thereby effect changes on it at will. > The female earth was central to organic cosmology that was undermined by the > Scientific Revolution and the rise of a market-oriented culture ... for > sixteenth-century Europeans the root metaphor binding together the self, > society and the cosmos was that of an organism ... organismic theory > emphasized interdependence among the parts of the human body, subordination > of individual to communal purposes in family, community, and state, and > vital life permeate the cosmos to the lowliest stone. Merchant cites Francis Bacon's use of female metaphors to describe the exploitation of nature at this time: \\"she is either free, ... or driven out of her ordinary course by the perverseness, insolence and forwardness of matter and violence of impediments ... or she is put in constraint, molded and made as it were new by art and the hand of man; as in things artificial ... nature takes orders from man and works under his authority\\". Nature must be \\"bound into service\\" and made a slave to the human ends of regaining our dominion over nature lost in the \\"fall from grace\\" in Eden. In combination with increasing industrialization and the rise of capitalism that simultaneously replaced women's work like weaving with machinery, and subsumed their roles as subsistence agriculturists also drove people to live in cities, further removing them from nature and the effects of industrialised production on it. The combined effects of industrialization, scientific exploration of nature and the ascendancy of the dominion/domination metaphor over the one of the nurturing Mother Earth, according to Merchant, can still be felt in social and political thought, as much as it was evident in the art, philosophy and science of the 16th century.  Legacy  Merchant’s The Death of Nature leaves a scholarly legacy in the fields of environmental history, philosophy, and feminism. The book is considered groundbreaking due to her connection between the feminization of nature and the naturalization of women. Along with this connection, she backs up her claim with historical evidence during the time of enlightenment. However, Merchant was not the first to present ecofeminist ideals and theories. Françoise d'Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminisme to portray the influence of women and their ability to generate an ecological revolution in her book Le Feminisme ou la Morte. Susan Griffin's book Women and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her, which also talks about women and ecology, was written in 1978, just before the Death of Nature. The Death of Nature is influential despite these earlier works because it is the first interpretation of an ecofeminist perspective on the history of ecology.

It is situated on the river Hornád at the eastern reaches of the Slovak Ore Mountains, near the border with Hungary. With a population of approximately 240,000, Košice is the second-largest city in Slovakia, after the capital Bratislava. Being the economic and cultural centre of eastern Slovakia, Košice is the seat of the Košice Region and Košice Self-governing Region, the Slovak Constitutional Court, three universities, various dioceses, and many museums, galleries, and theatres. In 2013 Košice was the European Capital of Culture, together with Marseille, France. Košice is an important industrial centre of Slovakia, and the U.S. Steel Košice steel mill is the largest employer in the city. The town has extensive railway connections and an international airport. The city has a well-preserved historical centre, which is the largest among Slovak towns. There are many heritage protected buildings in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau styles with Slovakia's largest church: the St. Elisabeth Cathedral. The long main street, rimmed with aristocratic palaces, Catholic churches, and townsfolk's houses, is a thriving pedestrian zone with many boutiques, cafés, and restaurants. The city is well known as the first settlement in Europe to be granted its own coat-of-arms.Lucinda Mallows: Slovakia: The Bradt Travel Guide, Globe Pequot Press, Connecticut, 2007 Etymology The first written mention of the city was in 1230 as \\"Villa Cassa\\". The name probably comes from the Slavic personal name Koš, Koša → Košici (Koš'people) → Košice (13821383) with the patronymic Slavic suffix \\"-ice\\" through a natural development in Slovak language (similar placenames are also known from other Slavic countries). In Hungarian Koša → Kasa, Kassa with a vowel mutation typical for the borrowing of old Slavic names in the region (Vojkovce → Vajkócz, Sokoľ → Szakalya, Szakál, Hodkovce → Hatkóc, etc.). The Latinized form Cassovia became common in the 15th century. Another theory is a derivation from Old Slovak kosa, \\"clearing\\", related to modern Slovak kosiť, \\"to reap\\". Though according to other sources the city name may derive from an old Hungarian the first name which begins with \\"Ko\\".Magyar Nyelvtudományi Társaság (Society of Hungarian Linguistics), Magyar nyelv, Volume 18, Akadémiai Kiadó, 1922, p. 142, Cited: \\"Kokos (Kakas), Kolumbán (Kálmán), Kopov (Kopó), Kokot (Kakat hn.) stb.

The first written reference to the Hungarian town of Kassa (as the royal village – Villa Cassa) comes from 1230. After the Mongol invasion in 1241, King Béla IV of Hungary invited German colonists to fill the gaps in population. The city was in the historic Abauj County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The city was made of two independent settlements: Lower Kassa and Upper Kassa, amalgamated in the 13th century around the long lens-formed ring, of today's Main Street. The first known town privileges come from 1290. The city proliferated because of its strategic location on an international trade route from agriculturally rich central Hungary to central Poland, itself along a greater route connecting the Balkans and the Adriatic and Aegean seas to the Baltic Sea. The privileges given by the king were helpful in developing crafts, business, increasing importance (seat of the royal chamber for Upper Hungary), and for building its strong fortifications. In 1307, the first guild regulations were registered here and were the oldest in the Kingdom of Hungary. As a Hungarian free royal town, Kassa reinforced the king's troops in the crucial moment of the bloody Battle of Rozgony in 1312 against the strong aristocratic Palatine Amadé Aba (family). In 1347, it became the second-place city in the hierarchy of the Hungarian free royal towns with the same rights as the capital Buda. In 1369, it received its own coat of arms from Louis I of Hungary. The Diet convened by Louis I in Kassa decided that women could inherit the Hungarian throne. \\"Cassovia: Superioris Hungariae Civitas Primaria\\",Matica slovenská, Kniha, Matica slovenská, 2008, p. 16 the prospect from Civitates orbis terrarum. Cassovia (Slovak: Košice, German: Kaschau, Hungarian: Kassa), the \\"capital\\" of Upper Hungary in 1617. The military base in Košice at the end of the 18th century National Theater built in 1899 Main Street – 1902 The significance and wealth of the city at the end of the 14th century was mirrored by the decision to build an entirely new church on the grounds of the previously destroyed smaller St. Elisabeth Church. The construction of the biggest cathedral in the Kingdom of Hungary – St. Elisabeth Cathedral – was supported by Emperor Sigismund, and by the apostolic see itself. Since the beginning of the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the Pentapolitana – the league of towns of five most important cities in Upper Hungary (Bártfa, Locse, Kassa, Eperjes, and Kisszeben). During the reign of King Hunyadi Mátyás the town reached its medieval population peak. With an estimated 10,000 inhabitants, it was among the largest medieval cities in Europe.R.O.Halaga: Právny, územný a populačný vývoj mesta Košíc, Košice 1967, p.54 The history of Kassa was heavily influenced by the dynastic disputes over the Hungarian throne. Together with the decline of the continental trade brought the city into stagnation. Vladislaus III of Varna failed to capture the city in 1441. John Jiskra's mercenaries from Bohemia defeated Tamás Székely's Hungarian army in 1449. John I Albert, Prince of Poland, could not capture the city during a six-month-long siege in 1491. In 1526, the city homaged for Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. John Zápolya captured the town in 1536 but Ferdinand I reconquered the city in 1551. In 1554, the settlement became the seat of the Captaincy of Upper Hungary. In 1604, Catholics seized the Lutheran church in Kassa. The Calvinist Stephen Bocskay then occupied Kassa during his Protestant, Ottoman-backed insurrection against the Habsburg dynasty. The future George I Rákóczi joined him as a military commander there. Giorgio Basta, commander of the Habsburg forces, failed in his attempt to capture the city. At the Treaty of Vienna (1606), in return for giving territory including Kassa back, the rebels won the Habsburg concession of religious toleration for the Magyar nobility and brokered an Austrian-Turkish peace treaty. Stephen Bocskay died in Kassa on December 29, 1606, and was interred there. For some decades during the 17th century Kassa was part of the Principality of Transylvania, and consequently a part of the Ottoman Empire and was referred to as Kaşa in Turkish. On September 5, 1619, the prince of Transylvania, Gabriel Bethlen captured Kassa with the assistance of the future George I Rákóczi in another anti-Habsburg insurrection. By the Peace of Nikolsburg in 1621, the Habsburgs restored the religious toleration agreement of 1606 and recognized Transylvanian rule over the seven Partium countries: Ugocsa, Bereg, Zemplén, Borsod, Szabolcs, Szatmár and Abaúj (including Kassa). Bethlen married Catherine von Hohenzollern, of Johann Sigismund Kurfürst von Brandenburg, in Kassa in 1626. Kassa and the rest of the Partium were returned to the Habsburgs after Bethlen's death, which took place in 1629. On January 18, 1644, the Diet in Kassa elected George I Rákóczi the prince of Hungary. He took the whole of Upper Hungary and joined the Swedish army besieging Brno for a projected march against Vienna. However, his nominal overlord, the Ottoman Sultan, ordered him to end the campaign, but he did so with gains. In the Treaty of Linz (1645), Kassa returned to Transylvania again as the Habsburgs recognized George's rule over the seven counties of the Partium. He died in 1648, and Kassa was returned to the Habsburgs once more. Kassa became a centre of the Counter-Reformation. In 1657, a printing house and university were founded by the Jesuits, funded by Emperor Leopold I. The 1664 Peace of Vasvár at the end of the Austro-Turkish War (1663-1664) awarded Szabolcs and Szatmár counties to the Habsburgs, which put Kassa further inside the border of Royal Hungary again. A modern pentagonal fortress (citadel) was built by the Habsburgs south of the city in the 1670s. The city was besieged by Kuruc armies several times in the 1670s, and it revolted against the Habsburg emperor. The rebel leaders were massacred by the emperor's soldiers on November 26, 1677. Another rebel leader, Imre Thököly captured the city in 1682, making Kaşa once again a vassal territory of Ottoman Empire under Principality of Upper Hungary until 1686. The Austrian field marshal Aeneas de Caprara got Kassa back from Ottoman Turks on late-1685. In 1704–1711 Prince of Transylvania Francis II Rákóczi made Košice the main base in his War for Independence. The fortress was demolished by 1713. When not under Ottoman suzerainty, Kassa was the seat of the Habsburg \\"Captaincy of Upper Hungary\\" and the chair of the Chamber of Szepes County (Spiš, Zips), which was a subsidiary of the supreme financial agency in Vienna responsible for Upper Hungary). Due to Ottoman occupation of Eger, Kassa was the residence of Eger's archbishop from 1596 to 1700. From 1657, it was the seat of the historic Royal University of Kassa (Universitas Cassoviensis), founded by Bishop Benedict Kishdy. The university was transformed into a Royal Academy in 1777, then into a Law Academy in the 19th century. It ceased to exist in the turbulent year of 1921. After the end of the anti-Habsburg uprisings in 1711, the victorious Austrian armies drove the Ottoman forces back to the south, and this major territorial change created new trade routes which circumvented Košice. The city began to decay and turned from a rich medieval town into a provincial town known for its military base and dependent mainly on agriculture. In 1723, the Immaculata statue was erected in the place of a former gallows at Hlavná ulica (Main Street) commemorating the plague from the years 1710–1711. This was one of the centers of the Hungarian language national revival, which published the first Hungarian language periodical called the Magyar Museum in Hungary in 1788. The city's walls were demolished step by step from the early 19th century to 1856; only the Executioner's Bastion remained with few parts of the wall. The city became the seat of its own bishopric in 1802. The city's surroundings became a theater of war again during the Revolutions of 1848, when the Imperial cavalry general Franz Schlik defeated the Hungarian army on December 8, 1848, and January 4, 1849. The city was captured by the Hungarian army on February 15, 1849, but the Russian troops drove them back on June 24, 1849. In 1828, there were three manufacturers and 460 workshops. The first factories were established in the 1840s (sugar and nail factories). The first telegram message arrived in 1856, and the railway connected the city to Miskolc in 1860. In 1873, there were already connections to Eperjes, Zsolna, and Csop (in today's Ukraine). The city gained a public transit system in 1891 when the track was laid down for a horse-drawn tramway. The traction was electrified in 1914. In 1906, Francis II Rákóczi's house of Rodostó was reproduced in Kassa, and his remains were buried in the St. Elisabeth Cathedral. After World War I and during the gradual break-up of Austria- Hungary, the city at first became a part of the transient \\"Eastern Slovak Republic\\", declared on December 11, 1918, in Košice and earlier in Prešov under the protection of Hungary. On December 29, 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions entered the city, making it part of the newly established Czechoslovakia. However, in June 1919, Košice was occupied again, as part of the Slovak Soviet Republic, a proletarian puppet state of Hungary. The Czechoslovak troops secured the city for Czechoslovakia in July 1919, which was later upheld under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920.  Fate of Košice Jews  Jews had lived in Košice since the 16th century but were not allowed to settle permanently. There is a document identifying the local coiner in 1524 as a Jew and claiming that his predecessor was a Jew as well. Jews were allowed to enter the city during the town fair, but were forced to leave it by night, and lived mostly in nearby Rozunfaca. In 1840 the ban was removed, and, a few Jews were living in the town, among them a widow who ran a small Kosher restaurant for the Jewish merchants passing through the town. Košice was ceded to Hungary, by the First Vienna Award, from 1938 until early 1945. The town was bombarded on June 26, 1941, by a still unidentified aircraft, in what became a pretext for the Hungarian government to declare war on the Soviet Union a day later. The German occupation of Hungary led to the deportation of Košice's entire Jewish population of 12,000 and an additional 2,000 from surrounding areas via cattle cars to the concentration camps. In 1946, after the war, Košice was the site of an orthodox Zionist revival, with a Mizrachi convention and a Bnei Akiva Yeshiva (school) for refugees, which, later that year, moved with its students to Israel. A memorial plaque in honor of 12,000 Jews was deported from Košice and, the surrounding areas in Slovakia were unveiled at the pre-war Košice Orthodox synagogue in 1992. Today there are only 8 men who pray at the synagogue regularly, and they are assisted by Jewish students predominantly studying medicine at the city's universities, from Israel.  Soviet occupation  The Soviet Union captured the town in January 1945, and for a short time, it became a temporary capital of the restored Czechoslovak Republic until the Red Army had reached Prague. Among other acts, the Košice Government Programme was declared on April 5, 1945. A large population of ethnic Germans in the area was expelled and sent on foot to Germany or to the Soviet border.Forgotten Voices page 97 After the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc. Several cultural institutions that still exist were founded, and large residential areas around the city were built. The construction and expansion of the East Slovak Ironworks caused the population to grow from 60,700 in 1950 to 235,000 in 1991. Before the breakup of Czechoslovakia (1993), it was the fifth-largest city in the federation.  Under Slovakia  Following the Velvet Divorce and creation of the Slovak Republic, Košice became the second-largest city in the country and became a seat of a constitutional court. Since 1995, it has been the seat of the Archdiocese of Košice. Geography Košice lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in eastern Slovakia, about from the Hungarian, from the Ukrainian, and from the Polish borders. It is about east of Slovakia's capital Bratislava and a chain of villages connects it to Prešov which is about to the north. Košice is on the Hornád River in the Košice Basin, at the easternmost reaches of the Slovak Ore Mountains. More precisely, it is a subdivision of the Čierna hora mountains in the northwest and Volovské vrchy mountains in the southwest. The basin is met on the east by the Slanské vrchy mountains. Climate Košice has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb), as the city lies in the north temperate zone. The city has four distinct seasons. Precipitation varies little throughout the year with abundance precipitation that falls during summer and only few during winter. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of , and the hottest month is July, with an average temperature of . Demographics Hlavná ulica (Main Street) in historic downtown Košice's coat of arms, the first municipal coat of arms in Europe Košice has a population of 240,688 (December 31, 2011). According to the 2011 census, 73.8% of its inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.65% Hungarians, 2% Romani, 0.65% Czechs, 0.68% Rusyns, 0.3% Ukrainians, and 0.13% Germans. 19% of Košice's population did not declare their ethnic affiliation in the 2011 census. The religious makeup was 45% Roman Catholics, 16.6% people with no religious affiliation, 6.12% Greek Catholics, and 2.33% Lutherans, 2% Calvinists and 0.11% Jews.Štatistický úrad Slovenskej republiky Archived copy at the Library of Congress (September 10, 2012). Historical demographics According to the researchers the town had a German majority until the mid-16th century,Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 46-47 and by 1650, 72.5% of the population may have been Hungarians, 13.2% was German, 14.3% was Slovak or of uncertain origin. The Ottoman Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi mentioned that the city was inhabited by \\"Hungarians, Germans, Upper Hungarians\\" in 1661 when the city was under the suzerainty of Ottoman Empire and under Turkish control. The linguistic makeup of the town's population underwent historical changes that alternated between the growth of the ratio of those who claimed Hungarian and those who claimed Slovak as their language. With a population of 28,884 in 1891, just under half (49.9%) of the inhabitants of Košice declared Hungarian, then the official language, as their main means of communication, 33.6% Slovak, and 13.5% German; 72.2% were Roman Catholics, 11.4% Jews, 7.3% Lutherans, 6.7% Greek Catholics, and 4.3% Calvinists. The results of that census are questioned by some historians by a disputed claim that they were manipulated, to increase the percentage of the Magyars during a period of Magyarization. By the 1910 census, which is sometimes accused of being manipulated by the ruling Hungarian bureaucracy, 75.4% of the 44,211 inhabitants claimed Hungarian, 14.8% Slovak, 7.2% German and 1.8% Polish.Atlas and Gazetteer of Historic Hungary 1914, Talma Kiadó The Jews were split among other groups by the 1910 census, as only the most frequently-used language, not ethnicity, was registered. The population around 1910 was multidenominational and multiethnic, and the differences in the level of education mirror the stratification of society.http://mek.oszk.hu/16900/16992 The town's linguistic balance began to shift towards Slovak after World War I by Slovakization in the newly- established Czechoslovakia. According to the 1930 census, the city had 70,111, with 230 Gypsies (today Roma), 42 245 Czechoslovaks (today Czechs and Slovaks), 11 504 Hungarians, 3 354 Germans, 44 Poles, 14 Romanians, 801 Ruthenians, 27 Serbocroatians (today Serbs and Croatians) and 5 733 Jews.Encyklopedie branné moci Republiky Československé. 2006 J. Fidler, V. Sluka As a consequence of the First and Second Vienna Awards, Košice was ceded to Hungary. During the German occupation of Hungary towards the end of World War II, approximately 10,000 Jews were deported by the Arrow Cross Party and the Nazis and killed in Auschwitz. The ethnic makeup of the town was dramatically changed by the persecution of the town's large Hungarian majority, population exchanges between Hungary and Slovakia and Slovakization and by mass migration of Slovaks into newly-built communist-block- microdistricts, which increased the population of Košice four times by 1989 and made it the fastest growing city in Czechoslovakia.KOROTNOKY, Ľudovít (ed.).

European Capital of Culture  In 2008 Košice won the competition among Slovak cities to hold the prestigious title European Capital of Culture 2013. Project Interface aims at the transformation of Košice from a centre of heavy industry to a postindustrial city with creative potential and new cultural infrastructure. Project authors bring Košice a concept of the creative economy – merging of economy and industry with arts, where transformed urban space encourages development of certain fields of creative industry (design, media, architecture, music and film production, IT technologies, creative tourism).

Led by songwriters Andy Sturmer (drums, vocals) and Roger Manning (keyboards, vocals), the group was known for their blend of 1970s classic rock and XTC- style power pop. They released two albums, Bellybutton (1990) and Spilt Milk (1993), that proved highly influential to artists in a similar vein. Sturmer and Manning met in high school and shared an admiration for jazz, post-punk, and British pop music. Following a stint as members of Beatnik Beatch, they quit the group to continue songwriting with one another and formed Jellyfish. They were initially supported by Jason Falkner (guitar) and Roger's brother Chris (bass). After the tour for Bellybutton, those musicians were replaced by Tim Smith (bass) and Eric Dover (guitar). The group viewed Spilt Milk as their \\"masterpiece\\" and the fulfillment of their original grandiose vision for the band, emphasizing bombasticity, vocal harmonies, orchestration, and studio experimentation. Jellyfish broke up in 1994 due to poor record sales, Sturmer's discomfort with his role as frontman, and artistic conflicts between the two songwriters. Manning subsequently formed Imperial Drag, with Dover, and pursued careers as a solo artist and session musician. Sturmer worked with the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi and has kept a low public profile. In 2017, Manning, Dover, and Smith reformed as the Lickerish Quartet. During their five-year existence, Jellyfish attracted critical acclaim and a devoted cult following, but struggled against prevailing rock trends (hair metal and grunge). Their only charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 was \\"Baby's Coming Back\\". Three other songs were top-twenty hits on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart: \\"The King Is Half-Undressed\\", \\"That Is Why\\", and \\"The Ghost at Number One\\". Elsewhere, they had six songs appear on the UK Singles Chart, although none reached higher than the top thirty. A cover version of \\"Baby's Coming Back\\", by the band McFly, later topped UK charts in 2007. Formation While attending high school in Pleasanton, California in the early 1980s, Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning met and bonded over their love for jazz. Later in the decade, they joined Beatnik Beatch, a group fronted by Chris Ketner. Sturmer was the group's drummer, singer, and songwriter, while Manning was keyboardist. The duo soon began collaborating with one another, writing compositions that were stylistically different from the songs the band was producing at the time. As a side gig, the two also briefly wrote commercial jingles for companies such as Montana Hawk Shooting Range and Shutterbug Camera Store. In August 1989, a year after Atlantic Records released Beatnik Beatch's eponymous debut album, Manning and Sturmer left the group to continue songwriting with one another. At this juncture, they were still signed with Atlantic Records, but grew dissatisfied with the label's lack of interest for the new project. Virtually their only advocate at the label was A&R; man John S. Carter, who became their manager after he was soon dismissed from the company. Sturmer was the group's de facto leader and frontman. Although Sturmer and Manning were each credited for 50% of their writing collaborations, typically Sturmer's contributions were musical and lyrical, while Manning's were only musical. Manning commented: \\"Andy was perfectly capable of writing completed, finished great songs on his own. I could write lyrics, but it was a painstaking process.\\" In Sturmer's summation: \\"It's not collaborative on every level. I write all the lyrics, but we write the music together. The way Roger and I write is that we embellish each other's ideas, like painting a picture. We grew up together and had a lot of the same records in our collection, so we don't have to explain our offbeat ideas to each other.\\" Jason Falkner was the lead guitarist for the Three O'Clock, a Los Angeles-based Paisley Underground band. He originally put a newspaper advertisement looking for \\"like-minded musicians\\" influenced by XTC, David Bowie, and the Blue Nile. Manning responded to Falkner's ad and the two met to collaborate. Nothing initially came out of the meeting. However, once Manning and Sturmer left Beatnik Beatch, Manning reconnected with Falkner to see if he was interested in joining the new group. Falkner was persuaded by the prospect of a major-label deal. He joined with the understanding – promised by Manning without consulting Sturmer – that he would be a contributing songwriter. Tensions arose immediately, as Sturmer was not ready to accommodate this arrangement, while Falkner struggled to connect with Sturmer on a personal level. Manning later called Falkner \\"the perfect part of the Jellyfish triangle during that period of our evolution\\". The name \\"Jellyfish\\" came at the suggestion of an Atlantic executive, but was initially ignored by the group. Once they finished recording for their first album and had to pick a name for themselves, Sturmer decided to go with Jellyfish, for lack of any better alternative. According to journalist Paul Rees, the name was chosen to evoke the feeling of something graceful, yet amorphous and ephemeral. Bellybutton Jellyfish recorded their first album Bellybutton at Schnee Studios in Hollywood with producer Albhy Galuten, best known for his work with the Bee Gees on Saturday Night Fever, and engineer Jack Joseph Puig. Unusually, the band's demos were almost as fully realized as the studio recordings. Manning explained that the group took extra care in writing and arranging material due to the stresses of hourly studio costs, as they wanted to use the time to experiment musically, and because \\"Andy and I had to believe 100 per cent, 'Okay, this [song] is working. This is mostly going somewhere. We feel that this is now fleshed out enough that we’re confident to be in the studio environment.'\\" No synthesizers or sequencers were used on the recording. Redd Kross bassist Steve McDonald, who played on the album, said that Manning intended the record to sound \\"somewhere between Queen and Partridge Family\\". Sessions lasted from September 1989 to March 1990 while the band were shopping around their demos to various labels and struggling to extricate themselves from Atlantic. Despite never playing live, they became subject to a bidding war among eight labels. Ultimately, they signed with Charisma Records, a newly-formed subsidiary of Virgin. Bellybutton was released on July 27, 1990 when the prevailing rock music trend was hair metal. Manning remembered that the band were \\"very aware\\" of that fact and believed that \\"in being true to ourselves, we couldn't have been more opposite to what was going on in music.\\" The album peaked at number 124 on the Billboard 200 and was well received by contemporary music critics with singles \\"The King Is Half-Undressed\\" and \\"Baby's Coming Back\\" enjoying moderate radio play. However, album sales numbered at a then-underwhelming 100,000 units sold. Reviews for Bellybutton ranged from favorable to mixed, with most critics focusing on the group's resemblance to older acts. The band were sometimes dismissed as a revivalist nostalgia group, exacerbated by the flamboyant 1970s-era outfits they wore on stage and on promotional materials. They were also often tagged as alternative rock despite being out of step with any other act in the genre. Sturmer said that the group \\"never tried to suck up to any genre of music. We just did what came naturally to us and didn't worry about it.\\" Falkner said that they \\"uniformly loathed the whole lumberjack rock star thing that was starting to happen ... We didn't want to be an everyman band at all.\\" He denied the assumption that the label forced the group into their Willy Wonka-style image: \\"There is no record company on the planet that would make people dress like that. That was all down to us.\\" Later, the band toned down their image as they tired of critics writing about their clothes rather than the music. Jellyfish recruited Roger's younger brother Chris on bass guitar and spent 12 weeks rehearsing for their 50-minute live show. From August 1990 to September 1991, they toured in support of Bellybutton, opening for the bands World Party and the Black Crowes. Their stage show featured an assortment of props, including a white picket fence, a bubble machine, Lite- Brite, and an eight-foot tall standee of Gavin MacLeod. They played the biggest show of their career in front of 72,000 people at Wembley Stadium, as the first of five bands opening for INXS. A considerable cult following began to form around Jellyfish, although the heavy touring schedule fatigued the group substantially. Tensions also worsened among the band members. Frustrated by having his songwriting contributions ignored by Manning and Sturmer, Falkner left the group after the tour. He later said: “I was told that Jellyfish would be an equal three-piece, with us writing and playing everything. That turned out to be a total joke. I felt like I was duped.\\" Chris also quit the band to become a chef. Spilt Milk As Jellyfish gathered prestige among industry insiders, many began soliciting the band for collaboration, including actress/singer Kim Basinger and Tears for Fears' Curt Smith. Following the Bellybutton tour, Sturmer and Manning worked with Ringo Starr for his 1992 solo album Time Takes Time. Five songs were written for Starr, but only one was used (\\"I Don't Believe You\\"). Sturmer and Manning also appeared in the music video for Starr's \\"Weight of the World\\". They were then invited to work with Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Wilson and Jellyfish had one songwriting session, but it was unproductive. One of the two songs they worked on, \\"Wish it Would Rain\\", later appeared on Manning's solo album Solid State Warrior (2005), albeit with Wilson's contributions omitted. The band also contributed the Mario-inspired song \\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\" to the 1991 compilation Nintendo: White Knuckle Scorin'. For the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, Sturmer and Manning backed William Shatner as he sang the Best Song nominees. After their sessions with Starr and Wilson, the band was dedicated to making their next album Spilt Milk \\"their masterpiece\\". Manning and Sturmer spent about eight hours a day, six days a week writing songs together in Los Angeles between October 1991 and March 1992. Galuten and Puig returned as co- producers alongside Manning and Sturmer. Recorded from April to September 1992 on a budget of $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ), the album's music was more aggressive, bombastic, and reliant on vocal harmonies and studio experimentation than Bellybutton. Manning reflected that Spilt Milk represented \\"the total vision we had for Jellyfish. The grandeur that was in our hearts from day one was finally realised with that album.\\" Bassist Tim Smith was recruited for the sessions and upcoming tour. Also featured on the album were guitarists T Bone Burnett, Lyle Workman, and Jon Brion (the latter soon formed the Grays with Falkner). Released on February 9, 1993, Spilt Milk peaked at number 164 in the US. Its poor sales were attributed to being released during the height of the popularity of grunge. Like Bellybutton, critics generally received the album favorably, but focused on its resemblance to artists of the 1970s, particularly the Raspberries. Detractors bemoaned the group for seemingly choosing Supertramp and Queen as influences. In the UK, the album performed better, reaching number 21. Its fans included Queen's Brian May, who praised the album in a contemporary interview. In late 1993, Jellyfish toured as the opening act for Tears for Fears. This tour included guitarist Eric Dover, who Sturmer said was \\"not really a full-fledged member [of the group]\\", with stops in Australia, Europe and Japan (the latter's dates were completely sold out). Jellyfish played their last show on November 20, 1993 at the Broward County Fair in Hollywood, Florida. In 1994, Jellyfish contributed a cover of Harry Nilsson's \\"Think About Your Troubles\\" to the tribute album For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson (1995). Their contribution was a personal request from Nilsson, who was a fan of the group. According to Manning, Nilsson met the band at a concert in Los Angeles, and \\"we all agreed that we should hook up and do some writing soon. Six weeks later he passed away.\\" The cover was the last song Sturmer and Manning recorded together. Breakup During the tour for Spilt Milk, Sturmer and Manning grew increasingly distant as friends. On their return home, the two songwriters independently wrote material for a third album, provisionally titled Nausea Trois. By then, they were drifting apart musically. Manning remembered that, prior, they would bond over albums such as Paul McCartney's Ram or the Zombies' Odessey and Oracle, however, \\"it was clear that none of that was happening anymore.\\" He said that he was \\"rediscovering my love of ... high-energy, fun melodic pop with attitude. And Andy was Leonard Cohen. That was it.\\" When Sturmer presented him a country ballad song, he accordingly \\"left in tears because I had zero interest in recording it.\\" Sturmer felt that Manning had outgrown the partnership, and for his part, was fearful that Manning's new songs would likely inspire journalists to persistently compare the band to Alice Cooper. Another reason the band broke up, in Manning's words, was Sturmer's discomfort with being \\"in the spotlight\\". Sturmer resented his role as leader and frontman, especially when it came to business matters, and his wish for Manning to take more initiative in the band's leadership had become a source of rancor. However, Sturmer rejected the idea of Tim Smith contributing as a third songwriter, as Smith recalled, \\"I think that was enough for Roger, partially, among other things, to shut it all down at that point anyway. ... I felt like I was the one that kind of tried to at least keep the band together in some way, and after that response, it was like, 'Whatever, if it happens it happens, I've done all that I can do here.'\\" Financial pressures also loomed over the band. On April 4, Manning phoned Sturmer and said \\"I think we're done\\", to which Sturmer responded: \\"I've been thinking the same thing.\\" One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the group had disintegrated due to \\"creative differences\\". In a June Denver Post article, Falkner responded to the news: \\"It's ironic. Let's just say that I didn't have a moment of silence when I heard about it.\\" Aftermath 1994–2000s Soon after Jellyfish broke up, Manning formed the Moog Cookbook and Imperial Drag, the latter group with Eric Dover. He has also released a few solo records and worked as a session musician. Some of his songs proposed for the potential third Jellyfish album were reworked for his solo records, but none made it into Imperial Drag. Tim Smith formed Umajets and recorded the album Demolotion with help from Manning and Dover. It was released in late 1995 to little critical notice. Sturmer retreated from the public eye, but continued working as a songwriter for cartoons such as Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, Teen Titans, and Ben 10. In 2004, Falkner unexpectedly reconnected with Sturmer at a Los Angeles studio: \\"He said he'd had a premonition that he was going to see me that day. Then he told me he was sorry for never having given me a chance. I was floored. We exchanged phone numbers, but neither of us has ever used them.\\" Fan Club, a four-CD box set, was released in 2002 by power pop label Not Lame Recordings. The set consists of demos, rarities, interview excerpts, and live performances. By the end of the year, the label had sold out three pressings of the set (8,000 copies). The set went out of print within months due to the expiration of the label's rights to the Jellyfish catalog, making it a collector's item. In 2004 or 2005, Coachella organizers invited Manning to reunite Jellyfish for a one-off performance at the festival. Manning advised the organizers to consult Sturmer first. Sturmer, through his lawyer, responded he would not accept the offer regardless of any amount of money involved. In a 2008 interview, Manning stated: \\"Except for Andy, we all speak to one another. ... nobody is interested in working with Andy in a personal or creative capacity. It would serve no purpose, but I don’t say that with any animosity or sadness.\\" Manning and Falkner reteamed for the albums Logan's Sanctuary (2000) and TV Eyes (2006), but neither were commercially successful. On July 25, 2008, Falkner joined Manning onstage for a performance of \\"That Is Why\\" at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In January 2010, they performed a few shows as the opening act for Cheap Trick, playing solo and Jellyfish songs, and as members of Cheap Trick's supporting band. 2010s–present In 2011, Manning reached out to Sturmer via e-mail. Manning later commented: \\"[I] felt it was long overdue. In doing some personal growth, I felt I had some amends to make with him that were going to be healing for myself and for both of us, ideally. I'm very happy I did that, and I think Andy was happy as well. He didn’t talk much about it afterwards. Just said, 'Thank you very much for this.'\\" In January 2012, Omnivore Recordings reissued Bellybutton and Spilt Milk on limited- edition colored vinyl; the pressings sold out within days. In June, they followed with Live At Bogart's, a complete 1991 performance that originally aired on Westwood One, then the Record Store Day release Stack-a-Tracks, containing the backing tracks of Bellybutton and Spilt Milk. In 2013, Omnivore issued Radio Jellyfish, a collection of 1993 radio performances in which the band played acoustically. In 2015, the label reissued expanded editions of Bellybutton and Spilt Milk that included many of the tracks previously released on Fan Club. In 2016, Not Lame Media published the band's first biography, Brighter Day: A Jellyfish Story, written by Craig Dorfman. Reviewing the book for PopMatters, Eric Rovie wrote that it was a \\"balanced\\" and \\"well-researched\\" work that presents the principal members \\"in conflicting but complementary lights: brilliant, driven, and talented on the one hand, but also selfish, overly-introspective, and obnoxiously perfectionist in others. The music speaks for itself.\\" According to a journalist in 2015, Sturmer refuses interviews about his past or current work. However, Sturmer participated in interviews for Brighter Day. In a 2014 interview, Manning said that he had not talked to Sturmer in two decades, and ruled out the idea that he would ever write songs with him again. In 2015, he said that they did communicate, but only regarding business matters. Asked about the prospect of a reunion, he said he was uncertain of the possibility and explained: \\"In general, I think it is lack of enough interest on Andy’s part. I know many people that work with him in film and TV always tell me how happy and successful he is. Last I heard he had four or five shows on Disney that he was scoring.\\" In 2017, Manning, Smith, and Dover reunited for a new band called the Lickerish Quartet. The musicians had not played together since 1994 and are scheduled to release three EPs from early 2020 to mid 2021. Sturmer was not offered to participate in the project. In a 2020 interview, Manning commented that Sturmer remains disinterested \\"in any kind of post-Jellyfish activity, and that’s fine.\\" Influences Among power pop bands of the 1990s, Jellyfish were distinguished for being influenced more by Cheap Trick (pictured in 1977) Jellyfish distinguished themselves from their peers by incorporating a wider variety of sounds and musical styles. Most of their influences were British. Sturmer and Manning shared an admiration for punk, progressive rock, reggae, fusion and for artists that included the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Harry Nilsson, Talking Heads, Cheap Trick, Peter Gabriel, Queen, and the Damned, in addition to jazz musicians such as Art Blakey, John Coltrane, the Jazz Messengers, Miles Davis, Elvin Jones, and Bill Evans. In a 1991 article about the Beatles' influence on new power pop bands, Sturmer commented: \\"I was much more influenced by ELO and Cheap Trick. After a while I heard a Beatles album and thought, 'Wow, what's up here with these guys?' I kinda went about it backwards.\\" Falkner's inspirations overlapped with his bandmates and included The Fall, Magazine, The Monochrome Set, Yes, and UK. He was originally contacted by Manning specifically because he listed XTC as an influence in his newspaper ad. Asked about Jellyfish's musical influences, Manning answered: \\"Britpop and post-punk was happening at the time. My jazz schooling helped me analyze the vocal harmonies and arrangements of The Carpenters and Fleetwood Mac and Burt Bacharach. I then applied that to what we were doing in Jellyfish.\\" He stated that, even though their music was not often associated with jazz, their shared enthusiasm for the genre was significant, as \\"it opens your ear to so many different kinds of harmony and so many arrangers and composers. Anybody who's just well-rounded and studied has had a jazz background, just as they've studied the great classical composers\\" However, he noted, \\"Andy was a mad [Bob] Dylan and Van Morrison fan, and while I have respect for those artists, the songwriting didn’t speak to me.\\" Manning's original concept for the group was akin to the early multimedia crossovers of bands that turned into TV shows or vice versa: the Monkees, the Archies, the Partridge Family, and the Banana Splits. In response to the band frequently being compared to past acts, Sturmer said: \\"There are certainly bits of what we do that people could go, 'This sounds to me like that,' but I think that's just a bit of a wank, frankly. ... I think when things are referenced to death, it's like trying to describe the color blue to a blind person.\\" Washington Post contributor Eric Bruce opined in 1990: \\"It's impossible not to hear Beatles and Beach Boys, especially, in the band's music, with nods to Supertramp, Cheap Trick, Gilbert O'Sullivan, 10cc, the Hollies, the Monkees, the Raspberries, Crowded House -- heck, just about every pop purveyor of above-average intelligence in the past 25 years\\". Similarly, Andy Edelstein of Newsday felt that their \\"greatest influence seems to be the '70s groups who themselves were derivative of the mid-'60s British Invasion bands\\". Legacy Nielsen SoundScan listed the combined US sales of Spilt Milk and Bellybutton with 269,000 copies sold, although the number was likely higher, as Soundscan was launched a year after the release of Bellybutton. Music journalists generally praised Jellyfish at the time, albeit a recurring criticism was that the band's music appeared too derivative. Later, journalists often used the group as a point of comparison to subsequent artists. Since the breakup, the group has influenced numerous other acts, especially within the power pop genre. Their following also grew significantly. AllMusic's James Christopher Morgan wrote that their influence extends to the Merrymakers, the Hutchinsons, the Excentrics, and Ben Folds Five, and added that the band \\"secure[d] for themselves the same kind of cult status bestowed upon so many of their heroes.\\" Writing for Louder Sound in 2015, Dave Everley attributed Jellyfish to have \\"bridged the world of power- pop and progressive rock like no one before or since\\".

It was published in 1605 but was entered into the Stationers' Register on 15 May 1594.Donald M Miche, ed., 'A Critical Edition of The True Chronicle History of King Leir and His Three Daughters, Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella', New York, NY, Garland Publishing, 1991; p. 4. The play has attracted critical attention principally for its relationship with King Lear, Shakespeare's version of the same story.Logan and Smith, pp. 222-4. Performance The records of theatre impresario Philip Henslowe show that King Leir was performed on 6 and 8 April 1594 at the Rose Theatre, by a cast that combined personnel from two acting companies, Queen Elizabeth's Men and Sussex's Men. Other records claim that the play was often acted, though these two are the only specific performances known. It has been suggested that Shakespeare, who might have been a player in the Queen's company of the 1590s, may have actually performed in King Leir.Tiffany Stern, ed., King Leir, Globe Quartos, London, 2002; p. ix. Publication The moste famous Chronicle historye of Leire king of England and his Three Daughters was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, by stationer Adam Islip; but Islip's name is crossed out of the record and the name of fellow stationer Edward White is substituted. Perhaps this conflict between stationers prevented the play's publication in 1594; certainly it did not appear in print until the next decade. It was registered again on 8 May 1605 (as the Tragecall historie of kinge Leir and his Three Daughters &c;), by stationer Simon Stafford. The first edition appeared later that year, printed by Stafford for the bookseller John Wright, with the title The true Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan and Cordella. The title page states that the drama \\"hath been diverse and sundry times lately acted\\". The 1605 quarto was the sole edition of the play during the seventeenth century.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 4, p. 25. Authorship There is no consensus of scholarly opinion on the authorship of King Leir. The play has been variously attributed to Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, George Peele, Thomas Lodge, Anthony Munday, and Shakespeare himself.Logan and Smith, pp. 219-20. Sources The author drew primarily on Holinshed's Chronicles for the story of Leir and his daughters. Other sources and influences include Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, The Mirror for Magistrates, William Warner's Albion's England, and Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene.Logan and Smith, pp. 220–1. In turn, critics widely agree that King Leir served as a primary source for Shakespeare's King Lear.Geoffrey Bullough, ed., Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare, 8 Volumes, New York, Columbia University Press, 1957-75; Vol. 7, pp. 269–71, 276–84, 287–92.Logan and Smith, pp. 222–3. Genre King Leir has been called a \\"chronicle history\\", a \\"tragical history\\", a \\"tragicomedy\\", and even \\"a tragedy with a happy ending\\". (Leir is alive and restored to his kingship at the end of his play.) Leir does not contain the subplot about Gloucester, Edgar, and Edmund that Shakespeare added to the story. The Annesley case Some commentators have argued that King Leir was printed in 1605 to take advantage of the attention drawn by Shakespeare's similar play - which would mean that Shakespeare's Lear was being acted in 1605.Logan and Smith, p. 223. Yet \\"a remarkable historical parallel\\" provided \\"a topical reason\\"Bullough, Vol. 7, p. 270. for the publication of Leir, and perhaps also for Shakespeare's interest in the story c. 1605. Brian Annesley (or Anslowe) was an elderly former follower of Queen Elizabeth, a wealthy Kentishman with three daughters: Grace (married to Sir John Wildgose), Christian (the wife of William Sandys, 3rd Baron Sandys), and the youngest, the unmarried Cordell who had been a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth. In 1603, Grace tried to have her father declared senile and incompetent to manage his estate. Cordell wrote to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury to protest her older sister's action, and otherwise supported her father against his eldest daughter.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (1930), p. 262, 265-6. Brian Annesley died in July 1604; Cordell Annesley successfully defended her father's last will and testament, which left most of the family property to Cordell. One of the executors of the will was Sir William Hervey; he was a veteran of the 1588 campaign against the Spanish Armada and the third husband of the Dowager Countess of Southampton, the mother of Shakespeare's patron Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton.

So, a true-life scandal with noteworthy parallels to the Leir/Lear story was in the news in 1603 and 1604, and may have helped to inspire both Shakespeare's play and the publication of the old play King Leir.

The father of the school is considered to be the Bohemian composer Johann Stamitz. Besides him, two generations of composers wrote compositions for the orchestra, whose reputation was due to its excellent discipline and the individual skill of its players; the English traveler Charles Burney called it \\"an army of generals\\". Their performance style included new dynamic elements, crescendos and diminuendos. Composers of the Mannheim school played an important role in the development of the classical period's genres and of the classical symphony form.Encyclopedia of Music, William Collins Sons & Company Ltd., p. 340. 1976 History The origins of the Mannheim school go back to the court of the Elector Charles III Philip, who moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720, already employing an orchestra larger than those of any of the surrounding courts. The orchestra grew even further in the following decades and came to include some of the best virtuosi of the time. Under the guidance of Kapellmeister Carlo Grua, the court hired such talents as Johann Stamitz, who is generally considered to be the founder of the Mannheim school, in 1741/42, and he became its director in 1750. The most notable of the revolutionary techniques of the Mannheim orchestra were its more independent treatment of the wind instruments, and its famous whole-orchestra crescendo. Contemporary musicians mentioned the high level of the orchestra, among them, Leopold Mozart in 1763, and W. A. Mozart in his letters in 1777/78,Szabolcsi Bence – Tóth Aladár: Zenei lexikon, Zeneműkiadó Vállalat, III. k. p. 535 (in Hungarian), 1965. and the English music historian Charles Burney. The role of the Mannheim school's composers in the evolution of the classical symphony is thus significant, although most scholars now agree that these changes occurred nearly simultaneously at various other centers, e.g. in Berlin and Vienna. Their influence on the evolution of the classical music period is due to the reputation of the ensemble at one hand, and on the other hand to the fact that the compositions of the Mannheim school's composers were published in Paris and London as well, some of their works even multiple times of different publishers. Composers Members of the Mannheim school included Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, Carl Stamitz, Franz Ignaz Beck, Ignaz Fränzl, and Christian Cannabich, and it had a very direct influence on many major symphonists of the time, including Joseph Haydn and Leopold Hofmann. (Cannabich, one of the directors of the orchestra after the death of J. Stamitz, was also a good friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the latter's visit to Mannheim in 1777 onwards.) Johann Stamitz visited Paris, and the Mannheim school had an influence on the Concert Spirituel Sacred Concert since 1754. When Joseph Legros took over the Parisian concert series Concert Spirituel, the relationship with the Mannheim School flourished and the music of Haydn became extremely popular in Paris. Prominent concerts in Paris during the 1770s were the Concert de la Loge Olympique (Concert of the Olympic Lodge) and the Concert des Amateurs (Concert for the Fans) which may have been part of the Concert Spirituel.Bernard Harrison \\"Haydn The Paris Symphonies\\" Cambridge University Press 1998 Claude-François-Marie Rigoley (the Comte d'Ogny) commissioned Joseph Haydn's six \\"Paris Symphonies\\", Nr. 82–87, for performance by Concert de la Loge Olympique. Chevalier de Saint-Georges conducted their world premiere. The influence of the Mannheim school is evident in these symphonies. Musical innovations Composers of the Mannheim school introduced a number of novel ideas into the orchestral music of their day: sudden crescendos – the Mannheim Crescendo (a crescendo developed via the whole orchestra) – and diminuendos; crescendos with piano releases; the Mannheim Rocket (a swiftly ascending passage typically having a rising arpeggiated melodic line together with a crescendo); the Mannheim Roller (an extended crescendo passage typically having a rising melodic line over an ostinato bass line); the Mannheim Sigh (a mannered treatment of the Baroque practice of putting more weight on the first of two notes in descending pairs of slurred notes); the Mannheim Birds (imitation of birds chirping in solo passages); the Mannheim Climax (a high-energy section of music where all instruments drop out except for the strings, usually preceded by a Mannheim Crescendo); and the Grand Pause where the playing stops for a moment, resulting in total silence, only to restart vigorously. The Mannheim Rocket can be a rapidly ascending broken chord from the lowest range of the bass line to the very top of the soprano line. Its influence can be found at the beginning of the fourth movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 as well as the very start of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor, Op. 2, No. 1\\\\. Members of the Mannheim school abandoned quickly the praxis of the basso continuo in their compositions, which was almost universal in the Baroque era, and they used the minimum of contrapuntal elaboration. One of their chief innovations is the four-movement symphony form, introducing the menuet as its third movement, which was originally one of the Baroque suite's movements. The Mannheim school played an important role in the development of the sonata form, which is generally the form of the classical symphony's first movement. In their orchestration practice, the clarinet appears both as part of the woodwind section and as a solo instrument.

He was the group's lead vocalist, drummer, and primary songwriter. Following their break-up in 1994, Sturmer became involved, with Tamio Okuda, as writer and producer for the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi. Although Sturmer maintains a low public profile, he continues working as a songwriter for cartoons produced by Disney and Cartoon Network.  Jellyfish  Sturmer attended high school in Pleasanton, California in the 1970s. There, he was a drummer in the school's jazz band, and met keyboardist Roger Manning, who recalled: \\"I've never seen anyone of his age with that expertise and command of his instrument. Andy was one of the first kids in our town who took it seriously and had a goal. He was my hero.\\" They later joined the group Beatnik Beatch. When the band dissolved in 1988, Sturmer and Manning formed Jellyfish. Jellyfish released two albums, Bellybutton (1990) and Spilt Milk (1993). Sturmer wrote all of the lyrics, but composed the music with Manning. He had the rare distinction of not only being a drummer who regularly sang lead in a rock group, but also one who played a stand-up drum set at the front of the stage instead of sitting on a throne at the rear of the band. While their records earned critical praise and they toured the world several times, Jellyfish failed to meet commercial expectations, and intra-group friction led to Jellyfish's dissolution in early 1994. In a May 1994 article published in the San Francisco Chronicle, it was reported that Sturmer and Manning would form new bands in the aftermath of Jellyfish. Sturmer nearly released a solo album on Virgin Records before deciding against the proposal. Manning later said, \\"It was a surprise to me that Andy chose the route he did. I felt sure he'd make solo albums of his own material, like [one unreleased] ballad he played me. That was a brilliant song and the world should hear it.\\" Elsewhere, Manning attributed the break-up partly to Sturmer's discomfort as frontman: \\"Andy never wanted to be in the spotlight, but he was never honest with himself. With Jellyfish, he couldn't have been in more foreign territory.\\" Puffy AmiYumi and other work Puffy (pictured 2009), as well as writing and co-producing their records with Tamio Okuda Sturmer subsequently devoted his career to producing and writing for other artists. Among his first projects was the Japanese pop duo Puffy (known as Puffy AmiYumi outside of Japan). He was already a friend of main Puffy composer and producer Tamio Okuda and was credited as \\"godfather\\" of the band for giving the group their name. Sturmer also worked with the Swedish pop band the Merrymakers, who tracked him down through the Internet. He ultimately played all the drums on their 1997 album Bubblegun and co-produced four tracks. Puffy were approached by Cartoon Network to sing the theme song for the 2003 animated series Teen Titans. Originally suggested by the series' producer Sam Register, creator Glen Murakami was delighted when he learned Sturmer would be writing and producing the track. In 2004, Sturmer also became the consulting producer and theme song composer for the cartoon Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. After composing and producing most of the songs on Puffy AmiYumi's Nice. (2003) and 59 (2004), his involvement with the band lessened. Following his work on Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, Sturmer composed theme songs for other Cartoon Network series, including Ben 10 (alongside its score composition), Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and the third season of The Batman animated series. He also composed the score and theme song for the Disney series My Friends Tigger & Pooh and performed the theme song for Transformers Animated. In 2006, he worked with Mike Viola on the album Alpacas Orgling (credited to LEO). In the liner notes for the 2002 Jellyfish box set Fan Club, it is stated that Sturmer was planning \\"an imminent solo record to be released over the Internet.\\" As of 2015, he refuses all requests for interviews about his past or current work. That year, Manning commented in an interview that the reason Jellyfish has never reunited was mostly due to Sturmer's \\"lack of interest\\". He added: \\"I know many people that work with him in film and TV always tell me how happy and successful he is. Last I heard he had four or five shows on Disney that he was scoring.\\"  References   External links  * * *Andy Sturmer songs *Jellyfish discography compiled by Zenandjuice Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American television composers Category:Jellyfish (band) members Category:1965 births Category:Animation composers ","title":"Andy Sturmer"},{"id":"310729","text":"Soviet Russia () may refer to:  Countries  * Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, an independent state (1917–1922) and republic of the Soviet Union (1922–1991) * Soviet Union (1922–1991), often incorrectly called Soviet Russia  Exhibitions  * Soviet Russia (exhibition, 1960) * Soviet Russia (exhibition, 1965) * Soviet Russia (exhibition, 1967) * Soviet Russia (exhibition, 1975)  Other uses  * Soviet Russia, a magazine of the Friends of Soviet Russia in the United States in the 1920s * Sovetskaya Rossiya (Soviet Russia), a Soviet and Russian newspaper since 1956  See also  * * Russia * Russian Republic (1917) * Russian reversal, a type of joke that usually begins \\"In Soviet Russia...\\" ","title":"Soviet Russia (disambiguation)"},{"id":"310732","text":"Granville Bantock (picture first published 1913) Sir Granville Ransome Bantock (7 August 186816 October 1946) was a British composer of classical music.

He was also conductor of the Liverpool Orchestral Society with which he premiered Delius's Brigg Fair on 18 January 1908. He became the principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music in 1900. He was a close friend of fellow composer Havergal Brian. He was Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham from 1908 to 1934 (in which post he succeeded Sir Edward Elgar).A Reason for Resignation. The University of Birmingham Newsletter, Issue 21 Vol 2 February 2003. Retrieved 2011-07-16. In 1934, he was elected Chairman of the Corporation of Trinity College of Music in London. He was knighted in 1930. His students included the conductor and composer Anthony Bernard and the composer Eric Fogg. In 1898 he married Helena von Schweitzer (1868-1961) who acted as a librettist for him. He was influential in the founding of the City of Birmingham orchestra (later the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra), whose first performance in September 1920 was of his overture Saul. Bantock's Hebridean Symphony was recorded by the CBO on 28 January 1925 at Riley Hall, Constitution Hill, Birmingham. This acoustic version, conducted by Adrian Boult, was never released. His music was influenced by folk song of the Hebrides (as in his 1915 Hebridean Symphony) and the works of Richard Wagner. Many of his works have an \\"exotic\\" element, including the choral epic Omar Khayyám (1906-09).Foreman, Lewis (2007), Bantock: Omar Khayyám (PDF), Chandos Records. Retrieved 2011-06-27. Among his other better-known works are the overture The Pierrot of the Minute (1908) and the Pagan Symphony (1928). Many of his works have been commercially recorded since the early 1990s. From 1926 to 1933 his Birmingham home was Metchley Lodge (now Metchley Abbey; despite the name, the building has no religious connection), which a Birmingham Civic Society blue plaque on the building records. Shortly after the composer's death in London, in 1946, a Bantock Society was established. Its first president was Jean Sibelius, whose music Bantock championed during the early years of the century. Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to Bantock. Edward Elgar dedicated the second of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches to Bantock. Granville Bantock is the father-in-law of the composer Margaret More (1903-1966) via her marriage to Granville's son, Raymond Bantock. Bibliography Three books have been published on Granville Bantock. The first was authored by his long-time (and long suffering) friend and 'secretary', 'Colonel' H. O. Anderton for the Living Masters of Music series in 1915. The second is a 'personal portrait' by Bantock's daughter, published by Dent in 1972. It is an engaging read and contains a number of photographs. The third, An Introduction to the Life and Work of Sir Granville Bantock by Vincent Budd, was published in 2000, by Gnosis Press. It is also illustrated and contains a discographical guide. A larger volume is in progress. The Bantock Society published a Journal between 1996 and 1999 and its issues contain a number of articles on the composer. There are also numerous other published pieces scattered in various magazines and journals. A Doctoral thesis by Trevor Bray, written in 1972, is a record of Bantock's musical output.

In filenames and elsewhere, the name Cangjie is sometimes abbreviated as cj. The input method was invented in 1976 by Chu Bong-Foo, and named after Cangjie (Tsang-chieh), the mythological inventor of the Chinese writing system, at the suggestion of Chiang Wei-kuo, the former Defense Minister of Taiwan. Chu Bong-Foo released the patent for Cangjie in 1982, as he thought that the method should belong to Chinese cultural heritage. Therefore, Cangjie has become open-source software and is on every computer system that supports traditional Chinese characters, and it has been extended so that Cangjie is compatible with the simplified Chinese character set. A Chinese keyboard in Shek Tong Tsui Municipal Services Building, Hong Kong with Cangjie hints printed on the lower-left corners of the keys. (Printed on the lower-right and upper-right corners are Dayi hints and Zhuyin symbols respectively.) Cangjie is the first Chinese input method to use the QWERTY keyboard. Chu saw that the QWERTY keyboard had become an international standard, and therefore believed that Chinese-language input had to be based on it. Other, earlier methods use large keyboards with 40 to 2400 keys, except the Four-Corner Method, which uses only number keys. Unlike the Pinyin input method, Cangjie is based on the graphological aspect of the characters: each graphical unit, called a \\"radical\\" (not to confused with Kangxi radicals), is represented by a basic character component, 24 in total, each mapped to a particular letter key on a standard QWERTY keyboard. An additional \\"difficult character\\" function is mapped to the X key. Keys are categorized into four groups, to facilitate learning and memorization. Assigning codes to Chinese characters is done by separating the constituent \\"radicals\\" of the characters. Overview Keys and \\"radicals\\" The basic character components in Cangjie are called \\"radicals\\" (字根) or \\"letters\\" (字母). There are 24 radicals but 26 keys; the 24 radicals (the basic shapes ) are associated with roughly 76 auxiliary shapes (), which in many cases are either rotated or transposed versions of components of the basic shapes. For instance, the letter A () can represent either itself, the slightly wider 曰, or a 90° rotation of itself. (For a more complete account of the 76-odd transpositions and rotations than the ones listed below, see the article on Cangjie entry in Chinese Wikibooks.) The 24 keys are placed in four groups: * Philosophical Group — corresponds to the letters 'A' to 'G' and represents the sun, the moon, and the five elements * Strokes Group — corresponds to the letters 'H' to 'N' and represents the brief and subtle strokes * Body-Related Group — corresponds to the letters 'O' to 'R' and represents various parts of the human anatomy * Shapes Group — corresponds to the letters 'S' to 'Y' and represents complex and enclosed character forms {  !Group!!Key!!Name!!Primary meaning -  rowspan=\\"7\\"Philosophical group A 日 sun 日, 曰, 90° rotated 日 (as in 巴) - B 月 moon the top four strokes of 目, 冂, 爫, 冖, the top and top-left part of 炙, 然, and 祭, the top-left four strokes of 豹 and 貓, and the top four strokes of 骨 - C 金 gold itself, 丷, 八, and the penultimate two strokes of 四 and 匹 - D 木 wood itself, the first two strokes of 寸 and 才, the first two strokes of 也 and 皮 - E 水 water 氵, the last five strokes of 暴 and 康, 又 - F 火 fire the shape 小, 灬, the first three strokes in 當 and 光 - G 土 land  itself, or 士 for soldier -  rowspan=\\"7\\"Stroke group H 竹 bamboo The slant and short slant, the Kangxi radical 竹, namely the upper parts in 笨 and 節 - I 戈 dagger axe The dot, the first three strokes in 床 and 庫, and the shape 厶 - J 十 ten The cross shape and the shape 宀 - K 大 big The X shape, including 乂 and the first two strokes of 右, as well as 疒 - L 中 centre The vertical stroke, as well as 衤 and the first four strokes of 書 and 盡 - M 一 one The horizontal stroke, as well as the final stroke of 孑 and 刁, the shape 厂, and the shape 工 - N 弓 bow The crossbow and the hook -  rowspan=\\"4\\"Body parts group O 人 person The dismemberment, the Kangxi radical 人, the first two strokes of 丘 and 乓, the first two strokes of 知, 攻, and 氣, and the final two strokes of 兆 - P 心 heart The Kangxi radical 忄, the second stroke in 心, the last four strokes in 恭, 慕, and 忝, the shape 匕, the shape 七, the penultimate two strokes in 代, and the shape 勹 - Q 手 hand The Kangxi radical 手 - R 口 mouth The Kangxi radical 口 -  rowspan=\\"6\\"Character shapes group S 尸 corpse 匚, the first two strokes of 己, the first stroke of 司 and 刀, the third stroke of 成 and 豕, the first four strokes of 長 and 髟 - T 廿 twenty Two vertical strokes connected by a horizontal stroke; the Kangxi radical 艸 when written as 艹 (whether the horizontal stroke is connected or broken) - U 山 mountain Three-sided enclosure with an opening on the top - V 女 woman A hook to the right, a V shape, the last three strokes in 艮, 衣, and 長 - W 田 field Itself, as well as any four-sided enclosure with something inside it, including the first two strokes in 母 and 毋 - Y 卜 fortune telling The 卜 shape and rotated forms, the shape 辶, the first two strokes in 斗 - Collision/Difficult key* X 重/難 collision/difficult (1) disambiguation of Cangjie code decomposition collisions, (2) code for a \\"difficult-to-decompose\\" part - Special character key* Z (See note) Auxiliary code used for entering special characters (no meaning on its own). In most cases, this key combined with other keys will produce Chinese punctuations (such as 。,、,「 」,『 』). Note: Some variants use Z as a collision key instead of X. In those systems, Z has the name \\"collision\\" (重) and X has the name \\"difficult\\" (難); but the use of Z as a collision key is neither in the original Cangjie nor used in the current mainstream implementations. In other variants, Z may have the name \\"user-defined\\" (造) or some other name. - Wildcard Shift + 8 (*) Wildcard It can replace any key from 2nd to 5th place, and return a list matches the combination. It is very useful for unknown guesses when you are sure about the first and last input. (e.g. Input 竹*竹 will include the following in the list: 身, 物, 秒, 第 ) } The auxiliary shapes of each Cangjie radical have changed slightly across different versions of the Cangjie method. Thus, this is one reason that different versions of the Cangjie method are not completely compatible. Chu Bong-Foo has provided alternate names for some letters according to their characteristics. For example, H (竹) is also called 斜, which means slant. The names form a rhyme to help learners memorize the letters, each group being in a line (The sounds of final characters are given in parentheses): :日 月 金 木 水 火 土 (tǔ) :斜 點 交 叉 縱 橫 鈎 (gōu) :人 心 手 口 (kǒu) :側 並 仰 紐 方 卜 (bǔ) Keyboard layout A typical keyboard layout for Cangjie method, based on United States keyboard layout. Note the non-standard use of Z as the collision key. Basic rules The typist must be familiar with several decomposition rules (拆字規則) that define how to analyze a character to arrive at a Cangjie code. * Direction of decomposition: left to right, top to bottom, and outside to inside * Geometrically connected forms: take four Cangjie codes, namely the first, second, third, and last codes * Geometrically unconnected forms that can be broken into two subforms (e.g., 你): identify the two geometrically connected subforms according to the direction of decomposition rules (i.e., 人 and 尔), then take the first and last codes of the first subform and the first, second, and last code of the second subform. * Geometrically unconnected forms that can be broken into multiple subforms (e.g., 謝): identify the first geometrically connected subform according to the direction of decomposition rules (i.e., 言) and take the first and last codes of that form. Next, break the remainder (i.e., 射) into subforms (i.e., 身 and 寸) and take the first and last codes of the first subform and the last code of the last subform. The rules are subject to various principles: * Conciseness (精簡) – if multiple ways of decomposition are possible, the shorter decomposition is consider to be correct. * Completeness (完整) – if multiple ways of decomposition with the same length of code are possible, the one that identifies a more complex form first is the correct decomposition. * Reflection of the form of the radical (字型特徵) – the decomposition should reflect the shape of the radical, meaning (a) using the same code twice or more should be avoided if possible, and (b) the shape of the character should not be \\"cut\\" at a corner in the form. * Omission of codes (省略) ** Partial omission (部分省略) – when the number of codes in a complete decomposition exceeds the permitted number of codes, the extra codes are ignored. ** Omission in enclosed forms (包含省略) – when part of the character to be decomposed and the form is an enclosed form, only the shape of the enclosure is decomposed; the enclosed forms are omitted. Examples Chinese with Cangjie input method version 5 Chinese with Cangjie input method on an Android device * 車 (chē: vehicle) ** This character is geometrically connected, consisting of a single vertical structure, so we take the first, second, and last Cangjie codes from top to bottom. ** The Cangjie code is thus 十 田 十 (JWJ), corresponding to the basic shapes of the codes in this example. * 謝 (xiè: to thank, to wither) ** This character consists of geometrically unconnected parts arranged horizontally. For the initial decomposition, we treat it as two parts, 言 and 射. ** The first part, 言, is geometrically unconnected from top to bottom; we take the first (亠, auxiliary shape of 卜 Y) and last parts (口, basic shape of 口 R) and arrive at 卜 口 (YR). ** The second part is again geometrically unconnected, arranged horizontally. The two parts are 身 and 寸. *** For the first part of this second part, 身, we take the first and last codes. Both are slants and therefore H; the first and last codes are thus 竹 竹 (HH). *** For the second part of the original second part, 寸, we take only the last part. Because this is geometrically unconnected and consists of two parts, the first part is the outer form while the second part is the dot in the middle. The dot is I, and therefore the last code is 戈 (I). ** The Cangjie code is thus 卜 口 (YR) 竹 竹 (HH) 戈 (I), or 卜 口 竹 竹 戈 (YRHHI). * 谢 (simplified version of 謝) ** This example is identical to the example just above, except that the first part is 讠; the first and last codes are 戈 (I) and 女 (V). ** Repeating the same steps as in the above example, we get 戈 女 (IV) 竹 竹 (HH) 戈 (I), or 戈 女 竹 竹 戈 (IVHHI). Exceptions Some forms are always decomposed in the same way, whether the rules say they should be decomposed this way or not. The number of such exceptions is small: {  !rowspan=2 Form !colspan=3 Fixed decomposition - ! Version 2 ! Version 3 !

Instead, it was part of an integrated system consisting of the Cangjie input rules and a Cangjie controller board. This controller board contains character generator firmware, which dynamically generates Chinese characters from Cangjie codes when characters are output, using the hi-res graphics mode of the Apple II computer. In the preface of the Cangjie user's manual, Chu Bong-Foo wrote in 1982: In this early system, when the user types \\"yk\\", for example, to get the Chinese character 文, the Cangjie codes do not get converted to any character encoding and the actual string \\"yk\\" is stored. The Cangjie code for each character (a string of 1 to 5 lowercase letters plus a space) the encoding of that particular character. Demonstration of character generator Mingzhus capability to generate characters according to the codes. None of the examples are included in Unicode. The first character is ⿰飠它, which denotes a kind of soup in Xuzhou. Other characters are never recorded. A particular \\"feature\\" of this early system is that, if one sends random lowercase words to it, the character generator will attempt to construct Chinese characters according to the Cangjie decomposition rules, sometimes causing strange, unknown characters to appear. This unintended feature, \\"automatic generation of characters\\", is described in the manual and is responsible for producing more than 10,000 of the 15,000 characters that the system can handle. The name Cangjie, evocative of the creation of new characters, was indeed apt for this early version of Cangjie. The presence of the integrated character generator also explains the historical necessity for the existence of the \\"X\\" key, which is used for the disambiguation of decomposition collisions: because characters are \\"chosen\\" when the codes are \\"output\\", every character that can be displayed must in fact have a unique Cangjie decomposition. It would not make sense—nor would it be practical—for the system to provide a choice of candidate characters when a random text file is displayed, as the user would not know which of the candidates is correct. Issues Cangjie was designed to be an easy-to-use system to help promote the use of Chinese computing. However, many users find Cangjie is difficult to learn and use, with many difficulties caused by poor instruction. Perceived difficulties * In order to input using Cangjie, knowledge of both the names of the radicals as well as their auxiliary shapes is required. It is common to find tables of the Cangjie radicals with their auxiliary shapes taped onto the monitors of computer users. * One must also be familiar with the decomposition rules, lack of knowledge of which results in increased difficulty in typing the intended characters. * The user cannot type a character that they have forgotten how to write (a problem with all non-phonetic based input methods). With enough practice, users can overcome the above problems. Typical touch- typists can type Chinese at 25 characters per minute (cpm), or better, using Cangjie, despite having difficulty remembering the list of auxiliary shapes or the decomposition rules. Experienced Cangjie typists can reportedly attain a typing speed from 60 cpm to over 200 cpm.  Limitations in implementation  The decomposition of a character depends on a predefined set of \\"standard shapes\\" (標準字形). However, as many variations of Cangjie exist in different countries, the standard shape of a certain character in Cangjie is not always the one the user has learnt before. Learning Cangjie then entails learning not only Cangjie itself but also unfamiliar standard shapes for some characters. The Cangjie input method editor (IME) does not handle mistakes in decomposition except by informing the user (usually by beeping) that there is a mistake. However, Cangjie is originally designed to assign different codes to different variants of a character. For example, in the Cangjie provided on Windows, the code for 產 is YHHQM, which corresponds not to the shape of this character but to another variant, 産. This is a problem resulting from the implementation of Cangjie on Windows. In the original Cangjie, 產 should be YKMHM (the first part is 文) while 産 is YHHQM (the first part is 产). Punctuation marks are not geometrically decomposed, but rather given predefined codes that begin with ZX followed by a string of three letters related to the ordering of the characters in the Big5 code. (This set of codes was added to Cangjie on the traditional Chinese version of Windows 95. On Windows 3.1, Cangjie did not have a set of codes for punctuation marks.) Typing punctuation marks in Cangjie thus becomes a frustrating exercise involving either memorization or pick-and-peck. However, this is solved on modern systems through accessing a virtual keyboard on screen (On Windows, this is activated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + comma key). Commonly-made errors include not considered as alternative codes. For example, if one does not decompose 方 from top to bottom into YHS, but instead type YSH according to stroke order, Cangjie does not return the character 方 as a choice. Since Cangjie requires all 26 keys of the QWERTY keyboard, it cannot be used to input Chinese characters on feature phones, which have only a 12-key keypad. Alternative input methods, such as Zhuyin, 5-stroke (or 9-stroke by Motorola), and the Q9 input method, are used instead. Versions The Cangjie input method is commonly said to have gone through five generations (commonly referred to as \\"versions\\" in English), each of which is slightly incompatible with the others. Currently, version 3 (第三代倉頡) is the most common and supported natively by Microsoft Windows. Version 5 (第五代倉頡), supported by the Free Cangjie IME and previously the only Cangjie supported by SCIM, represents a significant minority method and is supported by iOS. The early Cangjie system supported by the Zero One card on the Apple II was Version 2; Version 1 was never released. The Cangjie input method supported on the classic Mac OS resembles both Version 3 and Version 5. Version 5, like the original Cangjie input method, was created directly by Chu. He had hoped that the release of Version 5, originally slated to be Version 6, would bring an end to the \\"more than ten versions of Cangjie input method\\" (slightly incompatible versions created by different vendors). Version 6 has not yet been released to the public, but is being used to create a database which can accurately store every historical Chinese text. Variants Most modern implementations of Cangjie input method editors (IME) provide various convenient features: * Some IMEs list all characters beginning with the code you have typed. For example, if you type A, the system gives you all characters whose Cangjie code begins with A, so that you can select the correct character if it is on the screen; if you type another A, the list is shortened to give all characters whose code begins with AA. Examples of such implementations include the IME in Mac OS X, and the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM). * Some IMEs provide one or more wildcard keys, usually but not always * and/or ?, that allow the user to omit part(s) of the Cangjie code; the system will display a list of matching characters for the user to choose. Examples include the X window Chinese INput XIM server (xcin), the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM), and the IME of the Founder Group (University of Peking) typesetting systems. Microsoft Windows's standard \\"Changjie\\" IME allows * to substitute for in-between characters (effectively reducing it to Simplified Cangjie entries), while the \\"New Changjie\\" IME allows * as a wildcard anywhere except for the first character. * Some IMEs provide an \\"abbreviation\\" feature, where impossible Cangjie codes are interpreted as abbreviations for the Cangjie codes of more than one character. This allows more characters to be input with fewer keys. An example is the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM). * Some IMEs provide an \\"association\\" (聯想 lianxiang) feature, where the system anticipates what you are going to type next, and provides you with a list of characters or even phrases associated with what the user has typed. An example is the Microsoft \\"Changjie\\" IME. * Some IMEs present the list of candidate characters differently, depending on the frequency of character use (how often that character has been typed by the user). An example is the Cangjie IME in the NJStar Chinese word processor. Besides the wildcard key, many of these features are convenient for casual users but unsuitable for touch-typists because they make the Cangjie IME unpredictable. There have also been various attempts to \\"simplify\\" Cangjie one way or another: * Simplified Cangjie ( also known as Quick, (簡易 jiǎnyì) or (速成 sùchéng) ) has the same radicals, auxiliary shapes, decomposition rules, and short list of exceptions as Cangjie, but only the first and last codes are used if more than two codes are required in Cangjie.  Applications  Many researchers have discussed ways to decompose Chinese characters into their major components, and tried to build applications based on the decomposition system. The idea can be referred to as the study of the . Cangjie codes offer a basis for such an endeavour. Academia Sinica in Taiwan and Jiaotong University in Shanghai上海交通大學漢字編碼組,上海漢語拼音文字研究組編著。漢字信息字典。北京市科學出版社，1988。 have similar projects as well. One direct application of the use of decomposed characters is the possibility of computing the similarities between different Chinese characters.宋柔，林民，葛詩利。漢字字形計算及其在校對系統中的應用，小型微型計算機系統，第29卷第10期，第1964至1968頁，2008。 The Cangjie input method offers a good starting point for this kind of application. By relaxing the limit of five codes for each Chinese character and adopting more detailed Cangjie codes, visually similar characters can be found by computation. Integrating this with pronunciation information enables computer-assisted learning of Chinese characters.

The player controls a tank which is attacked by other tanks and missiles. The game is considered to be the \\"first big 3D success\\". Gameplay The game uses wireframe vector graphics on a black and white (with green and red sectioned color overlay) vector monitor. Gameplay is on a flat plane with a mountainous horizon featuring an erupting volcano, distant crescent moon, and various geometric solids (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The player can hide behind the solids or, once fired upon, maneuver in rapid turns to buy time with which to fire. The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible, and can block the movement of a player's tank. However, they are also useful as shields as they block enemy fire as well. The player views the screen, which includes an overhead radar view, to find and destroy the rather slow tanks, or the faster-moving supertanks. Saucer-shaped UFOs and guided missiles occasionally appear for a bonus score. The saucers differ from the tanks in that they do not fire upon the player and do not appear on radar. There is a game play modification at 100,000 points if the proper conditions are met. When executed properly the next appearing Supertank will not attack and will retreat. A tank icon will then appear at right on qualified high score listings. Cabinet Battlezone used 3D vector graphics to immerse the player through a 'periscope' display Battlezone was housed in a standard upright arcade cabinet with a novel \\"periscope\\" viewfinder which the player used to view the game. The game action could also be viewed from the sides of the viewfinder for spectators to watch. A later, less common version of the cabinet removed the periscope to improve visibility to non-players and improve the ergonomics for players who could not reach the periscope. This modification also was welcomed by some operators, who felt that the small windows present in the \\"periscoped\\" version did not attract enough attention to the game when played. Battlezone uses two sticks for controlling the player's tank A smaller version of the cabinet (known as a \\"cabaret cabinet\\") also existed with the screen angled upwards, and no periscope. A cocktail table version was tested as a prototype but not produced; it lacked the color overlays as the display would have to flip for opposing players. The controls consisted of left and right joysticks, which could only be moved in the Y (vertical) axis, each controlling the treads on that side of the player's tank. One joystick contained a button used to fire projectiles at enemy targets. Development Owen Rubin, who shared an office with Ed Rotberg, came up with the idea of making the volcano in the background erupt, and coded the animation for it. Home ports In the 1980s, Battlezone was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari 2600, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC, ZX Spectrum, and later the Atari ST. The ZX Spectrum version was published by Quicksilva; the ports to non-Atari systems were from Atarisoft. The Atari 2600 version uses raster graphics instead of vectors and has a third person view where the tank is visible. The Atari ST port contains large parts of the original 6502 code which is emulated in real time. An Atari 5200 port was scheduled for release in November 1983, but was cancelled. The Atari Lynx has the deluxe port Battlezone 2000 released in 1995. A Game Boy port was part of the 1996 Battlezone / Super Breakout combo. In 2008, an updated version of Battlezone was released on Xbox Live Arcade. The game was developed by Stainless Games and published by Atari Inc. It features 1080i graphics, Dolby 5.1 audio and an online mode to play against 2 - 4 friends in Deathmatch and Capture the Flag modes, and incorporates Xbox Live Vision support. Reception Battlezone was well received, earning an Honorable Mention for \\"Best Commercial Arcade Game\\" in 1982 at the Third Annual Arkie Awards. It was runner-up, behind Pac-Man. The Bradley Trainer A standard enemy tank in the player's sights in The Bradley Trainer A version called The Bradley Trainer (also known as Army Battlezone or Military Battlezone) was designed for use by the U.S. Army as targeting training for gunners on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. It was commissioned by a consultant group of retired generals. Approaching Atari in December 1980, some developers within Atari refused to work on the project because of its association with the Army, most notably original Battlezone programmer Ed Rotberg. Rotberg only joined after he was promised by management that he would never be asked to do anything with the military in the future. According to Rotberg, it took him three months of constant work to develop the prototype version of The Bradley Trainer. Only two were produced; one was delivered to the Army and is presumed lost, and the other is in the private collection of Scott Evans, who found it by a dumpster in the rear parking lot at Midway Games. The gunner yoke was based on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle control and was later re-used in the popular Star Wars game. The Bradley Trainer differs dramatically from the original Battlezone as it features helicopters, missiles, and machine guns; furthermore, the actual tank does not move—the guns simply rotate. Legacy Because of its use of first-person pseudo 3D graphics combined with a \\"viewing goggle\\" that the player puts his or her face into, Battlezone is sometimes considered the first virtual reality arcade video game. * Activision developed an authorized Battlezone game in 1998. Despite having the same name, it is not an arcade game, but a more complicated tank piloting strategy game. Battlezone II: Combat Commander is the 1999 sequel. * A re-imagining of Battlezone was developed by Paradigm Entertainment and released for the PlayStation Portable. * In 2013, Rebellion Developments bought the Battlezone franchise from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. In 2016, a virtual reality game titled Battlezone was released for the PlayStation 4. It was ported to the PC in 2017. It supports Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. Clones * Stellar 7, a Battlezone-inspired game, was released for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1983. * Robot Tank, released by Activision in 1983 for the Atari 2600, is similar to the 2600 version of Battlezone. * Encounter, developed by Novagen Software for the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64 in 1983, is also similar to 2600 Battlezone, with scaled sprites instead of wireframe 3D graphics. It includes both the missiles and saucers of the original. * A clone named 3D Tank Zone was released on the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro in 1983 by Dynabyte. 3D Tank Duel and Rommel's Revenge by Realtime Games and Crystal Computing respectively were released for the Sinclair Spectrum in 1983 and 1984, shortly before the Atari-authorized version was released by Quicksilva. A TRS-80 Color Computer clone called Rommel 3D and was released in 1985. Another clone from Design Design software was released as Tank Busters in the mid-80s for the Amstrad CPC. * A Battlezone clone for Apollo Domain/OS called bzone was written by Justin S. Revenaugh in 1986 and re-written for the X Window System by Todd Mummert in 1990. The X Window System version, cbzone, differed from the original arcade version in that the player could be attacked by more than one enemy tank at the same time. This version of the game was also ported to the Macintosh in the 1990s and was included in the UMich software archive. * The 1991 Macintosh tank game Spectre and its sequels owe much to Battlezone for their gameplay and appearance. * SGI workstations had a Battlezone derived game in the early 1990s called BZ which added network play. BZ also had guided missiles, where the player would fly the missile after launch, returning to the tank on impact. This version evolved into the game BZFlag with a capture-the-flag mode where flags can change the tank's abilities. * A true vector graphics homebrew Stramash Zone for the Vectrex in 2018.http://www.clockworkrobot.com/shop/ See also * Golden age of video arcade games References External links * * Battlezone at the Arcade History database * * * Battlezone software disassembly and analysis Category:1980 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari arcade games Category:Atari Lynx games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled Atari 5200 games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Commodore VIC-20 games Category:DOS games Category:First-person shooters Category:Tank simulation video games Category:Vector arcade games Category:Virtual reality games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Hand Made Software games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Battlezone (1980 video game)"},{"id":"310741","text":"Mateja Svet (); born 16 August 1968) is a former Yugoslav alpine skier of Slovenian descent.

Career A star player at Har-Brack High School in Natrona Heights, Pennsylvania, in 1953 he led the team to the W.P.I.A.L. co-championship with Donora. As a junior, he was talked into signing a professional football contract with the NFL's Cleveland Browns by Paul Brown. The signing was against NFL rules and likely illegal, and when Brown reneged on his promise that Gilchrist would make the team, Gilchrist left training camp at Hiram College, in Hiram, Ohio, and went to Canada to play. There, in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU), he received the Jim Shanks (Team MVP) Trophy for the Sarnia Imperials in 1954, and the Kitchener- Waterloo Dutchmen's Team MVP Award in 1955. In 1956, he joined the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, helping lead them to a 1957 Grey Cup victory. He spent one season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, rushing for 1,254 yards. He then was traded to the Toronto Argonauts for Tex Schwierer, and played three years in Toronto.Toronto Star, Thursday July 28, 1960, page 15. In his six years in the CFL, Gilchrist was a divisional All- Star at running back five consecutive years from 1956 to 1960 (there were no All-Canadians selected in those years) and was also an Eastern All-Star at linebacker in 1960. Additionally, in 1960 he was runner up for the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. In his CFL career, Gilchrist recorded 4,911 rushing yards, 1,068 receiving yards and 12 interceptions. Gilchrist then joined the roster of the Buffalo Bills of the fledgling American Football League. Incidentally, Gilchrist was Buffalo's backup plan: they had actually drafted Ernie Davis to be the team's franchise running back in 1962. Davis instead chose the NFL, but died of leukemia before ever playing a down of professional football. The Bills instead signed Gilchrist as a free agent. While with Buffalo, Gilchrist played fullback and kicked, though he insisted he could have played both ways. He was the first 1,000-yard American Football League rusher, with 1,096 yards in a 14-game schedule in 1962. That year, he set the all-time AFL record for touchdowns with 13, and he earned AFL MVP honors. Gilchrist rushed for a professional football record 243 yards and five touchdowns in a single game against the New York Jets in 1963. Though he was with the Bills for only three years (1962–1964), he remains the team's ninth- leading rusher all-time,https://www.pro-football- reference.com/teams/buf/career-rushing.htm and led the league in scoring in each of his three years as a Bill. Gilchrist ran for 122 yards in the Bills' 1964 American Football League championship defeat of the San Diego Chargers, 20-7. His 4.5 yard/rush average is second as a Bill only to O.J. Simpson. One of Gilchrist's strengths was blocking. Gilchrist's blocking was mentioned by broadcaster and ex-coach John Madden during a CBS TV broadcast in the 1987 season, saying \\"Cookie Gilchrist may have been the best blocking running back that ever played the game.\\" In an early civil rights victory for black athletes, Gilchrist led a successful boycott of New Orleans as the site of the 1965 American Football League All-Star game. He is the only athlete to turn down being enshrined into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and Museum, because of what he described as racism and exploitation by management. Gilchrist frequently was at odds with team management. He told a reporter from the London Free Press that most of the problems he encountered were a result of his standing up for principles at a time when black athletes were expected to remain silent. Gilchrist also played for the Denver Broncos in 1965 and 1967, and for the Miami Dolphins in 1966. He was sent to the man who started his career, Paul Brown in the Cincinnati Bengals expansion draft in 1968, but retired because of knee problems. He was an American Football League All-Star in 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965, making him one of only a few professional football players who made their league's All-Star team for 10 consecutive years (six in the CFL, and four in the AFL). Gilchrist was selected as the fullback of the All-Time American Football League Team. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Gilchrist to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2013 Gilchrist was named to the Bills' Wall of Fame during the team's home game on October 29, 2017 against the Oakland Raiders.

In 1975, he booked Marvin Gaye, Ike & Tina Turner, and Taveres for a benefit concert at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. Gilchrist had numerous feuds with the people he worked with during his football career. He refused entry into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame because he did not believe he was paid well enough for his service.Graham, Tim (January 11, 2011).

Gilchrist did accept induction onto the Bills' Wall of Honor, the predecessor to the Wall of Fame that had been set up at War Memorial Stadium in 1970, but none of the honorees on that wall were carried over to Rich Stadium when it was built in 1973. On August 30, 2017, the Bills announced that he would be inducted into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/2017/08/30/enigmatic- cookie-gilchrist-newest-member-bills-wall-fame/615919001/ In an article in The Buffalo News on March 18, 2007, Gilchrist, then 71, announced that he was being treated for throat cancer. At the time, he lived in Natrona Heights, Pennsylvania. On January 10, 2011, Gilchrist died at an assisted living facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Although the obituary published on January 10, 2011 in the New York Times and on January 10, 2011 in the Buffalo News both say he died in Pittsburgh. Gilchrist was posthumously diagnosed with stage four chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which may explain, in part, some of his behavioural difficulties. Gilchrist was aware of the possibility that he had the disease when writing his autobiography, The Cookie That Did Not Crumble, along with Chris Garbarino. Consequently, he donated his brain to the Canadian Sports Concussion Project for use in their study of CTE.

The highest peak of the wooded Pelion is Pourianos Stavros or Xeforti, (altitude ). On the south edge of Magnesia peninsula Tisaio mountain is found. Mt. Maurovouni () is the northeasternmost mountain of the regional unit and extends to the neighboring regional unit of Larissa. The southwest border of Magnesia is formed by the Othrys, with its highest peak Gerakovouni (). The interior of Magnesia has two plains. The plains southwest of the Pagasetic Gulf are called the Almyros plains, while the plains northwest of the Gulf are called the Volos-Velestino plain. The hydrological network of Magnesia is not particularly rich and is characterized by the absence of big rivers. The waters coming from Pelion shape the rivers Anavros, Platanorema, and Xirias. In the North section of Magnesia, Lake Karla was formerly found. Lake Karla was drained in 1962, but attempts have been made for its partial restoration. On the bight of Sourpi, next to Amaliapolis a coastal wetland is located, with various species of migratory birds. This wetland together with the forest of Kouri – an infrequent lowland of oak forest close to Almyros – is included in the list of the protected regions of the European Network Natura 2000. Climate The average temperature is 17 degrees Celsius and the average rainfall about 540 millimetres per year. Heat waves and intense cold periods are rare. During the summer the temperature rises up to about in August. The climate varies in different parts of the prefecture; close to the Pagasetic Gulf conditions are humid, in Nea Ionia it is quite dry and in Velestino and Almyros is the climate is continental. In winter there is significant snowfall in the mountains and often freezing temperatures. Administration Volos Milies Makrinitsa Nea Anchialos Lake Karla The regional unit Magnesia is subdivided into 5 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox): *Almyros (2) *Rigas Feraios (6) *South Pelion (Notio Pilio, 5) *Volos (1) *Zagora-Mouresi (4) Prefecture Magnesia was created as a prefecture. In addition to the territory of the present regional unit of Magnesia, the Magnesia Prefecture included the Northern Sporades group of islands (Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonnisos). As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was split into the Magnesia and Sporades regional units. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below. {  ! New municipality !! Old municipalities !!

History Antiquity Founding According to Hesiod's (probably) \\"Eoiae\\" () or \\"Catalogue of Women\\"Hesiod (probably), \\"Eoiae\\" () or \\"Catalogue of Women\\", c.650 BC. on the origin of the Greeks, Pandora (named after her grandmother Pandora, sister of Hellen and daughter of Deukalion and Pyrrha) together with Zeus had one son Graecus, while Zeus had two more with Thyia, another of Deukalion's daughter: Magnes and Macedon. Magnes and Makednos together with Hellen's three sons Dorus, Xuthus (with his sons Ion and Achaeus) and Aeolus, comprised the set of progenitors of the ancient tribes that formed the Greek/Hellenic nation. Magnes ruled the area and people under his name. Magnesia is also homeland of the mythical heroes Jason, Peleus and his son Achilles. The Magnetes contributed to the Greek colonization, with their main colonies being established before the 7th century BC, under the names of Magnesia beside Sipylus in Lydia and Magnesia on the Maeander in Ionia. Nomenclature The word magnet comes from the Greek \\"magnítis líthos\\" (μαγνήτης λίθος), which means \\"magnesian stone\\". The names for the elements magnesium and manganese are also derived from either this region or its colony Magnesia ad Sipylum, which in addition to the magnetic magnetite (an iron ore), produces certain ores of magnesium and manganese that were known to alchemists. Common era Written accounts and remains from the 5th century CE document the appearance of Christianity in Magnesia. The minutes of the 3rd Ecumenical Conference are co-signed by the Bishop of Dimitriada Cleonikos. Five basilicas have been revealed in Nea Anhialos, showing that the area was undergoing a spiritual growth in that era. Magnesias has churches, monasteries and chapels, many of which are architectural masterpieces in the style that is called \\"Pelioritica\\". In the area of Pelion are the monasteries of Saint Gerasimos in Makrinitsa, The Holy Archangels in Agios Georgios Nilias, Osios Lavredios in Agios Lavrendis, Saint John the Baptist in Siki and Saint Spiridon in Promiri. The most famous is the Flamouriou Monastery, built in the 16th century by Osios Simeon, the so-called \\"barefoot and loin-clothed\\", located near Veneto. In the Almiros area and on the mountain of Othris two other monasteries were built, one inhabited by monks in Ano Panagia (Virgin Mary) Xenia and the other by nuns in Kato Panagia Xenia. This monastery holds historical monuments of the area from the 12th century, with of frescoes, treasuries and a library. In Kato Panagia Xenia monastery, an icon of the Virgin Mary, venerated by the people of the area, is kept. All the monasteries are of archeological, historical and artistic interest and are accessible (Flamouriou Monastery only by men).

Onset of lung problems is typically between 20 and 50 years old. This may result in shortness of breath, wheezing, or an increased risk of lung infections. Complications may include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, neonatal jaundice, or panniculitis. A1AD is due to a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene that results in not enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Risk factors for lung disease include cigarette smoking and environmental dust. The underlying mechanism involves unblocked neutrophil elastase and buildup of abnormal A1AT in the liver. It is autosomal co-dominant, meaning that one defective allele tends to result in milder disease than two defective alleles. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by blood tests or genetic tests. Treatment of lung disease may include bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and, when infections occur, antibiotics. Intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or in severe disease lung transplantation may also be recommended. In those with severe liver disease liver transplantation may be an option. Avoiding smoking is recommended. Vaccination for influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis is also recommended. Life expectancy among those who smoke is 50 years old while among those who do not smoke it is almost normal. The condition affects about 1 in 2,500 people of European descent. Severe deficiency occurs in about 1 in 5,000. In Asians it is uncommon. About 3% of people with COPD are believed to have the condition. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was first described in the 1960s.  Signs and symptoms  Individuals with A1AD may develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) during their thirties or forties even without a history of smoking, though smoking greatly increases the risk. Symptoms may include shortness of breath (on exertion and later at rest), wheezing, and sputum production. Symptoms may resemble recurrent respiratory infections or asthma. More severe forms of A1AD can include impaired liver function, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure (15%). In newborns, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can result in early onset jaundice followed by prolonged jaundice. It is a leading reason for liver transplantation in newborns. Conditions associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, occurring due to paucity of AAT in circulation allowing uninhibited inflammation in lungs, and accumulation of mutated AAT in the liver Apart from COPD and chronic liver disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency has been associated with necrotizing panniculitis (a skin condition) and with granulomatosis with polyangiitis in which inflammation of the blood vessels may affect a number of organs but predominantly the lungs and the kidneys. Genetics Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1 (SERPINA1) is the gene that encodes the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin. SERPINA1 has been localized to chromosome 14q32. Over 75 mutations of the SERPINA1 gene have been identified, many with clinically significant effects. The most common cause of severe deficiency, PiZ, is a single base-pair substitution leading to a glutamic acid to lysine mutation at position 342 (dbSNP: rs28929474), while PiS is caused by a glutamic acid to valine mutation at position 264 (dbSNP: rs17580). Other rarer forms have been described (see OMIM).  Pathophysiology  Photomicrograph of a liver biopsy from a patient with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The PAS with diastase stain shows the diastase-resistant pink globules that are characteristic of this disease. A1AT is produced in the liver, and one of its functions is to protect the lungs from neutrophil elastase, an enzyme that can disrupt connective tissue. Normal blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin may vary with analytical method but are typically around 1.0-2.7 g/l. In individuals with PiSS, PiMZ and PiSZ genotypes, blood levels of A1AT are reduced to between 40 and 60% of normal levels; this is usually sufficient to protect the lungs from the effects of elastase in people who do not smoke. However, in individuals with the PiZZ genotype, A1AT levels are less than 15% of normal, and they are likely to develop panlobular emphysema at a young age. Between 10 and 15% of these people will develop liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, because the A1AT is not secreted properly and therefore accumulates in the liver. A liver biopsy in such cases will reveal PAS-positive, diastase- resistant granules. Unlike glycogen and other mucins which are diastase sensitive (i.e., diastase treatment disables PAS staining), A1AT deficient hepatocytes will stain with PAS even after diastase treatment - a state thus referred to as \\"diastase resistant\\". Cigarette smoke is especially harmful to individuals with A1AD. In addition to increasing the inflammatory reaction in the airways, cigarette smoke directly inactivates alpha-1 antitrypsin by oxidizing essential methionine residues to sulfoxide forms, decreasing the enzyme activity by a factor of 2,000.  Diagnosis  Emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Computed tomography of the lung showing emphysema and bullae in the lower lobes of a subject with type ZZ alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. There is also increased lung density in areas with compression of lung tissue by the bullae. A1AT deficiency remains undiagnosed in many patients. Patients are usually labeled as having COPD without an underlying cause. It is estimated that about 1% of all COPD patients actually have an A1AT deficiency. Testing is recommended in those with COPD, unexplained liver disease, unexplained bronchiectasis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis or necrotizing panniculitis. American guidelines recommend that all people with COPD are tested, whereas British guidelines recommend this only in people who develop COPD at a young age with a limited smoking history or with a family history. The initial test performed is serum A1AT level. A low level of A1AT confirms the diagnosis and further assessment with A1AT protein phenotyping and A1AT genotyping should be carried out subsequently. As protein electrophoresis does not completely distinguish between A1AT and other minor proteins at the alpha-1 position (agarose gel), antitrypsin can be more directly and specifically measured using a nephelometric or immunoturbidimetric method. Thus, protein electrophoresis is useful for screening and identifying individuals likely to have a deficiency. A1AT is further analyzed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a pH gradient. Normal A1AT is termed M, as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above. As every person has two copies of the A1AT gene, a heterozygote with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although a heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band. In blood test results, the IEF results are notated as, e.g., PiMM, where Pi stands for protease inhibitor and \\"MM\\" is the banding pattern of that person. Other detection methods include use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays in vitro and radial immunodiffusion. Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in the blood depend on the genotype. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the proteasome, whereas others have a tendency to polymerize, thereafter being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are: * PiMM: 100% (normal) * PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT * PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT * PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT * PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT * PiZZ: 10–15% (severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency)  Treatment  Treatment of lung disease may include bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and, when infections occur, antibiotics. Intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or in severe disease lung transplantation may also be recommended. In those with severe liver disease liver transplantation may be an option. Avoiding smoking and getting vaccinated for influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis is also recommended. People with lung disease due to A1AD may receive intravenous infusions of alpha-1 antitrypsin, derived from donated human plasma. This augmentation therapy is thought to arrest the course of the disease and halt any further damage to the lungs. Long-term studies of the effectiveness of A1AT replacement therapy are not available. It is currently recommended that patients begin augmentation therapy only after the onset of emphysema symptoms. As of 2015 there were four IV augmentation therapy manufacturers in the United States, Canada, and several European countries. IV therapies are the standard mode of augmentation therapy delivery. Researchers are exploring inhaled therapies. Augmentation therapy is not appropriate for people with liver disease. Treatment of A1AD-related liver damage focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the disease. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.  Epidemiology  Distribution of PiZZ in Europe People of Northern European and Iberian ancestry are at the highest risk for A1AD. Four percent of them carry the PiZ allele; between 1 in 625 and 1 in 2000 are homozygous. Another study detected a frequency of 1 in 1550 individuals and a gene frequency of 0.026. The highest prevalence of the PiZZ variant was recorded in the northern and western European countries with mean gene frequency of 0.0140. History A1AD was discovered in 1963 by Carl-Bertil Laurell (1919–2001), at the University of Lund in Sweden. Laurell, along with a medical resident, Sten Eriksson, made the discovery after noting the absence of the α1 band on protein electrophoresis in five of 1500 samples; three of the five patients were found to have developed emphysema at a young age. The link with liver disease was made six years later, when Harvey Sharp et al. described A1AD in the context of liver disease. Research Recombinant and inhaled forms of A1AT are being studied. Other experimental therapies are aimed at the prevention of polymer formation in the liver.

This list is a chronological progression of record times for the marathon. World records in the marathon are now ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the international governing body for the sport of athletics. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge set an official world record for men of 2:01:39 on September 16, 2018, at the 2018 Berlin Marathon. His run broke the previous world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds, the greatest improvement over a previous record since 1967. The IAAF recognizes two world records for women, a time of 2:14:04 set by Brigid Kosgei on October 13, 2019 during the Chicago Marathon which was contested by men and women together, and a \\"Women Only\\" record of 2:17:01, set by Mary Keitany, on April 23, 2017 at the London Marathon for women only. Criteria for record eligibility In order for a performance to be ratified as a world record by the IAAF, the marathon course on which the performance occurred must be long, measured in a defined manner using the calibrated bicycle method and meet other criteria that rule out artificially fast times produced on courses aided by downhill slope or tailwind. The criteria include: * \\"The start and finish points of a course, measured along a theoretical straight line between them, shall not be further apart than 50% of the race distance.\\" * \\"The decrease in elevation between the start and finish shall not exceed an average of one in a thousand, i.e. 1m per km.\\" In recognizing Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai's mark of 2:03:02 at the 2011 Boston Marathon as (at the time) \\"the fastest Marathon ever run\\", the IAAF said: \\"Due to the elevation drop and point-to-point measurements of the Boston course, performances [on that course] are not eligible for World record consideration.\\" Road racing events like the marathon were specifically excepted from IAAF rule 260 18(d) that rejected from consideration those track and field performances set in mixed competition. The Association of Road Racing Statisticians, an independent organization that compiles data from road running events, also maintains an alternate marathon world best progression but with standards they consider to be more stringent. Performances claiming world best or world record status on \\"point-to-point\\" courses such as the Boston Marathon have historically been rejected by USA Track & Field. Performances on these courses could be aided by slope or tailwinds. Women's world record The IAAF Congress at 2011 World Championships in Athletics passed a motion changing the record eligibility criteria effective October 6th 2007, so that women's world records must be set in all-women competitions. The result of the change was that Radcliffe's 2:17:42 performance at the 2005 London Marathon would supplant the existing women's mark as the \\"world record\\"; the earlier performance was to be referred to as a \\"world best\\". The decision was met with strong protest in Britain, and in November 2011 an IAAF council member reported that Radcliffe's original mark would be allowed to stand, with the eventual decision that both marks would be recognized as \\"world records,\\" the faster one as a \\"Mixed Gender\\" mark, the other as a \\"Women Only\\" mark. Unofficial record attempts In December 2016, Nike, Inc. announced that three top distance runners — Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese and Lelisa Desisa — had agreed to forgo the spring marathon season to work with the company in an effort to run a sub-two-hour marathon, though a detailed plan to complete the marathon in 1:59:59 or faster was not released. The Breaking2 event took place in the early morning of May 6, 2017; Kipchoge crossed the finish line with a time of 2:00:25. This time was more than two minutes faster than the world record. Among other factors, specialized pacers were used, entering the race midway to help Kipchoge keep up the pace.Eliud Kipchoge falls 26 seconds short of first sub two-hour marathon, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 7-May-2017 Kipchoge took part in a similar attempt to break the two-hour barrier in Vienna on October 12, 2019, as part of the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. He successfully ran the first sub two-hour marathon distance, with a time of 1:59:40.2. The effort did not count as a new world record under IAAF rules due to the setup of the challenge. Specifically, it was not an open event, Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team throughout, the run featured a pace car, and included rotating teams of other runners pacing Kipchoge in a formation designed to reduce wind resistance and maximize efficiency. The achievement was recognized by Guinness World Records with the titles ‘Fastest marathon distance (male)’ and ‘First marathon distance run under two hours’. History Marathon races were first held in 1896, but the distance was not standardized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) until 1921. The actual distance for pre-1921 races frequently varied slightly from the present figure of 42.195 km (26 miles 385 yards). In qualifying races for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Greek runners Charilaos Vasilakos (3:18:00) and Ioannis Lavrentis (3:11:27) won the first two modern marathons. On April 10, 1896, Spiridon Louis of Greece won the first Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece in a time of 2:58:50; however, the distance for the event was reported to be only 40,000 meters. Three months later, British runner Len Hurst won the inaugural Paris to Conflans Marathon (also around 40 km) in a time of 2:31:30. In 1900, Hurst would better his time on the same course with a 2:26:28 performance. Later, Shizo Kanakuri of Japan was reported to have set a world record of 2:32:45 in a November 1911 domestic qualification race for the 1912 Summer Olympics, but this performance was also run over a distance of approximately 40 km. The first marathon over the now official distance was won by American Johnny Hayes at the 1908 Summer Olympics, with a time of 2:55:18.4. It is possible that Stamata Revithi, who ran the 1896 Olympic course a day after Louis, is the first woman to run the modern marathon; she is said to have finished in 5½ hours. The IAAF credits Violet Piercy's 1926 performance as the first woman to race what is now the standard marathon distance; however, other sources report that the 1918 performance of Marie-Louise Ledru in the Tour de Paris set the initial mark for women.Fast Tracks: The History of Distance Running Since 884 B.C. by Raymond Krise, Bill Squires. (1982).Endurance by Albert C. Gross. (1986) Other \\"unofficial\\" performances have also been reported to be world bests or world records over time. Although her performance is not recognized by the IAAF, Adrienne Beames from Australia is frequently credited as the first woman to break the 3-hour barrier in the marathon. In the 1953 Boston Marathon, the top three male finishers were thought to have broken the standing world record, but Keizo Yamada's mark of 2:18:51 is now considered to have been set on a short course. The Boston Athletic Association does not report Yamada's performance as a world best.114th B.A.A Boston Marathon Official Program. April 19, 2010. On October 25, 1981, American Alberto Salazar and New Zealander Allison Roe set apparent world bests at the New York City Marathon (2:08:13 and 2:25:29); however, these marks were invalidated when the course was later found to have been nearly 150 meters short. Although the IAAF's progression notes three performances set on the same course in 1978, 1979, and 1980 by Norwegian Grete Waitz, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians considers the New York City course suspect for those performances, too. On April 18, 2011, the Boston Marathon produced what were at that time the two fastest marathon performances of all time. Winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya recorded a time of 2:03:02, followed by countryman Moses Mosop in 2:03:06. However, since the Boston course does not meet the criteria for record attempts, these times were not ratified by the IAAF. Eight world records have been set at the Polytechnic Marathon (1909, 1913, 1952–54, 1963–65). World records have been broken at all of the original five World Marathon Majors on numerous occasions; eight times at the Berlin Marathon, three times at the Boston Marathon, and four times each at the Chicago, London, and New York City Marathons. However, the records established in the Boston event have been disputed on grounds of a downhill point-to-point course, while three of the four New York records have been disputed on grounds of a short course.

It starts less than from Leeds city centre. Like much of Leeds, Armley grew in the Industrial Revolution and had several mills, one of which houses now the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills. Armley is predominantly and historically a largely working class area of the city, still retains many smaller industrial businesses, and has many rows of back-to-back terraced houses. It sits in the Armley ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds West parliamentary constituency. Etymology First attested in the Domesday Book as Ermelai, the name Armley comes from Old English. The second element is from Old English lēah ('open space in a wood'). The origin of the first element is less clear, but thought to come from an otherwise unattested Old English name Earma, a plausible nickname form of the name Earnmund. If so, the name originally meant 'Earma's woodland clearing'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017). Historically lying within the township of Armley, to the south of Armley's centre, the district of Green Side is first mentioned by this name in the nineteenth century. The origin of the name is not certain, but is probably named after the green space now constituted as Wortley Recreation Ground and Western Flatts Cliff park.  History  Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills St. Bartholomew's Church, Armley Armley is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book reference to \\"Ristone, Ermelai\\". At the time there were eight villagers in Ristone (now east Armley) and Ermelai (now west Armley).Parsons, Edward; \\"The Civil, Ecclesiastical, Literary, Commercial, and Miscellaneous History of Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Dewsbury, Otley, and the District Within Ten Miles of Leeds\\", Volume 1, pp. 184, 185, 187. Nabu Press. Retrieved 23 December 2011 The actual population is indeterminable as this only accounts for the 'head of household'.\\"Armley Local History\\", Yorkshire Evening Post, 4 February 2008. Retrieved 23 December 2011 Armley Mills, now the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills, was the world's largest woollen mill when it was built in 1788. In the 18th and 19th centuries Armley was, through its mills, a major contributor to the economy of the city of Leeds. Many of the buildings standing in and around Armley were built in the 1800s, including many of the churches, schools, shops and houses. Ledgard Way is named after the entrepreneur Samuel Ledgard. Armley also has picturesque views over the rest of Leeds from certain vantage points. William Tetley started his business of malters in Armley in the 1740s. His grandson Joshua Tetley founded Tetley's Brewery in Hunslet in 1822. Damage caused by a raid in the Leeds Blitz in March 1941 and later slum clearance schemes brought about the redevelopment of much of Armley in a programme beginning in the 1950s and finishing in the early 1970s. From the 1870s until 1956, Armley was home to the J W Roberts asbestos mattress and boiler lining factory. This facility exposed residents to asbestos fibres and resulted in a mesothelioma cancer cluster which persists to this day. One of the victims, June Hancock, launched a court action against Turner & Newall, the company that owned the J W Roberts' factory in 1993. Although the court case was successful, corporate restructuring had, as of 2005, avoided the case being settled. Hancock's story was the subject of a play, Dust, by Kenneth F. Yates, performed in Armley and at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in July 2009. The parish church, St Bartholomew's, is home to a notable pipe organ built by the German organ builder Edmund Schulze. Originally built for Meanwood Towers in 1866-69, it was opened by S. S. Wesley. It was moved to St Bartholomew's in 1879. Schulze's work, and this organ in particular, had enormous influence on the development of British organ building in the 19th century. Both church and organ have been restored. The smaller Christ Church is located at the end of Theaker Lane nearer the centre of Armley. Legend has it that a pedlar called Charlie used to rest and water his pony and trap in Whingate Park in the 19th century. He apparently sold spicy shortbread to the citizens of Upper Armley for 1d a piece. Today the triangular-shaped park is known as Charlie or Charley Cake Park. According to Armley Through the Camera, written in 1901, the park was \\"within memory of many present residents of Armley, a patch of wasteland. Some of them regularly played cricket on its turf\\".Kirkby, T (1901) Armley Through the Camera, p.20, Hanson & Oak, Theaker Lane, Leeds. There were two railway stations in Armley. Armley Moor railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Exchange closed 1966, and Armley Canal Road railway station on the line between Leeds and Shipley closed 1965. Geography Armley is located between the M621 motorway and the River Aire, stretching from roughly the New Wortley roundabout (the Armley Gyratory) to the start of the Stanningley By-pass and Cockshott Lane where it merges into Bramley.  Amenities  Armley Town Street includes high street names, charity shops and food and independent retailers. There are bus links to Leeds, Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield. Armley's Town Street has free off-road car parking, but parking is mainly on-street, with few car parks in the centre. Armley's only supermarket is a LIDL on Armley Road, but Aldi in neighbouring Wortley in a five minute walk from Town Street, Wortley also has an Asda and Bramley has Tesco, Aldi, Morrisons and Farmfoods. Towards Farnley there is a Sainsbury's. The former Kwiksave store in Pudsey is now a branch of Sainsbury's; a previous Somerfield store is now a Co-operative. The former Armley Sports and Leisure Centre Other amenities include Armley (Gott's) Park, Gott's Park Golf Club and Armley Mills Industrial Museum, and numerous former cinemas and churches. The old Methodist chapel is now a carpet outlet, like a similar chapel in Holbeck. There are present-day Methodist churches in Wesley Road, built in 1987, and in Whingate, built in 1884. The Wesley Road Chapel is a Local Ecumenical Partnership also involving the Baptist and United Reformed Churches.Wesley Road Chapel History , accessed 22 December 2015 The current church is the fourth on this site, where the original Methodist Wesleyan chapel stood and where John Wesley once preached. Armley's original leisure centre, based on the old Armley swimming baths, was demolished in 2009. The land is now a large car park for the new leisure centre. The closure of the original 25-metre swimming pool with redundant and unused space attracted some controversy because of the age and local architectural significance of the building. The new centre has state-of-the-art equipment. Morley and Beeston will also receive new leisure centres under a programme being run by Leeds City Council. HM Prison Leeds, formerly Armley Gaol is located in Armley. Housing A view of Western Armley Armley housing includes Victorian back-to-back houses, through terraces and tower blocks. There is much council housing, although most of the housing stock is privately built and dates from the 1960s. Back- to-back housing has been converted to through terraces. Corporation residential tower blocks, built to replace older housing stock at the centre of Armley, and neighbouring Wortley, are amongst the tallest in Leeds.

An equalizer is the solution set of an equation. In certain contexts, a difference kernel is the equalizer of exactly two functions.  Definitions  Let X and Y be sets. Let f and g be functions, both from X to Y. Then the equaliser of f and g is the set of elements x of X such that f(x) equals g(x) in Y. Symbolically: : \\\\operatorname{Eq}(f, g) := \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X \\\\mid f(x) = g(x)\\\\\\\\}. The equaliser may be denoted Eq(f, g) or a variation on that theme (such as with lowercase letters \\"eq\\"). In informal contexts, the notation {f = g} is common. The definition above used two functions f and g, but there is no need to restrict to only two functions, or even to only finitely many functions. In general, if F is a set of functions from X to Y, then the equalizer of the members of F is the set of elements x of X such that, given any two members f and g of F, f(x) equals g(x) in Y. Symbolically: : \\\\operatorname{Eq}(\\\\mathcal{F}) := \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X \\\\mid \\\\forall f,g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\; f(x) = g(x)\\\\\\\\}. This equaliser may be written as Eq(f, g, h, ...) if \\\\mathcal{F} is the set {f, g, h, ...}. In the latter case, one may also find {f = g = h = ···} in informal contexts. As a degenerate case of the general definition, let F be a singleton {f}. Since f(x) always equals itself, the equaliser must be the entire domain X. As an even more degenerate case, let F be the empty set. Then the equaliser is again the entire domain X, since the universal quantification in the definition is vacuously true.  Difference kernels  A binary equalizer (that is, an equalizer of just two functions) is also called a difference kernel. This may also be denoted DiffKer(f, g), Ker(f, g), or Ker(f − g). The last notation shows where this terminology comes from, and why it is most common in the context of abstract algebra: The difference kernel of f and g is simply the kernel of the difference f − g. Furthermore, the kernel of a single function f can be reconstructed as the difference kernel Eq(f, 0), where 0 is the constant function with value zero. Of course, all of this presumes an algebraic context where the kernel of a function is its preimage under zero; that is not true in all situations. However, the terminology \\"difference kernel\\" has no other meaning.  In category theory  Equalizers can be defined by a universal property, which allows the notion to be generalized from the category of sets to arbitrary categories. In the general context, X and Y are objects, while f and g are morphisms from X to Y. These objects and morphisms form a diagram in the category in question, and the equalizer is simply the limit of that diagram. In more explicit terms, the equalizer consists of an object E and a morphism eq : E → X satisfying f \\\\circ eq = g \\\\circ eq, and such that, given any object O and morphism m : O → X, if f \\\\circ m = g \\\\circ m, then there exists a unique morphism u : O → E such that eq \\\\circ u = m. 200px A morphism m:O \\\\rightarrow X is said to equalize f and g if f \\\\circ m = g \\\\circ m. In any universal algebraic category, including the categories where difference kernels are used, as well as the category of sets itself, the object E can always be taken to be the ordinary notion of equalizer, and the morphism eq can in that case be taken to be the inclusion function of E as a subset of X. The generalization of this to more than two morphisms is straightforward; simply use a larger diagram with more morphisms in it. The degenerate case of only one morphism is also straightforward; then eq can be any isomorphism from an object E to X. The correct diagram for the degenerate case with no morphisms is slightly subtle: one might initially draw the diagram as consisting of the objects X and Y and no morphisms. This is incorrect, however, since the limit of such a diagram is the product of X and Y, rather than the equalizer. (And indeed products and equalizers are different concepts: the set-theoretic definition of product doesn't agree with the set-theoretic definition of the equalizer mentioned above, hence they are actually different.) Instead, the appropriate insight is that every equalizer diagram is fundamentally concerned with X, including Y only because Y is the codomain of morphisms which appear in the diagram. With this view, we see that if there are no morphisms involved, Y does not make an appearance and the equalizer diagram consists of X alone. The limit of this diagram is then any isomorphism between E and X. It can be proved that any equalizer in any category is a monomorphism. If the converse holds in a given category, then that category is said to be regular (in the sense of monomorphisms). More generally, a regular monomorphism in any category is any morphism m that is an equalizer of some set of morphisms. Some authors require more strictly that m be a binary equalizer, that is an equalizer of exactly two morphisms. However, if the category in question is complete, then both definitions agree. The notion of difference kernel also makes sense in a category-theoretic context. The terminology \\"difference kernel\\" is common throughout category theory for any binary equalizer. In the case of a preadditive category (a category enriched over the category of Abelian groups), the term \\"difference kernel\\" may be interpreted literally, since subtraction of morphisms makes sense. That is, Eq(f, g) = Ker(f - g), where Ker denotes the category-theoretic kernel. Any category with fibre products (pullbacks) and products has equalizers.

Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes, such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression, or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output. In a medical setting, genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders, predict risks for specific conditions, or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives, such as a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) through DNA paternity testing, or be used to broadly predict an individual's ancestry. Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans (e.g. to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders), to gain information used for selective breeding, or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations. The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell. Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes (46 in humans) could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or monosomy X (Turner syndrome). In the 1970s, a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes, called chromosome banding, was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements. In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes (cytogenetics), genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes, parts of genes, or even single nucleotide \\"letters\\" of DNA sequence. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions, and one study estimated that as of 2017 there were more than 75,000 genetic tests on the market. Types Genetic testing is \\"the analysis of chromosomes (DNA), proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes, mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes for clinical purposes.\\" It can provide information about a person's genes and chromosomes throughout life. There are a number of types of testing available, including: *Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing - a non-invasive (for the fetus) test. It is performed on a sample of venous blood from the mother, and can provide information about the fetus early in pregnancy. it is the most sensitive and specific screening test for Down syndrome. *Newborn screening - used just after birth to identify genetic disorders that can be treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth and sent to the lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in children and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing children to be placed on special diets to avoid the effects of the disorder. *Diagnostic testing - used to diagnose or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing is used to confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed at any time during a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and the result could confirm the diagnosis of PKD. *Carrier testing - used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that, when present in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. This type of testing is offered to individuals who have a family history of a genetic disorder and to people in ethnic groups with an increased risk of specific genetic conditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition like cystic fibrosis. *Preimplantation genetic diagnosis - performed on human embryos prior to the implantation as part of an in vitro fertilization procedure. Pre-implantation testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs from the woman and sperm from the man are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus. *Prenatal diagnosis - used to detect changes in a fetus's genes or chromosomes before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother's amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling. *Predictive and presymptomatic testing - used to detect gene mutations associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful to people who have a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer.Average risks of breast and ovarian cancer as... Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. Li- Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a gene alteration on the gene TP53. Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person's risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis. *Pharmacogenomics - determines the influence of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics can examine an individual's genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people's genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual's response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing can be used for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine the best treatment option. Non- diagnostic testing includes: *Forensic testing - uses DNA sequences to identify an individual for legal purposes. Unlike the tests described above, forensic testing is not used to detect gene mutations associated with disease. This type of testing can identify crime or catastrophe victims, rule out or implicate a crime suspect, or establish biological relationships between people (for example, paternity). *Paternity testing - uses special DNA markers to identify the same or similar inheritance patterns between related individuals. Based on the fact that we all inherit half of our DNA from the father, and half from the mother, DNA scientists test individuals to find the match of DNA sequences at some highly differential markers to draw the conclusion of relatedness. *Genealogical DNA test - used to determine ancestry or ethnic heritage for genetic genealogy. * Research testing - includes finding unknown genes, learning how genes work and advancing understanding of genetic conditions. The results of testing done as part of a research study are usually not available to patients or their healthcare providers. Medical procedure Genetic testing is often done as part of a genetic consultation and as of mid-2008 there were more than 1,200 clinically applicable genetic tests available. Once a person decides to proceed with genetic testing, a medical geneticist, genetic counselor, primary care doctor, or specialist can order the test after obtaining informed consent. Genetic tests are performed on a sample of blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a medical procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or cotton swab to collect a sample of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. Alternatively, a small amount of saline mouthwash may be swished in the mouth to collect the cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorders, often using DNA sequencing. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor. Routine newborn screening tests are done on a small blood sample obtained by pricking the baby's heel with a lancet. Risks and limitations The physical risks associated with most genetic tests are very small, particularly for those tests that require only a blood sample or buccal smear (a procedure that samples cells from the inside surface of the cheek). The procedures used for prenatal testing carry a small but non- negligible risk of losing the pregnancy (miscarriage) because they require a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from around the fetus. Many of the risks associated with genetic testing involve the emotional, social, or financial consequences of the test results. People may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty about their results. The potential negative impact of genetic testing has led to an increasing recognition of a \\"right not to know\\". In some cases, genetic testing creates tension within a family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested. The possibility of genetic discrimination in employment or insurance is also a concern. Some individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear it will affect their ability to purchase insurance or find a job.Amy Harmon, \\"Insurance Fears Lead Many to Shun DNA Tests,\\" The New York Times, February 24, 2008 Health insurers do not currently require applicants for coverage to undergo genetic testing, and when insurers encounter genetic information, it is subject to the same confidentiality protections as any other sensitive health information.\\"Genetic Information and Medical Expense Insurance\\", American Academy of Actuaries, June 2000 In the United States, the use of genetic information is governed by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) (see discussion below in the section on government regulation). Genetic testing can provide only limited information about an inherited condition. The test often can't determine if a person will show symptoms of a disorder, how severe the symptoms will be, or whether the disorder will progress over time. Another major limitation is the lack of treatment strategies for many genetic disorders once they are diagnosed. Another limitation to genetic testing for a hereditary linked cancer, is the variants of unknown clinical significance. Because the human genome has over 22,000 genes, there are 3.5 million variants in the average person's genome. These variants of unknown clinical significance means there is a change in the DNA sequence, however the increase for cancer is unclear because it is unknown if the change affects the gene's function. A genetics professional can explain in detail the benefits, risks, and limitations of a particular test. It is important that any person who is considering genetic testing understand and weigh these factors before making a decision. Other risks include incidental findings—a discovery of some possible problem found while looking for something else. In 2013 the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) that certain genes always be included any time a genomic sequencing was done, and that labs should report the results. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing (also called at-home genetic testing) is a type of genetic test that is accessible directly to the consumer without having to go through a health care professional. Usually, to obtain a genetic test, health care professionals such as physicians, nurse practitioners, or genetic counselors acquire their patient's permission and then order the desired test, which may or may not be covered by health insurance. DTC genetic tests, however, allow consumers to bypass this process and purchase DNA tests themselves. DTC genetic testing can entail primarily genealogical/ancestry-related information, health and trait-related information, or both. There is a variety of DTC tests, ranging from tests for breast cancer alleles to mutations linked to cystic fibrosis. Possible benefits of DTC testing are the accessibility of tests to consumers, promotion of proactive healthcare, and the privacy of genetic information. Possible additional risks of DTC testing are the lack of governmental regulation, the potential misinterpretation of genetic information, issues related to testing minors, privacy of data, and downstream expenses for the public health care system. In the United States, most DTC genetic test kits are not reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the exception of a few tests offered by the company 23andMe. As of 2019, the tests that have received marketing authorization by the FDA include 23andMe's genetic health risk reports for select variants of BRCA1/BRCA2, pharmacogenetic reports that test for selected variants associated with metabolism of certain pharmaceutical compounds, a carrier screening test for Bloom syndrome, and genetic health risk reports for a handful of other medical conditions, such as celiac disease and late-onset Alzheimer's. Controversy DTC genetic testing has been controversial due to outspoken opposition within the medical community. Critics of DTC testing argue against the risks involved, the unregulated advertising and marketing claims, the potential reselling of genetic data to third parties, and the overall lack of governmental oversight. DTC testing involves many of the same risks associated with any genetic test. One of the more obvious and dangerous of these is the possibility of misreading of test results. Without professional guidance, consumers can potentially misinterpret genetic information, causing them to be deluded about their personal health. Some advertising for DTC genetic testing has been criticized as conveying an exaggerated and inaccurate message about the connection between genetic information and disease risk, utilizing emotions as a selling factor. An advertisement for a BRCA-predictive genetic test for breast cancer stated: “There is no stronger antidote for fear than information.”Gollust et al., \\"Limitations of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising for Clinical Genetic Testing,\\" JAMA.2002; 288: 1762-1767 Apart from rare diseases that are directly caused by specific, single-gene mutation, diseases \\"have complicated, multiple genetic links that interact strongly with personal environment, lifestyle, and behavior.\\" Ancestry.com, a company providing DTC DNA tests for genealogy purposes, has reportedly allowed the warrantless search of their database by police investigating a murder.Ronald Bailey, \\" Ancestry.com Hands Over Client DNA Test Results to Cops Without a Warrant\\" Reason.com The warrantless search led to a search warrant to force the gathering of a DNA sample from a New Orleans filmmaker; however he turned out not to be a match for the suspected killer. Governmental genetic testing In Estonia As part of its healthcare system, Estonia is offering all of its residents genome-wide genotyping. This will be translated into personalized reports for use in everyday medical practice via the national e-health portal. Estonia offering 100,000 residents free genetic testing The aim is to minimise health problems by warning participants most at risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It is also hoped that participants who are given early warnings will adopt healthier lifestyles or take preventative drugs.Estonia launches genetic-testing program for 8% of its population Government regulation In the United States With regard to genetic testing and information in general, legislation in the United States called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also bars employers from using individuals’ genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.Statement of Administration policy, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, 27 April 2007 The legislation, the first of its kind in the United States,Kennedy in support of genetic information nondiscrimination bill, Abril 24, 2008. Last access: 28/05/2008. was passed by the United States Senate on April 24, 2008, on a vote of 95–0, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 21, 2008.\\"Administration News  President Bush Signs Genetic Nondiscrimination Legislation Into Law,\\" Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, Kaiser Family Foundation, May 22, 2008 It went into effect on November 21, 2009. In June 2013 the US Supreme Court issued two rulings on human genetics. The Court struck down patents on human genes, opening up competition in the field of genetic testing. The Supreme Court also ruled that police were allowed to collect DNA from people arrested for serious offenses. In popular culture Some possible future ethical problems of genetic testing were considered in the science fiction film Gattaca, the novel Next, and the science fiction anime series \\"Gundam Seed\\". Also, some films which include the topic of genetic testing include The Island, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, and the Resident Evil series. Ethics Pediatric genetic testing The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) have provided new guidelines for the ethical issue of pediatrics genetic testing and screening of children in the United States. Their guidelines state that performing pediatric genetic testing should be in the best interest of the child. In hypothetical situations for adults getting genetically tested 84-98% expressing interest in getting genetically tested for cancer predisposition. Though only half who are at risk of would get tested. AAP and ACMG recommend holding off on genetic testing for late-onset conditions until adulthood. Unless diagnosing genetic disorders during childhood and start early intervention can reduce morbidity or mortality. They also state that with parents or guardians permission testing for asymptomatic children who are at risk of childhood onset conditions are ideal reasons for pediatrics genetic testing. Testing for pharmacogenetics and newborn screening is found to be acceptable by AAP and ACMG guidelines. Histocompatibility testing guideline states that it's permissible for children of all ages to have tissue compatibility testing for immediate family members but only after the psychosocial, emotional and physical implications has been explored. With a donor advocate or similar mechanism should be in place to protect the minors from coercion and to safeguard the interest of said minor. Both AAP and ACMG discourage the use of direct-to-consumer and home kit genetic because of the accuracy, interpretation and oversight of test content. Guidelines also state that if parents or guardians should be encouraged to inform their child of the results from the genetic test if the minor is of appropriate age. If minor is of mature appropriate age and request results, the request should be honored. Though for ethical and legal reasons health care providers should be cautions in providing minors with predictive genetic testing without the involvement of parents or guardians. Within the guidelines AAP and ACMG state that health care provider have an obligation to inform parents or guardians on the implication of test results. To encourage patients and families to share information and even offer help in explain results to extend family or refer them to genetic counseling. AAP and ACMG state any type of predictive genetic testing for all types is best offer with genetic counseling being offer by Clinical genetics, genetic counselors or health care providers. Israel Israel uses DNA testing to determine if people are eligible for immigration. The policy where \\"many Jews from the Former Soviet Union (‘FSU’) are asked to provide DNA confirmation of their Jewish heritage in the form of paternity tests in order to immigrate as Jews and become citizens under Israel's Law of Return\\" has generated controversy.Jerusalem Post:'Who is a Jew?' can now be answered by genetic testingJerusalem Post: Should Jewishness be determined by a genetic test?Is It Possible to Make Aliyah to Israel on the Basis of a DNA Test? Costs The cost of genetic testing can range from under $100 to more than $2,000. This depends on the complexity of the test. The cost will increase if more than one test is necessary or if multiple family members are getting tested to obtain additional results. Costs can vary by state and some states cover part of the total cost. From the date that a sample is taken, results may take weeks to months, depending upon the complexity and extent of the tests being performed. Results for prenatal testing are usually available more quickly because time is an important consideration in making decisions about a pregnancy. Prior to the testing, the doctor or genetic counselor who is requesting a particular test can provide specific information about the cost and time frame associated with that test.

All services are built on GPL’d libraries, including firetalk, libfaim, libicq2000, libmsn, XMPP, and libyahoo2. Fire supports OS X v10.1 and higher. The latest version of Fire is 1.5.6. The program is released under the GNU General Public License. On 2007-02-23, it was announced that there would be no future versions of Fire released. The official Fire website stated there were several reasons, the biggest being the loss of developers, followed by the fact that most of the libraries used by Fire are no longer in active development. Two of Fire's developers joined the Adium team and wrote a transition path for users to move from Fire to Adium. The announcement recommended Adium for future IM needs.https://sourceforge.net/p/fire/mailman/message/10848647/  History  In the early beta days of Mac OS X, Eric Peyton wanted to have an IM client which would run on this new OS. However, all of the official client vendors had not yet supported Mac OS X, so Peyton started expanding on an OPENSTEP project he had been working on, which used an open source library to connect with AIM servers. He started porting this using the new Cocoa libraries on Mac OS X and a new IM client began to take shape. Development in the early days was fast and furious and Fire was touted by Apple as one of the keystone applications on Mac OS X v10.0. Initially Peyton hosted the application and did all the development on his own equipment. He then formed the corporation \\"Epicware\\" to protect himself from the lawyers of the huge corporations he was interacting with. The application was expanded to include the ability to talk to multiple servers. First Yahoo! and ICQ were added, followed later by IRC, Microsoft, and XMPP. Most recently, support for Bonjour was added. Because service providers at this time used proprietary protocols to facilitate vendor lock in, Fire would often stop working with one or another major service until the application or one of its component libraries was updated. In 2001, Colter Reed started contributing to the development of Fire on a regular basis and became the second major developer of Fire. They collaborated for a while using the Epicware hardware and finally decided to move the project to SourceForge to take advantage of the free hosting, download, and mirror services available there. Version 0.28.a was the first release which used the SourceForge System. From 2003-2007, primary development of the Fire application was transferred to Graham Booker and Alan Humpherys with many others participating in development and localization of the product. On 2007-02-23, development of Fire officially ended as the Fire developers joined forces with the Adium development team to focus on a single IM application supporting Mac OS X.

Bunker, a main character of the series, is a World War II veteran, blue-collar worker, and family man. All in the Family premiered on January 12, 1971, where he was depicted as the head of the Bunker family. In 1979, the show was retooled and renamed Archie Bunker's Place; it finally went off the air in 1983. Bunker lived at the fictional address of 704 Hauser Street in the borough of Queens, in New York City. All in the Family got many of its laughs by playing on Archie's bigotry, although the dynamic tension between Archie and his liberal son-in-law, Mike, provided an ongoing political and social sounding board for a variety of topics. Archie appears in all but seven episodes of the series. Three fifth season episodes were missed because of a contract dispute between O'Connor and series creator Norman Lear. Archie was modeled after Norman Lear's father Herman Lear and on Alf Garnett from the BBC1 sitcom Till Death Us Do Part. In 1999, TV Guide ranked Archie Bunker number5 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2005, Archie Bunker was listed as number1 on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters, defeating runners-up such as Ralph Kramden, Lucy Ricardo, Fonzie, and Homer Simpson. Archie's chair is in the permanent collection of the National Museum of American History. Character traits Archie has a gruff, overbearing demeanor, largely defined by his bigotry towards a diverse group of individuals: blacks, Hispanics, \\"Commies\\", gays, hippies, Jews, Asians, Catholics, \\"women's libbers\\", and Polish–Americans are frequent targets of his barbs. As the show progresses, it becomes apparent that Archie's prejudice is not motivated by malice, but is rather a combination of the era and environment in which he was raised and a generalized misanthropy. Archie himself is depicted as a striver, loving father, and basically decent man; nevertheless, he is ill-tempered and frequently tells his long-suffering wife Edith to \\"stifle yourself\\" and \\"dummy up\\". Series creator Norman Lear admitted this is how his father treated Lear's mother. Archie \\"turned the angry white male into a cultural icon\\", according to CBS News.Farewell Archie. CBS News. After the end of the second season taping, the actor Carroll O'Connor, who played Archie Bunker, said, paraphrasing James Baldwin, \\"The American white man is trapped by his own cultural history. He doesn't know what to do about it.\\" O'Connor goes on to say: > Archie's dilemma is coping with a world that is changing in front of him. He > doesn't know what to do, except to lose his temper, mouth his poisons, look > elsewhere to fix the blame for his own discomfort. He isn't a totally evil > man. He's shrewd. But he won't get to the root of his problem, because the > root of his problem is himself, and he doesn't know it. That is the dilemma > of Archie Bunker. As the series progressed, Archie mellowed somewhat, albeit often out of necessity. In one episode, he expresses revulsion for a Ku Klux Klan-like organization which he accidentally joins.\\"Archie and the KKK\\", Parts I and II On another occasion, when asked to speak at the funeral of his friend Stretch Cunningham, Archie—surprised to learn that his friend was Jewish—overcomes his initial discomfort and delivers a moving eulogy, wearing a yarmulke, and closing with a heartfelt \\"shalom\\". In 1978, the character became the guardian of Edith's stepcousin Floyd's nine-year-old daughter, Stephanie (Danielle Brisebois) and came to accept her Jewish faith, even buying her a Star of David pendant.Episode 197 Archie was also known for his frequent malapropisms and spoonerisms. For example, he refers to Edith's gynecologist as a \\"groinacologist\\" and to Catholic priests who go around sprinkling \\"incest\\" (incense) on their congregation, whereas he referred to incest itself as \\"committing 'insects' in the family\\". Archie repeatedly called President Richard M. Nixon \\"Richard E. Nixon\\". By the show's second season, these had become dubbed \\"Bunkerisms\\", \\"Archie Bunkerisms\\", or simply \\"Archie- isms\\".Archie-bunker  Define Archie-bunker at Dictionary.com The actor who played Bunker, Carroll O'Connor, was Irish Catholic, and Norman Lear modeled the character on his Jewish father, but Bunker's own ethnicity is never explicitly stated, other than identifying him as a WASP; over the course of the series, he mocks or belittles not just most minorities (including blacks, Hispanics, Latinos, and Asians), but also most white ethnic groups as well, including the English, French, Germans, Jews, Irish, and Polish. Archie, a Christian belonging to the Episcopal denomination, often misquotes the Bible. He takes pride in being religious, although he rarely attends church services and constantly mispronounces the name of his minister, Reverend Felcher, as \\"Reverend Fletcher\\". (When Edith inevitably corrects him, he dismisses the error with \\"Whatever\\".) He is a compulsive gambler, who, in earlier years, frequently lost his entire weekly paycheck in poker games, as related by Edith in the Season4 episode \\"Archie the Gambler\\"; he quit only when Edith threatened to leave him, taking then three-year old Gloria with her. Lear based the Archie Bunker character on his own father, Herman Lear, as well as Alf Garnett, the character from the BBC1 sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, on which All in the Family was based. Character biography When first introduced on All in the Family in 1971, Archie is the head of a family consisting of his wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), his adult daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and his liberal son-in-law, college student Michael \\"Mike\\" Stivic (Rob Reiner), with whom Archie disagrees on virtually everything; Archie frequently characterizes Mike as a \\"dumb Polack\\" and usually addresses him as \\"Meathead\\" because, in Archie's words, he is \\"dead from the neck up\\". During the show's first five seasons, Mike and Gloria live with Archie and Edith so Mike can put himself through college. Upon Mike's graduation, he and Gloria move into their own home next door, allowing Archie and Mike to interact nearly as much as they had when they were living in the same house. Archie was born in Queenshttps://lsa.umich.edu/history/reverbeffect/episode7.html on May 18th, 1924,In the episode \\"Archie & the Miracle\\", Archie explains to Mike that he believes he has the winning church raffle ticket #18 because \\"the Lord saved me on the 18th; I was born on the 18th of the month\\". In episode 106, \\"Archie and the Quiz\\", there is a direct reference to the fact that Archie was born in 1924. to parents David and Sarah.Stated in season one, episode one, \\"Meet the Bunkers\\" He is a Taurus.Last original airing of Archie Bunker's Place Information on his siblings is inconsistent, because three of them are mentioned, and Archie is seen talking on the phone to his younger brother Fred in \\"Cousin Oscar\\" (as well as Fred's daughter Debbie Marie), but during season 6episode \\"Archie Finds a Friend\\", he states that he is an only child. Two later episodes (one during season8 and another during season 9) feature Fred (played by Richard McKenzie) and it is now suggested that Fred is Archie's only sibling. Another of Fred's daughters, Linda, visited Archie during the third season (she briefly dated the Bunkers' neighbor Lionel in \\"Lionel Steps Out\\"). Archie's father David is said to be an only child while his mother Sarah has one brother named Roy Longstreet whom Archie liked more than his own parents. Two of Archie's cousins are depicted: Oscar, who dies off-camera in the Bunker house during a visit, and cousin Bertha (played by Peggy Rea, who appears in the same episode), apparently a somewhat distant cousin, because Archie does not recognize her. Archie celebrates his 50th birthday in a 1974 episode and the character is last seen on the final episode of Archie Bunker's Place, titled \\"I'm Torn Here\\", on April 4, 1983. In season 5, during a three- episode stretch where Archie's whereabouts are unknown, it is revealed that he attended Flushing High School and lettered in baseball. While locked in the storeroom of Archie's bar (Archie's Place) with Mike in the season8 All in the Family episode \\"Two's a Crowd\\", a drunk Archie confides that as a child, his family was desperately poor, and he was teased in school because he wore a shoe on one foot and a boot on the other, so kids nicknamed him \\"Shoe-booty\\". In the same episode, Mike learns that Archie was mentally and physically abused by his father, who was also the source of his bigoted views. Yet, Archie then goes on to vehemently defend his father, who he claims loved him and taught him \\"to do good\\". It is revealed that Archie's father was a brakeman for the Long Island Rail Road, when Archie receives his father's pocket watch from his formerly long-estranged brother, Alfred (\\"Fred\\"), who later appeared in two All in the Family episodes, \\"Archie's Brother\\" and \\"The Return of Archie's Brother\\", and the Archie Bunker's Place episode \\"Father Christmas\\". When Fred visits Archie in the \\"Archie's Brother\\" episode, it is revealed that they had not seen each other in the 29 years since Archie and Edith's wedding, although they apparently had communicated over the years via phone (two early episodes, \\"Cousin Oscar\\" and \\"Lionel Steps Out\\", depict phone conversations between Archie and Fred). Their long estrangement was fueled by the fact that Fred refused to attend their father's funeral, with Fred even describing him as \\"nuts about everything.\\" In \\"The Return of Archie's Brother,\\" the two seem to have reconciled, with Fred offering to invest $5,000 to put Archie's bar in a national syndicate. However, in Fred's return trip to visit Archie and Edith, he arrives with a beautiful 18-year-old wife named Katherine. This leads to a heated discussion, which erupts into an argument between Archie and Fred over \\"May–September romances\\", with Archie even asking if the \\"truant officer\\" married them, and places another strain on the relationship between Archie and Fred, who storms angrily out of the Bunker home with his teen bride after Archie vehemently snubs his brother's offer to go into business with him. Archie and Fred apparently are estranged for the next three-plus years. Putting a further strain on the relationship was the 1981 arrival of Fred's 18-year-old daughter, Barbara (\\"Billie\\") Denise Miller, who is also upset over her father's marriage to someone not even three years older than she is (although in Archie Bunker's Place, Billie begins dating someone 15 years her senior). Fred visits again for Christmas in 1982, finally revealing to everyone why he left his first wife and found love with Katherine. Archie is a World War II veteran who had been based in Foggia, Italy, for 22 months. During a doctor's appointment it is stated that Archie had an undistinguished military record for his non-combat ground role in the motor pool of the Air Corps, later called the Army Air Forces, which at the time was a branch of the United States Army. He received a Good Conduct Medal\\"Archie and the FBI\\" and, in the All in the Family episode \\"Archie's Civil Rights\\", it is disclosed he also received a Purple Heart for being hit in his buttocks by shrapnel. Archie married Edith Bunker 22 years before season 1. Later recollections of their mid-1940s courtship do not result in a consistent timeline. On the flashback episode showing Mike and Gloria's wedding, Archie tells Mike his courtship of Edith lasted two years and hints that their relationship was not consummated until a month after their wedding night. Edith elsewhere recollects that Archie fell asleep on their wedding night and reveals that their sex life has not been very active in recent years. On another occasion, Edith discusses Archie's history of gambling addiction, which caused problems in the early years of their marriage. Archie also reveals that when Edith was in labor with Gloria, he took her to Bayside Hospital on the Q5 bus because \\"the subway don't run to Bayside\\". According to Edith, Archie's resentment of Mike stems primarily from Mike's attending college while Archie had been forced to drop out of high school, to help support his family during the Great Depression. Archie does not take advantage of the G.I. Bill, although he does attend night school to earn his diploma in 1973. Archie is also revealed to have been an outstanding baseball player in his youth. His dream was to pitch for the New York Yankees but he had to leave high school to enter the workforce. His uncle got him a job on a loading dock after World War II, and by the 1970s he was a foreman. Although he is a Protestant, Archie seldom attends church, despite professing strong Christian views. The original pilot mentions that in the 22 years Archie and Edith were married, Archie had attended church only seven times (including their wedding day) and that Archie had walked out of the sermon the most recent time, disgusted with the preacher's message (which he perceived as leftist). Archie's religiosity often translates into \\"knee-jerk\\" opposition to atheism or agnosticism (which Mike and Gloria variously espouse), Catholicism, and Judaism; by the time of Archie Bunker's Place, Archie's antisemitism has mostly disappeared in part due to being increasingly associated with Jews such as his adopted daughter Stephanie and business partner Murray Klein. Archie is a Republican and an outspoken supporter of Richard Nixon, as well as an early (1976) supporter of Ronald Reagan; he correctly predicts Reagan's election in 1980. During the Vietnam War, Archie dismisses peace protesters as unpatriotic and has little good to say about the civil rights movement. Despite having an adversarial relationship with his black neighbors, the Jeffersons, he forms an unlikely friendship with their son Lionel, who performs various odd jobs for the Bunkers and responds to Archie's patronizing racial views with sarcastic quips that usually go over Archie's head. The later spinoff series 704 Hauser features a new, black family moving into Bunker's old home. The series is set in 1994 but does not indicate whether Bunker, who would have been 70 by this time, is still alive. His now-adult grandson, Joey Stivic, appears briefly in the first episode of the series and references his grandfather, but doesn't state whether he's still alive at this point. Viewer reactions Such was the name recognition and societal influence of the Bunker character that by 1972, commentators were discussing the \\"Archie Bunker vote\\" (i.e., the voting bloc comprising urban, white, working-class men) in that year's presidential election. In the same year, there was a parody election campaign, complete with T-shirts, campaign buttons, and bumper stickers, advocating \\"Archie Bunker for President\\".The Archie Bunker strategy?  Philadelphia Daily News  13 March 2008 In May 1973, RCA Records' trade advertisement for Archie and Edith's debut single, a recording of \\"Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?\\", carried the tagline \\"John and Yoko, move over\\", referring to the artist-activists John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The character's imprint on American culture is such that Archie Bunker's name was still being used in the media to describe a certain group of voters who voted in the 2008 United States presidential election. Commentating on BBC Newsnight, political commentator Conrad Black referred to Donald Trump as having secured the \\"Archie Bunker vote\\" during the 2016 United States presidential election. Norman Lear originally intended that Bunker be strongly disliked by audiences. Lear was shocked when Bunker quietly became a beloved figure to much of middle America. Lear thought Bunker's opinions on race, sex, marriage, and religion were so wrong as to represent a parody of right-wing bigotry. Sammy Davis Jr., who was both black and Jewish, genuinely liked the character. He felt Bunker's bigotry was based on his rough, working- class life experiences and that Bunker was honest and forthright in his opinions, showing an openness to changing his views if an individual treated him right. In 1972, Davis appeared in episode 21 of season2 of All in the Family, and later appeared in episode 19 of season1 of spin-off Archie Bunker's Place. Bunker's perceived racist and misogynistic views were the template for the creation of Eric Cartman, one of the characters in the adult animated sitcom South Park.

It comes from the 15th century Latin \\"militare\\" meaning \\"to serve as a soldier\\". The related modern concept of the militia as a defensive organization against invaders grew out of the Anglo-Saxon fyrd. In times of crisis, the militiaman left his civilian duties and became a soldier the emergency was over, when he returned to his civilian occupation. The current meaning of militant does not usually refer to a registered soldier: it can be anyone who subscribes to the idea of using vigorous, sometimes extreme, activity to achieve an objective, usually political. A \\"militant [political] activist\\" would be expected to be more confrontational and aggressive than an activist not described as militant. Militance may or may not include physical violence, armed combat, terrorism, and the like. The Trotskyist Militant group in the United Kingdom published a newspaper, was active in labour disputes, moved resolutions in political meetings, but was not based on violence. The purpose of the Christian Church Militant is to struggle against sin, the devil and \\". . . the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\\" (Ephesians 6:12), but it is not a violent movement. As adjective Militant can mean \\"vigorously active and aggressive, especially in support of a cause\\" as in 'militant reformers'. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, defines militant as \\"Having a combative character; aggressive, especially in the service of a cause\\". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines militant as \\"aggressively active (as in a cause)\\". It says that the word militant might typically be used in phrases such as 'militant conservationists' or 'a militant attitude'. An example of the adjective usages is demonstrated when The New York Times ran an article titled Militant Environmentalists Planning Summer Protests to Save Redwoods describing a group that believes in \\"confrontational demonstrations\\" and \\"nonviolent tactics\\" to get across their message of preserving the environment. Another usage example includes 'a militant political activist', drawing attention to behaviours typical of those engaged in intensive political activism. The political protests headed by the Reverend Al Sharpton have been described as militant in nature in The Washington Post.The Washington Post, by Howard Kurtz, 30 March 1990. The word \\"militant\\" is sometimes used to describe groups that do not name or describe themselves as militants, but that advocate extreme violence. In the early 21st Century, members of groups involved in Islamic terrorism such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS are usually described as militants.BBC: Nigeria blast blamed on Islamic militant group Boko Haram. Example of use of \\"militant\\" to describe a group suspected of carrying out a suicide bombing(Boko Haram) As noun A militant, as a noun, is a person who uses militant methods in pursuit of an objective;Macmillan dictionary definition of militant as noun the term is not associated with the military. In general usage, a militant person is a confrontational person who does not necessarily use violence. Militant can refer to individuals or groups displaying aggressive behavior or attitudes. Militant is sometimes used as a euphemism for terrorist or armed insurgent. (For more on this, see mass media usage below.) Militant is often used within some religious circles to denote the continuous battle of Christians (as church members) or the Christian Church in their struggle against sin. In particular, the Roman Catholic Church differentiates between Church militant and church triumphant. Ellen G. White, one of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist church, says \\"Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry.\\" Such religious meaning must not be confused with the word 'belligerent' used to describe extremist religious behaviours found in some who, based on their extreme religious beliefs or ideologies, take up weapons and become involved in warfare, or who commit acts of violence or terrorism in an attempt to advance their extremist religious agendas. Such extremist groups can be Christian, Muslims, Jewish, or of any other religious affiliation. Mass media usage Newspapers, magazines, and other information sources may deem militant a neutral term,Juergensmeyer, Mark. Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Comparative studies in religion and society, 13. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003.

Page 238. conventionally indicates disapproval of the behavior of the individual or organization so labeled, regardless of the motivations for such behavior. Militant, at other times, can refer to anyone not a member of formal armed forces engaging in warfare or serving as a combatant. The mass media sometimes uses the term \\"militant\\" in the context of terrorism. Journalists sometimes apply the term militant to paramilitary movements using terrorism as a tactic.

Legal inferences Those resisting a foreign military occupation can be seen as not meriting the label terrorists because their acts of political violence against military targets of a foreign occupier do not violate international law. Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions gives lawful combatant status to those engaging in armed conflicts against alien (or foreign) occupation, colonial domination and racist régimes. Non-uniformed guerrillas also gain combatant status if they carry arms openly during military operations. Protocol 1 does not legitimize attacks on civilians by militants who fall into these categories. In the UN General Assembly Resolution on terrorism (42/159, 7 December 1987). which condemns international terrorism and outlines measures to combat the crime, with one proviso: \\"that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Charter of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly deprived of that right [...], particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation or other forms of colonial domination, nor...the right of these peoples to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law].\\" Span of militancy Militants occur across the political spectrum, including racial or religious supremacists, separatists, abortion opponents and proponents, and environmentalists. Examples of left-wing, right-wing, and advocacy group militants include militant reformers, militant feminists, militant animal rights advocates, and militant anarchists. The phrase militant Islam can suggest violent and aggressive political activity by Islamic individuals, groups, movements, or governments. Various secret societies that have been known to be militarists are known as militant. Using the president’s authority to assassinate people worldwide who pose an \\"imminent threat\\" if \\"capture is not feasible\\", the Obama administration routinely called every victim of extrajudicial killing a militant. Organizations Among organisations that describe themselves as militants, the Ulster Young Militants are an example of a group resorting to violence (intimidation, arson, and murder) as a deliberate tactic. Militant research Militant research is defined as a type of research that is distinct from academia while also not synonymous with the political militant. It refuses the alienating practices of academia which separate researchers from the political meaning of their activity. In recent years it has become an increasingly popular approach for doing research especially since it attempt to resolve academic concerns related to representation and auto-critique.

The Flumpet was invented for Art Farmer by David Monette and is currently in production by Monette. The Flumpet is in the key of B♭. Design The Flumpet was designed in 1989 and borrows the three piston valve design of both the trumpet and flugelhorn and shares the same instrument length of a trumpet. The curves on the end of the Flumpet have a resemblance to shepherd's crooks. The mouthpiece is deeply conical which tapers slightly, as opposed to the trumpet mouthpiece which has an extreme taper to create a bowl shape. The sound of the Flumpet is described as thicker and richer than a flugelhorn and more mellow and rounded than that of a trumpet. During its creation, metal-worker David Monette wanted to produce an instrument that broke design barriers but ultimately maintained its usefulness. The Flumpet has been described as \\"capable of both warmth and sharp attack\\", taking advantage of the softer sound produced by the flugelhorn, advantageous in smaller and more intimate venues, whilst still being capable of producing the more familiar harder tones of a trumpet. The tone has been described as having \\"characteristics of a flugelhorn, but not nearly as brittle. It has the response of a cornet, but again the sound quality is broader and more resonant.\\" Notable players Art Farmer’s decorated Flumpet * Art Farmer * Charles Schlueter * Scotty Barnhart * Vince Jones Recordings and performances Made popular by the works of Art Farmer and The Art Farmer Septet, the Flumpet can be heard on his record Silk Road. At a 1997 performance by Boston Symphony Orchestra, Charles Schlueter played the Flumpet in place of the post-horn solo of Mahler's Symphony No. 3. Farmer also used the instrument on Haydn's trumpet concerto. Film composer and musician Mark Isham played Flumpet on the soundtrack for the 1997 film Afterglow.

Mobley was described by Leonard Feather as the \\"middleweight champion of the tenor saxophone\\", a metaphor used to describe his tone, that was neither as aggressive as John Coltrane nor as mellow as Stan Getz, and his style that was laid-back, subtle and melodic, especially in contrast with players like Sonny Rollins and Coltrane. The critic Stacia Proefrock claimed he is \\"one of the most underrated musicians of the bop era.\\" Biography  Early life and education Mobley was born in Eastman, Georgia, but was raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, near Newark.Steve Huey, \\"Artist Biography\\", AllMusic. When he was 16, an illness kept him in the house for several months. His grandmother thought of buying a saxophone to help him occupy his time, and it was then that Mobley began to play. He tried to enter a music school in Newark, but could not, since he was not a resident, so he instead studied music through books at home.  Career  At 19, he started to play with local bands and, months later, worked for the first time with musicians like Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach. He took part in one of the earliest hard bop sessions, alongside Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Doug Watkins and trumpeter Kenny Dorham. The results of these sessions were released as Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers. When The Jazz Messengers split in 1956, Mobley continued on with pianist Silver for a short time, although he did work again with Blakey some years later, when the drummer appeared on Mobley's albums in the early 1960s. In 1956, Mobley recorded the album Mobley's Message with Jackie McLean and Donald Byrd. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5. During the 1960s, he worked chiefly as a leader, recording over 20 albums for Blue Note Records between 1955 and 1970, including Soul Station (1960), generally considered to be his finest recording, and Roll Call (1960). He performed with many of the other important hard bop players, such as Grant Green, Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Clark, Wynton Kelly and Philly Joe Jones, and formed a particularly productive partnership with trumpeter Lee Morgan. Mobley is widely recognized as one of the great composers of originals in the hard bop era, with interesting chord changes and room for soloists to stretch out. Mobley spent a brief time in 1961 with Miles Davis, during the trumpeter's search for a replacement for John Coltrane. He is heard on the album Someday My Prince Will Come (alongside Coltrane, who returned for the recording of two tracks), and several live recordings (In Person: Live at the Blackhawk and At Carnegie Hall).  Retirement  Mobley was forced to retire in the mid-1970s, due to lung problems. He also had problems with homelessness in his later years and struggled to stay in touch with his fellow musicians. He worked two engagements at the Angry Squire in New York City November 22 and 23, 1985, and January 11, 1986, in a quartet with Duke Jordan and guest singer Lodi Carr a few months before his death from pneumonia in 1986.

Forced perspective is a comparable illusion in architecture. History in painting Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70 The phrase, which can also be spelled without the hyphen and ligature in English as trompe l'oeil,For example by the National Gallery of Art, Washington originates with the artist Louis-Léopold Boilly, who used it as the title of a painting he exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1800.Taws, Richard (9 May 2019). \\"At the National Gallery\\". London Review of Books 40 (9): 26–27. Although the term gained currency only in the early 19th century, the illusionistic technique associated with trompe-l'œil dates much further back.\\"Illusionism\\". Grove Art Online. (2003). It was (and is) often employed in murals. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in Pompeii. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room. A version of an oft-told ancient Greek story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. Zeuxis (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, Parrhasius, asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner. Trompe-l'œil painting by Evert Collier Perspective A fascination with perspective drawing arose during the Renaissance. Many Italian painters of the late Quattrocento, such as Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506) and Melozzo da Forlì (1438–1494), began painting illusionistic ceiling paintings, generally in fresco, that employed perspective and techniques such as foreshortening to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as di sotto in sù, meaning \\"from below, upward\\" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the Camera degli Sposi in Mantua and Antonio da Correggio's (1489–1534) Assumption of the Virgin in the Parma Cathedral. Similarly, Vittorio Carpaccio (1460–1525) and Jacopo de' Barbari (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a fly might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden. Quadratura Escaping Criticism by Pere Borrell del Caso, 1874 Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to \\"open up\\" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as quadratura. Examples include Pietro da Cortona's Allegory of Divine Providence in the Palazzo Barberini and Andrea Pozzo's Apotheosis of St Ignatius on the ceiling of the Roman church of Sant'Ignazio. The Mannerist and Baroque style interiors of Jesuit churches in the 16th and 17th centuries often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically \\"open\\" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', Mary's, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by Andrea Pozzo, which is only slightly curved, but gives the impression of true architecture. Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting. The Flemish painter Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting. Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art The Dutch painter Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World (Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt, Rotterdam, 1678).Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age', Amsterdam University Press, 2008 A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, quodlibet, features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around. Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by Jan van der Vaart. Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by Sir James Thornhill, the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the Baroque style popular in the early 18th century. The American 19th-century still-life painter William Harnett specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American Richard Haas and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist Rainer Maria Latzke began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter Salvador Dalí utilized the technique for a number of his paintings. In other art forms Trompe-l'œil, in the form of \\"forced perspective\\", has long been used in stage-theater set design, so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the existing stage. A famous early example is the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, with Vincenzo Scamozzi's seven forced-perspective \\"streets\\" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance. Jesuit Church, Vienna, by Andrea Pozzo, 1703 Trompe-l'œil is employed in Donald O'Connor's famous \\"Running up the wall\\" scene in the film Singin' in the Rain (1954). During the finale of his \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, Roy Andersson has made use of similar techniques in his feature films. Matte painting is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many Looney Tunes, such as the Road Runner cartoons, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This sight gag was employed in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In Chicago's Near North Side, Richard Haas used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to Chicago school architecture. One of the building's sides features the Chicago Board of Trade Building, intended as a reflection of the building located two miles south. Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called street painting or \\"pavement art\\". These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include Julian Beever, Edgar Mueller, Leon Keer, and Kurt Wenner. The Palazzo Salis of Tirano, Italy has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies, and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.Paull, J. (2015) Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull SlideShare. Trompe-l’œil in the form of illusion architecture and Lüftlmalerei is common on façades in the Alpine region. Trompe l'œil, in the form of \\"illusion painting\\", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist Rainer Maria Latzke, who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, frescography, and the English artist Graham Rust. OK Go's music video for \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" uses a number of trompe-l'œil illusions alongside other optical illusions, captured through a one-shot take. Trompe-l'œil illusions have been used as gameplay mechanics in video games such as The Witness and Superliminal.

He is voiced by Ray Liotta. Tommy is the first playable protagonist in the Grand Theft Auto series that has a proper voice actor, with full dialogue. Tommy is an ex-gangster or ex-made man for the Forelli family, a fictional Italian Mafia family in the Grand Theft Auto universe. After being released from prison in 1986, Tommy agrees to take part in a deal for his old boss and friend, in which he is ambushed. In an attempt to find the man who set up the ambush, Tommy rises through the ranks of Vice City's criminal underworld. After murdering the man who set up the ambush, he takes over his criminal empire, which he further expands, ultimately becoming the kingpin of Vice City. Character design A piece of concept art featuring Tommy, sporting a similar hairstyle to that of his in-game appearance. Tommy, an Italian-American, is portrayed with a swarthy, handsome appearance, combed dark brown, almost black hair, and a constant five o'clock shadow. He first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt with dark blue palm trees printed on it, a gold pearl necklace around his neck, a gold watch around his left wrist, and a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers. This outfit becomes known as Tommy's \\"street\\" clothes. As the game progresses, Tommy is offered more wardrobe options: he obtains a blue-purple pastel suit with the sleeves rolled up over a black dress shirt and black loafers, as well as the option of a dark pinstripe suit labeled as \\"Mr. Vercetti\\" (which bears similarities to Tony Montana's uniform). A light green costume is available to perform a bank robbery, complete with a hockey mask, and is even able to wear the uniform for an allied gang, among many others. Tommy Vercetti, in several ways, exhibits characteristics of fictional drug lord Tony Montana from the 1983 film Scarface. This coincides with the heavy themes and appearance of the movie that has been implemented into Vice City. Among these characteristics, his exile from his old home (Liberty City), his rise to power (acquiring property and wealth in the city, and a mansion which also sports an interior similar to that of Montana's mansion). Tommy is also a hired assassin, has killed his own collaborators (Lance Vance), taken over his temporary boss's business (Ricardo Diaz) and rebelled against his former leader (Sonny Forelli), as Tony Montana had. The only notable difference is that the final gunfight in Montana's mansion sees Montana eventually killed, whereas the final gunfight in Tommy's mansion sees Tommy managing to single-handedly take down his captors and survive. Characteristics Tommy Vercetti is depicted as both intelligent and temperamental; he is easily angered and quick to resort to violence. He has no hesitation about killing, though many of his victims are in turn trying to kill Tommy as well, or have done something that requires them to be killed. Despite all this, Tommy does also show a softer side as seen with his relations with Mercedes Cortez, the daughter of Juan Garcia Cortez, and Earnest Kelly, an elderly employee at the Print Works printing company that he buys later in the game: the former serves as a love interest for Tommy, while the latter is more of a father figure due to his childhood memories of working with his father at a printworks. Biography Early life Tommy Vercetti was born to an Italian-American family and was raised in Liberty City, where his father worked for an unknown company (presumably the Liberty Tree) as a printing press operator working on its printers. It is unknown whether he owned the printing company or not but Tommy used to clean its rollers and suggests he lived a normal and moral life. When he was a teenager, he would befriend Mafia mobster Sonny Forelli, whom was a rising force in the Forelli Crime Family (it is unknown whether or not he was already Don, but can be assumed as police information say Sonny became Boss of the Mafia at an early age) and would start working for the Forelli family, earning the syndicates' trust and eventually becoming a made man in the Mafia. In 1971, jealous and nervous of Tommy's rising reputation inside the Mafia and the Liberty City crime scene, Sonny sent Tommy to kill a key mobster (presumably of the Leone family) in the Harwood District for unknown reasons (presumably because of the Mafia's scuffles over rackets and revenge). In actuality, what was supposed to be Tommy's clean hit would turn out to be a threat set up by Sonny. When Tommy arrived, eleven men would ambush him due to Sonny having probably warned Tommy's enemies of the impending threat posed by him (or even having organized the ambush himself). Tommy would miraculously survive after killing all eleven of them, but would end up being arrested in the process and sent to prison for multiple charges of murder. He would be placed on death row, but due to the Forelli Mafia's influence and possibly interference, he only served fifteen years. He also earned the title \\"The Harwood Butcher\\" for how he singlehandedly slew eleven men on his own. Release from prison Fresh out of prison in 1986, Tommy is immediately dispatched by then Don Sonny Forelli to Vice City in order to participate in a drug deal. This deal was organized due to Sonny's fear that Tommy's presence in Liberty City would cause problems for his organization (whom by this time was the most powerful Mafia family in Liberty City) as Tommy's Harwood Slaughter of 1971 was still fresh in the minds of police and would thus cause the law enforcers in Liberty City to start possibly harassing the Forelli family. Sonny orders Tommy to expand into the drug business in the south and to stay there for a while finding opportunities for a good business. Tommy arrives at the deal as a supervisor between the Forelli Crime Family and the nearly wiped out Vance Crime Family, led by brothers Lance and Victor Vance. Just then, a group of masked assailants open fire on them, killing Victor Vance and Forelli's men (Harry and Lee), resulting in Tommy losing both the money and the drugs, from which he narrowly escapes with Ken Rosenberg, the Forellis' crooked lawyer and his contact in Vice City. With the promise to Sonny to retrieve both the drugs and money, he then sets out to find and kill the party responsible. While investigating, Tommy makes a number of allies and employers who offer him help, including retired Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who helped set up the exchange; music producer Kent Paul, who maintains connections with the city's criminal underworld; Lance Vance, who seeks revenge for his brother's death and to reclaim their stolen money and drugs; Texan real estate developer Avery Carrington; and drug baron Ricardo Diaz (who is later revealed to be responsible for the ambushed deal). Business ventures After Tommy and Lance lead an assault on Diaz's estate and kill him, Tommy begins to disobey Sonny's orders and enjoys the empire he claimed from Diaz, without paying any tribute to the Forelli family, enraging Sonny, who constantly demands a larger cut of the profits from Tommy, and Lance, who wants more respect from Tommy and also more control in the family. During this time, Tommy forms his own organization, called the \\"Vercetti Gang,\\" from the remains of Diaz's gang, and becomes acquainted with Umberto Robina, leader of the Los Cabrones Cuban street gang, whom he helps end a war against a rival Haitian gang, as well as \\"Big\\" Mitch Baker, leader of the Vice City Bikers, whom he helps with a few favours, seeking to establish a partnership with both gangs. He also briefly works for the heavy metal band Love Fist, now managed by Kent Paul, helps Cortez leave the city with stolen military equipment, and buys out several nearly bankrupt companies to use as fronts for illicit businesses. Tommy and the Forelli family's conflict reaches a boiling point when Tommy kills Forelli henchmen sent to seize his business revenue, and Sonny personally visits him in Vice City. Due to Lance's betrayal, he is forced into a large shootout with the Forelli crew, in which he kills Sonny, Lance, and the hit squad, finally securing his empire and gang in the city, with Ken Rosenberg as his main partner. It is also during this major gunfight that Tommy discovers that Sonny actually set up the eleven people to ambush Tommy and caused him to spend fifteen years in prison. At the end of the game, Tommy is shown to have become an extremely powerful figure in Vice City's criminal underworld. He is in charge of the Vercetti Gang, the most powerful organization in Vice City, has alliances with both the Los Cabrones and Vice City Bikers, lives in a huge mansion, owns many businesses that he uses as fronts for his illegal operations, and is also in charge of the drug trade in Vice City. Furthermore, Sonny's death marked the beginning of the Forelli family's decline in Liberty City, so most likely the Forellis never bothered Tommy again. Tommy, at the end of the game, is the kingpin of Vice City.  Later life  Not much is known about Tommy's life after the events of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, though he most likely continued ruling over Vice City's criminal underworld undisputed. By 1992, he cut his ties with Ken Rosenberg after sending him to rehab in the state of San Andreas. Tommy is mentioned in The Introduction, a short prologue film to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, in a scene where Ken tries to call Tommy after getting out of rehab, but fails, leading him to search for a new job. Influences and analysis Ray Liotta, the actor who provided the voice for Tommy Vercetti, at the 2014 Deauville American Film Festival Prior to the release of Vice City, IGN stated that Tommy was likely to \\"leave the same kind of imprint on kids today that [actor Ray Liotta's] portrayal of Ray Sinclair left on every high school and college kid who saw Something Wild back in 1986.\\" They also compared Liotta's portrayal of Tommy to his portrayal of Henry Hill in Goodfellas. When asked about his portrayal of Tommy, Liotta stated that \\"it was hard work.\\" He said that \\"you're pretty much putting yourself in [the game developers'] hands and doing whatever they want so there's not much for you to do creatively.\\" Reception The character of Tommy Vercetti received very positive reviews and remarks from critics and players of Vice City, making it to many lists of the best video game characters. IGN said that they \\"were ready for a more fleshed-out protagonist\\" after Grand Theft Auto IIIs Claude. Crave Online stated that playing as Tommy was \\"a breath of fresh air\\". The Age praised Ray Liotta's voice acting and stated \\"while the character riffs on Tony Montana throughout the game, Liotta's speeches give him a reckless sense of humour that makes him more likeable\\". GameDaily praised Liotta's portrayal as having transformed him from a generic-looking thug to a \\"tough guy who ruled the 80's.\\" The Telegraph described Tommy as \\"the most amoral\\" Grand Theft Auto protagonist. Liotta won the award for Best Live Action/Voice Male Performance at the 2003 G-Phoria Awards and Best Performance by a Human at the 2003 Spike Video Game Awards.

It is the home town of the Buendía family. Aracataca Macondo is often supposed to draw from García Márquez's childhood town, Aracataca. Aracataca is located near the north (Caribbean) coast of Colombia, 80 km south of Santa Marta. In June 2006, there was a referendum to change the name of the town to Aracataca Macondo, which ultimately failed due to low turnout. Etymology In the first chapter of his autobiography, Living to Tell the Tale, García Márquez states that he took the name Macondo from a sign at a banana plantation near Aracataca. He also mentions the fact that Macondo is the local name of the tree Cavanillesia platanifolia, which grows in that area. Fictional history The town first appears in García Márquez's short story \\"Leaf Storm\\". It is the central location for the subsequent novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. He has since used Macondo as a setting for several other stories. In In Evil Hour, published the year before One Hundred Years of Solitude, García Márquez mentions Macondo as the town where Father Ángel was succeeded by the one- hundred-year-old Antonio Isabel del Santísimo Sacramento del Altar Castañeda y Montero, a clear reference to the novel to come. In the narrative of One Hundred Years of Solitude, the town grows from a tiny settlement with almost no contact with the outside world, to eventually become a large and thriving place, before a banana plantation is set up. The establishment of the banana plantation leads to Macondo's downfall, followed by a gigantic windstorm that wipes it from the map. As the town grows and falls, different generations of the Buendía family play important roles, contributing to its development. The fall of Macondo comes first as a result of a four-year rainfall, which destroyed most of the town's supplies and image. During the years following the rainfall, the town begins to empty, as does the Buendía home. In popular culture The town of Macondo is the namesake of the Macondo Prospect, an oil and gas prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April 2010. In addition to this usage: *Early in the 1974 film Chinatown, Jake Gittes spies on Hollis Mulwray at the fictional \\"El Macondo Apartments\\". Production director Richard Sylbert says this was indeed a reference to the city of García Márquez. *Popular Russian rock band Bi-2 released as part of their 2006 album \\"Milk\\" (\\"\\") a song called \\"Macondo\\" (\\"\\"). The chorus repeats: \\"Rain was falling on Macondo, right in the middle of the century\\" (\\"\\"). Bi-2 first obtained popularity in 2000, with the release of their first hit \\"No One Writes to the Colonel\\" (\\"\\"), the title of a novella by Gabriel García Márquez. * Given the town's association with magical realism, many Latin Americans would portray the everyday illogical or absurd news and situations they or their respective countries face as more aptly belonging to Macondo. As a result, some Latin Americans occasionally refer to their home towns or countries as Macondos. The Latin American McOndo phenomenon of the mid-1990s (started by the anthology of the same name), a counter-reaction to magical realism and the region's literary Boom of the 60s and 70s, derives its name from the portmanteau of the words Macondo and McDonald's. *Macondo is the name of a village beset by \\"sloths and jaguars\\" in the speculative fiction novel 2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson. The village is in Colombia. *Macondo is the name of a popular bar in Via del Pratello, one of the main nightlife areas in Bologna, Italy *Macondo is the name of a popular bar in Salerno, Italy. *Macondo Coffee UK is an ethical coffee brand and microroaster in Chichester, West Sussex. * Macondo is the name of a New York City restaurant currently in operation which is themed after One Hundred Years of Solitude. * Macondo is the name of a refugee settlement in Simmering, a municipality on the outskirts of Vienna, Austria, named after Garcia Márquez's fictitious town by Chilean refugees. It has been home to successive waves of refugees since Hungarians came en masse after the revolution of 1956, followed by Czech and Romanian waves in 1968, Vietnamese \\"Boat People\\" and Chileans fleeing Pinochet in the early 70s. Many of these refugees and their descendants still live in the settlement as \\"permanent refugees,\\" while new waves from current headlining wars from around the world keep arriving: Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya, etc. References Category:Fictional populated places Category:Colombian literature it:Cent'anni di solitudine#Macondo ","title":"Macondo"},{"id":"310811","text":"Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) is a private, Baptist liberal arts college in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

OBU operates five off-campus apartment complexes for upperclassmen. Student life Ouachita's Student Village residence halls are connected to the main campus via Heflin Plaza, a walkway that bridges the campus ravine Ouachita is primarily a residential campus, with 94% percent of the students living in one of eight on-campus residence halls and five off-campus apartment complexes. Only students who have family in the area, are married or are over the age of 22 are allowed to live elsewhere. Campus policies restrict students visiting the rooms of those of the opposite sex to special visiting hours. Ouachita does not allow nationally affiliated social fraternities or sororities, but there are local fraternities and sororities called \\"social clubs.\\" Approximately 20% of the student body are members of such clubs. Annually, during Homecoming Weekend, the social clubs participate in a musical show called Tiger Tunes, produced by the Ouachita Student Foundation (OSF). All proceeds raised from Tiger Tunes and other events throughout the year are then given by OSF for student scholarships. Current men's social clubs are: Beta Beta, Rho Sigma, Kappa Chi, and Eta Alpha Omega. Current women's social clubs are: E.E.E., Chi Delta, Tri Chi, Chi Mu and Gamma Phi. In the spring, Tiger Traks invades the campus for two days of competition among students. Called \\"Arkansas' Most Exciting College Weekend,\\" Tiger Traks invites all students and faculty to participate and raise funds for OSF scholarships. There are also more than 40 professional, departmental and honorary organizations for students.

An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, and Ethnic Slurs in the English-speaking World. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2006. the term was originally coined and applied only to Mexicans who entered the U.S. state of Texas from Mexico by crossing the Rio Grande river, which is the U.S. border, presumably by swimming or wading across the river and getting wet in the process. Usage The first use of the term wetback in The New York Times is dated June 20, 1920. It was used officially by the US government, including Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, with 'Operation Wetback', a project that involved the mass deportation of illegal Mexican immigrants. Usage of the term appeared in mainstream media outlets until the 1960s. The term can also be used as an adjective or verb. As an adjective, it pertains to activities involving Mexican illegal aliens in the United States. The earliest known recorded use in this way is by John Steinbeck in the novel Sweet Thursday, the sequel to Cannery Row, with the sentence, \\"How did he get in the wet-back business?\\" It was originally used as a verb in 1978 in Thomas Sanchez's Hollywoodland with the meaning, \\"to gain illegal entry into the United States by swimming the Rio Grande\\".Green, Jonathon (2010).

The title has been awarded since 1185, though briefly abolished (1793–1804) and briefly dormant (1870–1916). It was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France during the ' and Bourbon Restoration, and one of the Grand Dignitaries of the Empire during the First French Empire (when the title was Marshal of the Empire, not Marshal of France). A Marshal of France displays seven stars on each shoulder strap. A marshal also receives a baton: a blue cylinder with stars, formerly fleurs-de-lis during the monarchy and eagles during the First French Empire. The baton bears the Latin inscription of ', which means \\"terror in war, ornament in peace\\". Between the end of the 16th century and the middle of the 19th century, six Marshals of France were given the even more exalted rank of Marshal General of France: , , , , , and . Terror belli... ...decus pacis Modern-day baton, belonging to one of the four Marshals of France during World War II (Leclerc, de Lattre, Juin and Kœnig) History The title derived from the office of marescallus Franciae created by King Philip II Augustus of France for Albéric Clément (). The title was abolished by the National Convention in 1793. It was restored as Marshal of the Empire during the First French Empire by Napoleon. Under the Bourbon Restoration, the title reverted to Marshal of France, and Napoleon III kept that designation. After the fall of Napoleon III and the Second French Empire, the Third Republic did not use the title until the First World War, when it was recreated as a military distinction and not a rank. Contrarily to ranks, which are awarded by the army, the distinction of Marshal of France is awarded by a special law voted by the French Parliament. For this reason, it is impossible to demote a Marshal. The most famous case is Philippe Pétain, who was awarded the distinction of Marshal of France for his generalship in World War I, and who was stripped of other positions and titles after his trial for high treason due to his involvement with collaborationist Vichy France: due to the principle of separation of powers, the court that judged him did not have the power to cancel the law that had made him a Marshal in the first place. The last living Marshal of France was Alphonse Juin, promoted in 1952, who died in 1967. The latest Marshal of France was Marie-Pierre Kœnig, who was made a Marshal posthumously in 1984. Today, the title of Marshal of France can only be granted to a general officer who fought victoriously in war-time.

In the Middle Ages it was a major royal fortress and occasional royal residence. In decline by the 16th century, it was largely demolished in 1651. The Duke of Newcastle later built a mansion on the site, which was burnt down by rioters in 1831 and left as a ruin. It was later rebuilt to house an art gallery and museum, which remain in use. Little of the original castle survives, but sufficient portions remain to give an impression of the layout of the site. Medieval history The first Norman castle on Castle Rock was a wooden structure of a motte-and-bailey design, begun in 1068, two years after the Battle of Hastings, on the orders of William the Conqueror. This wooden structure was replaced by a far more defensible stone castle during the reign of King Henry II, of an imposing and complex architectural design, which eventually comprised an upper bailey at the highest point of the castle rock, a middle bailey to the north containing the main royal apartments, and a large outer bailey to the east. For centuries the castle served as one of the most important in England for nobles and royalty alike. In a strategic position due to its location near a crossing of the River Trent, it was also known as a place of leisure, being close to the royal hunting grounds at Tideswell, the \\"Kings Larder\\" in the Royal Forest of the Peak, and also close to the royal forests of Barnsdale and Sherwood. The castle also had its own deer park in the area immediately to the west, still known as The Park. While King Richard I (\\"the Lionheart\\") was away on the Third Crusade, along with a great number of English noblemen, Nottingham Castle was occupied by supporters of Prince John, including the Sheriff of Nottingham. In the legends of Robin Hood, Nottingham Castle is the scene of the final showdown between the Sheriff and the heroic outlaw. In March 1194, an historic battle took place at Nottingham Castle, part of the returned King Richard's campaign to put down the rebellion of Prince John. The castle was the site of a decisive attack when King Richard besieged it after constructing some siege machines similar to those used on crusade. Richard was aided by Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester, and David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon. The castle surrendered after just a few days. Shortly before his 18th birthday, King Edward III, with the help of a few trusted companions led by Sir William Montagu, staged a coup d'état at Nottingham Castle (19 October 1330) against his mother Isabella of France, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. Both Isabella and Mortimer were acting as Regents during Edward's minority following their murder of his father Edward II at Berkeley Castle. William Montagu and his companions were accompanied by William Eland, castellan and overseer of Mortimer's castle, who knew the location of a secret tunnel which would take them higher up in the castle to a normally locked door. In the dark of night on 19 October 1330, Montagu and his companions entered the tunnel, climbed up to the door, which had now been unlocked either by Edward III or a trusted servant, and overpowered Mortimer, killing Mortimer's personal guards. Mortimer was bound and gagged, led out of the tunnel and arrested, along with Queen Mother Isabella. Mortimer was sent to the Tower of London, and hanged a month later. Isabella of France was forced into retirement at Castle Rising Castle. With this dramatic event the personal reign of Edward began.Ian Mortimer, The Perfect King. The Life of Edward III, London: Vintage Books, 2008., p 1–3. These events seem to be echoed in an interpolation made to a metrical chronicle in around 1331, which describes the caves beneath the castle as having been carved out by Lancelot in his attempts to hide Guinevere from King Arthur following their adulterous affair. This seems to be the earliest reference to Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery that exists.Helen Cooper, 'Lancelot, Roger Mortimer, and the Date of the Auchinleck Manuscript', in The Key of All Good Remembrance, ed. by A. J Fletcher and Anne-Marie D'Arcy (Dublin: Portland, 2005), pp. 91-99. Royal residence Victorian reconstruction of the likely appearance of the castle in the late medieval period Edward III used the castle as a residence and held Parliaments. In 1346 King David II of Scotland was held prisoner. In 1365 Edward III improved the castle with a new tower on the west side of the Middle Bailey and a new prison under the High Tower. In 1376 Peter de la Mare, speaker of the House of Commons, was confined in Nottingham Castle for having \\"taken unwarrantable liberties with the name of Alice Perrers, mistress of the king\\".Old and New Nottingham. William Howie Wylie. 1853 In 1387 the state council was held in the castle. Richard II held the Lord Mayor of London with Aldermen and Sheriffs in the castle in 1392, and held another state council for the purpose of humbling Londoners. The last visit recorded by Richard II was in 1397 when another council was held here. From 1403 until 1437 it was the main residence of Henry IV's queen, Joan. After the residence of Joan maintenance was reduced. Only upon the Wars of the Roses did Nottingham Castle begin to be used again as a military stronghold. Edward IV proclaimed himself king in Nottingham, and in 1476 he ordered the construction of a new tower and Royal Apartments. This was described by John Leland in 1540 as: > the most beautifulest part and gallant building for lodging... a right > sumptuous piece of stone work. During the reign of Henry VII, the castle remained a royal fortress. Henry VIII ordered new tapestries for the castle before he visited Nottingham in August 1511. By 1536 Henry had the castle reinforced and its garrison increased from a few dozen men to a few hundred. In 1538 the Constable, the Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, reported on the need for maintenance. A survey in 1525 stated that there was much \\"dekay and ruyne of said castell\\" and > part of the roof of the Great Hall is fallen down. Also the new building > there is in dekay of timber, lead and glass. Civil war The castle ceased to be a royal residence by 1600 and was largely rendered obsolete in the 17th century by artillery. A short time following the outbreak of the English Civil War, the castle was already in a semi-ruined state after a number of skirmishes occurred on the site. At the start of the Civil War, in August 1642, Charles I chose Nottingham as the rallying point for his armies, but soon after he departed, the castle rock was made defensible and held by the parliamentarians. Commanded by John Hutchinson, they repulsed several Royalist attacks, and they were the last group to hold the castle. In 1648 the Royalist commander Marmaduke Langdale, fleeing after defeat in the Battle of Preston, was captured and held in Nottingham Castle, but he managed to escape and make his way to Europe. In 1651, two years after the execution of Charles I in 1649, the castle was razed to prevent it being used again. The present 'Ducal Mansion' A depiction of the castle on fire in 1831 The castle from The History and Antiquities of Nottingham by James Orange, 1840 Entrance to the Ducal Mansion (2012) After the restoration of Charles II in 1660, the present 'Ducal Mansion' was built by Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle between 1674 and 1679 on the foundations of the previous structure. Despite the destruction of the keep and fortifications of the upper bailey, some rock cut cellars and medieval pointed arches survive beneath the mansion, together with a long passage to the bottom of the rock, commonly known as Mortimer's Hole, through which guided tours take place, starting at the Castle and ending at Brewhouse Yard. The mason for the Mansion was Samuel Marsh of Lincoln, who also worked for the Duke at Bolsover Castle. His designs are generally thought to have been strongly influenced by Rubens's engravings, in his book Palazzi di Genova.Sir John Summerson Pelican History of Art: Architecture in England 1530–1830, Harmondsworth 1953 p104 The Duke's mansion is a rare surviving example in England of Artisan Mannerist architecture. However, it lost its appeal to the later Dukes with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, which left Nottingham with the reputation of having the worst slums in the British Empire outside India. When residents of these slums rioted in 1831, in protest against the Duke of Newcastle's opposition to the Reform Act 1832 they burned down the mansion. The original exterior stairs on the eastern façade of the mansion were subsequently demolished to create a parade ground for the Robin Hood Rifles. The mansion remained a derelict shell until it was restored in 1875 by Thomas Chambers Hine, and opened in 1878 by the Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) as Nottingham Castle Museum, the first municipal art gallery in the UK outside London. The new interiors ignored the original floor levels and fenestration to accommodate a top-lit picture gallery modelled after the Grand Gallery of the Louvre. The gatehouse of the medieval castle and much of the walling of the outer bailey was retained as a garden wall for the Ducal mansion. However, the northernmost part of the outer bailey was lost when an approach road was constructed in the 1830s for the development of The Park Estate on the former deer park. On Christmas Day 1996 a landslip, caused by a leaking water main, led to 80 tonnes of earth and retaining wall from the Restoration terrace next to the Mansion falling to the bottom of the Castle rock. This revealed some remains of the original castle foundations and the bedrock. After a lengthy controversy on the best conservation/restoration approach, the terrace was reinstated with a traditional stone façade. The terrace offers great views to the south of the city, and appeared in the film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, a film about the changing attitude of youth in a changing industrial society. A drawing of the Ducal Mansion appeared on millions of packets of rolling tobacco and cigarettes made by John Player & Sons, a Nottingham firm. Most packets had the phrases Nottingham Castle and Trade Mark bracketing the image of the non-fortress-like structure. This led the novelist Ian Fleming to refer to \\"that extraordinary trademark of a dolls house swimming in chocolate fudge with Nottingham Castle written underneath\\" in Thunderball, in the knowledge that his British readers would be familiar with the image. The building is due to undergo a multi-million renovation in 2018. Nottingham Castle Museum Until its closure in July 2018 (the castle will be closed for two years for a £30 million redevelopment) the ducal mansion was still in use as a museum and art gallery. It housed most of the City of Nottingham's fine and decorative art collections, galleries on the history and archaeology of Nottingham and the surrounding areas, and the regimental museum of the Sherwood Foresters. Notable elements of the collections were: * 15th-century Nottingham alabaster carvings, including those found in 1779 at St. Peter's Church, Flawford * Watercolours by Richard Parkes Bonnington and Paul Sandby * The Joseph Collection of Wedgwood Jasperware * The Ballantyne Collection of contemporary ceramics * Salt-glazed stoneware, including locally-made \\"bear jugs\\" * A costume collection including Nottingham lace making * Roman votive offerings from the Temple of Diana Nemorensis at Lake Nemi (mostly no longer on public display) * Works by George Wallis Additionally, The Nottingham Castle Victoria Cross Memorial, dedicated on 7 May 2010, lists Albert Ball and 19 other Nottinghamshire recipients of the Victoria Cross. Fine art from Britain and continental Europe was on display in the Long Gallery of the Castle. It included works by artists from Nottinghamshire such as Thomas Barber, Richard Bonington, Henry Dawson, Paul Sandby and John Rawson Walker, and 20th-century works by Edward Burra, Tristram Hillier, Ivon Hitchens, Dame Laura Knight, Harold Knight, L.S.

It was first registered as a General Conference association in 1929 in Burgwedel, near Hanover, Germany.

Through its local church congregations and groups of adherents, affiliated publishing houses, schools, health clinics and hospitals, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is active in over 132 countries of the world. The movement's beliefs largely reflect its distinctive Seventh-day Adventist Church heritage and foundational pillars, with some small divergences. See on \\"Beliefs\\" below.  History   1914-1918 Seventh-day Adventist Church Schism (Europe)  The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement came about as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war, which was in clear opposition to the historical position of the church that had always upheld the non-combative position. Since the American Civil War, Adventists were known as non- combatants, and had done work in hospitals or given medical care rather than combat roles.http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership The Seventh-day Adventist leaders in Europe when the war began, determined on their own that it was permissible for Adventists to bear arms and serve in the military and other changes which went against traditional Adventist beliefs. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists sent Seventh-day Adventist minister and General Conference Secretary William Ambrose Spicer to investigate the changes these leaders had instituted, but was unable to undo what L. R. Conradi and the others had done during the war. After the war, the Seventh-day Adventist church sent a delegation of four brethren from the General Conference (Arthur G. Daniells who was president of General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, L. H. Christian, F. M. Wilcox, M. E. Kern) in July 1920, who came to a Ministerial Meeting in Friedensau with the hope of a reconciliation. Before the 200 Pastors and the Brethren from the General Conference present at this meeting, its European church leaders, G. Dail, L. R. Conradi, H. F. Schuberth, and P. Drinhaus withdrew their statement about military service and apologized for what they had done. The Reformers were informed of this and the next day saw a meeting by the Adventist brethren with the Reform-Adventists. A. G. Daniells urged them to return to the Seventh-day Adventist church, but the Reform-Adventists maintained that the European church leaders had forsaken the truth during the war and the reconciliation failed.http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership Soon after they began to form a separate group from the official Adventist church. A related group which also came about for the same reasons was the True and Free Seventh-day Adventists (TFSDA) which formed in the Soviet Union at this time, whose most well known leader was Vladimir Shelkov.  The 1951 Schism - SDARM General Conference Session Zeist, Netherlands and its Aftermath  A major division then took place within the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement itself at its General Conference session held at Zeist, Utrecht (province), Netherlands in 1951. The cause for the division involved tensions that had arisen over unresolved issues of the preceding years. Charges of arbitrariness and authoritarianism by the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement leader and on the part of the General Conference administration towards member Units, failures by the General Conference committee to adequately resolve moral failings among leaders, issues concerning mal- administration of Church finances, and procedural and organisational irregularities prior to and during the Session itself are cited by the present organisation as significant contributing factors.Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference, \\"Our GC Delegation Sessions\\" 1948, http://www.sdarm.org/origin/his_11_sessions_III.html#1948 Accessed April 1,Zeist 2011.Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference, \\"Our GC Delegation Sessions\\" 1951, Accessed April 1, 2011. After two weeks of deliberations within the Session trying to resolve some of these tensions, a move was made by a number of delegates to read a declaration enumerating the main problems involved and requesting that a committee to address the entire situation be established. The motion carried on the first vote but was overturned by the chairman. To signify their protest at what was held to be an arbitrary decision of the chair, 45% of delegates present, led by the then Secretary of the General Conference, left the Session room. The Session's proceedings faltered at this point. Efforts to reconcile the situation while all delegates were still present in Netherlands failed.Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference, \\"Our GC Delegation Sessions\\" 1951, Accessed April 1, 2011.\\"International Missionary Society Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement - About IMS\\" Accessed: April 1, 2011. Another factor affecting the administration of the Session at the time was the international situation behind the iron curtain.Ward R & Humphreys R, \\"Religious Bodies In Australia\\" 3rd Edition. New Melbourne Press, Victoria, Australia. p.171. 1995. Many of the units attached to the General Conference were unable to send delegates to the Zeist session due to restrictions on religious bodies in communist lands.Alfons Balbach, \\"History of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement\\", Reformation Herald Publishing Association, Virginia, USA, 1999, pp97-98.

Those Units not represented directly accounted for approximately 60% of the organization's membership. Consequently, neither of the two factions that became evident at the Zeist session were in a position to make any unilateral decisions.Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference, \\"Our GC Delegation Sessions\\" 1951, Accessed April 1, 2011. Over the course of the next year, steps were taken by both parties to explain the situation to their respective member bodies (Union Conferences) that were affiliated up until this time to the one worldwide church administration. Both factions re-organised themselves as General Conference committees independently of each other and proceeded to take the oversight of the SDARM General Conference affairs.  SDARM General Conference Headquarters in Roanoke, Virginia, USA  The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement had been first registered as a general conference association in Burgwedel, near Hanover, Germany in 1929. Though never approved by the inaugural 1925 Gotha SDARM General Conference Session, the designation \\"International Missionary Society\\" was added to the beginning of the name. The full registered name at that time took the form \\"International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement, General Conference\\". The reasons for adding the designation to the beginning of the name were purely pragmatic, and done in the interests of securing General Conference finances on loan to one of its member Units, namely the German Union Conference. The SDARM General Conference operated under this German registration until 1936 when the association was dissolved by the Gestapo.Alfons Balbach, \\"History of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement\\", Reformation Herald Publishing Association, Virginia, USA, 1999, pp.129-130. From 1936 until the conclusion of the second World War, there was no legally registered SDARM General Conference entity anywhere in the world, and would not be until 1949. The international situation during those years prevented the convening of a General Conference Session. It was not until 1948, when the first post-war General Conference session was held, that the delegates agreed to re-register the worldwide interests of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement by incorporating the SDARM General Conference as an association in the USA. They also agreed to do this \\"under the name that was adopted by the General Conference delegation in session in 1925\\". This decision was carried out in 1949.Balbach, p.130. The registered name was now correctly, \\"Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference.\\" It was under the By-Laws of this newly incorporated body that the 1951 Zeist General Conference Session was convened.Balbach, pp. 130-131 By 1951 the SDARM General Conference affairs and financial interests were formally associated with the USA registered entity. Consequently, in the aftermath of the Zeist session, legal proceedings to establish the recognized administrators of the registered General Conference corporate entity commenced. These proceedings were finalised in May 1952 in an out-of-court agreement between the two factions. Representatives of the faction that had engaged in the protest walk-out in 1951 were left in control of the registered SDARM General Conference association.Newspaper Article: Adventist Suit Over Control is Withdrawn, The Sacramento Union, May 8, 1952.Kramer, Helmut H., \\"The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (German Reform)\\", Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. p.23. 1988. By 1955, when the next Session of Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference convened under the auspices the USA registered association, delegates present represented \\"9000 members (1000 less than in 1951)\\". This was a representation of 90% of the worldwide church membership recorded prior to the 1951 division.Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference, \\"Our GC Delegation Sessions\\" 1955, http://www.sdarm.org/origin/his_11_sessions_IV.html#1955 Accessed April 1, 2011. International Missionary Society (IMS) Following the 1952 legal proceedings, in June of that year, representatives of the faction that had been the subject of the protest at Zeist conducted a second re-organisation. To distinguish themselves from their opposing faction, they adopted the name \\"International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement, General Conference\\" with headquarters in Mosbach, Baden in Germany.Kramer, Helmut H., \\"The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (German Reform)\\", Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. p.23. 1988. As mentioned previously, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, as a general conference association, had been registered under this name in Germany in 1929 and operated under that name until 1936 when the association was dissolved by the Gestapo.Alfons Balbach, \\"History of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement\\", Reformation Herald Publishing Association, Virginia, USA, 1999, pp.129-130. \\"International Missionary Society\\" was a name that had been associated with the German Union Conference of the Seventh-Day Adventist Reform Movement from its inception in 1919. As the inaugural 1925 SDARM General Conference session did not agree to use this designation in its official name, the 1949 registered entity did not use it. With the opposing faction now adopting this designation and adding it to the 1925 agreed name, the designation \\"International Missionary Society\\" thereafter became associated exclusively with those affiliated with the interests of that faction.  Post 1952 Re-Unification Attempts - IMS and SDARM General Conference  With both factions formally organized, affiliations of Union and Field Conferences associated under one or the other of the two corporate administrations. Though they remained separate both in administration and worship, the theological beliefs espoused by each entity's adherents were common to both.Kramer, Helmut H., \\"The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (German Reform)\\", Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. p.23. 1988. Despite this common platform of belief, tensions from the 1951 schism continued to remain high. Consequently, official efforts in 1967 and again in 1993 to reconcile both administrations at a General Conference level were unsuccessful.\\"International Missionary Society Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement - About IMS\\" Accessed: April 1, 2011.Kramer, Helmut H., \\"The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (German Reform)\\", Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. p.23. 1988. Post War World II relations with Seventh-day Adventist Church In 2005, the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church tried to make amends and apologized for its failures during World War II, as the issue from the actions of L. R. Conradi continued during that war also. Some members see it as the first attempts to reconcile the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement with the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church. However, the actions of the SDA Church towards those who took a conscientious stand against all military service during World War I, were not acknowledged in the apology. The position of the SDA Church towards those engaged in military service, particularly combatants, remains an unresolved issue today.For a discussion of the present dilemma of the Seventh-day Adventist Church's position on Military Service, see Phillips, K. & Tstalbasidis, K., \\"I Pledge Allegiance - The Role of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in the Military\\". Keith Phillips-Karl Tsatalbasidis. pp.35-36. 2009. ()  Name of Church Congregations  While local church congregations use the name Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, those affiliated with the International Missionary Society General Conference also combine the designation \\"International Missionary Society\\" into their name to distinguish themselves from SDARM General Conference Units.  Beliefs  The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (SDARM General Conference) identifies itself with a conservative Seventh-day Adventist theological and eschatological heritage. While it holds to the basic tenets of the Seventh-day Adventist faith, commonly referred to as the pillars or landmarks of the faith for these landmark teachings, there is a divergence in degree on some post-1914 doctrinal positions taken by L. R. Conradi and some of the European church leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in both interpretation and application. The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement's official position as conscientious objectors\\"Our Attitude Toward Civil Authorities\\", \\"This We Believe (Expanded)\\", Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement Website, Accessed 25 December 2010. in relation to war and military service reflects the pacifist position of the Seventh-day Adventist Church during the 1861-1865 American Civil War. This is in direct response to what L. R. Conradi and others presented to the members and distinct from the official Seventh-day Adventist Church position which is one of non-combatancy, though in practice Seventh-day Adventist members have served in combatant roles in the military services.Ronald Osborn, \\"A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists in Times of War\\", November 2003, Adventist Today Magazine [Online] Accessed 25 December 2010. Other divergences include the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement's positions on divorce and remarriage, closed communion, the sealing work of Revelation 7 (the SDARM holding to a pre-1914 view of its literal and number- limited nature), and the remnant church of Revelation 12:17.Gerhard Pfandl, \\"Information on the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement\\", Adventist Biblical Research Institute, [Online] http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/Independent%20Ministries/SDA%20Reform%20movement.htm Accessed 25 December 2010. The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, as does the official Seventh-day Adventist Church, maintains the belief that Ellen G. White, a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, manifested the New Testament \\"Gift of Prophecy\\". Though she had died before the formation of the SDA Reform Movement, her inspired writings, commonly referred to as testimonies, are held in the highest regard by the movement as a whole. Consistent with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the SDA Reform Movement believes her inspired works do not take the place of the Bible. Rather they are considered a help to the believing church in bringing men and women back to the neglected truths of the Bible, with an emphasis on the need for professed believers to be faithful in the practice of its principles. Whereas the Seventh-day Adventist church emphasises the message of the three angels of Revelation 14:6-12, the Reform Movement places a distinct emphasis on a fourth angelic message based on Revelation 18:1-4.Ward R & Humphreys R, 1995, \\"Religious Bodies In Australia\\" 3rd Edition. New Melbourne Press, p.171. The movement claims that the message of this other angel was first given at 1888 Minneapolis General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This claim is maintained by the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement as the unique purpose for its existence as a distinct organisation separate to the Seventh- day Adventist Church.That Other Angel: The message is captured in the expression \\"Christ our Righteousness\\", the foundation for \\"Justification by Faith\\". Aside from the divergences, an examination of the SDA Reform Movement's published beliefs, indicate many similarities in theology with the traditional Seventh-day Adventist beliefs and also the more conservative Historic Adventism and Last Generation Theology wings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.http://www.sdarm.org/beliefs.php .

They should not be confused with the similarly named Chehalis First Nation of the Sts'Ailes people along the Harrison River in the Fraser Valley area of British Columbia. \\"Ts-a-lis\\" (\\"place of sand\\") or \\"Chi-ke-lis\\" (\\"shifting sands\\") is the Lower Chehalis word for a historic native village at today Westport. Early explorers pronounced the word \\"Chehalis\\" and gave this name to the river and the people living upriver who later became the \\"Chehalis people\\" or \\"People of the Sands\\". The Chehalis people of Washington consists of two divisions, speaking two distinct languages, which were not mutually intelligible: The Upper Chehalis or Kwaiailk and the Lower Chehalis, the boundary between the two groups was the confluence of the Chehalis River and Satsop River. Today, Chehalis people are enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation (Upper and Lower Chehalis), the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation (predominately Lower Chehalis), Shoalwater Bay Tribe (Lower Chehalis), and Cowlitz Indian Tribe (Upper Chehalis). Chehalis- Population estimates in United States (2010) counts about 250 Upper Chehalis, and 500 Lower Chehalis.  Tribal lands and Chehalis bands or village groups  The \\"Upper Chehalis bands\\" hunted from the mountains, across the prairies, and fished the Cowlitz, Upper Chehalis, Newaukum, Skookumchuck, Black, and Satsop rivers, the \\"Lower Chehalis bands\\" fished the Middle and Lower Chehalis, Wynoochee, Wishkah, Humptulips, Elk, Johns, Hoquiam, North, Willapa, Niawiakum, and Palix rivers to Grays Harbor and in the Lower Puget Sound. Like many Northwest Coast natives, the Chehalis relied on fishing from local rivers for food and built plank houses (longhouses) to protect themselves from the harsh, wet winters west of the Cascade Mountains. Lower Chehalis bands or village groups (from the Pacific coast westward inland to below the Satsop River mouth into Chehalis River; with their dependence on natural resources like cedar and fish, especially on Pacific salmon, living in compact villages composed of Plank houses they differed little from their Coast Salish neighbors of the Pacific Northwest Coast): * Copalis (on Copalis River and the Pacific Coast between the mouth of Joe Creek and Grays Harbor, in 1805, Lewis and Clark estimated a population of 200 Copalis in 10 houses, the 5 individuals assigned to a \\"Chepalis\\" tribe in an enumeration given by Olson of the year 1888 probably refers to them. Most Copalis are part of the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, other Copalis descent are enrolled with the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation) * Humptulips (on the Humptulips River, and part of Grays Harbor, including also Hoquiam River and Wishkah River (Hwish-kahl), meaning \\"stinking water\\", today part of the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, the Shoalwater Bay Tribe, and Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation) ** Hli'mtimi (near North Cove on north coast of Willapa Bay) ** Hooshkal (on the north shore of Grays Harbor) ** Hoquiam (from Ho'-kwee-um or Ho-kwim - \\"hungry for wood\\", name of a Chehalis village at present Hoquiam, Washington, named because of the great amount of driftwood at the mouth of the Hoquiam River) ** Kishkallen (on the north shore of Grays Harbor) ** Klimmim (Gibbs), 1877, no location mentioned) ** Kplelch (at the mouth of North River into Willapa Bay) ** Kwapks (at the mouth of North River) ** Mo'niltimsh (at Georgetown) ** Nooachhummik (on the coast north of Grays Harbor) ** Nookalthu (north of Grays Harbor) ** Nu'moihanhl (at Tokeland, Washington on north coast of Willapa Bay, named after 19th century Chief Toke) ** Whiskah or Whishkah (lived along Wishkah River, a tributary of the Chehalis River) * Wynoochee (on Wynoochee River, today part of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation and the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation) Upper Chehalis bands or village groups (along the Satsop River and above its mouth westward upriver the Chehalis River, they depended more on wild plants and edible vegetables or fruits (camassia, bitterroot, kouse root, serviceberry, chokecherry, huckleberry, and wild strawberry), fish, especially salmon, and game, and had seasonal villages, by 1800 they had adopted the Horse, allowing them to enlarge their trade and groups of hunters rode far to hunt deer, and elk, their culture therefore resembles that of their Interior Salish neighbors of the Northwest Plateau): * Satsop (along Satsop River, today part of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation) * Kwaiailk (Q'ʷay'áyiłq') or Upper Chehalis proper (Kwaiailk / Q'ʷay'áyiłq' was the name of one of at least four bands of Upper Chehalis, they inhabited the Upper Chehalis River country, an area that extended from Cloquallam Creek to the Upper Chehalis River, above the Satsop River, and on the Cowlitz River, they spoke two dialects - Oakville Chehalis dialect west of Grand Mound, Washington, and Tenino Chehalis dialect southeast of Grand Mound. In 1855, according to Gibbs, they numbered 216, but were becoming amalgamated with the Cowlitz, today most are part of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, some also Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation) Language The Lower and Upper Chehalis languages belong to the Coast Salish family of languages among Northwest Coast indigenous peoples. Reservation The Chehalis people settled on their current Chehalis Indian Reservation () along the Chehalis River in 1860. The reservation has a land area of 18.188 km² (7.022 sq mi) in southeastern Grays Harbor and southwestern Thurston Counties. As of the 2000 census its resident population was 691 persons. The major communities within the reservation are Chehalis Village and part of the city of Oakville. In the 2010 census, the population increased to 853 members. 639 of them were full-blooded.

Due to the lack of development, exploration, and cartographic limits of the time, the exact boundaries, ownership, and administration of the region were not precisely defined when the territory was extant. There is also not a definitive date when the British first asserted sovereignty over the territory. Maps vary in defining the boundaries of the territory; however, in modern usage, the region is generally accepted to be the region bounded by modern-day British Columbia, the continental divide with Rupert's Land, Russian America (later Alaska,) and the Arctic Ocean. The territory covered what is now the Yukon, mainland Northwest Territories, northwestern mainland Nunavut, northwestern Saskatchewan, and northern Alberta. Northern modern-day British Columbia is sometimes also considered to have been part of the territory as well. The North-Western Territory was not technically of the part of land granted to the Hudson's Bay Company in May 1670 as the region did not drain into Hudson's Bay.\\"The Royal Charter of the Hudson's Bay Company\\". HBC Heritage. Archived from the original on 7 October 2015. Retrieved 5 October 2015. However, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was still the de facto administrator of the region and the territory was included in the same process of transferring Rupert's Land to Canada from the HBC, effective on July 15, 1870. History It is obscure when exactly the United Kingdom first asserted sovereignty over the territory; however, after France accepted British sovereignty over the Hudson Bay coast by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the UK was the only European power with practical access to that part of the continent. The Hudson's Bay Company, despite the royal charter assigning only Rupert's Land to the company, had long used the region as part of its trading area. The North West Company also hunted and trapped on the land and this led to frequent conflicts between the companies. To ease tensions, the UK government assigned administrative duties to the HBC, while still allowing The North West Company to hunt on the lands with the passage of \\"An act for regulating the fur trade, and establishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of North America\\", in 1821. As well, large areas of Rupert's Land were not accurately mapped then to know the precise boundaries. The British made almost no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of the area. In accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1763, large-scale settlement by non-aboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by treaty.left In 1862 during the Stikine Gold Rush, part of the North-Western Territory became the Stickeen (Stikine) Territory when the Stikine became inundated by American miners and, to prevent any resulting American claims to or agitation for the region, Governor James Douglas of the Vancouver Island and British Columbia colonies declared the area a British territory. The coastal area at the mouth of the Stikine was part of Russian America at the time, but the British had rights of free navigation to the Stikine by treaties in 1825 and 1839 as well as a lease of coastal lands to the south of it. The boundary of the North-Western Territory in this region, and likewise the Stickeen Territories created from it, south of and northwards from the Stikine, had been set as \\"ten marine leagues\\" from the sea, but this remained undefined until the Alaska Boundary Settlement of 1903. The North-Western Territory's boundary with Russian America north of the 60th Parallel had been set at the 141st line of longitude by the Treaty of St. Petersburg in 1825. The year following the creation of the Stickeen Territories, part of the Stikine returned to the North-Western Territory when boundaries were adjusted and the Colony of British Columbia was extended to the 60th parallel north, a measure which also brought into British Columbia its portion of the Peace River Block, which had not been part of the Stikine Territory. In 1868, shortly after Canadian Confederation, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to surrender its vast territories to the new dominion. However, it was not until July 15, 1870, that the transfer to Canada was made. On that date the North-Western Territory became part of the newly created Northwest Territories (often stylized as the North-West Territories). In 1880, the British Arctic Territories were claimed by Canada and later formed the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. In 1898 the Yukon Territory was formed when the areas west of the Mackenzie Mountains were removed from the Northwest Territories during the Klondike Gold Rush, again as with the Stickeen Territory to prevent efforts at American takeover and also to enable easier governance.

Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel's Mother. Beowulf is described receiving the sword in lines 1455-1458: > And another item lent by Unferth at that moment of need was of no small > importance: the brehon handed him a hilted weapon, a rare and ancient sword > named Hrunting. The iron blade with its ill-boding patterns had been > tempered in blood. It had never failed the hand of anyone who hefted it in > battle, anyone who had fought and faced the worst in the gap of danger. This > was not the first time it had been called to perform heroic feats.Heaney, > Seamus (trans., 2002). Beowulf: A Verse Translation (Norton Critical > Edition, NY, W.W. Norton, 2002) page 39. However, although the sword possessed great power and was claimed to have never failed anyone who used it, when Beowulf descended to the bottom of the lake to fight Grendel's mother, the sword proved ineffective. As the \\"fabulous powers of that heirloom failed,\\" Beowulf was forced to discard it.Beowulf line 1528, Heaney, Norton ed. page 40. Hrunting's significance Swords have great significance in the war-centred Anglo-Saxon culture from which Beowulf arises. Therefore, emphasis is strongly placed on the exchange of weapons of war. Weapons such as swords circulated through Anglo-Saxon society as inheritance through family, birthed through the monsters, found under magic rocks, and as rewards between lords and their subjects.Heinrich Harke, “The Circulation of Weapons in Anglo-Saxon Society” in Rituals of Power: From Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages, ed. Frans Theuws (Boston, 2000), 377-78. Occasionally such exchange was also seen between warriors. One example of a weapon as a gift is seen in the exchange of Hrunting. As Unferth passes his sword to Beowulf, he admits the loss of his glory, and his submission to this greater warrior. However, when Hrunting fails Beowulf in his battle against Grendel's mother, it possibly reflects its previous owner, Unferth, who failed to defeat the hated Grendel.Geoffrey Hughes, “Beowulf, Unferth, and Hrunting: an interpretation” in English Studies (58, 1977), 393-95. In addition, Beowulf's defeat of Grendel prompts the Danish king Hrothgar to bestow upon him many gifts consisting of weapons; this further emphasizes the importance of weaponry to such a society. Beowulf then passes on his rewards to his king Hygelac, thereby establishing his obligation to his king.Harke, “Circulation of Weapons,” 379. Hrunting's various meanings demonstrate that weapons of war can carry not only positive, but also negative, significance. Symbolism of Hrunting Unferth's very act of giving Hrunting to Beowulf and the sword's unexpected failure in the battle against Grendel's mother bear much symbolism in the poem. Given that Unferth shows his dislike for Beowulf early in the story, Unferth's choice to award Beowulf with Hrunting, which means “thrusting,”Lee, Alvin A (1998). Gold-Hall and Earth-Dragon: Beowulf as Metaphor. University of Toronto Press. p. 61. Many commentators do not offer a meaning to the name. Malone, Kemp, \\"Some Linguistic Studies of 1929 and 1930\\", Modern Language Notes, vol 46, nr.1 (Jan. 1931) p.2, \\"Unferth's sword Hrunting evidently had a name meaning 'the sword that originally belonged to Hrunta (or Hrunt).'\\" and again, Malone, Kemp, \\"Hildeburg and Hengest\\" ELH: Journal of English Literary History, vol. 10, nr.4 (Dec. 1943) pages 277-278, \\"The base hrunt of Hrunting answers to the Scandinavian sword-name Hrotti, recorded in the Elder Edda and identical with the word hrotti 'big person; brute' ... The sword Hrotti belong to Fáfnir, to whom such a nickname as Hrotti would be eminently applicable. ... Put into Old English, the nickname Hrotti would take the form Hrunta, and from this form the sword-name Hrunting was derived....\\" can be interpreted as a sign of peace and acceptance. In this light, the giving of the sword seems to be an indication of Unferth's recognition of Beowulf as a capable and powerful warrior. On the other hand, the poem portrays Unferth as a sly and treacherous man. Furthermore, scholars even propose that Hrunting is “the very sword with which [Unferth] slew his own kin.”Ettlinger, Ellen (1943). Beowulf, Unferth and Hrunting: An Interpretation in Man, Vol. 43, (Jan. – Feb., 1943), pp.11-17. It is possible then that Unferth's motive in giving away his sword upon being confronted with the problem of Grendel's mother could very well be to avoid going into battle. The passing of Hrunting from Unferth's hand to Beowulf is therefore a reflection of Unferth's treachery as he abandons his role as a warrior of Heorot.Beowulf, Burton Raffel, pg154 At first glance, Unferth's sudden act of generosity towards Beowulf appears to have been done for noble reasons. However, what is known about Unferth and the sword's inefficacy in battle strongly suggest that Unferth's intentions are cowardly rather than noble - something reinforced by the similarly equivocal role played by the sword's \\"hafted\\" counterpart in Grettis Saga.C. Tolkien ed., J. R. R. Tolkien: Beowulf (2015) p. 210 Hrunting's failure The reason behind Hrunting's failing against Grendel's Mother has been a point of much scholarly debate. J.L. Rosier, in A Design for Treachery: The Unferth Intrigue, puts forth the contention that Unferth deliberately gave Beowulf a sword that he knew would fail, possibly for the purpose of preventing Beowulf from succeeding where Unferth himself failed.Rosier, J. L. \\"A Design for Treachery: The Unferth Intrigue.\\" PiMLA, LXXVII (March 1962), 1-7. Yet this point has been contested by J.D.A Oglivy, who notes that the poem itself offers another explanation. First, Oglivy notes that if Unferth supplied an inferior weapon then it doesn't follow for the poet to have gone into extensive detail about the magical infallibility of the sword.

Another explanation that has been put forth connects Hrunting's failure to the broader underlying message of Christianity prevalent throughout the poem. Kent Gould, in his essay \\"Beowulf\\" and Folktale Morphology: God as Magical Donor, suggests that Hrunting fails because it was given to Beowulf by Unferth, a heathen. Only the more powerful replacement blade that God gives Beowulf is capable of destroying evil. According to Gould, \\"the message would be clear enough to the poem's Christian audience: only God can contribute enough power to overcome enemies to whom the poem has elsewhere given a Scriptural history.\\"Gould, Kent. \\"'Beowulf' and Folktale Morphology: God as Magical Donor.\\" Folklore, Vol. 96, No. 1.

The small amount of emulsifiers naturally found in butter are used to form an oil-in-water emulsion. Although similar to hollandaise in concept, it is considered neither a classic leading nor compound sauce.(1995), On Cooking, Sarah R. Labensky, Salan M. Hause, Priscilla A. Martel This sauce originates in Loire Valley cuisine.  Origin  The chef Clémence Lefeuvre (née Clémence Prau) invented beurre blanc, apparently by accident, sometime around the beginning of the 20th century. She served this sauce at her restaurant \\"La Buvette de la Marine\\" in the hamlet of La Chebuette in the village of Saint-Julien-de- Concelles on the banks of the Loire River a few kilometers upstream from Nantes.St-Julien-de-Concelles Official Website Retrieved 24 May 2008. Legend holds that she intended to prepare a béarnaise sauce to go with pike, but forgot to add the tarragon and egg yolks. Some sources claim that this invention occurred while she worked as a cook for the Marquis de Goulaine at Château de Goulaine.Nantes' Quiz Retrieved 24 May 2008. Aristide Briand, long- time prime minister of France and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at her death in 1932 that it \\"was a bit like national mourning\\". Preparation A good beurre blanc is rich and buttery, with a neutral flavor that responds well to other seasonings and flavorings, thereby lending itself to the addition of herbs and spices. It should be light yet still liquid and thick enough to cling to food also known as nappe. Beurre blanc is prepared by reducing wine, vinegar, shallots, and herbs (if used) until it is nearly dry. Although not necessary, cream can be added at this point as a stabilizer to the sauce. Lemon juice is sometimes used in place of vinegar, and stock can be added, as well.Julia Child (1961), Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Alfred A. Knopf Cold, one-inch cubes of butter are then gradually incorporated into the sauce as the butter melts and the mixture is whisked. The sauce can separate by either overheating or cooling. If it heats past , some of the emulsifying proteins begin to break down and release the butterfat they hold in emulsion. If the sauce cools below , the butterfat will solidify. Derivatives Beurre rouge Beurre rouge (English: \\"red butter\\") is a variant of the beurre blanc sauce that is prepared by substituting a dry red wine for the white wine and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar.

He was captain of the England under-20 team, and has been capped eight times for the under-21s. He represented England U20 at 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Career Liverpool Wavertree born Welsh, joined Liverpool at the age of 10. He progressed through the ranks, becoming captain of the Reserve Team in the process. Welsh trained with the Liverpool first team squad at their Melwood training ground from the middle of the 2001–02 season. In the 2002–03 season John Welsh played only one game for the first team – his début match against Ipswich Town on 4 December 2002 in a League Cup fourth round tie at home – when he replaced Vladimír Šmicer in the 83rd minute. Also, he was amongst the substitutes for a number of European games. His first game in Premiership was against Arsenal on 4 October 2003, when he replaced Salif Diao in the 82nd minute, but he couldn't help his team avoid defeat – they lost 2–1, and unfortunately for Welsh, his first act was to be booked for a foul on Ray Parlour. Welsh featured in Liverpool's run to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute in the round of 16 away tie against Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool would go on to win the trophy but Welsh was left out of the final match day squad. Hull City After three starts and seven substitute appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, in August 2005, John went on a season-long loan to Championship side Hull City. The club were impressed, and in November 2005 agreed a deal which saw Liverpool take promising young winger Paul Anderson in exchange. The swap took place on 4 January 2006. However, three minutes into a match against Preston North End on 10 March 2007, Welsh dived into a tackle with Preston's Neil Mellor, a former Liverpool teammate. Welsh was carried off on a stretcher, and it later transpired that he had broken both the tibia and fibula in his right leg, ruling him out for many months. Loans away from Hull On 31 December 2007, Chester City announced they would be signing Welsh on loan when the transfer window reopened the following day. He made his Chester debut on 1 January 2008, in a 2–0 home defeat to Grimsby Town, and spent the rest of the month in Chester's starting line-up before returning to Hull. He joined Carlisle United on 27 October 2008 for an initial one-month loan making his debut against Hartlepool United. In March 2009, he joined Football League Two side Bury on loan and was released from Hull on 2 June 2009.Windass and Bridges among eight released by Hull Tranmere Rovers In July 2009, Welsh signed a deal with League One side Tranmere Rovers. He had a very consistent season for Tranmere, playing the holding midfield role successfully. Welsh also scored four goals in his first season at Prenton Park, including a volley in the 4–2 victory over Gillingham and a 25-yard strike in a 2–1 home victory over Brighton. The club offered him contract terms for the 2012–13 season. Preston North End In May 2012, it was announced that Welsh had signed for Preston North End on a two-year contract. He was voted Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year of Preston North End for the season 2012/13. On 17 December 2013, Welsh extended his contract with Preston for a further twelve months, thus keeping him at the club until the summer of 2015. Despite Tom Clarke taking over the captaincy for the 2014–15 season, Welsh still played a major part in getting the club promoted via the play-offs. This form was rewarded with a new two-year contract. At the end of the 2018 season he left Preston North End and was given an award for longest serving Preston player. Grimsby Town Welsh signed a two-year contract with League Two club Grimsby Town on 25 June 2018. He was firmly installed as club captain for the 2018–19 season. Welsh left the club by mutual consent on 20 March 2019. Non-League In October 2019 he joined Atherton Collieries on a short-term contract.https://www.betvictornorthernpremier.co.uk/colls-in-welsh-coup-59060 It was announced in August 2020 that he had signed for Stafford Rangers, on step 10 of the English football pyramid.https://www.staffordrangersfc.co.uk/rangers-continue-to-strengthen- squad/ Career Statistics {  + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Liverpool 2002–03 rowspan=\\"3\\"Premier League 0000100010 - 2003–04 1000001020 - 2004–05 3010201070 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !4!!0!!1!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!10!!0 - Hull City (loan) 2005–06 Championship 2020010colspan=\\"2\\"—212 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Hull City 2005–06 rowspan=\\"2\\"Championship 1200000colspan=\\"2\\"—120 - 2006–07 1810030colspan=\\"2\\"—211 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !30!!1!!0!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!33!!1 - Chester City (loan) 2007–08 League Two 6000000060 - Carlisle United (loan) 2008–09 League One 4020000060 - Bury (loan) 2008–09 League Two 6000000060 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Tranmere Rovers 2009–10 rowspan=\\"3\\"League One 454402010524 - 2010–11 414102040484 - 2011–12 443101030493 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !130!!11!!6!!0!!5!!0!!8!!0!!149!!11 - rowspan=\\"7\\"Preston North End 2012–13 rowspan=\\"3\\"League One 361202020421 - 2013–14 362501030452 - 2014–15 320401070440 - 2015–16 rowspan=\\"3\\"Championship 2401010colspan=\\"2\\"—260 - 2016–17 600020colspan=\\"2\\"—80 - 2017–18 90200000110 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !143!!3!!14!!0!!7!!0!!12!!0!!176!!3 - Grimsby Town 2018–19 League Two 4000001050 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !347!!17!!23!!0!!19!!0!!23!!0!!412!!17 } Honours Preston North End *Football League One play-offs: 2015 References External links *John Welsh profile at the Grimsby Town F.C. website *John Welsh profile at hullcityafc.net *John Welsh profile at liverpoolfc.tv * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Liverpool Category:England youth international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Hull City A.F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Atherton Collieries A.F.C. players ","title":"John Welsh (English footballer)"},{"id":"310853","text":"Cementum is a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth. The cementum is the part of the periodontium that attaches the teeth to the alveolar bone by anchoring the periodontal ligament.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 170. Structure Cementum situated around a human molar The cells of cementum are the entrapped cementoblasts, the cementocytes. Each cementocyte lies in its lacuna, similar to the pattern noted in bone. These lacunae also have canaliculi or canals. Unlike those in bone, however, these canals in cementum do not contain nerves, nor do they radiate outward. Instead, the canals are oriented toward the periodontal ligament and contain cementocytic processes that exist to diffuse nutrients from the ligament because it is vascularized. After the apposition of cementum in layers, the cementoblasts that do not become entrapped in cementum line up along the cemental surface along the length of the outer covering of the periodontal ligament. These cementoblasts can form subsequent layers of cementum if the tooth is injured. Sharpey fibers are part of the principal collagenous fibers of the periodontal ligament embedded in the cementum and alveolar bone to attach the tooth to the alveolus. If cementum can be observed on teeth, it can imply that the roots are exposed, showing that the clinical crown (the exposed part of the tooth) is bigger than the anatomical crown (the surface of the tooth covered by enamel). This is often due to gingival recession and may be an indication of periodontal disease. Cementoenamel junction The cementum joins the enamel to form the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), which is referred to as the cervical line. Three possible types of transitional interfaces may be present at the CEJ. The traditional view was that certain interfaces dominated in certain oral cavities. The CEJ may exhibit all of these interfaces in an individual's oral cavity, and there is even considerable variation when one tooth is traced circumferentially. Dentinocemental junction When the cementoid reaches the full thickness needed, the cementoid surrounding the cementocytes becomes mineralized, or matured, and is then considered cementum. Because of the apposition of cementum over the dentin, the dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is formed. This interface is not as defined, either clinically or histologically, as that of the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), given that cementum and dentin are of common embryological background, unlike that of enamel and dentin. The dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is a relatively smooth area in the permanent tooth, and attachment of cementum to the dentin is firm but not understood completely. Types The different categories of cementum are based on the presence or absence of cementocytes, as well as whether the collagen fibres are extrinsic or intrinsic. It is thought that fibroblasts, and some cementoblasts, secrete extrinsic fibres, but only cementoblasts secrete intrinsic fibres. The extrinsic fibres within acellular extrinsic fibre cementum, travel perpendicular to the surface of the root and allow the tooth to attach to the alveolar bone by the periodontal ligament (PDL), continuous with the cementodentinal junction (CDJ). Acellular cementum only contains extrinsic collagen fibres. Whereas, cellular cementum is quite thick and contains both extrinsic and intrinsic collagen fibres. The first cementum to be formed during tooth development is acellular extrinsic fibre cementum.AAP 2010 In-Service Examination, question A-9 The acellular layer of cementum is living tissue that does not incorporate cells into its structure and usually predominates on the coronal half of the root; cellular cementum occurs more frequently on the apical half. In summary, the main types of cementum are as follows: Acellular Extrinsic Fibres Cementum (AEFC), Cellular Intrinsic Fibres Cementum (CIFC) and Mixed Stratified Cementum (MSC) which displays both cellular and acellular cementum. Cellular cementum contains cells and is the medium of attachment of collagen fibres to the alveolar bone. It is also responsible for minor repair of any resorption by continued deposition to keep the attachment apparatus intact. Acellular cementum does not contain cells and has a main purpose of adaptive function. Composition Cementum is slightly softer than dentin and consists of about 45% to 50% inorganic material (hydroxylapatite) by weight and 50% to 55% organic matter and water by weight.American Academy of Periodontology 2010 In-Service Exam, question A-38 The organic portion is composed primarily of collagen and proteoglycans. Cementum is avascular, receiving its nutrition through its own imbedded cells from the surrounding vascular periodontal ligament. The cementum is light yellow and slightly lighter in color than dentin. It has the highest fluoride content of all mineralized tissue. Cementum also is permeable to a variety of materials. It is formed continuously throughout life because a new layer of cementum is deposited to keep the attachment intact as the superficial layer of cementum ages. Cementum on the root ends surrounds the apical foramen and may extend slightly onto the inner wall of the pulp canal. Development Cementum is secreted by cells called cementoblasts within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. These cementoblasts develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the connective tissue of the dental follicle or sac. Unlike ameloblasts and odontoblasts, which leave no cellular bodies in their secreted products, during the later steps within the stage of apposition, many of the cementoblasts become entrapped by the cementum they produce, becoming cementocytes. Thus again, cementum is more similar to alveolar bone, with its osteoblasts becoming entrapped osteocytes. Cementum is capable of repairing itself to a limited degree, but not regenerate. and is not resorbed under normal conditions. Clinical significance * Some root resorption of the apical portion of the root may occur, however, if orthodontic pressures are excessive and movement is too fast. Some experts also agree on a third type of cementum, afibrillar cementum, which sometimes extends onto the enamel of the tooth. * The excessive buildup of cementum on the roots of a tooth is a pathological condition known as hypercementosis. Cementum thickness can increase on the root end to compensate for attritional wear of the occlusal/incisal surface and passive eruption of the tooth. * When cementum is exposed through gingival recession, it quickly undergoes abrasion by mechanical friction because of its low mineral content and thinness. The exposure of the deeper dentin can lead to problems such as extrinsic staining and dentinal hypersensitivity. * The incidence of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival decline occurs from either trauma or periodontal illness. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root's cementum and then dentin to cause a chronic infection of the pulp. Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative obstacles and increased tooth loss. * Cementicles are small, spherical or ovoid calcified masses embedded within or attached to the cementum layer on the root surface of a tooth, or lying free within the periodontal ligament. * Cemental spurs can be found at or near the CEJ. These are symmetrical spheres of cementum attached to the cemental root surface, similar to enamel pearls. Cemental spurs result from irregular deposition of cementum on the root. They can present some clinical problems in differentiation from calculus and may be noted on radiographs; yet, because they are hard dental tissue, they are not easily removed, and thus may also interfere with periodontal treatment. DNA studies A 2010 archeological study has found that cementum has five times the amount of mitochondrial DNA compared to dentin, which is commonly sampled. Teeth are increasingly utilized as a source of nuclear DNA to aid identification of human remains. DNA extraction and the results of genetic analysis from the tissue are extremely variable and to some extent unpredictable. However, the quantity of DNA available in dentin is affected by age and dental disease, whereas that in cementum is not.

In the series, use of this date system is commonly heard at the beginning of a voice-over log entry, such as \\"Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb IV …\\". While the general idea resembles the Julian date currently used by astronomers, writers and producers have selected numbers using different methods over the years, some more arbitrary than others. This makes it impossible to convert all stardates into equivalent calendar dates, especially since stardates were originally intended to avoid specifying exactly when Star Trek takes place.  Original stardate  The original 1967 Star Trek Guide (April 17, 1967, p. 25) instructed writers for the original Star Trek TV series on how to select stardates for their scripts. Writers could pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point, and aim for consistency within a single script, but not necessarily between different scripts. This was to \\"avoid continually mentioning Star Trek's century\\" and avoid \\"arguments about whether this or that would have developed by then\\". The original series would be officially placed between the years 2265 and 2269, with the second pilot beginning on stardate 1312.4 and the last-produced episode on stardate 5928.5. Though the dating system would be revised for Star Trek: The Next Generation, the pilot of Star Trek: Discovery follows the original series' dating system, starting on stardate 1207.3, which is stated precisely to be Sunday, May 11, 2256.  Revised stardate  The three 1990s Star Trek series followed a new numerical convention. Star Trek: The Next Generation revised the stardate system in the 1987 Star Trek: The Next Generation Writer's/Director's Guide, to five digits and one decimal place. According to the guide, the first digit \\"4\\" should represent the 24th century, with the second digit representing the television season. The remaining digits can progress unevenly, with the decimal point usually counting days. Stardates of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine began with 46379.1, corresponding to the sixth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation which was also set in the year 2369. Star Trek: Voyager began with stardate 48315.6 (2371), one season after TNG had finished its seventh and final season. As in TNG, the second digit would increase by one every season, while the initial two digits eventually rolled over from 49 to 50, despite the year 2373 still being in the 24th century. Star Trek: Nemesis was set around stardate 56844.9.  Other stardates  Additional Star Trek media have generated their own numbering systems. The 2009 MMORPG Star Trek Online takes place on stardate 86088.58, in the year 2409. Writer Roberto Orci revised the system for the 2009 film Star Trek so that the first four digits correspond to the year, while the remainder was intended to stand for the day of the year. In the first installment of the movie trilogy, Spock makes his log of the destruction of Vulcan on stardate 2258.42, or February 11, 2258.http://i.imgur.com/Ft2c5bd.png Star Trek Into Darkness begins on stardate 2259.55, or February 24, 2259.

Hill was sentenced to death by lethal injection and was executed on September 3, 2003. Early life Paul Hill was born in Miami, Florida on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in Coral Gables. At the age of 17, Hill was charged with the assault of his father when his parents attempted to get him treatment for his drug problem. Hill said he experienced a religious conversion two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school.\\"Turning From 'Weapon of the Spirit' to the Shotgun\\" , Washington Post, August 7, 1994 Hill later enrolled in Belhaven University where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he would have three children. Early career Hill graduated from Reformed Theological Seminary, where he studied under Greg Bahnsen, a founder of the right-wing Christian Reconstructionist movement.Religion in Today's World: Global Issues, Sociological Perspectives By Melissa M. Wilcox. p. 187. He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused theonomy, a movement related to Reconstructionism. Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a minister affiliated with both the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. He was excommunicated in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for \\"defensive action\\" against abortion providers and claimed a connection to the Army of God.Turning From 'Weapon of the Spirit' to the Shotgun , Washington Post Sunday, p. A01. August 7, 1994 Crime, trial, and execution On July 29, 1994, Hill approached the Ladies Center, an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. When he spotted clinic doctor John Britton and his bodyguard, retired USAF Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett.Arlington National Cemetery records page James H. Barrett Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a Mossberg Model 500A 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett's wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested. Following his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear pro se. i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill's motion to use the affirmative defense of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death. Appeals to the First District Court of Appeals, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari (asked the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997). The execution warrant for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor Jeb Bush. Hill died by lethal injection in Florida State Prison on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, \\"If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected.\\" Hill chose Rev. Donald Spitz as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life. Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed Dr. John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed. Motives and aftermath Prior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to Reconstructionist author Gary North, which set out Hill's views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortionists to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North's responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill's theological arguments, and concluded that, \\"...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God's church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God's moral law.\\"Lone Gunners for Jesus: Letters to Paul J. Hill by Gary North (critical response to Hill) Hill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill's views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no remorse for his actions, and that he expected \\"a great reward in Heaven\\".

The population was 4,097 in the 2010 census. Fort Kent is home to an Olympic biathlete training center, an annual CAN-AM dogsled race, and the Fort Kent Blockhouse, built in reaction to the Aroostook War and in modern times designated a national historic site. Principal industries include agriculture (particularly potatoes and forestry) and textiles. Fort Kent is the northern terminus of U.S. 1 and the ending point of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail. History Fort Kent was erected in the summer of 1839 as an American border outpost during the undeclared Aroostook War. The blockhouse, the first structure built in what is present- day city of Fort Kent, was named after then-governor of Maine Edward Kent. The Saint John River was a log driving route from upstream forests to downstream sawmills and paper mills until the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad and trucks began transporting pulpwood. 2008 flooding After receiving nearly of snow during the 2007–2008 winter season, the Saint John River began to flood on April 29. Nearly two days of nonstop rain also contributed to the flooding. As the river rose, it poured into the downtown area. More than 600 of Fort Kent's 4,233 residents were evacuated. The river's water level rose to nearly , which was above flood stage. Governor John Baldacci declared a state of emergency for the region, flying from Augusta to see the damage first-hand. The Fish River did most of the damage, flooding St. Louis Catholic church and an apartment building.  Relationship with French Canada  The town is economically and culturally linked to the Canadian towns of Clair and Saint- François-de-Madawaska, both in Madawaska County, New Brunswick, directly across the Saint John River. Most children on the Canadian side attend French- speaking school while their American counterparts are taught mainly in English. Sixty-two percent of the residents of Fort Kent are habitual speakers of French. The variety of French spoken in Fort Kent and most of the Saint John River Valley closely resembles the French spoken in Quebec and New Brunswick. It is referred to as New England French, \\"Valley French\\", or \\"Brayon\\". Many residents have American-Canadian dual citizenship. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Climate Fort Kent has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb), bordering on a subarctic climate (Koppen: Dfc). There are four distinct seasons, with winter being the longest, typically beginning during November or late October and lasting well into April many years. Summers are very pleasant, with warm days and cool nights. Fort Kent receives a large amount of snowfall every year, averaging of snow fall. The highest single day snowfall recorded is and occurred on January 30, 1945. The highest snow depth recorded is and occurred on January 20, 1955. The coldest maximum recorded is and occurred on January 4, 1981. The warmest minimum recorded is and occurred on the dates July 9, 1944, July 14, 1987, August 16, 1970 and August 17, 1937. On average, the last and first freeze dates are May 28 and September 17, giving Fort Kent an average growing season of 112 days. Education Fort Kent is served by Maine School Administrative District 27. Schools in the town include Fort Kent Elementary School, Valley Rivers Middle School and Fort Kent Community High School. The town is home to the campus of the University of Maine at Fort Kent. Transportation Fort Kent signed a lease agreement with the Fish River Flying Club on July 8, 2011 to repair, maintain, and operate the local municipal airport, which had been closed since the 1980s. Notable events International Muskie Derby Fort Kent is home to the International Muskie Fishing Derby. The Derby was started in 2003 to provide a platform showcase the new fishery and continues today. It has brought attention to the new fishery and helped bring attention to national TV shows such as ESPN 2's Beat Charlie Moore. This show and other future shows will help show case the fishery to not only potential derby contestants but for a more secure and expanded tourist based fishery. The St John Watershed is a unique muskie habitat. Several factors make it acceptable and necessary to remove some fish from the ecosystem for the fishery to remain healthy. Ploye Festival Along with the Muskie Derby is the Fort Kent Ploye Festival, one of the featured events is the making of the world's largest ploye. This event attracts hundreds of spectators, making it the highlight of the Ploye Festival. The massive ploye, which thus far, measures 12 feet in diameter, can only be accomplished with the help of friends and family of Bouchard Family Farm, producers or the ploye mix. It requires approximately fifteen bags of charcoal to ready the metal pan to the accurate temperature in order for the ploye to be cooked to perfection. It also needs about fifty pounds of ploye mix, much water (which is then mixed in five-gallon pails) and plenty of muscle to stir the mix. Five people are required to transport the mix from the pails to the awaiting pre-heated pan and also four people to spread the mix out as fast as possible. The thin batter cooks quickly, so time is of the essence. Once cooked, the enormous pan is then removed from the coals, and the ploye is taken off with huge spatulas. Pieces of the giant ploye are then plopped onto large trays and brought to nearby tables where they can be buttered with brushes, and distributed to the eagerly awaiting crowd. World Cup IBU The Fort Kent Outdoor Center (previously known as 10th Mountain) has hosted a multitude of World Cup biathlon events, including the largest events in 2004 and 2011, where racers from around the globe took part in various biathlon events in Fort Kent. During the 2011 World Cup Biathlon, Chicago Bulls superstar Scotty Pippen visited Fort Kent to witness the race. 2010–11 Biathlon World Cup – World Cup 8 The World Cup Biathlon will be returning to Northern Maine in 2023. World Acadian Congress Northern Maine and parts of New Brunswick and Quebec participated in the World Acadian Congress to celebrate the rich Acadians history of the area in 2014. Multiple family reunions and events took place during the time, including concerts, parades, and festivals. Can Am Crown International Sled Dog Race The Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog Race was first held on Tuesday, February 16, 1993. Nine teams from Maine, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick competed in that race. In 1994 sixteen teams competed in the 250-mile race and eleven in the newly introduced 60-mile race. In 1997 a 30-mile race was added to the itinerary. That same year, the first Saturday in March was established as the official start date for all three races. The race begins on Main Street in Fort Kent, sloping underneath the international bridge to Canada, then extending into the western parts of the Allagash wilderness, and finishes back in Fort Kent. Three races are part of the CAN-AM Crown, consisting of a 30-mile, 60 mile, and an Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race qualifying 250 mile race.

The prototypical examples of such structures are collections of sets for which the lattice operations can be given by set union and intersection. Indeed, these lattices of sets describe the scenery completely: every distributive lattice is--up to isomorphism-- given as such a lattice of sets. Definition As in the case of arbitrary lattices, one can choose to consider a distributive lattice L either as a structure of order theory or of universal algebra. Both views and their mutual correspondence are discussed in the article on lattices. In the present situation, the algebraic description appears to be more convenient: A lattice (L,∨,∧) is distributive if the following additional identity holds for all x, y, and z in L: : x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z). Viewing lattices as partially ordered sets, this says that the meet operation preserves non-empty finite joins. It is a basic fact of lattice theory that the above condition is equivalent to its dual: §6, Theorem 9 : x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z) for all x, y, and z in L.For individual elements x, y, z, e.g. the first equation may be violated, but the second may hold; see the N5 picture for an example. In every lattice, defining p≤q as usual to mean p∧q=p, the inequality x ∧ (y ∨ z) ≥ (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) holds as well as its dual inequality x ∨ (y ∧ z) ≤ (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z). A lattice is distributive if one of the converse inequalities holds, too. More information on the relationship of this condition to other distributivity conditions of order theory can be found in the article on distributivity (order theory).  Morphisms  A morphism of distributive lattices is just a lattice homomorphism as given in the article on lattices, i.e. a function that is compatible with the two lattice operations. Because such a morphism of lattices preserves the lattice structure, it will consequently also preserve the distributivity (and thus be a morphism of distributive lattices).  Examples  Young's lattice Distributive lattices are ubiquitous but also rather specific structures. As already mentioned the main example for distributive lattices are lattices of sets, where join and meet are given by the usual set-theoretic operations. Further examples include: * The Lindenbaum algebra of most logics that support conjunction and disjunction is a distributive lattice, i.e. \\"and\\" distributes over \\"or\\" and vice versa. * Every Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice. * Every Heyting algebra is a distributive lattice. Especially this includes all locales and hence all open set lattices of topological spaces. Also note that Heyting algebras can be viewed as Lindenbaum algebras of intuitionistic logic, which makes them a special case of the first example. * Every totally ordered set is a distributive lattice with max as join and min as meet. * The natural numbers form a (conditionally complete) distributive lattice by taking the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This lattice also has a least element, namely 1, which therefore serves as the identity element for joins. * Given a positive integer n, the set of all positive divisors of n forms a distributive lattice, again with the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This is a Boolean algebra if and only if n is square-free. * A lattice-ordered vector space is a distributive lattice. *Young's lattice given by the inclusion ordering of Young diagrams representing integer partitions is a distributive lattice. * The points of a distributive polytope (a convex polytope closed under coordinatewise minimum and coordinatewise maximum operations), with these two operations as the join and meet operations of the lattice.. Early in the development of the lattice theory Charles S. Peirce believed that all lattices are distributive, that is, distributivity follows from the rest of the lattice axioms., p. xlvii., p. 33 bottom However, independence proofs were given by Schröder, Voigt,(de) Lüroth, Korselt, Korselt's non-distributive lattice example is a variant of M3, with 0, 1, and x, y, z corresponding to the empty set, a line, and three distinct points on it, respectively. and Dedekind.  Characteristic properties  Various equivalent formulations to the above definition exist. For example, L is distributive if and only if the following holds for all elements x, y, z in L: : (x\\\\wedge y)\\\\vee (y\\\\wedge z)\\\\vee (z\\\\wedge x) = (x\\\\vee y)\\\\wedge (y\\\\vee z)\\\\wedge (z\\\\vee x). Similarly, L is distributive if and only if : x\\\\wedge z = y\\\\wedge z and x\\\\vee z = y\\\\vee z always imply x=y. Image:M3 1xyz0.svgThe diamond lattice M3 is non- distributive: = x ∧ 1 = x ≠ 0 = 0 ∨ 0 = . Image:N5 1xyz0.svgThe pentagon lattice N5 is non-distributive: = x ∧ 1 = x ≠ z = 0 ∨ z = . Distributive lattice which contains N5 (solid lines, left) and M3 (right) as subset, but not as sublattice The simplest non-distributive lattices are M3, the \\"diamond lattice\\", and N5, the \\"pentagon lattice\\". A lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to M3 or N5; a sublattice is a subset that is closed under the meet and join operations of the original lattice. Note that this is not the same as being a subset that is a lattice under the original order (but possibly with different join and meet operations). Further characterizations derive from the representation theory in the next section. Finally distributivity entails several other pleasant properties. For example, an element of a distributive lattice is meet-prime if and only if it is meet-irreducible, though the latter is in general a weaker property. By duality, the same is true for join-prime and join-irreducible elements.See Birkhoff's representation theorem#The partial order of join- irreducibles. If a lattice is distributive, its covering relation forms a median graph.. Furthermore, every distributive lattice is also modular.  Representation theory  The introduction already hinted at the most important characterization for distributive lattices: a lattice is distributive if and only if it is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (closed under set union and intersection). That set union and intersection are indeed distributive in the above sense is an elementary fact. The other direction is less trivial, in that it requires the representation theorems stated below. The important insight from this characterization is that the identities (equations) that hold in all distributive lattices are exactly the ones that hold in all lattices of sets in the above sense. Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices states that every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of the poset of its join-prime (equivalently: join-irreducible) elements. This establishes a bijection (up to isomorphism) between the class of all finite posets and the class of all finite distributive lattices. This bijection can be extended to a duality of categories between homomorphisms of finite distributive lattices and monotone functions of finite posets. Generalizing this result to infinite lattices, however, requires adding further structure. Another early representation theorem is now known as Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices (the name honors Marshall Harvey Stone, who first proved it). It characterizes distributive lattices as the lattices of compact open sets of certain topological spaces. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Stone's famous representation theorem for Boolean algebras and as a specialization of the general setting of Stone duality. A further important representation was established by Hilary Priestley in her representation theorem for distributive lattices. In this formulation, a distributive lattice is used to construct a topological space with an additional partial order on its points, yielding a (completely order-separated) ordered Stone space (or Priestley space). The original lattice is recovered as the collection of clopen lower sets of this space. As a consequence of Stone's and Priestley's theorems, one easily sees that any distributive lattice is really isomorphic to a lattice of sets. However, the proofs of both statements require the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice.  Free distributive lattices  Free distributive lattices on zero, one, two, and three generators. The elements labeled \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" are the empty join and meet, and the element labeled \\"majority\\" is (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z) ∧ (y ∨ z). The free distributive lattice over a set of generators G can be constructed much more easily than a general free lattice. The first observation is that, using the laws of distributivity, every term formed by the binary operations \\\\lor and \\\\land on a set of generators can be transformed into the following equivalent normal form: :M_1 \\\\lor M_2 \\\\lor \\\\cdots \\\\lor M_n, where M_i are finite meets of elements of G. Moreover, since both meet and join are associative, commutative and idempotent, one can ignore duplicates and order, and represent a join of meets like the one above as a set of sets: :\\\\\\\\{N_1, N_2, \\\\ldots, N_n\\\\\\\\}, where the N_i are finite subsets of G. However, it is still possible that two such terms denote the same element of the distributive lattice. This occurs when there are indices j and k such that N_j is a subset of N_k. In this case the meet of N_k will be below the meet of N_j, and hence one can safely remove the redundant set N_k without changing the interpretation of the whole term. Consequently, a set of finite subsets of G will be called irredundant whenever all of its elements N_i are mutually incomparable (with respect to the subset ordering); that is, when it forms an antichain of finite sets. Now the free distributive lattice over a set of generators G is defined on the set of all finite irredundant sets of finite subsets of G. The join of two finite irredundant sets is obtained from their union by removing all redundant sets. Likewise the meet of two sets S and T is the irredundant version of \\\\\\\\{N \\\\cup M \\\\mid N \\\\in S, M \\\\in T\\\\\\\\}. The verification that this structure is a distributive lattice with the required universal property is routine. The number of elements in free distributive lattices with n generators is given by the Dedekind numbers. These numbers grow rapidly, and are known only for n ≤ 8; they are :2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 . The numbers above count the number of elements in free distributive lattices in which the lattice operations are joins and meets of finite sets of elements, including the empty set. If empty joins and empty meets are disallowed, the resulting free distributive lattices have two fewer elements; their numbers of elements form the sequence :0, 1, 4, 18, 166, 7579, 7828352, 2414682040996, 56130437228687557907786 .

The algebraic and coalgebraic structures are made compatible with a few more axioms. Specifically, the comultiplication and the counit are both unital algebra homomorphisms, or equivalently, the multiplication and the unit of the algebra both are coalgebra morphisms. (These statements are equivalent since they are expressed by the same commutative diagrams.) Similar bialgebras are related by bialgebra homomorphisms. A bialgebra homomorphism is a linear map that is both an algebra and a coalgebra homomorphism.

Then, diagrams 1 and 3 say that Δ: B → B ⊗ B is a homomorphism of unital (associative) algebras (B, ∇, η) and (B ⊗ B, ∇2, η2) :\\\\Delta \\\\circ abla = abla_2 \\\\circ (\\\\Delta \\\\otimes \\\\Delta) : (B \\\\otimes B) \\\\to (B \\\\otimes B), or simply Δ(xy) = Δ(x) Δ(y), :\\\\Delta \\\\circ \\\\eta = \\\\eta_2 : K \\\\to (B \\\\otimes B), or simply Δ(1B) = 1B ⊗ B; diagrams 2 and 4 say that ε: B → K is a homomorphism of unital (associative) algebras (B, ∇, η) and (K, ∇0, η0): :\\\\epsilon \\\\circ abla = abla_0 \\\\circ (\\\\epsilon \\\\otimes \\\\epsilon) : (B \\\\otimes B) \\\\to K, or simply ε(xy) = ε(x) ε(y) :\\\\epsilon \\\\circ \\\\eta = \\\\eta_0 : K \\\\to K, or simply ε(1B) = 1K. Equivalently, diagrams 1 and 2 say that ∇: B ⊗ B → B is a homomorphism of (counital coassociative) coalgebras (B ⊗ B, Δ2, ε2) and (B, Δ, ε): : abla \\\\otimes abla \\\\circ \\\\Delta_2 = \\\\Delta \\\\circ abla : (B \\\\otimes B) \\\\to (B \\\\otimes B), : abla_0 \\\\circ \\\\epsilon_2 = \\\\epsilon \\\\circ abla : (B \\\\otimes B) \\\\to K; diagrams 3 and 4 say that η: K → B is a homomorphism of (counital coassociative) coalgebras (K, Δ0, ε0) and (B, Δ, ε): :\\\\eta_2 \\\\circ \\\\Delta_0 = \\\\Delta \\\\circ \\\\eta : K \\\\to (B \\\\otimes B), :\\\\eta_0 \\\\circ \\\\epsilon_0 = \\\\epsilon \\\\circ \\\\eta : K \\\\to K, where :\\\\epsilon_0 =\\\\epsilon \\\\circ \\\\eta . Examples Group bialgebra An example of a bialgebra is the set of functions from a group G (or more generally, any monoid) to \\\\mathbb R, which we may represent as a vector space \\\\mathbb R^G consisting of linear combinations of standard basis vectors eg for each g ∈ G, which may represent a probability distribution over G in the case of vectors whose coefficients are all non-negative and sum to 1. An example of suitable comultiplication operators and counits which yield a counital coalgebra are :\\\\Delta(\\\\mathbf e_g) = \\\\mathbf e_g \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf e_g \\\\,, which represents making a copy of a random variable (which we extend to all \\\\mathbb R^G by linearity), and :\\\\varepsilon(\\\\mathbf e_g) = 1 \\\\,, (again extended linearly to all of \\\\mathbb R^G) which represents \\"tracing out\\" a random variable -- i.e., forgetting the value of a random variable (represented by a single tensor factor) to obtain a marginal distribution on the remaining variables (the remaining tensor factors). Given the interpretation of (Δ,ε) in terms of probability distributions as above, the bialgebra consistency conditions amount to constraints on (∇,η) as follows: # η is an operator preparing a normalized probability distribution which is independent of all other random variables; # The product ∇ maps a probability distribution on two variables to a probability distribution on one variable; # Copying a random variable in the distribution given by η is equivalent to having two independent random variables in the distribution η; # Taking the product of two random variables, and preparing a copy of the resulting random variable, has the same distribution as preparing copies of each random variable independently of one another, and multiplying them together in pairs. A pair (∇,η) which satisfy these constraints are the convolution operator : abla\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf e_g \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf e_h\\\\bigr) = \\\\mathbf e_{gh} \\\\,, again extended to all \\\\mathbb R^G \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb R^G by linearity; this produces a normalized probability distribution from a distribution on two random variables, and has as a unit the delta-distribution \\\\eta = \\\\mathbf e_{i} \\\\;, where i ∈ G denotes the identity element of the group G.  Other examples  Other examples of bialgebras include the tensor algebra, which can be made into a bialgebra by adding the appropriate comultiplication and counit; these are worked out in detail in that article. Bialgebras can often be extended to Hopf algebras, if an appropriate antipode can be found. Thus, all Hopf algebras are examples of bialgebras. Similar structures with different compatibility between the product and comultiplication, or different types of multiplication and comultiplication, include Lie bialgebras and Frobenius algebras. Additional examples are given in the article on coalgebras. See also *Quasi-bialgebra  Notes   References  * . Category:Bialgebras Category:Coalgebras Category:Monoidal categories ","title":"Bialgebra"},{"id":"310889","text":"In category theory, the coproduct, or categorical sum, is a construction which includes as examples the disjoint union of sets and of topological spaces, the free product of groups, and the direct sum of modules and vector spaces. The coproduct of a family of objects is essentially the \\"least specific\\" object to which each object in the family admits a morphism. It is the category- theoretic dual notion to the categorical product, which means the definition is the same as the product but with all arrows reversed. Despite this seemingly innocuous change in the name and notation, coproducts can be and typically are dramatically different from products. Definition Let C be a category and let X1 and X2 be objects of C. An object is called the coproduct of X1 and X2, written X1 ∐ X2 or X1 ⊕ X2, or sometimes simply X1 \\\\+ X2, if there exist morphisms i1 : X1 -> X1 ∐ X2 and i2 : X2 -> X1 ∐ X2 satisfying the following universal property: for any object Y and any morphisms f1 : X1 -> Y and f2 : X2 -> Y, there exists a unique morphism f : X1 ∐ X2 -> Y such that f1 = f ∘ i1 and f2 = f ∘ i2. That is, the following diagram commutes: center The unique arrow f making this diagram commute may be denoted f1 ∐ f2, f1 ⊕ f2, f1 \\\\+ f2 or [f1, f2]. The morphisms i1 and i2 are called canonical injections, although they need not be injections or even monic. The definition of a coproduct can be extended to an arbitrary family of objects indexed by a set J. The coproduct of the family {Xj : j ∈ J} is an object X together with a collection of morphisms ij : Xj -> X such that, for any object Y and any collection of morphisms fj : Xj -> Y, there exists a unique morphism f from X to Y such that fj = f ∘ ij. That is, the following diagram commutes for each j in J: center The coproduct X of the family {Xj} is often denoted \\\\coprod_{j\\\\in J}X_j or \\\\bigoplus_{j \\\\in J} X_j. Sometimes the morphism f: X → Y may be denoted \\\\coprod_{j \\\\in J} f_j to indicate its dependence on the individual fjs.  Examples  The coproduct in the category of sets is simply the disjoint union with the maps ij being the inclusion maps. Unlike direct products, coproducts in other categories are not all obviously based on the notion for sets, because unions don't behave well with respect to preserving operations (e.g. the union of two groups need not be a group), and so coproducts in different categories can be dramatically different from each other. For example, the coproduct in the category of groups, called the free product, is quite complicated. On the other hand, in the category of abelian groups (and equally for vector spaces), the coproduct, called the direct sum, consists of the elements of the direct product which have only finitely many nonzero terms. (It therefore coincides exactly with the direct product in the case of finitely many factors.) Given a commutative ring R, the coproduct in the category of commutative R-algebras is the tensor product. In the category of (noncommutative) R-algebras, the coproduct is a quotient of the tensor algebra (see free product of associative algebras). In the case of topological spaces coproducts are disjoint unions with their disjoint union topologies. That is, it is a disjoint union of the underlying sets, and the open sets are sets open in each of the spaces, in a rather evident sense. In the category of pointed spaces, fundamental in homotopy theory, the coproduct is the wedge sum (which amounts to joining a collection of spaces with base points at a common base point). Despite all this dissimilarity, there is still, at the heart of the whole thing, a disjoint union: the direct sum of abelian groups is the group generated by the \\"almost\\" disjoint union (disjoint union of all nonzero elements, together with a common zero), similarly for vector spaces: the space spanned by the \\"almost\\" disjoint union; the free product for groups is generated by the set of all letters from a similar \\"almost disjoint\\" union where no two elements from different sets are allowed to commute. The coproduct of a poset category is the join operation.  Discussion  The coproduct construction given above is actually a special case of a colimit in category theory. The coproduct in a category C can be defined as the colimit of any functor from a discrete category J into C. Not every family \\\\lbrace X_j\\\\rbrace will have a coproduct in general, but if it does, then the coproduct is unique in a strong sense: if i_j:X_j\\\\rightarrow X and k_j:X_j\\\\rightarrow Y are two coproducts of the family \\\\lbrace X_j\\\\rbrace, then (by the definition of coproducts) there exists a unique isomorphism f:X\\\\rightarrow Y such that f \\\\circ i_j = k_j for each j \\\\in J. As with any universal property, the coproduct can be understood as a universal morphism. Let \\\\Delta : C\\\\rightarrow C\\\\times C be the diagonal functor which assigns to each object X the ordered pair \\\\left(X, X\\\\right) and to each morphism f : X\\\\rightarrow Y the pair \\\\left(f, f\\\\right). Then the coproduct X + Y in C is given by a universal morphism to the functor \\\\Delta from the object \\\\left(X, Y\\\\right) in C\\\\times C. The coproduct indexed by the empty set (that is, an empty coproduct) is the same as an initial object in C. If J is a set such that all coproducts for families indexed with J exist, then it is possible to choose the products in a compatible fashion so that the coproduct turns into a functor C^J\\\\rightarrow C. The coproduct of the family \\\\lbrace X_j\\\\rbrace is then often denoted by :\\\\coprod_{j\\\\in J} X_j and the maps i_j are known as the natural injections. Letting \\\\operatorname{Hom}_C\\\\left(U, V\\\\right) denote the set of all morphisms from U to V in C (that is, a hom-set in C), we have a natural isomorphism :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_C\\\\left(\\\\coprod_{j\\\\in J}X_j,Y\\\\right) \\\\cong \\\\prod_{j\\\\in J}\\\\operatorname{Hom}_C(X_j,Y) given by the bijection which maps every tuple of morphisms :(f_j)_{j\\\\in J} \\\\in \\\\prod_{j \\\\in J}\\\\operatorname{Hom}(X_j,Y) (a product in Set, the category of sets, which is the Cartesian product, so it is a tuple of morphisms) to the morphism :\\\\coprod_{j\\\\in J} f_j \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Hom}\\\\left(\\\\coprod_{j\\\\in J}X_j,Y\\\\right). That this map is a surjection follows from the commutativity of the diagram: any morphism f is the coproduct of the tuple :(f\\\\circ i_j)_{j \\\\in J}. That it is an injection follows from the universal construction which stipulates the uniqueness of such maps. The naturality of the isomorphism is also a consequence of the diagram. Thus the contravariant hom-functor changes coproducts into products. Stated another way, the hom-functor, viewed as a functor from the opposite category C^\\\\operatorname{op} to Set is continuous; it preserves limits (a coproduct in C is a product in C^\\\\operatorname{op}). If J is a finite set, say J = \\\\lbrace 1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\rbrace, then the coproduct of objects X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n is often denoted by X_1\\\\oplus\\\\ldots\\\\oplus X_n. Suppose all finite coproducts exist in C, coproduct functors have been chosen as above, and 0 denotes the initial object of C corresponding to the empty coproduct. We then have natural isomorphisms :X\\\\oplus (Y \\\\oplus Z)\\\\cong (X\\\\oplus Y)\\\\oplus Z\\\\cong X\\\\oplus Y\\\\oplus Z :X\\\\oplus 0 \\\\cong 0\\\\oplus X \\\\cong X :X\\\\oplus Y \\\\cong Y\\\\oplus X. These properties are formally similar to those of a commutative monoid; a category with finite coproducts is an example of a symmetric monoidal category. If the category has a zero object Z, then we have unique morphism X\\\\rightarrow Z (since Z is terminal) and thus a morphism X\\\\oplus Y\\\\rightarrow Z\\\\oplus Y. Since Z is also initial, we have a canonical isomorphism Z\\\\oplus Y\\\\cong Y as in the preceding paragraph. We thus have morphisms X\\\\oplus Y\\\\rightarrow X and X\\\\oplus Y\\\\rightarrow Y, by which we infer a canonical morphism X\\\\oplus Y\\\\rightarrow X\\\\times Y. This may be extended by induction to a canonical morphism from any finite coproduct to the corresponding product. This morphism need not in general be an isomorphism; in Grp it is a proper epimorphism while in Set* (the category of pointed sets) it is a proper monomorphism. In any preadditive category, this morphism is an isomorphism and the corresponding object is known as the biproduct. A category with all finite biproducts is known as a semiadditive category. If all families of objects indexed by J have coproducts in C, then the coproduct comprises a functor C^J\\\\rightarrow C. Note that, like the product, this functor is covariant.

Written by Jocelyn Paine. Category:Limits (category theory) ","title":"Coproduct"},{"id":"310890","text":"Incompatibilists agree that determinism leaves no room for free will. As a result, they reject one or both. Incompatibilism is the view that a deterministic universe is completely at odds with the notion that persons have a free will; that there is a dichotomy between determinism and free will where philosophers must choose one or the other. This view is pursued in at least three ways: libertarians deny that the universe is deterministic, the hard determinists deny that any free will exists, and pessimistic incompatibilists (hard indeterminists) deny both that the universe is determined and that free will exists. Incompatibilism is contrasted with compatibilism, which rejects the determinism/free will dichotomy.  Libertarianism  Metaphysical libertarianism argues that free will is real and that determinism is false. Such dualism risks an infinite regress however;Libertarian free will asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen consciously - i.e. are not random. This begs the question: what causes these actions? Since they can't be chosen at random by, as explained above, this question can be asked for each subsequent answer to it, thus forming an infinite regress. Similarly, in the 20th century, in the Frankfurt's concept of hierarchical mesh. Similarly, G. Strawson (1998, 2004), Free will, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. if any such mind is real, an objection can still be raised using the standard argument against free will that it is shaped by a necessity or chance. Libertarian Robert Kane (among others) presented an alternative model: Robert Kane (editor of the Oxford Handbook of Free Will) is a leading incompatibilist philosopher in favour of free will. Kane seeks to hold persons morally responsible for decisions that involved indeterminism in their process. Critics maintain that Kane fails to overcome the greatest challenge to such an endeavor: \\"the argument from luck\\".http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/ Namely, if a critical moral choice is a matter of luck (indeterminate quantum fluctuations), then on what grounds can we hold a person responsible for their final action? Moreover, even if we imagine that a person can make an act of will ahead of time, to make the moral action more probable in the upcoming critical moment, this act of 'willing' was itself a matter of luck. Libertarianism in the philosophy of mind is unrelated to the like-named political philosophy. It suggests that we actually do have free will, that it is incompatible with determinism, and that therefore the future is not determined. For example, at this moment, one could either continue reading this article if one wanted, or cease. Under this assertion, being that one could do either, the fact of how the history of the world will continue to unfold is not currently determined one way or the other. One famous proponent of this view was Lucretius, who asserted that the free will arises out of the random, chaotic movements of atoms, called \\"clinamen\\". One major objection to this view is that science has gradually shown that more and more of the physical world obeys completely deterministic laws, and seems to suggest that our minds are just as much part of the physical world as anything else. If these assumptions are correct, incompatibilist libertarianism can only be maintained as the claim that free will is a supernatural phenomenon, which does not obey the laws of nature (as, for instance, maintained by some religious traditions). However, many libertarian view points now rely upon an indeterministic view of the physical universe, under the assumption that the idea of a deterministic, \\"clockwork\\" universe has become outdated since the advent of quantum mechanics. By assuming an indeterministic universe libertarian philosophical constructs can be proposed under the assumption of physicalism. There are libertarian view points based upon indeterminism and physicalism, which is closely related to naturalism. A major problem for naturalistic libertarianism is to explain how indeterminism can be compatible with rationality and with appropriate connections between an individual's beliefs, desires, general character and actions. A variety of naturalistic libertarianism is promoted by Robert Kane,summary of Kane's views by the Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophyKane, Robert. “Free Will: New Directions for an Ancient Problem.” (2003). In Free Will, Robert Kane (ed.) (2003) Malden, MA: Blackwell who emphasizes that if our character is formed indeterministically (in \\"self-forming actions\\"), then our actions can still flow from our character, and yet still be incompatibilistically free. Alternatively, libertarian view points based upon indeterminism have been proposed without the assumption of naturalism. At the time C. S. Lewis wrote Miracles, quantum mechanics (and physical indeterminism) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality (noting that, under a physicalist point of view, the non- physical entity must be independent of the self-identity or mental processing of the sentient being). Lewis mentions this only in passing, making clear that his thesis does not depend on it in any way. Others may use some form of Donald Davidson's anomalous monism to suggest that although the mind is in fact part of the physical world, it involves a different level of description of the same facts, so that although there are deterministic laws under the physical description, there are no such laws under the mental description, and thus our actions are free and not determined.Sosa -- Free Mental Causation! (MS Word)  Hard determinism  Schopenhauer said \\"Man is free to do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills\\" The Hard Determinist says that obviously, then, there is no 'free will' Those who reject free will and accept determinism are variously known as \\"hard determinists\\", hard incompatibilists, free will skeptics, illusionists, or impossibilists. They believe that there is no 'free will' and that any sense of the contrary is an illusion.Saul Smilansky, Free Will and Illusion, Oxford, 2000 Of course, hard determinists do not deny that one has desires, but say that these desires are causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. According to this philosophy, no wholly random, spontaneous, mysterious, or miraculous events occur. Determinists sometimes assert that it is stubborn to resist scientifically motivated determinism on purely intuitive grounds about one's own sense of freedom. They reason that the history of the development of science suggests that determinism is the logical method in which reality works. William James said that philosophers (and scientists) have an \\"antipathy to chance.\\"William James, The Dilemma of Determinism, p.153 Absolute chance, a possible implication of quantum mechanics and the indeterminacy principle, implies a lack of causality. This possibility often disturbs those who assume there must be a causal and lawful explanation for all events.  Moral implications  Since many believe that free will is necessary for moral responsibility, this may imply disastrous consequences for their theory of ethics. As something of a solution to this predicament, it has been suggested that, for the sake of preserving moral responsibility and the concept of ethics, one might embrace the so-called \\"illusion\\" of free will. This, despite thinking that free will does not exist according to determinism. Critics argue that this move renders morality merely another \\"illusion\\", or else that this move is simply hypocritical. The Determinist will add that, even if denying free will does mean morality is incoherent, such an unfortunate result has no effect on the truth. Note, however, that hard determinists often have some sort of 'moral system' that relies explicitly on determinism. A Determinist's moral system simply bears in mind that every person's actions in a given situation are, in theory, predicted by the interplay of environment and upbringing. For instance, the Determinist may still punish undesirable behaviours for reasons of behaviour modification or deterrence.  Hard incompatibilism  Hard incompatibilism, like hard determinism, is a type of skepticism about free will. 'Hard incompatibilism' is a term coined by Derk Pereboom to designate the view that both determinism and indeterminism are incompatible with having free will and moral responsibility. Like the hard determinist, the hard incompatibilist holds that if determinism were true, our having free will would be ruled out. But Pereboom argues in addition that if our decisions were indeterministic events, free will would also be precluded. In his view, free will is the control in action required for the desert aspect of moral responsibility—for our deserving to be blamed or punished for immoral actions, and to be praised or rewarded for morally exemplary actions. He contends that if our decisions were indeterministic events, their occurrence would not be in the control of the agent in the way required for such attributions of desert. The possibility for free will that remains is libertarian agent causation, according to which agents as substances (thus not merely as having a role in events) can cause actions without being causally determined to do so. Pereboom argues that for empirical reasons it is unlikely that we are agent causes of this sort, and that as a result, it is likely that we lack free will.Derk Pereboom, \\"Defending Hard incompatibilism\\", Midwest Studies 29 (2005), pp. 228–47.  Experimental research  In recent years researchers in the field of experimental philosophy have been working on determining whether ordinary people, who aren't experts in this field, naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility.Eddy Nahmias, Stephen Morris, Thomas Nadelhoffer, and Jason Turner. (forthcoming).Incompatibilism Intuitive?,” Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Some experimental work has even conducted cross-cultural studies.Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).\\"Is belief in free will a cultural universal?\\" Mind & Language The debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other. Still, there has been some evidence that people can naturally hold both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases which ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give incompatibilist answers, but when presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give compatibilist answers).Shaun Nichols and Joshua Knobe.

After the increased popularity of female pubic hair styling or removal, commonly called bikini waxing, male waxing became more common in the 1990s, although the number of practitioners historically and currently is unknown. Male waxing is popular in the body building and modeling communities. The pubic hair removal style that involves removal of all the pubic hair is called the sphinx wax. Unlike the many styling possibilities for removal of female pubic hair, the male practice is mainly total removal, sometimes called manzilian, a contraction of \\"male Brazilian\\", or \\"brozilian\\". However waxing salons typically offer variations on total hair removal from the genital area and often include other parts of the body in combinations of services offered to the clientele. A popular combination is known as \\"the back, sack and crack\\", where the back, the scrotum and the perianal region between the buttocks are depilated. Hair may be removed from the penis too. Technique The technique of male pubic hair removal is the same as bikini waxing of female pubic hair. Waxing involves the thin spreading of a wax combination over the skin. A cloth or paper strip is then pressed on the top and ripped off with a quick movement against the direction of hair growth. This removes the wax along with the hair and dead skin cells, leaving the skin smooth. Home waxing kits have become increasingly popular over the years. A hard wax which does not require the cloth paper strip is sometimes used on the more sensitive areas such as the scrotum or penis. A light oil such as baby oil can be applied to those sensitive areas before wax is applied to reduce wax adhesion to the skin. It is desirable to not cover the genitals with a modesty towel when using oil since the towel can absorb the protective oil, lessening its effectiveness. Application of egg oil for a few days post waxing can help moisturise the skin and reduce inflammation, pain or growth of bacteria. Sugaring is an alternative to waxing. It is claimed to be less painful during application and less irritating to sensitive areas such as the scrotum. The application technique differs from waxing in that hair is pulled out in the same direction as the hair's growth.  Benefits  Pubic hair shaved from the genital area of a mature male There are benefits to waxing compared to other forms of hair removal. Removal of male pubic hair by waxing is a long-lasting method but can be painful if the man is not used to it or doing it for the first time. Hair in waxed areas will not grow back for three to eight weeks; when the hair does grow back, it is soft and thin. When hair is shaved or removed by depilatory cream, the hair is removed at the surface rather than the root. In a few days, the hair can be seen at the surface. With these methods, hair tends to grow back in a rough stubble. Areas that are repeatedly waxed over long periods of time often exhibit a thinning of regrowth, and regrowth that is thinner, softer, and lighter in color. The use of a hair inhibitor will also aid the slow re-growth of hair; used over a long period of time this can be used as an almost permanent method.  Potential dangers  Some physicians do not recommend waxing for persons suffering from diabetes or who have varicose veins or poor circulation as they are more susceptible to infection. Patients on Retin-A, Renova, Differin or isotretinoin have been advised by doctors not to have waxing performed; these medications can weaken the skin, and lead to tearing of the skin.

They were at the forefront of the psychedelic music trend, beginning in 1966. They are best known for the hit song \\"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet\\". History 1964–1971 The band was formed in 1964 as \\"The Trenchcoats\\". The original members were Emil \\"Peppy\\" Thielhelm aka \\"Peppy\\" Castro (vocals and guitar), Dennis LePore (lead guitar), Ralph Scala (organ and vocals), Ron Gilbert (bass) and Jon Finnegan (drums). The band made a name for itself in various clubs in Greenwich Village. The band changed its name first to the Bloos Magoos and by 1966 to the Blues Magoos. Mike Esposito joined as lead guitarist and Geoff Daking as drummer. The band's single \\"So I'm Wrong and You Are Right\\" b/w \\"The People Had No Faces\\" on Verve Records, (both Rick Shorter compositions) did not gain the band much recognition. In late 1966, Mercury Records signed the band to a record deal and the group's debut album Psychedelic Lollipop was released shortly thereafter – following the 1966 trend to include the word \\"Psychedelic\\" on the sleeve (after the 13th Floor Elevators' The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators, and The Deep's Psychedelic Moods, both also from 1966). They played often at the Chess Mate Coffeehouse, a mostly folk venue in Detroit owned by Morrie Widenbaum that also hosted bands such as Southbound Freeway and Siegel-Schwall Blues Band. In a tour of the US in 1967 the Blues Magoos were the opening act, followed by The Who and the headliners Herman's Hermits. The group's most successful song was \\"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet\\" reached number 5 on the U.S. charts, and number 4 in Canada. The next single by the Blues Magoos was \\"There's A Chance We Can Make It\\". By 1967, they appeared on several network television programs including two Dick Clark produced series, Where The Action Is and American Bandstand. They also made visits to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, performing \\"Pipe Dream,\\" and a Kraft Music Hall hosted by Jack Benny. \\"One by One\\" was the band's last single to make the charts. The two albums released after Psychedelic Lollipop (Electric Comic Book and Basic Blues Magoos) were not successful. By 1968, the band split up. The band was signed to ABC Records, but only Castro agreed to continue and started up a revamped Blues Magoos, with Eric Kaz, Richie Dickon, John Leillo and Roger Eaton. The other Blues Magoos moved to the west coast, enlisted Ted Munda, and released the \\"Let Your Love Ride\\" b/w \\"Who Do You Love\\" single on Ganim Records in 1969 before replacing Munda with Joey Stec, formerly of The Millennium, and then eventually going their separate ways. Ralph Scala and Joey Stec later played in The Dependables. In 1969, the Castro-led band completed Never Goin' Back To Georgia. Eaton left the band, and the other Blues Magoos used session musicians for the follow-up Gulf Coast Bound. After two further years the band was dissolved. 1972–present After a stint with the rock musical Hair and recording with Mercury label mate Exuma (Tony McKay), Peppy Castro formed Barnaby Bye with fellow cast members Bobby and Billy Alessi. The group released two albums on Atlantic Records, Room to Grow (1972) and Touch (1973). In 1981, Castro resurfaced again with the group Balance whose song \\"Breaking Away\\" reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In July 2008, the Blues Magoos with original members Ralph Scala, Castro and Geoff Daking reunited for the first time in years for two concerts, including one with The Zombies at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza in New York City. In December 2009 they traveled to Spain for the Purple Weekend festival. In 2014, The Blues Magoos released their first new album in 43 years, titled Psychedelic Resurrection. The Blues Magoos toured in 2015.

The infection leads to swelling inside the trachea, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of \\"barking\\" cough, stridor, and a hoarse voice. Fever and runny nose may also be present. These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. Often it starts or is worse at night and normally lasts one to two days. Croup can be caused by a number of viruses including parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed. Many cases of croup are preventable by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually treated with a single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases. Croup is a relatively common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due to the success of the diphtheria vaccine. Signs and symptoms Croup is characterized by a \\"barking\\" cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficult breathing which usually worsens at night. The \\"barking\\" cough is often described as resembling the call of a sea lion. The stridor is worsened by agitation or crying, and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, stridor may decrease considerably. Other symptoms include fever, coryza (symptoms typical of the common cold), and indrawing of the chest wall–known as Hoover's sign. Drooling or a very sick appearance can indicate other medical conditions, such as epiglottitis or tracheitis. Causes Croup is usually deemed to be due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis (laryngitis and tracheitis together), spasmodic croup, laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity. Viral Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus (a member of the paramyxovirus family), primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases. Other viral causes include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis, but lacks the usual signs of infection (such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treatment, and response to treatment, are also similar. Bacterial Bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. Laryngeal diphtheria is due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae while bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth. The most common bacteria implicated are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pathophysiology The viral infection that causes croup leads to swelling of the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor. Diagnosis {  style = \\"float: right; margin- left:15px; text-align:center\\" + Westley score: Classification of croup severity - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Feature ! colspan=\\"6\\" Number of points assigned for this feature - !0 !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 -  Chest wall retraction  style=\\"width:50px;\\"None  style=\\"width:50px;\\"Mild  style=\\"width:50px;\\"Moderate  style=\\"width:50px;\\"Severe  style=\\"width:50px;\\"  style=\\"width:50px;\\" -  Stridor  None  With agitation  At rest    -  Cyanosis  None     With agitation  At rest -  Level of consciousness  Normal      Disoriented -  Air entry  Normal  Decreased  Markedly decreased    } Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis. A frontal X-ray of the neck is not routinely performed, but if it is done, it may show a characteristic narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because of the subglottic stenosis, which resembles a steeple in shape. The steeple sign is suggestive of the diagnosis, but is absent in half of cases. Other investigations (such as blood tests and viral culture) are discouraged, as they may cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, can be used to confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated. Severity The most commonly used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice. It is the sum of points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions. The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17. * A total score of ≤ 2 indicates mild croup. The characteristic barking cough and hoarseness may be present, but there is no stridor at rest. * A total score of 3–5 is classified as moderate croup. It presents with easily heard stridor, but with few other signs. * A total score of 6–11 is severe croup. It also presents with obvious stridor, but also features marked chest wall indrawing. * A total score of ≥ 12 indicates impending respiratory failure. The barking cough and stridor may no longer be prominent at this stage. 85% of children presenting to the emergency department have mild disease; severe croup is rare (<1%). Prevention Many cases of croup have been prevented by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. At one time, croup referred to a diphtherial disease, but with vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in the developed world. Treatment Children with croup should generally kept as calm as possible. Steroids are given routinely, with epinephrine used in severe cases. Children with oxygen saturation less than 92% should receive oxygen, and those with severe croup may be hospitalized for observation. If oxygen is needed, \\"blow-by\\" administration (holding an oxygen source near the child's face) is recommended, as it causes less agitation than use of a mask. With treatment, less than 0.2% of children require endotracheal intubation. Steroids Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup. Significant relief is obtained as early as two hours after administration. While effective when given by injection, or by inhalation, giving the medication by mouth is preferred. A single dose is usually all that is required, and is generally considered to be quite safe. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally effective. Epinephrine Moderate to severe croup may be improved temporarily with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4 hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital. Other While other treatments for croup have been studied, none has sufficient evidence to support its use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional self-care treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness and currently it is rarely used. The use of cough medicines, which usually contain dextromethorphan or guaifenesin, are also discouraged. There is tentative evidence that breathing heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to decrease the work of breathing is useful in those with severe disease. Since croup is usually a viral disease, antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected. In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended. In severe cases associated with influenza A or B, the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered. Prognosis Viral croup is usually a self-limiting disease, with half of cases resolving in a day and 80% of cases in two days. It can very rarely result in death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms usually improve within two days, but may last for up to seven days. Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Epidemiology Croup affects about 15% of children, and usually presents between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn. History The word croup comes from the Early Modern English verb croup, meaning \\"to cry hoarsely.\\" The noun describing the disease originated in southeastern Scotland and became widespread after Edinburgh physician Francis Home published the 1765 treatise An Inquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of the Croup. Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's ancient Greece, and it was not until 1826 that viral croup was differentiated from croup due to diphtheria by Bretonneau. Viral croup was then called \\"faux-croup\\" by the French and often called \\"false croup\\" in English, as \\"croup\\" or \\"true croup\\" then most often referred to the disease caused by the diphtheria bacterium. False croup has also been known as pseudo croup or spasmodic croup. Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown in affluent countries in modern times due to the advent of effective immunization.

He is portrayed in Star Trek: The Original Series by Robert Herron and in Star Trek: The Next Generation by Kevin Conway. History of Kahless  Kahless (pronounced: /keɪ̯.lɛs/ [kay-les] or /keɪ̯.lɪs/ [kay-lis]; pIqaD letters: \\"qeylIS\\") is a messianic figure in Klingon history, who unified the Klingon people and became emperor after three centuries of there being no one holding the title. The Klingons' most important symbol of leadership, Kahless said that Klingons should fight not just to shed blood, but to enrich the spirit. The story of Kahless is a cornerstone of Klingon mythology and religion. According to the Star Trek backstory in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Rightful Heir\\", Kahless united the empire some 1,500 years ago after fighting and killing the tyrant Molor with the first bat'leth, or \\"Sword of Honor\\". He fashioned the sword with his own hands, by dropping a lock of his hair into the lava from the Kri'stak Volcano and twisting it into a blade. Another epic story relates how Kahless fought his brother, Morath, for twelve days and twelve nights because Morath had lied and brought shame to his family. Kahless is also said to have fought off an entire army single-handedly at Three Turn Bridge. Despite the emphasis on his victories in battle, Kahless was not known as merely a great warrior, but also as a great lover. One day, five hundred warriors stormed the Great Hall at Qam-Chee. The garrison fled in terror. Only the Emperor Kahless and the Lady Lukara stood their ground. Together, they fought through the night and one by one the attacking warriors fell. Finally, after many hours, and with the Great Hall ankle-deep in blood, they emerged victorious, and made passionate love. So began the greatest romance in Klingon history. In The Next Generation episode \\"Rightful Heir\\", set in the late 24th century, on the planet Boreth (a Klingon place of pilgrimage), ambitious caretakers created a clone of Kahless from dried blood from the ancient dagger of Molor in a bid for leadership. The ruse was scuttled by Worf, son of Mogh, who learned the truth and subsequently arranged for the new Kahless II to occupy a ceremonial position as a figurehead “emperor” in the Klingon Empire. An image of Kahless was encountered in the Star Trek episode \\"The Savage Curtain\\". In the Excalbian Yarnek's study of good versus evil, Kahless was one of the evil images alongside Zora, Colonel Phillip Green and Genghis Khan. Abraham Lincoln and Surak of Vulcan represented good and assisted Kirk and Spock. Played by actor Robert Herron, this Kahless also appeared as the typical original series smooth forehead Klingon (which does not date back to the era of Kahless as revealed in Star Trek: Enterprise). As the Excalbians were reading Kirk and Spock's thought patterns, Kahless's depiction here has been retconned by fans to be based solely on Kirk's limited and heavily biased knowledge of Klingon culture. Religion Klingon warriors will often pray to Kahless for guidance before going into battle. (\\"Blood Oath\\") A popular Klingon prayer - often used during the time of Star Trek: Discovery - goes as follows: * \\"Whom do we seek?\\" ** \\"Kahless.\\" * \\"How do we find him?\\" ** \\"Together.\\" * \\"Give us light to see.\\" ** \\"Forever.\\" * \\"Will he hide from us always?\\" ** \\"Never.\\" Legacy The stories of Kahless are the origin myth of the Klingon people. Passed down from generation to generation, these stories remind the Klingon people of their origin and identity. Klingons study these stories for all of their lives; many find new truths in them every time. Many of these stories are held within the sacred texts, a few exclusively. Nevertheless, they remain an integral part of Klingon lore. The following stories are portions and excerpts of song and lore surrounding the life of Kahless: * Long ago, a storm was heading for the city of Quin'lat. Everyone took protection within the walls except one man who remained outside. Kahless went to him and asked what he was doing. \\"I am not afraid,\\" the man said. \\"I will not hide my face behind stone and mortar. I will stand before the wind and make it respect me.\\" Kahless honored his choice and went back inside. The next day, the storm came, and the man was killed, as the wind does not respect a fool. (TNG: \\"Rightful Heir\\") * ...Kahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson for having told a lie, but Morath refused to fight his brother, and instead ran away. Kahless pursued him across valleys and over mountains, all the way to the edge of the sea. And there on the shore, they fought for twelve days and twelve nights because Morath had broken his word and brought shame and dishonor to his family. (TNG: \\"New Ground\\", \\"Firstborn\\") * ...Kahless held his father's lifeless body in his arms. He could not believe what his brother had done. Then his brother threw their father's sword into the sea, saying that if he could not possess it, neither would Kahless. That was the last time the brothers would speak. (TNG: \\"Birthright, Part II\\") * Kahless looked into the ocean and wept, for the sword was all he had left of his father and the sea filled with his tears and flooded beyond the shore. The people begged Kahless to stop his weeping, and he did and walked into the water to find the lost sword. He searched and searched the murky ocean bottom, holding his breath for three days and three nights until he eventually found the sword. (TNG: \\"Birthright, Part II\\") * Kahless later invented the forms of what would become the Mok'bara when he went to the Underworld in search of his father. Kahless showed him the forms, and his father was able to remember his body and return to the world of the living. (TNG: \\"Birthright, Part II\\") * Kahless single-handedly fought off an entire army at Three Turn Bridge. (DS9: \\"Let He Who Is Without Sin...\\") * ...The tyrant Molor was so strong that no one could stand against him. Kahless would rather die than live under Molor's tyranny... (TNG: \\"Firstborn\\") * Kahless went into the mountains, all the way to the Kri'stak Volcano. He cut off a lock of his hair and thrust it into the river of molten rock, which poured from the summit. The hair began to burn, but then he plunged it into the lake of Lursor and twisted it into a sword. ...And the blood was ankle deep. And the River Skral ran crimson red. On the day above all days. When Kahless slew evil Molor dead... And after he used it to kill the tyrant Molor he gave it a name: bat'leth, \\"the sword of honor\\". (TNG: \\"Rightful Heir\\"; DS9: \\"The Way of the Warrior\\") The story of the sword is known only by the High Clerics, because it was never written down in the sacred texts. This was so that if Kahless was ever to return, they could be sure it was him. (TNG: \\"Rightful Heir\\") When the Shroud of the Sword of Kahless was discovered, it was determined that the Sword of Kahless dated back at least 1,400 years. (DS9: \\"The Sword of Kahless\\") * With the Sword, Kahless slew Molor, conquered the Fek'Ihri and forged the first Empire. Kahless would also use the Sword to skin the serpent of Xol, to harvest his father's field, and to carve a statue for his beloved Lukara. (DS9: \\"The Sword of Kahless\\") Molor's defeat is celebrated yearly with the observance of the Kot'baval Festival. (TNG: \\"Firstborn\\") * A thousand years ago, at the dawn of the Empire, five hundred warriors stormed the Great Hall at Qam-Chee. The city garrison fled before them. Only the Emperor Kahless, and the Lady Lukara stood their ground. It was here that they began the greatest romance in Klingon history. (DS9: \\"Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places\\") * Kahless and Lukara were nearly killed moments after they were married, by Molor's troops. (DS9: \\"You Are Cordially Invited...\\") The wielding of Ma'Staka's at the conclusion of a Klingon wedding is a continued tradition in Klingon culture. * Kahless was condemned to die by the tyrant Molor, who was angered that Kahless had incited the people against him. The night before his execution, Kahless asked that he be allowed to go out into the night and say farewell to the moon and the stars, for he knew that in the Netherworld, he would not see them again. Kahless gave his word that he would come back, and Molor let him go. Kahless had given his word and Molor understood what that meant. The next day at dawn, Kahless returned and was put to death. (TNG: \\"Birthright, Part II\\") :This story is contradicted by \\"The Promise\\", indicating the degree of disparity that potentially exists in each of these stories told. Another story that mentions Kahless entering the afterlife said that he was there to rescue his brother from the Barge of the Dead and deliver him to Sto-Vo-Kor. According to the Eleventh Tome of Klavek, Kahless returned from the dead still bearing a wound from the afterlife. (VOY: \\"Barge of the Dead\\") The Story of the Promise * When Kahless united the people and gave them the laws of honor, he saw that his work was done. So one night he gathered his belongings and went to the edge of the city to say good- bye. The people wept, they did not want him to go. And Kahless said, \\"You are Klingons. You need no one but yourselves. I will go now, to Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day I will return.\\" Then Kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said, \\"Look for me there, on that point of light.\\" (TNG: \\"Rightful Heir\\") The story of \\"The Promise\\" indicated that Kahless was to reappear in the lava caves on the planet of Boreth. The Followers of Kahless, or \\"Guardians\\", waited there for his return. To Klingons, there was no more sacred place. For over 1,500 years, Klingons came to Boreth to ask questions. According to the Clerics, the only way a Klingon warrior could find the answers they sought was to: \\"Open your heart to Kahless, ask him your questions, let him speak to you with your mind unclouded by doubt or hesitation. Only then can you find what you are looking for.\\" (TNG: \\"Rightful Heir\\") Clone The Clone of Kahless was created by a Klingon scientist named Gothmara, with the assistance and aid of materials provided by the Clerics, \\"The r'tak of Boreth\\" (ST:DS9 Books The Left Hand of Destiny). By Lieutenant Worf's design and with the cooperation of Chancellor Gowron, the Clone of Kahless becomes emperor of the Klingon Empire in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Rightful Heir\\". The emperor is a figurehead, with power residing with the Klingon High Council. Worf believes this to be the first step in a renaissance for the Klingon people. This idealism is seen to be unfounded when the Clone's opposition to the Klingon invasion of Cardassian space is unheeded by the High Council and their armies. Novels and opera The non-canon novel Kahless, written by Michael Jan Friedman, gives a different version of Kahless' history. In the novel, Kahless left for Sto-vo-kor with a scroll detailing how he really brought about the creation of the new Klingon Empire. The scroll says that Kahless was a loyal soldier of Molor who killed the son of the tyrant because he was acting in a dishonorable manner. Kahless fled with his company of soldiers and was then thought of as a sort of hero to the people. However, he did not think of himself a hero. It was Morath, who was not blood-related but was still considered a brother under Klingon custom, who forced Kahless to stick with his rebellion and slay the tyrant. While Molor was indeed a strong and capable warrior, when Kahless and Morath finally met him in battle, he was severely weakened by the plague happening at the time. Kahless gave Molor his d'k tahg to commit suicide. Instead, Molor threw it at Kahless, but Morath jumped in front of the blade, after which Kahless decapitated the tyrant. Thus, the blade contains the blood of Morath who sacrificed his life for his friend, not the blood of Kahless. Moreover, the book makes clear that the supposed clone of Kahless is a clone of Morath. The novel also describes the creation of the first bat'leth. Kahless had a vision of his dead mate in Sto-vo-kor telling him to do exactly what the myth says (make the sword from his hair and lava). Instead, he draws the image of the sword and gives it to a swordsmith. Despite the scroll being proven authentic, most Klingons still see their Emperor as a semi-divine figure. Kahless is referred-to in the 1984 tie-in novel The Final Reflection by John M. Ford. Captain Krenn tells the story to Dr Tagore, of how the Klingons have one who is not forgotten. When his ship was dying, Kahless had his hand bound to the captain's chair, so none could say he left the bridge. The ship's crew could then abandon the ship, because Kahless had taken on the ship's fate. Krenn tells Tagore that's the source of the Klingon phrase Kahlesste kaase, Kahless' hand, a swear or curse that many of the Klingons in the book utter when impressed or awed. Kahless is the subject of an opera in the Klingon language: ’u’, which debuted at The Hague in September 2010. Other information The character of Kahless was included as a part of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Trek Customizable Card Game Premiere Release Set of the First Edition.

For most of its history the Quartet consisted of John Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (double bass), and Connie Kay (drums). The group grew out of the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie's big band from 1946 to 1948, which consisted of Lewis and Jackson along with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Kenny Clarke. They recorded as the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951 and Brown left the group, being replaced on bass by Heath. During the early-to- mid-1950s they became the Modern Jazz Quartet, Lewis became the group's musical director, and they made several recordings with Prestige Records, including the original versions of their two best-known compositions, Lewis's \\"Django\\" and Jackson's \\"Bags' Groove\\". Clarke left the group in 1955 and was replaced as drummer by Connie Kay, and in 1956 they moved to Atlantic Records and made their first tour to Europe. Under Lewis's direction, they carved their own niche by specializing in elegant, restrained music that used sophisticated counterpoint inspired by baroque music, yet nonetheless retained a strong blues feel. Noted for their elegant presentation, they were one of the first small jazz combos to perform in concert halls rather than nightclubs. They were initially active into the 1970s until Jackson quit in 1974 due to frustration with their finances and touring schedule, but re- formed in 1981. They made their last released recordings in 1992 and 1993, by which time Kay had been having health issues and Mickey Roker had been his replacement drummer while Kay was unavailable. After Kay's death in 1994, the group operated on a semi-active basis, with Percy Heath's brother Albert Heath on drums until the group disbanded permanently in 1997. History Background, formation, departure of Kenny Clarke, and Prestige recordings (1946–1955) Two of the four founding members of the Modern Jazz Quartet, pianist John Lewis and drummer Kenny Clarke, met and first performed together in 1944 while stationed with the US army in France during World War II. In 1946, they reconnected in New York, where Clarke, who had joined his friend Dizzy Gillespie's big band, introduced Gillespie to Lewis, who went on to replace Thelonious Monk as the band's pianist. The band's rhythm section now consisted of Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Ray Brown (bass), and Clarke (drums). On Gillespie's encouragement, they began to perform improvised renditions of jazz standards as a standalone unit between sets of the big band's music, as an entr'acte, a practice that had been accepted in jazz since Benny Goodman introduced his trio in 1935. Jackson later recalled: \\"From the first time we performed in that band as a quartet, we became prominent and a part of the band. We would play fifteen to twenty minutes, two or three tunes, and everybody loved it, including Dizzy and the band.\\" Upon the dissolution of Gillespie's band, the rhythm section considered continuing as a quartet under Jackson's name, but they went in their own directions for the next three years. On August 18, 1951, they made a recording as the Milt Jackson Quartet for Gillespie's record label, Dee Gee Records. Brown then left the group to concentrate on working with his wife, singer Ella Fitzgerald, and was replaced as bassist by Percy Heath, who had also performed with Gillespie. The quartet was incorporated on January 14, 1952, as the Modern Jazz Society, Inc., of which the Modern Jazz Quartet became the working entity. Three or four names were considered, including the New Jazz Quartet, before the group decided to use the name Modern Jazz Quartet. In a 1992 interview, Lewis said of the name: \\"It was an arbitrary name, the quickest name we could get cleared for a corporation in New York state. It had nothing to do with a description of the music.\\" Heath later recalled a conversation between the group members that occurred in Jackson's Cadillac on the way home from a nightclub date that led up to the creation of the Modern Jazz Quartet: In April 1952 they recorded for Hi-Lo Records as the Milt Jackson Quartet and also made a record for Blue Note Records with Lou Donaldson on saxophone as the Milt Jackson Quintet, later released on Wizard of the Vibes; the latter record contained the first recording of \\"Bags' Groove\\", which would become a signature song of the Modern Jazz Quartet. In November of that year they accompanied Charlie Parker in a live recording at Birdland. For Prestige Records, they made their first recordings as the Modern Jazz Quartet on December 22, 1952 which, on Prestige CEO Bob Weinstock's insistence, were released under the group name Milt Jackson and the Modern Jazz Quartet. These recordings contained the original version of Lewis's composition \\"Vendome\\", the Quartet's first experiment with combining jazz and fugal counterpoint. Between 1953 and early 1955 the group recorded the tracks that were eventually released on the album Django (1956), including their first recording of Lewis's composition \\"Django\\", another signature piece for the Quartet. In 1953 they also accompanied Ben Webster and Sonny Rollins on live recordings, the former being released in 2001 as 1953: An Exceptional Encounter. In October 1953, the Quartet began its first major booking at Birdland, which was followed by appearances in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Carnegie Hall. Reviewing their appearance at Birdland, Nat Hentoff wrote: \\"If the success of the Modern Jazz Quartet depended only on the support of jazz musicians, this could be the most in-demand unit in the country.\\" Heath recalled: In January 1955, they returned to Birdland, and on the last night of that engagement, Clarke announced that he was quitting the band. He later said that he did so because \\"I wouldn't be able to play the drums my way again after four or five years of playing eighteenth-century drawing-room jazz\\". Lewis recalled \\"He was trying to find himself. There was a change in the music, but it was early when Kenny left so it was easy to handle and adjust to. If we had to make the change later, it would have been a disaster. We had to give up a lot of pieces we played when Kenny left.\\" Heath commented \\"It had to change, because there is no other Kenny Clarke. Kenny didn't want to have such orchestrated music because he was an innovator and didn't want his part dictated.\\" Jackson said \\"The three years Kenny was in the group was an experimental stage. We were still looking for a direction.\\" Monte Kay, who had by then become the group's manager, suggested that Clarke be replaced by Connie Kay (no relation), who joined the group the day after Clarke had left. The group members had come to have various responsibilities besides playing their instruments: Lewis was the musical director, Jackson handled public relations, Heath managed the finances, and Kay organized the accommodation and transportation. On July 2, 1955, the Modern Jazz Quartet recorded their last album with Prestige Records, Concorde; its title track was Lewis's second major fugue-influenced piece for the group. Move to Atlantic Records and international success (1956–1974) Modern Jazz Quartet at Schiphol Airport (1961) In 1956, the Modern Jazz Quartet moved to Atlantic Records, which was switching from singles to LPs and began focusing on jazz under the guidance of Nesuhi Ertegun, who signed the group to the company and worked with them as a producer. In that year, they recorded the album Fontessa and had their first formal collaboration with an invited guest, clarinetist Jimmy Giuffre, recorded as The Modern Jazz Quartet at Music Inn. In October of that year the Quartet took their first trip to Europe, where they recorded for South German Radio (SDR), performed on a month-long Birdland All-Star tour with Bud Powell, Miles Davis, and Lester Young, and had a two-week residency at Club Saint-Germain in Paris. The next year they came back to Europe on their own, performing 88 concerts in four months in Germany, France, and the British Isles, receiving rave reviews. In 1957, they also recorded a self-titled studio album, the live album The Modern Jazz Quartet and the Oscar Peterson Trio at the Opera House, and Lewis's first film soundtrack, for No Sun in Venice. The group recorded The Modern Jazz Quartet at Music Inn Volume 2 with Sonny Rollins in 1958 and 1959 saw Lewis's creation of the soundtrack for the film Odds Against Tomorrow, originally recorded with an orchestra and released in an arrangement for the Quartet as Music from Odds Against Tomorrow (1960). In 1960, they released Pyramid and European Concert, and contributed to the third stream movement with Third Stream Music (with Jimmy Giuffre 3) and The Modern Jazz Quartet & Orchestra. In 1962 they released The Comedy, containing a suite by Lewis inspired by characters from Commedia dell'arte, and Lonely Woman, whose title track was one of the first recorded covers of a composition by free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman. They followed up with The Sheriff and Collaboration with guitarist Laurindo Almeida (1964), along with The Modern Jazz Quartet Plays George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess and Jazz Dialogue with the All Star Jazz Band (1965). They released a collaboration with the Swingle Singers, Place Vendôme (1966), and three live albums, Concert in Japan '66 (in Japan only), Blues at Carnegie Hall (1966), and Live at the Lighthouse (1967). They then moved from Atlantic to Apple Records, for which they released Under the Jasmin Tree (1968) and Space (1969). Lewis, who produced these albums, recalled: \\"Monte Kay was a friend of the president of the Beatles' company, and he felt we weren't getting the attention we should have, so we went there and had two good records.\\" Returning to Atlantic, they released Plastic Dreams (1971) and The Legendary Profile (1972). In 1973 they recorded the last two studio albums before their hiatus, In Memoriam (with an orchestra conducted by Maurice Peress) and Blues on Bach, both of which were released the next year). During this period, they performed annual Christmas concerts at the New York City Town Hall; a recording of performances from 1971 with Paul Desmond on saxophone was released in 1981. Hiatus, reunion, and final years (1974–1997) In July 1974, Jackson quit the group, later citing frustration with their finances as his primary reason. He was also unhappy with the group's touring schedule, which by then had become year-round rather than the previous arrangement in which they had vacations during the northern hemisphere summer. Jackson had previously used the downtime to play and record music that was not in the style of the Modern Jazz Quartet, but felt saddled in the group after they also began playing at summer jazz festivals in 1969 or 1970. The jazz magazine DownBeat compared their breakup to \\"the abrupt disintegration of Mt. Rushmore\\". In November 1974 they performed a farewell concert at Avery Fisher Hall, later released as a series of two albums and then as a complete package, The Complete Last Concert (1988). They had occasional reunion concerts, never going more than eighteen months without playing together, before reuniting in 1981 for a tour of Japan, recorded as Reunion at Budokan 1981 for Pablo Records. They recorded three more albums for Pablo, Together Again: Live at the Montreux Jazz Festival '82 (1982), Echoes (1984), and Topsy: This One's for Basie (1985), before returning to Atlantic, recording Three Windows (1987, with the New York Chamber Symphony) and For Ellington (1988). Kay had a stroke in 1992 and during his recovery was replaced by drummer Mickey Roker, who performed on some tracks on the group's last released recording, MJQ & Friends: A 40th Anniversary Celebration (recorded 1992–1993, released1994). Kay died in November 1994, after which the group operated on a semi-active basis; the 1995 album Dedicated to Connie, a recording of a 1960 concert in Slovenia, was released in his memory. In February 1995, Albert Heath, Percy Heath's brother, became the quartet's percussionist. Percy Heath had become tired of touring by 1997 and the group permanently disbanded in that year after a final recording date. In October 1999, Jackson died, followed by Lewis in March 2001 and Heath in April 2005. Style and public image The Modern Jazz Quartet played in a cool jazz style that combined bebop and the blues with classical elements. There was a marked contrast in styles between Jackson's rhythmically complex blues-based solos and Lewis's restrained manner of playing and classically influenced pieces. One of the first small jazz combos to perform in concert halls rather than nightclubs, the group was noted for habitually wearing formal attire at concerts, inspired by the bands of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford. In his book Visions of Jazz, Gary Giddins summed up their legacy with an explanation of the jazz scene in 1992: \\"... Young bands customarily performed in concert and at festivals, often in tailored suits. Composition was as widely vaunted for small ensembles as improvisation, and flawless intonation was considered vital. Such traditional jazz devices as polyphony, riffs, breaks, boogie bass, mutes, and fugal counterpoint, as well as a repertory that ranges over the entire history of the music, were everywhere apparent. You could say that the Modern Jazz quartet now resided in a world at least partially of its own making.\\" Honors The Modern Jazz Quartet earned a variety of honors, including the first NAACP award for cultural contributions in the field of music in 1957, top billing on numerous jazz magazine polls, and honorary doctorates from Berklee College.

The bat'leth (Klingon: betleH, rough pronunciation: ; plural betleHmey, ) is a double-sided scimitar/hook sword/deer horn knives hybrid- edged weapon with a curved blade, four points, and three handholds on the back. It was designed and created by Star Trek: The Next Generation visual effects producer Dan Curry for the Star Trek franchise, where it is the characteristic melee weapon of Klingons. Curry has called the bat'leth \\"one of the iconic images associated with the show.\\" It has spawned a smaller version, which became known as the \\"mek'leth\\"; in Klingon, this is written meqleH. Bat'leths have become an enduring symbol of the franchise among fans, and they are occasionally referenced in other media.  Description  A bat'leth is a curved blade approximately long, with two spiked protrusions at each end and three handholds along the back which can be used to twist and spin the blade rapidly. Dan Curry created the bat'leth in 1990 for Worf, the character played by Michael Dorn in Star Trek: The Next Generation, after receiving approval from producer Rick Berman. Curry based the bat'leth's design on the \\"Chinese fighting crescent.\\" A martial artist aside from his regular work as a visual- effects producer, Curry also developed a fighting style, with ritual dance- like motions, similar to t'ai chi ch'uan for the use of the weapon.Poe, p. 13. In 1995, Curry developed a smaller version of the bat'leth, the \\"mek'leth,\\" whose design he based on that of a Northern Tibetan cavalry sword, for Dorn to use when Dorn joined the cast, and Worf joined the crew, of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Mek'leths are intended for one-handed use and shaped like a scimitar; they are approximately half the length of the full-size bat'leth.\\"mekleth\\", Star Trek Encyclopedia.  Use in Star Trek  A regular bat'leth In Star Trek lore, the Klingon Kahless created the bat'leth around A.D. (C.E.) 625. According to Klingon mythology, he formed the blade by dropping a length of his hair into some lava from inside the Kri'stak Volcano, then cooling, shaping, and hardening it in the lake of Lursor. He then united Qo'noS, the Klingon homeworld, by killing a tyrant named Molor with the weapon, which became known as \\"The Sword of Kahless\\". The sword was later stolen by a species called the Hur'q during their invasion of Qo'noS. In the Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Sword of Kahless\\", Worf and another Klingon named Kor rediscover the artifact, but it is eventually transported into space to prevent them from using it to attack each other. The Sword of Kahless differs from normal bat'leths as it has five points and one handhold compared to four points and three handholds. In the Klingon language, the bat'leth was originally referred to as batlh'etlh, then was shortened to betleH. The word \\"bat'leth\\", itself, means \\"sword of honor,\\", from batlh, \\"honor.\\" Bat'leths are made of a reinforced metal called baakonite\\"Baakonite\\", Star Trek Encyclopedia. and are normally long and weigh . The bat'leth appeared in 29 television episodes across the Star Trek franchise in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Enterprise and later appears in several chapters of Star Trek: Discovery. The Bat'leth was also used in the 1994 film Star Trek Generations. The mek'leth appeared in the television series Deep Space Nine and in the 1996 film Star Trek: First Contact. The Sword of Kahless appeared in the 2000 video game Star Trek: Armada and normal bat'leths appeared in the 1996 video game Star Trek: Klingon. Some of the bat'leth's uses were in the debut episode \\"Reunion\\", where Worf teaches his son Alexander how to use one. Worf used a bat'leth to kill Durasa Klingon who killed Worf's mate K'Ehleyr. Notable uses of the weapon occurred in the Voyager episode \\"Barge of the Dead\\"in which Tuvok uses a bat'leth to teach B'Elanna Torres about her Klingon heritage, and in the Deep Space Nine episode \\"Tacking into the Wind\\" in which Worf kills the leader of the Klingon High Council, Gowron in a bat'leth duel to give the Klingon Chancellorship to General Martok.  Cultural legacy  cosplayer in a Klingon costume with a bat'leth The bat'leth is considered an iconic image of the Star Trek universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some and a part of Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons dealers, and pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, displays one in his office. However, due to the dangers that real bat'leths can pose, no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures. The rise in the popularity of the bat'leth has led to the formation of martial arts teams aiming to develop a martial art distinct from the one Curry initially developed. Such teams have incorporated moves from ju-jitsu, kendo, , and nunchaku. Bat'leth competitions have been held at conventions such as MileHiCon and StarCon. The bat'leth has appeared in television programs outside the Star Trek franchise. In 2002, it was seen in Stargate SG-1 episode \\"The Other Guys\\". In 2005, a bat'leth was in the background of the US detective series Monk episode \\"Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra\\". In 2010, one was seen in the \\"Chuck Versus the Beard\\" episode of the American action-comedy series Chuck. In 2011, a bat'leth was used in American situation comedy The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Zarnecki Incursion\\".  Legality  Replicas of the bat'leth are often made of metal and can be dangerous. Media reports documenting instances of replica bat'leths being used in crimes have referred to the weapon as a \\"double-pointed Klingon crescent-shaped sword\\", a \\"Klingon- type sword\\", a \\"Star Trek Klingon-type sword\\" or as a \\"double-pointed scimitar\\".  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, it is legal to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are considered to be \\"potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle.\\" They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street. In the court documents, it was referred to as a \\"multi-bladed sword\\", and the judge said, \\"I've never seen anything like it in my life before.\\" The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat'leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat'leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.  United States  The legality of the bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a bat'leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies. The Colorado Springs Police Department said that it was a deadly weapon. In New Jersey, bat'leths are considered weapons and are liable to be seized. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and seized a bat'leth as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare fraud investigation in 2010.

Applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the Hodge dual of the element. This map was introduced by W. V. D. Hodge. For example, in an oriented 3-dimensional Euclidean space, an oriented plane can be represented by the exterior product of two basis vectors, and its Hodge dual is the normal vector given by their cross product; conversely, any vector is dual to the oriented plane perpendicular to it, endowed with a suitable bivector. Generalizing this to an -dimensional vector space, the Hodge star is a one-to-one mapping of -vectors to -vectors; the dimensions of these spaces are the binomial coefficients \\\\tbinom nk = \\\\tbinom{n}{n - k}. The naturalness of the star operator means it can play a role in differential geometry, when applied to the cotangent bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and hence to differential -forms. This allows the definition of the codifferential as the Hodge adjoint of the exterior derivative, leading to the Laplace–de Rham operator. This generalizes the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, in which divergence of a vector field may be realized as the codifferential opposite to the gradient operator, and the Laplace operator on a function is the divergence of its gradient. An important application is the Hodge decomposition of differential forms on a closed Riemannian manifold. Formal definition for k-vectors Let be an -dimensional vector space with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\cdot \\\\rangle, referred to here as an inner product. This induces an inner product on k-vectors \\\\alpha, \\\\beta\\\\in {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!k}V, for 0 \\\\le k \\\\le n, by defining it on decomposable -vectors \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha_1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\alpha_k and \\\\beta = \\\\beta_1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\beta_k to equal the Gram determinantHarley Flanders (1963) Differential Forms with Applications to the Physical Sciences, Academic Press : \\\\langle \\\\alpha,\\\\beta \\\\rangle = \\\\det ( \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\alpha_i,\\\\beta_j \\\\right\\\\rangle ) _{i,j=1}^k extended to {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!k}V through linearity. The unit -vector \\\\omega\\\\in{\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!n}V is defined in terms of an oriented orthonormal basis \\\\\\\\{e_1,\\\\ldots,e_n\\\\\\\\} of as: :\\\\omega \\\\ :=\\\\ e_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge e_n. The Hodge star operator is a linear operator on the exterior algebra of , mapping -vectors to ()-vectors, for 0 \\\\le k \\\\le n. It has the following property, which defines it completely: :\\\\alpha \\\\wedge ({\\\\star} \\\\beta) = \\\\langle \\\\alpha,\\\\beta \\\\rangle \\\\,\\\\omega for every pair of -vectors \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!k}V . Dually, in the space {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!n}V^*of -forms (alternating -multilinear functions on V^n), the dual to \\\\omega is the volume form \\\\det, the function whose value on v_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge v_n is the determinant of the n\\\\times n matrix assembled from the column vectors of v_i in e_i-coordinates. Applying \\\\det to the above equation, we obtain the dual definition: :\\\\det(\\\\alpha \\\\wedge {\\\\star} \\\\beta) = \\\\langle \\\\alpha,\\\\beta \\\\rangle . or equivalently, taking \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha_1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\alpha_k, \\\\beta = \\\\beta_1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\beta_k, and \\\\star\\\\beta = \\\\beta_1^\\\\star \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\beta_{n-k}^\\\\star: :\\\\det(\\\\alpha_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge \\\\alpha_k\\\\wedge \\\\beta_1^\\\\star\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge\\\\beta_{n-k}^\\\\star) \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\det(\\\\langle\\\\alpha_i,\\\\beta_j\\\\rangle). This means that, writing an orthonormal basis of -vectors as e_I \\\\ = \\\\ e_{i_1}\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge e_{i_k} over all subsets I = \\\\\\\\{i_1<\\\\cdots of [n]=\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, the Hodge dual is the ()-vector corresponding to the complementary set \\\\bar{I} = [n]\\\\setminus I = \\\\\\\\{\\\\bar i_1 < \\\\cdots < \\\\bar i_{n-k}\\\\\\\\}: :{\\\\star} e_I = (-1)^{\\\\sigma(I)} e_\\\\bar{I} , where (-1)^{\\\\sigma(I)} is the sign of the permutation \\\\sigma(I) = i_1\\\\cdots i_k \\\\bar i_1\\\\cdots\\\\bar i_{n-k}. Since Hodge star takes an orthonormal basis to an orthonormal basis, it is an isometry on the exterior algebra {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge} V.  Geometric explanation  The Hodge star is motivated by the correspondence between a subspace of and its orthogonal subspace (with respect to the inner product), where each space is endowed with an orientation and a numerical scaling factor. Specifically, a non-zero decomposable -vector w_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge w_k\\\\in \\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge^{\\\\\\\\!k} V corresponds by the Plücker embedding to the subspace W with oriented basis w_1,\\\\ldots,w_k, endowed with a scaling factor equal to the -dimensional volume of the parallelopiped spanned by this basis (equal to the Gramian, the determinant of the matrix of inner products \\\\langle w_i, w_j \\\\rangle). The Hodge star acting on a decomposable vector can be written as a decomposable ()-vector: :\\\\star(w_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge w_k) \\\\,=\\\\, u_1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge u_{n-k}, where u_1,\\\\ldots,u_{n-k} form an oriented basis of the orthogonal space U = W^\\\\perp\\\\\\\\!. Furthermore, the ()-volume of the u_i-parallelopiped must equal the -volume of the w_i-parallelopiped, and w_1,\\\\ldots,w_k,u_1,\\\\ldots,u_{n-k} must form an oriented basis of . A general -vector is a linear combination of decomposable -vectors, and the definition of the Hodge star is extended to general -vectors by defining it as being linear. Examples Two dimensions In two dimensions with the normalized Euclidean metric and orientation given by the ordering , the Hodge star on -forms is given by : {\\\\star} \\\\, 1 = dx \\\\wedge dy : {\\\\star} \\\\, dx = dy : {\\\\star} \\\\, dy = -dx : {\\\\star} ( dx \\\\wedge dy ) = 1 . On the complex plane regarded as a real vector space with the standard sesquilinear form as the metric, the Hodge star has the remarkable property that it is invariant under holomorphic changes of coordinate. If is a holomorphic function of , then by the Cauchy–Riemann equations we have that and . In the new coordinates : \\\\alpha \\\\ =\\\\ p \\\\,dx + q \\\\,dy \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\left( p \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} + q \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) \\\\,du + \\\\left( p \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} + q \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right) \\\\,dv \\\\ =\\\\ p_1 du + q_1 \\\\, dv , so that : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\star}\\\\alpha = -q_1 \\\\,du + p_1 \\\\,dv &= - \\\\left( p \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} + q \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right) du + \\\\left(p \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} + q \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) dv \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= -q \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} du + \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} dv \\\\right) + p \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} du + \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} dv \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & = -q\\\\,dx + p\\\\, dy, \\\\end{align} proving the claimed invariance. Three dimensions A common example of the Hodge star operator is the case , when it can be taken as the correspondence between vectors and bivectors. Specifically, for Euclidean R3 with the basis dx, dy, dz of one-forms often used in vector calculus, one finds that :\\\\begin{align} {\\\\star} \\\\,dx &= dy \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\star} \\\\,dy &= dz \\\\wedge dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\star} \\\\,dz &= dx \\\\wedge dy. \\\\end{align} The Hodge star relates the exterior and cross product in three dimensions: > {\\\\star} (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\qquad > {\\\\star} (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times \\\\mathbf {v}) = \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{v} . Applied to three dimensions, the Hodge star provides an isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector is associated with a bivector and vice versa, that is: \\\\mathbf{A} = {\\\\star} \\\\mathbf{a}, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{a} = {\\\\star} \\\\mathbf{A}. The Hodge star can also be interpreted as a form of the geometric correspondence between an axis and an infinitesimal rotation around the axis, with speed equal to the length of the axis vector. An inner product on a vector space V gives an isomorphism V\\\\cong V^*\\\\\\\\! identifying V with its dual space, and the space of all linear operators L:V\\\\to V is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product V^*\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\otimes V\\\\cong V\\\\otimes V. Thus for V = \\\\mathbb{R}^3, the star mapping \\\\textstyle \\\\star:V\\\\to\\\\bigwedge^{\\\\\\\\!2}\\\\\\\\! V \\\\subset V\\\\otimes V takes each vector \\\\mathbf{v} to a bivector \\\\star \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\in V\\\\otimes V, which corresponds to a linear operator L_{\\\\mathbf{v}} : V\\\\to V. Specifically, L_{\\\\mathbf{v}} is a skew-symmetric operator, which corresponds to an infinitesimal rotation: that is, the macroscopic rotations around the axis \\\\mathbb{v} are given by the matrix exponential \\\\exp(t L_{\\\\mathbf{v}}). With respect to the basis dx, dy, dz of \\\\mathbb{R}^3, the tensor dx\\\\otimes dy corresponds to a coordinate matrix with 1 in the dx row and dy column, etc., and the wedge dx\\\\wedge dy \\\\,=\\\\, dx\\\\otimes dy - dy\\\\otimes dx is the skew-symmetric matrix \\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\,0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[-.5em] \\\\,\\\\\\\\!-1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!&\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!&\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[-.5em] \\\\,0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!0\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\end{array}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right], etc. That is, we may interpret the star operator as: > \\\\mathbf{v} = a\\\\,dx + b\\\\,dy + c\\\\,dz \\\\quad\\\\longrightarrow \\\\quad > \\\\star{\\\\mathbf{v}} \\\\ \\\\cong\\\\ L_{\\\\mathbf{v}} \\\\ = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & c > & -b \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c & 0 & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & -a & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Under this correspondence, cross product of vectors corresponds to the commutator Lie bracket of linear operators: L_{\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v}} = L_{\\\\mathbf{u}} L_{\\\\mathbf{v}} - L_{\\\\mathbf{v}} L_{\\\\mathbf{u}}. Four dimensions In case , the Hodge star acts as an endomorphism of the second exterior power (i.e. it maps 2-forms to 2-forms, since ). If the signature of the metric tensor is all positive, i.e. on a Riemannian manifold, then the Hodge star is an involution; if the signature is mixed, then application twice will return the argument up to a sign – see ' below. For example, in Minkowski spacetime where with metric signature and coordinates where (using \\\\varepsilon_{0123} = 1): :\\\\begin{align} \\\\star dt &= dx \\\\wedge dy \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star dx &= dt \\\\wedge dy \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star dy &= -dt \\\\wedge dx \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star dz &= dt \\\\wedge dx \\\\wedge dy \\\\end{align} for one-forms while :\\\\begin{align} \\\\star (dt \\\\wedge dx) &= - dy \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star (dt \\\\wedge dy) &= dx \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star (dt \\\\wedge dz) &= - dx \\\\wedge dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star (dx \\\\wedge dy) &= dt \\\\wedge dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star (dx \\\\wedge dz) &= - dt \\\\wedge dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star (dy \\\\wedge dz) &= dt \\\\wedge dx \\\\end{align} for 2-forms. Because their determinants are the same in both and , the signs of the Minkowski space 2-form duals depend only on the chosen orientation. An easy rule to remember for the above Hodge operations is that given a form \\\\alpha, its Hodge dual {\\\\star}\\\\alpha may be obtained by writing the components not involved in \\\\alpha in an order such that \\\\alpha \\\\wedge (\\\\star \\\\alpha) = dt \\\\wedge dx \\\\wedge dy \\\\wedge dz . An extra minus sign will enter only if \\\\alpha does not contain dt. (The latter convention stems from the choice for the metric signature. For , one puts in a minus sign only if \\\\alpha involves dt.)  Duality  Applying the Hodge star twice leaves a -vector unchanged except for its sign: for \\\\eta\\\\in {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^k V in an -dimensional space , one has :{\\\\star} {\\\\star} \\\\eta = (-1)^{k(n-k)} s \\\\eta , where is the parity of the signature of the inner product on , that is, the sign of the determinant of the matrix of the inner product with respect to any basis. For example, if and the signature of the inner product is either or then . For Riemannian manifolds (including Euclidean spaces), we always have . The above identity implies that the inverse of \\\\star can be given as : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\star}^{-1}: ~& {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!k} \\\\to {\\\\textstyle\\\\bigwedge}^{\\\\\\\\!n-k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\eta \\\\mapsto (-1)^{k(n-k)} \\\\\\\\!s {\\\\star} \\\\eta \\\\end{align} If is odd then is even for any , whereas if is even then has the parity of . Therefore: :{\\\\star}^{-1} = \\\\begin{cases} s {\\\\star} & n \\\\text{ is odd} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (-1)^k s {\\\\star} & n \\\\text{ is even} \\\\end{cases} where is the degree of the element operated on. On manifolds For an n-dimensional oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold M, we apply the construction above to each cotangent space \\\\text{T}^*_p M and its exterior powers \\\\wedge^k\\\\text{T}^*_p M, and hence to the differential k-forms \\\\zeta\\\\in\\\\Omega^k(M) = \\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\wedge^k\\\\text{T}^*\\\\\\\\!M\\\\right), the global sections of the bundle \\\\wedge^k \\\\mathrm{T}^*\\\\\\\\! M\\\\to M. The Riemanninan metric induces an inner product on \\\\wedge^k\\\\text{T}^*_p M at each point p\\\\in M. We define the Hodge dual of a k-form \\\\zeta , defining {\\\\star} \\\\zeta as the unique (n – k)-form satisfying :\\\\eta\\\\wedge {\\\\star} \\\\zeta \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\langle \\\\eta, \\\\zeta \\\\rangle \\\\, \\\\omega for every k-form \\\\eta , where \\\\langle\\\\eta,\\\\zeta\\\\rangle is a real-valued function on M, and the volume form \\\\omega is induced by the Riemannian metric. Integrating this equation over M, the right side becomes the L^2 inner product on k-forms, and we obtain: :\\\\int_M \\\\eta\\\\wedge {\\\\star} \\\\zeta \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\eta,\\\\zeta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle. More generally, if M is non- oriented, one can define the Hodge star of a k-form as a (n – k)-pseudo differential form; that is, a differential form with values in the canonical line bundle.  Computation in index notation  We compute in terms of tensor index notation with respect to a (not necessarily orthonormal) basis \\\\\\\\{\\\\tfrac{\\\\part}{\\\\part x_1},\\\\ldots,\\\\tfrac{\\\\part}{\\\\part x_n}\\\\\\\\} in a tangent space V = T_p M and its dual basis \\\\\\\\{dx_1,\\\\ldots,dx_n\\\\\\\\} in V^* = T^*_pM, having the metric matrix (g_{ij}) \\\\ = \\\\ (\\\\langle \\\\tfrac{\\\\part}{\\\\part x_i}, \\\\tfrac{\\\\part}{\\\\part x_j}\\\\rangle) and its inverse matrix (g^{ij}) \\\\ =\\\\ (\\\\langle dx_i, dx_j\\\\rangle). The Hodge dual of a decomposable k-form is: : \\\\star\\\\left(dx^{i_1} \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{i_k}\\\\right) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det [g_{ab}]}}{(n-k)!} g^{i_1 j_1} \\\\cdots g^{i_k j_k} \\\\varepsilon_{j_1 \\\\dots j_n} dx^{j_{k+1}} \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{j_n}. Here \\\\varepsilon_{j_1 \\\\dots j_n} is the Levi-Civita symbol with \\\\varepsilon_{1 \\\\dots n} = 1, and we implicitly take the sum over all values of the repeated indices j_1,\\\\ldots,j_n. The factorial (n-k)! accounts for double counting, and is not present if the summation indices are restricted so that j_{k+1} < \\\\dots < j_n. The absolute value of the determinant is necessary since it may be negative, as for tangent spaces to Lorentzian manifolds. An arbitrary differential form can be written: : \\\\alpha \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\alpha_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_k} dx^{i_1}\\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{i_k} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{i_1 < \\\\dots < i_k} \\\\alpha_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_k} dx^{i_1}\\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{i_k}. The factorial k! is again included to account for double counting when we allow non-increasing indices. We would like to define the dual of the component \\\\alpha_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_k} so that the Hodge dual of the form is given by : \\\\star\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{(n-k)!}(\\\\star \\\\alpha)_{i_{k+1}, \\\\dots, i_n} dx^{i_{k+1}} \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{i_n}. Using the above expression for the Hodge dual of dx^{i_1} \\\\wedge \\\\dots \\\\wedge dx^{i_k}, we find: : (\\\\star \\\\alpha)_{i_{k+1}, \\\\dots, i_n} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det [g_{ab}]}}{k!} \\\\alpha^{i_1, \\\\dots, i_k}\\\\, \\\\,\\\\varepsilon_{i_1, \\\\dots, i_n}. Although one can apply this expression to any tensor \\\\alpha, the result is antisymmetric, since contraction with the completely anti-symmetric Levi- Civita symbol cancels all but the totally antisymmetric part of the tensor. It is thus equivalent to antisymmetrization followed by applying the Hodge star. The unit volume form \\\\omega = \\\\star 1\\\\in \\\\wedge^n V^* is given by: :\\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\left \\\\det [g_{ij}] \\\\right }\\\\;dx^1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^n .  Codifferential  The most important application of the Hodge star on manifolds is to define the codifferential \\\\delta on k-forms. Let :\\\\delta = (-1)^{n(k-1) + 1} s\\\\ {\\\\star} d {\\\\star} = (-1)^{k}\\\\, {\\\\star}^{-1} d {\\\\star} where d is the exterior derivative or differential, and s = 1 for Riemannian manifolds. Then :d:\\\\Omega^k(M)\\\\to \\\\Omega^{k+1}(M) while :\\\\delta:\\\\Omega^k(M)\\\\to \\\\Omega^{k-1}(M). The codifferential is not an antiderivation on the exterior algebra, in contrast to the exterior derivative. The codifferential is the adjoint of the exterior derivative with respect to the L^2 inner product: : \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\eta,\\\\delta \\\\zeta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle d\\\\eta,\\\\zeta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle, where \\\\zeta is a -form and \\\\eta a -form. This identity follows from Stokes' theorem for smooth forms: : 0 \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\int_M d (\\\\eta \\\\wedge {\\\\star} \\\\zeta) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\int_M \\\\left(d \\\\eta \\\\wedge {\\\\star} \\\\zeta - \\\\eta \\\\wedge {\\\\star} (-1)^{k+1}\\\\,{\\\\star}^{-1} d {\\\\star} \\\\zeta\\\\right) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle d\\\\eta,\\\\zeta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle - \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\eta,\\\\delta\\\\zeta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle, provided M has empty boundary, or \\\\eta or \\\\star\\\\zeta has zero boundary values. (However, true adjointness follows after continuous continuation to the appropriate topological vector spaces as closures of the spaces of smooth forms.) Since the differential satisfies d^2 = 0, the codifferential has the corresponding property :\\\\delta^2 = s^2 {\\\\star} d {\\\\star} {\\\\star} d {\\\\star} = (-1)^{k(n-k)} s^3 {\\\\star} d^2 {\\\\star} = 0. The Laplace–deRham operator is given by :\\\\Delta = (\\\\delta + d)^2 = \\\\delta d + d\\\\delta and lies at the heart of Hodge theory. It is symmetric: :\\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\Delta \\\\zeta,\\\\eta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\zeta,\\\\Delta \\\\eta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle and non-negative: :\\\\langle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\Delta\\\\eta,\\\\eta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\rangle \\\\ge 0. The Hodge star sends harmonic forms to harmonic forms. As a consequence of Hodge theory, the de Rham cohomology is naturally isomorphic to the space of harmonic -forms, and so the Hodge star induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups :{\\\\star} : H^k_\\\\Delta (M) \\\\to H^{n-k}_\\\\Delta(M), which in turn gives canonical identifications via Poincaré duality of with its dual space. Derivatives in three dimensions The combination of the \\\\star operator and the exterior derivative generates the classical operators , , and on vector fields in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This works out as follows: takes a 0-form (a function) to a 1-form, a 1-form to a 2-form, and a 2-form to a 3-form (and takes a 3-form to zero). For a 0-form f=f(x,y,z), the first case written out in components gives: :d f=\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, dx+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} \\\\, dy + \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z} \\\\, dz. The inner product identifies 1-forms with vector fields as dx\\\\mapsto (1,0,0), etc., so that df becomes \\\\mathrm{grad}\\\\,f = (\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x},\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y},\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z}). In the second case, a vector field \\\\mathbf F = (A,B,C) corresponds to the 1-form \\\\varphi=A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy+C\\\\,dz, which has exterior derivative: :d\\\\varphi=\\\\left({\\\\partial C \\\\over \\\\partial y} - {\\\\partial B \\\\over \\\\partial z}\\\\right)dy\\\\wedge dz + \\\\left({\\\\partial C \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial A \\\\over \\\\partial z}\\\\right)dx\\\\wedge dz+\\\\left({\\\\partial B \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial A \\\\over \\\\partial y}\\\\right)dx\\\\wedge dy. Applying the Hodge star gives the 1-form: :\\\\star d\\\\varphi=\\\\left({\\\\partial C \\\\over \\\\partial y} - {\\\\partial B \\\\over \\\\partial z} \\\\right) \\\\, dx - \\\\left({\\\\partial C \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial A \\\\over \\\\partial z} \\\\right) \\\\, dy+\\\\left({\\\\partial B \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial A \\\\over \\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\, dz, which becomes the vector field \\\\mathrm{curl}\\\\,\\\\mathbf F = (\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial y} - \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial z},\\\\, -\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial z},\\\\, \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial y}). In the third case, \\\\mathbf F = (A,B,C) again corresponds to \\\\varphi=A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy+C\\\\,dz. Applying Hodge star, exterior derivative, and Hodge star again: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\star\\\\varphi &= A\\\\,dy\\\\wedge dz-B\\\\,dx\\\\wedge dz+C\\\\,dx\\\\wedge dy, \\\\\\\\\\\\ d{\\\\star\\\\varphi} &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial x}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial y}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)dx\\\\wedge dy\\\\wedge dz, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\star d{\\\\star\\\\varphi} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial x}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial B}{\\\\partial y}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\mathrm{div}\\\\,\\\\mathbf F. \\\\end{align} One advantage of this expression is that the identity , which is true in all cases, sums up two others, namely that and . In particular, Maxwell's equations take on a particularly simple and elegant form, when expressed in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star. One can also obtain the Laplacian in terms of the above operations: : \\\\Delta f =\\\\star d{\\\\star d f}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial y^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial z^2}.

Originally developed for IBM PC compatibles, it was later ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh, and Commodore 64. A fully revamped version of the game was released for the Sega Genesis in 1991. Set in the year 4620, the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy. There is no set path, allowing players to switch freely between mining, ship-to-ship combat, and alien diplomacy. The broader plot of the game emerges slowly, as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures. The game has been widely praised by both contemporary and modern critics, and is one of the earliest instances of a sandbox game. It led to the development of a sequel, Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula, and influenced the design of numerous other games for decades after its release. Gameplay The player begins inside a space station called Starport orbiting the planet Arth. Here they buy and sell minerals, Endurium (fuel), and artifacts, recruit and train crew members, and upgrade parts of the ship. The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship's six posts: navigator, science officer, engineer, communications officer, doctor, and captain. A crewman's proficiency is determined by the relevant skill: a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet's properties and detect aliens at a greater range, for example. Skills are increased through training, which must be purchased. One crewman can man multiple posts, but different species have different maximum skill levels. The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium, a type of crystal used as fuel. The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons, armor, and shields. The goals of the game include exploration, collection of lifeforms and minerals, and finding habitable colony worlds. Eventually, a larger goal of finding out why stars in the region are flaring dangerously and stopping the process, if possible, comes to the forefront. The main sources of income are selling minerals, artifacts, and lifeforms and recommending planets for colonization. The ship is equipped with a Terrain Vehicle that the crew can use to look for minerals and life-forms. The most lucrative source of income is finding planets suitable for human life. If the science officer's analysis shows a planet to be within acceptable parameters, the player can have the captain log a planet for colonization. Starflight has 270 star systems, each containing from zero to eight planets for a total of 800. All star systems can be entered and all planets landed on, though this destroys the ship if the gravity is greater than 8.0 g. The science officer can scan and analyze the planet for information about it, including its temperature, gravity, and chemical composition. When a landing is ordered, a Mercator projection map shows the topography of each planet, as well as a cursor to select a landing point. Once the ship lands, a Terrain Vehicle can be deployed to drive across the terrain, which is periodically scanned for new information, in search of minerals, lifeforms, and alien ruins. As is the case in outer space, a heads-up display monitors the Terrain Vehicle's status. Space is also crisscrossed with continuum fluxes, coordinate pairs that allow instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time, though it causes all but the most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings. Aliens may be cautious, friendly, or hostile, and all have distinctive speech patterns; the player can influence alien reactions by arming weapons and shields or hailing the aliens with varying communication styles. Alien ships can be also scanned for information. Combat involves maneuvering the ship and firing weapons, either instantly damaging short range lasers or avoidable, but more powerful long range missiles. The weapon used depends on how far away enemy ships are and what the player's ship is armed with. The player's ship has ablative armor and regenerative shields, and can take damage to its hull and individual components. Story Setting The galaxy is composed of eight space- faring races, five of which can be hired as part of the player's crew. Humans only exist on Arth and are not found among the stars. Other species include Veloxi, large insects who demand bribes from ships which violate their space; Mechan, androids left over from the days of the Old Empire; Elowan, a pacifistic race of sentient plants; Thrynn, reptile creatures who are primarily interested in money; Spemin, gelatinous blobs who are known for their cowardice; Gazurtoid, octopus-like religious zealots who regard all \\"air-breathers\\" as infidels; and Uhlek, a destructive fleet of ships with a hive mind. Humor also plays a role within Starflight. Plot The player's starship just outside of Arth's orbit, with the navigator engaging the maneuver command The story begins on the planet Arth, a haven for the survivors of the Old Empire. Due to heavy radiation, the inhabitants have been forced to live beneath the planet's crust for centuries. In recent times, the radiation has finally dissipated from the surface, allowing the population to unearth long-lost technology belonging to Arth's original settlers. The inhabitants of Arth have recently discovered two things: first, that they were once a colony world of Earth; and second, Endurium, a crystalline mineral that fuels interstellar flight. An independent company called Interstel is dispatching ships to mine for resources, particularly Endurium. In addition, Interstel employees are instructed to seek information about Arth's history, alien artifacts, and planets with optimum environments for colonization. Early in the game, Arth scientists discover that stars throughout the local region of the galaxy are flaring, and the home planet of Arth is in danger. By following clues given in Interstel announcements and through contact with alien races in space, the crew discovers an Old Empire starship adrift in space. An endlessly repeating distress call has been transmitting from the ship for over a thousand years. Before the fall of the Old Empire, a scientific expedition known as the Noah 9 left Earth in search of Heaven, a paradise world to which humans could immigrate. The expedition never arrived, leaving a fleet of Mechan ships forever waiting for their arrival. Once their coded questions are answered correctly, the Mechans assume that the crew is, in fact, the long-awaited Noah 9. Further investigation leads the crew to Earth, the home world of the Old Empire. The planet lies in ruins and is devoid of all life, but contains information about the history of Old Empire and its fate. Additional clues are found in the Four Seedlings, a quadrilaterally symmetrical system made up of four suns. Centuries ago, the leaders of the Old Empire realized something was causing hostile aliens to flee from the center of the galaxy. The greatest minds from each of the races gathered at this location, where they discovered that the Crystal Planet was slowly eradicating all life. In a last act, they sent a human named Commander McConnell to end it, but he failed. At the start of the game, the Crystal Planet is slowly moving through the galaxy. The planet causes nearby stars to flare up and destroy all life in the system. The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, and find special artifacts that grant access to the Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry can be found on the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed. Development Starflight was developed by Binary Systems, a five-man team consisting of Rod McConnell, Greg Johnson (lead designer), Alec Kercso (programming), Tim C. Lee (graphics and programming), and Bob Gonsalves (sound). Then-vice president of Electronic Arts Joe Ybarra was also closely involved, and produced the work. The original idea for making a video game was conceived by McConnell and Ybarra in 1983. McConnell hired colleague Dave Boulton, who had an idea for using fractals to generate an endless virtual universe, along with Kercso, Gonsalves, Lee, and Johnson, all of whom were first time game designers. Boulton quit the project early on in development, saying it was too ambitious, with Lee replacing him. The team coded the game mostly in Forth with a few key routines written in x86 assembler. Forth was chosen since it is easier to use than assembler and more compact. This was important because the game had to fit into 128K of RAM. Genesis version of Starflight It took \\"fifteen man-years\\" and three actual years to develop the game. In a 2006 interview, lead designer Johnson said, \\"I had never really designed a game before ... It's funny looking back on it now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded.\\" Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by his friend and office-mate Paul Reiche III, the designer of Archon, during a period where Reiche was \\"supposed to be working on Mail Order Monsters\\". Reiche advised Johnson to draft a \\"story network\\" that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a \\"fractal generator\\", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them to increase the number of planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion. Starflight was released for PC on August 15, 1986. Originally available only on IBM, Tandy, and compatible PCs, it was released for the Amiga and Commodore 64 in 1989 and the Atari ST and Macintosh in 1990, and a Sega Genesis version was published in 1991. The Genesis version has new graphics, modifications to the ship, and upgrades for the Terrain Vehicle, including equipment to allow amphibious mining. Reception By December 1987 Starflight sold over 100,000 copies, and it eventually went on to sell over a million copies. Critical response to Starflight upon its release was extremely positive. Hartley and Patricia Lesser complimented the game in their \\"The Role of Computers\\" column in the December 1986 issue of Dragon, calling it \\"stunning in its presentation and play\\". In 1986 and 1987, Computer Gaming World declared it \\"the best space exploration game in years\\" and \\"the best science fiction game available on computer\\". The magazine named Starflight its Adventure Game of the Year for 1987, and in August 1988, it joined the magazine's Hall of Fame for games highly rated over time by readers, with the third-highest rating for action/adventure games on the list, and the fourth-highest overall. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four stars out of five, stating that \\"Such rich NPCs offered additional suspension of belief\\". Science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle named Starflight his game of the month for January 1987, stating that it was \\"as much a career as a game\\" and \\"fascinating\\". Fellow writer Orson Scott Card wrote, \\"Starflight is the first science fiction computer game that actually gives you something of the experience of roaming through the galaxy. ... I have found this game obsessively fascinating—and the graphics and player interface are superb\\". He called it the \\"Star Wars of science fiction games. Brilliantly designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space- exploration games must be measured\\". Compute! listed it in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", stating that \\"Starflight captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully, yet those hours are anything but boring\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Starflight the 55th-best computer game ever released. Ybarra said in 1987 that the game had created a \\"beachhead in the arena of sci-fi\\" for Electronic Arts. Lee said in 2010, \\"I knew it was a classic while we were building it\\". Erin Hoffman of The Escapist in 2010 called it \\"one of the great breakthroughs in gaming\\". In 2012, Lee Hutchinson of Ars Technica called the game \\"a thing of awe and reverence\\" and said it \\"defined the genre of space exploration games\\". In 1998, PC Gamer declared it the 36th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"the most authentic Star Trek experience you could have on a PC - and it wasn't even a Trek game\\". Legacy Starflight had a 1989 sequel, Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula. Reiche was inspired by the game to create Star Control, with Johnson coding three of the alien species in the game; Computer Gaming World called Star Control II a spiritual successor to Starflight. Mass Effect director Casey Hudson tweeted in 2011 that \\"Starflight was a key inspiration for the ME series.\\" Starflight is often cited along with Elite, which appeared two years earlier with similar gameplay, as early open world space exploration games. Dwarf Fortress's forgotten beasts were inspired by the procedurally generated lifeforms within Starflight.

It was founded in 1848. The population of Joensuu is (), and the economic region of Joensuu has a population of 115,000. The nearest major city, Kuopio in North Savonia, is located to the west. As is typical of cities in Eastern Finland, Joensuu is monolingually Finnish. Joensuu is a lively student city with a subsidiary of the University of Eastern Finland, which has over 15,000 enrolled students, and a further 4,000 students at the Karelia University of Applied Sciences. The largest employers are the municipal City of Joensuu, North Karelian Hospital District Federation of Municipalities, Abloy and Punamusta. The European Forest Institute, the University and many other institutes and export enterprises such as Abloy and John Deere give Joensuu an international flavour.  History  The city of Joensuu, founded by the Czar Nicholas I of Russia in 1848, is the regional centre and the capital of North Karelia. During the 19th century Joensuu was a city of manufacture and commerce. When in 1860 the city received dispensation rights to initiate commerce, former restrictions against industry were removed and the local sawmills began to prosper and expand. Water traffic was improved by the building and opening of the Saimaa Canal in 1856. Consequently, a lively commerce between the regions of North Karelia, St. Petersburg and Central Europe was enabled. At the end of the 19th century Joensuu was one of the largest harbour cities in Finland. Throughout the centuries Karelian traders have plied the Pielisjoki River. The river has always been the lively heart of the city. Canals – completed by 1870 – increased the river traffic. Thousands of steamboats, barges and logging boats sailed along the river during the golden age of river traffic. The Pielisjoki River has also been an important log raft route, providing wood for the sawmills and for the entire lumber industry. During the last few decades, the formerly modest agrarian town has developed into a vital centre of the province. Success in regional annexations, the establishment of the province of Karelia and investments in education have been the most decisive actions in this development. The municipality of Pielisensuu was consolidated with Joensuu in 1954. At the beginning of 2005, the municipalities of Kiihtelysvaara and Tuupovaara were consolidated with Joensuu. At the beginning of 2009 the municipalities of Eno and Pyhäselkä were consolidated with Joensuu. After the most recent consolidations, there are approximately 73,000 inhabitants in the Joensuu municipal area. church of Joensuu is renowned for its sharply augmented towers, which in this image are tinged by the midnight sun and with a moonrise in the background. The University of Joensuu (now part of the University of Eastern Finland since January 2010.Steps leading to the establishment of the UEF ) has, in twenty-five years, expanded to eight faculties. The university is one of the mainstays for the vitality of the city and so for all North Karelia. Diversified international cooperation in science, industry and commerce benefits the whole region. The proximity of the eastern border has been an important factor in the history of the city. The Republic of Karelia is once again a significant area for cooperation with nearby regions in Russia. Export companies in Joensuu continue the pre- revolutionary traditions in foreign trade. Joensuu offers varied cultural activities. A series of events – Ilosaarirock festival, Joensuu Music Winter, Festival of Visual Culture Viscult, Gospel festivals – and the unspoilt environment increase the attractiveness of the city. Joensuu is sometimes referred to as the Forest Capital of Europe, mainly because the European Forest Institute is based there. Other forestry research and educational facilities are also based in Joensuu.  Education  Joensuu is a city of students. The University of Eastern Finland (UEF) has one of its three main campuses in Joensuu and the University of Applied Sciences Karelia has two Joensuu campuses.

Numbered bus service is available to all parts of Joensuu (Route maps, Timetables). Note, that if you want to catch a bus, you have to wave at the driver - the bus does not stop automatically. Joensuu also has an airport, with flights to Helsinki. The airport has ceased functioning since March 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions enacted by Finnavia and Finnair. Joensuu is located along the Blue Highway, which is an international tourist route from Mo i Rana, Norway to Pudozh, Russia via Sweden.  Sports  Evangelical-Lutheran Church, Kirkkokatu, Joensuu The city is known for its basketball club Kataja, which plays in the Finnish first-tier league Korisliiga. Other championship level clubs of Joensuu include Josba (floorball), Mutalan Riento (volleyball), the world leading orienteering club Kalevan Rasti (orienteering) and Joensuun Prihat (women's volleyball). The ice hockey team Jokipojat plays in the Finnish second-tier league Mestis, and their home arena is the Mehtimäki Ice Hall. The local football club Jippo plays in the Finnish second Division. Finnish baseball enjoys popularity as well and the local team, Joensuun Maila, plays in the top division Superpesis. Notable sportspeople from Joensuu include Jukka Keskisalo, the European champion in 2006 at 3000m St., and Aki Parviainen, the world champion of Javelin throw in 1999; biathlete Kaisa Mäkäräinen, who won three overall World Cup titles in the 2010–11, 2013–14 and 2017–18 seasons; 1983 WRC champion Hannu Mikkola; 2013 GRC champion and current World RX driver Toomas Heikkinen; and NHL ice hockey players Urho Vaakanainen and Juuso Riikola.  Geography   Climate  Joensuu has a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) due to its high latitude and inland position. Being quite far inland, Joensuu has a more continental climate than most of Finland. As a result, Joensuu can be prone to temperature extremes both in winter and summer. For example, Joensuu is on average warmer than Dublin or Manchester in July, and colder than Moscow in January. Winters are long, cold and snowy. Summers however, bring frequent temperatures above and thunderstorms occur typically on 10–15 days per year. An all-time record of on July 29, 2010, is also the Finnish nationwide heat record. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Joensuu was on December 10, 1955. In winter, the snowcover is reliable and on average 50–70 cm deep. Annually, Joensuu experiences on average 24 days with temperatures or colder while temperature below is observed about once per year. Annual total precipitation averages at 589 mm, with about 225 mm of it falling in the form of snow.

Pope Innocent III and his successor Pope Honorius III organized crusading armies led by King Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, and an attack against Jerusalem ultimately left the city in Muslim hands. Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Paderborn, and a mixed army of Dutch, Flemish and Frisian soldiers led by William I, Count of Holland joined the crusade. In order to attack Damietta in Egypt, they allied in Anatolia with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm under Kaykaus I and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts. After occupying the port of Damietta, the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to Al- Mansoura from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan al-Kamil ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which led to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop, where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta—and Egypt altogether—and to an eight-year peace agreement. Preparations Pope Innocent III had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the papal bull Quia maior, calling all of Christendom to join a new crusade. This was followed by another papal bull, the Ad Liberandam in 1215. France The message of the crusade was preached in France by Robert of Courçon; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the Albigensian Crusade against the heretical Cathar sect in southern France. In 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the Fourth Lateran Council, where, along with the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Raoul of Merencourt, he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the papacy, as the First Crusade should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the Fourth Crusade, which had been taken over by the Venetians. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at Brindisi in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an indulgence, including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves. Hungary and Germany Oliver of Paderborn had preached the crusade in Holy Roman Empire, and Emperor Frederick II attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the Papacy (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by Pope Honorius III but despite the pledge made by Frederick II to join the Crusade, Frederick hung back and the organized crusading armies led by King Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI, Duke of Austria failed. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. Portugal According to Oliver of Paderborn, the Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum and De itinere frisonum, many of the Crusaders from the Rhineland, Flanders, and Friesland decided to go to the Holy Land by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at Dartmouth on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts William I of Holland and George of Weid they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of Santiago de Compostela.Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \\"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217–1218\\", Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History 15 (2019) At their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the Almohad controlled city of Alcácer do Sal. The Frisians according to De itinere frisonum, however, refused on account of Innocent III's disqualification of the venture at the Fourth Lateran Council.Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \\"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\\", Al-Masaq 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573 The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured Alcácer do Sal with the help of the military orders on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of Seville, Badajoz, and Jaén to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to Pope Honorius III the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \\"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\\", Al-Masaq 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573 Georgia Pope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, a reconnaissance force under the Mongols Jebe and Subutai destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the Battle of Khunan in 1222. After the death of Georgian King George IV Lasha, his sister Queen Rusudan wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322–327. Decades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.M.F. Brosset, \\"Historie de la Georgie,\\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548–549. A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.David Morgan, \\"The Mongols,\\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men. If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength. Campaign King Andrew II of Hungary Holy Land The first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King Andrew II of Hungary.Alexander Mikaberidze: Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (page 311) In July 1217, Andrew departed from Zagreb, accompanied by Leopold VI of Austria and Otto I, Duke of Merania. King Andrew's army was so largeat least 20,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \\"uncountable\\" infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later. They were transported by the Venetian fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in Split. They landed on 9 October on Cyprus from where they sailed to Acre and joined John of Brienne, ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Hugh I of Cyprus, and Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch to fight against the Ayyubids in Syria. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time (page 210) In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders—Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade—held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East (page 358) King Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan Al-Adil I at Bethsaida on the Jordan River on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the First Crusade in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and trebuchets did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the Lebanon and on Mount Tabor. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.(Jean Richard: The Crusades, c 1071-c. 1291) page 298. Andrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home. Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum Later in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland William I arrived with a mixed army consisting of Dutch, Flemish and Frisian soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking Damietta in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with Kaykaus I, Seljuq Sultan of Rûm in Anatolia, who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts. Egypt In July 1218 the crusaders began their siege of Damietta, and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan Al-Adil, the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including Robert of Courçon. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by al-Kamil. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent Pelagius of Albano to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade Damietta for Jerusalem, but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this William I, Count of Holland left the crusade and sailed home. In August or September, Francis of Assisi arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port. Immediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with John of Brienne claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, John of Brienne returned. Then in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary Prester John, was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards Cairo.Christopher Eric Taylor, Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War, 2011, University of Texas at Austin. This move was observed by the forces of al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2,000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta. By now al-Kamil was able to ally with the other Ayyubids in Syria, who had defeated Kaykaus I. The crusader march to Cairo was disastrous; the river Nile flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius. Aftermath The terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of Damietta to al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the True Cross. However, the relic was never returned as al- Kamil did not, in fact, have it. The failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the Occitan poet Guilhem Figueira. The more orthodox Gormonda de Monpeslier responded to Figueira's D'un sirventes far with a song of her own, Greu m'es a durar. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \\"foolishness\\" of the wicked. Impact on literature The Palästinalied is a famous lyric poem by Walther von der Vogelweide written in Middle High German describing a pilgrim travelling to the Holy Land during the height of the Fifth Crusade.Kaye, Haley Caroline, \\"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context;=senproj_s2016.

Description Just as a Lie groupoid can be thought of as a \\"Lie group with many objects\\", a Lie algebroid is like a \\"Lie algebra with many objects\\". More precisely, a Lie algebroid is a triple (E, [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot], \\\\rho) consisting of a vector bundle E over a manifold M, together with a Lie bracket [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot] on its space of sections \\\\Gamma (E) and a morphism of vector bundles \\\\rho: E\\\\rightarrow TM called the anchor. Here TM is the tangent bundle of M. The anchor and the bracket are to satisfy the Leibniz rule: :[X,fY]=\\\\rho(X)f\\\\cdot Y + f[X,Y] where X,Y \\\\in \\\\Gamma(E), f\\\\in C^\\\\infty(M) and \\\\rho(X)f is the derivative of f along the vector field \\\\rho(X). It follows that :\\\\rho([X,Y])=[\\\\rho(X),\\\\rho(Y)] for all X,Y \\\\in \\\\Gamma(E).  Examples  * Every Lie algebra is a Lie algebroid over the one point manifold. * The tangent bundle TM of a manifold M is a Lie algebroid for the Lie bracket of vector fields and the identity of TM as an anchor. * Every integrable subbundle of the tangent bundle -- that is, one whose sections are closed under the Lie bracket -- also defines a Lie algebroid. * Every bundle of Lie algebras over a smooth manifold defines a Lie algebroid where the Lie bracket is defined pointwise and the anchor map is equal to zero. * To every Lie groupoid is associated a Lie algebroid, generalizing how a Lie algebra is associated to a Lie group (see also below). For example, the Lie algebroid TM comes from the pair groupoid whose objects are M, with one isomorphism between each pair of objects. Unfortunately, going back from a Lie algebroid to a Lie groupoid is not always possible,Marius Crainic, Rui L. Fernandes. Integrability of Lie brackets, Ann. of Math. (2), Vol. 157 (2003), no. 2, 575 --620 but every Lie algebroid gives a stacky Lie groupoid.Hsian-Hua Tseng and Chenchang Zhu, Integrating Lie algebroids via stacks, Compositio Mathematica, Volume 142 (2006), Issue 01, pp 251-270, available as arXiv:math/0405003Chenchang Zhu, Lie II theorem for Lie algebroids via stacky Lie groupoids, available as arXiv:math/0701024 * Given the action of a Lie algebra g on a manifold M, the set of g -invariant vector fields on M is a Lie algebroid over the space of orbits of the action. * The Atiyah algebroid of a principal G-bundle P over a manifold M is a Lie algebroid with short exact sequence: *: 0 \\\\to P\\\\times_G \\\\mathfrak g\\\\to TP/G\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\rho} TM \\\\to 0. : The space of sections of the Atiyah algebroid is the Lie algebra of G-invariant vector fields on P. * A Poisson Lie algebroid is associated to a Poisson manifold by taking E to be the cotangent bundle. The anchor map is given by the Poisson bivector. This can be seen in a Lie bialgebroid.  Lie algebroid associated to a Lie groupoid  To describe the construction let us fix some notation. G is the space of morphisms of the Lie groupoid, M the space of objects, e:M\\\\to G the units and t:G\\\\to M the target map. T^tG=\\\\bigcup_{p\\\\in M}T(t^{-1}(p))\\\\subset TG the t-fiber tangent space. The Lie algebroid is now the vector bundle A:=e^*T^tG. This inherits a bracket from G, because we can identify the M-sections into A with left-invariant vector fields on G. The anchor map then is obtained as the derivation of the source map Ts:e^*T^tG \\\\rightarrow TM . Further these sections act on the smooth functions of M by identifying these with left-invariant functions on G. As a more explicit example consider the Lie algebroid associated to the pair groupoid G:=M\\\\times M. The target map is t:G\\\\to M: (p,q)\\\\mapsto p and the units e:M\\\\to G: p\\\\mapsto (p,p). The t-fibers are p\\\\times M and therefore T^tG=\\\\bigcup_{p\\\\in M}p\\\\times TM \\\\subset TM\\\\times TM. So the Lie algebroid is the vector bundle A:=e^*T^tG=\\\\bigcup_{p\\\\in M} T_pM=TM. The extension of sections X into A to left-invariant vector fields on G is simply \\\\tilde X(p,q)=0\\\\oplus X(q) and the extension of a smooth function f from M to a left- invariant function on G is \\\\tilde f(p,q)=f(q). Therefore, the bracket on A is just the Lie bracket of tangent vector fields and the anchor map is just the identity. Of course you could do an analog construction with the source map and right-invariant vector fields/ functions. However you get an isomorphic Lie algebroid, with the explicit isomorphism i_*, where i:G\\\\to G is the inverse map.  Example  Consider the Lie groupoid : \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times U(1) \\\\rightrightarrows \\\\mathbb{R}^2 where the target map sends : ((x,y), e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} Notice that there are two cases for the fibers of T^t(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times U(1)): : \\\\begin{align} t^{-1}(0) \\\\cong & U(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{-1}(p) \\\\cong & \\\\\\\\{ (a,u) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times U(1) : ua = p \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} This demonstrating that there is a stabilizer of U(1) over the origin and stabilizer-free U(1)-orbits everywhere else. The tangent bundle over every t^{-1}(p) is then trivial, hence the pullback e^*(T^t(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times U(1))) is a trivial line bundle.

A Lie groupoid can thus be thought of as a \\"many-object generalization\\" of a Lie group, just as a groupoid is a many-object generalization of a group. Just as every Lie group has a Lie algebra, every Lie groupoid has a Lie algebroid. Examples *Any Lie group gives a Lie groupoid with one object, and conversely. So, the theory of Lie groupoids includes the theory of Lie groups. *Given any manifold M, there is a Lie groupoid called the pair groupoid, with M as the manifold of objects, and precisely one morphism from any object to any other. In this Lie groupoid the manifold of morphisms is thus M \\\\times M. *Given a Lie group G acting on a manifold M, there is a Lie groupoid called the translation groupoid with one morphism for each triple g \\\\in G, x,y \\\\in M with gx = y. *Any foliation gives a Lie groupoid. *Any principal bundle P\\\\to M with structure group G gives a groupoid, namely P\\\\times P/G over M, where G acts on the pairs componentwise. Composition is defined via compatible representatives as in the pair groupoid. Morita Morphisms and Smooth Stacks Beside isomorphism of groupoids there is a more coarse notation of equivalence, the so-called Morita equivalence. A quite general example is the Morita-morphism of the Čech groupoid which goes as follows. Let M be a smooth manifold and \\\\\\\\{U_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} an open cover of M. Define G_0:=\\\\bigsqcup_\\\\alpha U_\\\\alpha the disjoint union with the obvious submersion p:G_0\\\\to M. In order to encode the structure of the manifold M define the set of morphisms G_1:=\\\\bigsqcup_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} where U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}=U_\\\\alpha \\\\cap U_\\\\beta\\\\subset M. The source and target map are defined as the embeddings s:U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\to U_\\\\alpha and t:U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\to U_\\\\beta. And multiplication is the obvious one if we read the U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} as subsets of M (compatible points in U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} and U_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma} actually are the same in M and also lie in U_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}). This Čech groupoid is in fact the pullback groupoid of M\\\\Rightarrow M, i.e. the trivial groupoid over M, under p. That is what makes it Morita-morphism. In order to get the notion of an equivalence relation we need to make the construction symmetric and show that it is also transitive. In this sense we say that 2 groupoids G_1\\\\Rightarrow G_0 and H_1\\\\Rightarrow H_0 are Morita equivalent iff there exists a third groupoid K_1\\\\Rightarrow K_0 together with 2 Morita morphisms from G to K and H to K. Transitivity is an interesting construction in the category of groupoid principal bundles and left to the reader. It arises the question of what is preserved under the Morita equivalence. There are 2 obvious things, one the coarse quotient/ orbit space of the groupoid G_0/G_1 = H_0/H_1 and secondly the stabilizer groups G_p\\\\cong H_q for corresponding points p\\\\in G_0 and q\\\\in H_0. The further question of what is the structure of the coarse quotient space leads to the notion of a smooth stack. We can expect the coarse quotient to be a smooth manifold if for example the stabilizer groups are trivial (as in the example of the Čech groupoid). But if the stabilizer groups change we cannot expect a smooth manifold any longer. The solution is to revert the problem and to define: A smooth stack is a Morita-equivalence class of Lie groupoids. The natural geometric objects living on the stack are the geometric objects on Lie groupoids invariant under Morita-equivalence. As an example consider the Lie groupoid cohomology. Examples *The notion of smooth stack is quite general, obviously all smooth manifolds are smooth stacks. *But also orbifolds are smooth stacks, namely (equivalence classes of) étale groupoids. *Orbit spaces of foliations are another class of examples External links * Alan Weinstein, Groupoids: unifying internal and external symmetry, AMS Notices, 43 (1996), 744-752.

Quotient algebras are also called factor algebras. Here, the congruence relation must be an equivalence relation that is additionally compatible with all the operations of the algebra, in the formal sense described below. Its equivalence classes partition the elements of the given algebraic structure. The quotient algebra has these classes as its elements, and the compatibility conditions are used to give the classes an algebraic structure.A. G. Kurosh, Lectures on General Algebra, Translated from the Russian edition (Moscow, 1960), Chelsea, New York, 1963. The idea of the quotient algebra abstracts into one common notion the quotient structure of quotient rings of ring theory, quotient groups of group theory, the quotient spaces of linear algebra and the quotient modules of representation theory into a common framework.  Compatible relation  Let A be the set of the elements of an algebra \\\\mathcal{A}, and let E be an equivalence relation on the set A. The relation E is said to be compatible with (or have the substitution property with respect to) an n-ary operation f, if (a_i,\\\\; b_i) \\\\in E for 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n implies (f (a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n), f (b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n)) \\\\in E for any a_i,\\\\; b_i \\\\in A with 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n. An equivalence relation compatible with all the operations of an algebra is called a congruence with respect to this algebra.  Quotient algebras and homomorphisms  Any equivalence relation E in a set A partitions this set in equivalence classes. The set of these equivalence classes is usually called the quotient set, and denoted A/E. For an algebra \\\\mathcal{A}, it is straightforward to define the operations induced on the elements of A/E if E is a congruence. Specifically, for any operation f^{\\\\mathcal{A}}_i of arity n_i in \\\\mathcal{A} (where the superscript simply denotes that it is an operation in \\\\mathcal{A}, and the subscript i \\\\in I enumerates the functions in \\\\mathcal{A} and their arities) define f^{\\\\mathcal{A}/E}_i : (A/E)^{n_i} \\\\to A/E as f^{\\\\mathcal{A}/E}_i ([a_1]_E, \\\\ldots, [a_{n_i}]_E) = [f^{\\\\mathcal{A}}_i(a_1,\\\\ldots, a_{n_i})]_E, where [x]_E \\\\in A/E denotes the equivalence class of x \\\\in A generated by E (\\"x modulo E\\"). For an algebra \\\\mathcal{A} = (A, (f^{\\\\mathcal{A}}_i)_{i \\\\in I}), given a congruence E on \\\\mathcal{A}, the algebra \\\\mathcal{A}/E = (A/E, (f^{\\\\mathcal{A}/E}_i)_{i \\\\in I}) is called the quotient algebra (or factor algebra) of \\\\mathcal{A} modulo E. There is a natural homomorphism from \\\\mathcal{A} to \\\\mathcal{A}/E mapping every element to its equivalence class. In fact, every homomorphism h determines a congruence relation via the kernel of the homomorphism, \\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ker}}\\\\,h = \\\\\\\\{(a,a') \\\\in A^2\\\\, \\\\, h(a) = h(a')\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq A^2. Given an algebra \\\\mathcal{A}, a homomorphism h thus defines two algebras homomorphic to \\\\mathcal{A}, the image h(\\\\mathcal{A}) and \\\\mathcal{A}/\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ker}}\\\\,h The two are isomorphic, a result known as the homomorphic image theorem or as the first isomorphism theorem for universal algebra. Formally, let h : \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{B} be a surjective homomorphism. Then, there exists a unique isomorphism g from \\\\mathcal{A}/\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ker}}\\\\,h onto \\\\mathcal{B} such that g composed with the natural homomorphism induced by \\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{ker}}\\\\,h equals h.  Congruence lattice  For every algebra \\\\mathcal{A} on the set A, the identity relation on A, and A \\\\times A are trivial congruences. An algebra with no other congruences is called simple. Let \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) be the set of congruences on the algebra \\\\mathcal{A}. Because congruences are closed under intersection, we can define a meet operation: \\\\wedge : \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) \\\\times \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) by simply taking the intersection of the congruences E_1 \\\\wedge E_2 = E_1\\\\cap E_2. On the other hand, congruences are not closed under union. However, we can define the closure of any binary relation E, with respect to a fixed algebra \\\\mathcal{A}, such that it is a congruence, in the following way: \\\\langle E \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathcal{A}} = \\\\bigcap \\\\\\\\{ F \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) \\\\mid E \\\\subseteq F \\\\\\\\}. Note that the (congruence) closure of a binary relation depends on the operations in \\\\mathcal{A}, not just on the carrier set. Now define \\\\vee: \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) \\\\times \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}) as E_1 \\\\vee E_2 = \\\\langle E_1\\\\cup E_2 \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathcal{A}} . For every algebra \\\\mathcal{A}, (\\\\mathrm{Con}(\\\\mathcal{A}), \\\\wedge, \\\\vee) with the two operations defined above forms a lattice, called the congruence lattice of \\\\mathcal{A}.  Maltsev conditions  If two congruences permute (commute) with the composition of relations as operation, i.e. \\\\alpha\\\\circ\\\\beta = \\\\beta\\\\circ\\\\alpha, then their join (in the congruence lattice) is equal to their composition: \\\\alpha\\\\circ\\\\beta = \\\\alpha\\\\vee\\\\beta. An algebra is called congruence-permutable if every pair of its congruences permutes; likewise a variety is said to be congruence-permutable if all its members are congruence- permutable algebras. In 1954, Anatoly Maltsev established the following characterization of congruence-permutable varieties: a variety is congruence permutable if and only if there exist a ternary term such that ; this is called a Maltsev term and varieties with this property are called Maltsev varieties. Maltsev's characterization explains a large number of similar results in groups (take ), rings, quasigroups (take , complemented lattices, Heyting algebras etc. Furthermore, every congruence-permutable algebra is congruence-modular, i.e. its lattice of congruences is modular lattice as well; the converse is not true however. After Maltsev's result, other researchers found characterizations based on conditions similar to that found by Maltsev but for other kinds of properties, e.g. in 1967 Bjarni Jónsson found the conditions for varieties having congruence lattices that are distributive (thus called congruence-distributive varieties). Generically, such conditions are called Maltsev conditions. This line of research led to the Pixley–Wille algorithm for generating Maltsev conditions associated with congruence identities.

The 2016 census recorded an urban population of 3,765 people. Macroom is part of the Cork North-West (Dáil constituency). Bridge over the river Sullane, viewed from Masseytown Macroom began as a meeting place for the Druids of Munster. It is first mentioned is in 6th-century records, and the immediate area hosted a major battle c. 987 involving the Irish king Brian Boru. During the middle ages, the town was invaded by a succession of warring clans, including the Murcheatach Uí Briain and Richard de Cogan families. In the early modern period the MacCarthy's took control and later the area found prosperity via milling. The MacCarthys built a series of tower houses, many of which survive. The family lost influence during the Williamite wars of the 1690s, after which authority over the town castle waxed and waned between the MacCarthys and a number of ambitious English families. In the 17th century, Macroom became a central point of conflict in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The population fell in the 1840s during the Great Irish Famine. Evidence can be found in the former workhouse, now the district hospital at the north side of New Street, and the mass graveyard to the west, near Clondrohid. During the late 18th and early 19th century a number of Anglo- Irish families, and a branch of the Massey family, settled in the area; but many of their estate houses were burned by rebels during and after the Irish War of Independence as the town was caught the turmoil of IRA activity. From 1976 to 1982 Macroom hosted the Mountain Dew Rock festival, with lineups that included Rory Gallagher, Thin Lizzy and Van Morrison, attended by Sex Pistol John Lydon. Today the town is an economic hub for the mid west Cork region, and location a major Danone milk processing factory, which dries and cans Infant formula from milk supplied by local dairy farmers. Until the 1950s New Street was the town's economic hub, and contained many small retail outlets. In September 2019 Macroom was designated a rent pressure zone.

This standing stone is part of a 3500-year-old complex in Knocknakilla between Macroom and Millstreet The first historical reference to Macroom dates from the 6th century, when the townland was known as Achad Dorbchon and held within the kingdom of Muscraighe Mitine.Ring, 31 The Eóganachta were then the dominant clan of Munster; they held kingdoms from Muscraighe Mitine to the midlands town of Birr. At some point, they were replaced by the Uí Floinn, who commissioned a castle in Macroom so as to establish Raithleann as capital of Muskerry. Middle ages Muscraighe Mitine underwent three invasions during the 13th century. The Murcheatach Uí Briain and Richard de Cogan arrived in 1201 and 1207 respectively; the MacCarthys became the dominant and most powerful family and held Macroom Castle until the mid-17th century.Ring, 80 From the 14th century, Macroom became the capital of the Barony of Muskerry and the centre for trade, burial and religious worship. It was one of the earliest Irish milling centres, and from the end of the 16th century the town grew from a village to a functionally diverse urban centre. The locality grew outwards from the castle. The MacCarthys established the town as a centre for markets and fairs, and in 1620 a market house was built to the east of and facing the castle. The family introduced a plantation scheme which aimed to attract new agriculture and industrial techniques and methods to the area. Modern period By the mid-17th century English families owned approximately one-third of the town in value terms.Ring, 105 The Protestant families introduced butter making, a labour-intensive industry. A 1750 tenement list details 134 buildings and 300 families, with a population ratio of 6 to 1 between Catholic and Protestants. The town had developed from a locality of mud cabins in the early 1660s to a linear shaped urban settlement of mainly thatched cabins, which were later replaced by solid cottages following a campaign by the Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA). Macroom Castle was for a period controlled by Admiral Sir William Penn, a British Admiral and father of William Penn, after whom the U.S. state of Pennsylvania is named. Battle of Macroom The 1650 battle of Macroom was waged as part of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, when the English Parliamentarian force under Roger Boyle defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche. Bishop Boetius MacEgan, fighting on behalf of the MacCarthys, failed to hold the castle and was taken prisoner by the Cromwellian forces and hanged at Carrigadrohid.Boetius MacEgan, Bishop of Ross Biography War of Independence ILLA supported by small tenant farmers and agrarian labourers in the Market Square Macroom was the main base in Cork for the British Auxiliary Division during the 1919–1921 Irish War of Independence. The Irish Republican Army was highly active in the county, especially in the areas around Macroom, Bandon and Dunmanway. Royal Irish Constabulary police in the town described the area as \\"practically in a state of war\\". After a series of burnings of local police barracks and courthousesHart, 27 a curfew was imposed on the town, with a ban on public meetings and market fairs. A local IRA member wrote of a \\"hinterland unpoliced and unwatched\\". The local police felt they had lost control and the Auxiliaries were called to intervene. The townspeople treated army personnel with hostility, and there were instances of patrols being stoned. The Brits were embroiled in a guerrilla battle in the Muskerry hills, coming under fire from the Ballyvourney IRA cell, and lost three men – two of them officers – in one attack.Hart, 28 In 1920 at Kilmichael, on the road between Macroom and Dunmanway, 17 members of the Macroom Auxiliary \\"C Company\\" were ambushed and killed by a local IRA cell led by the prominent general Tom Barry. In the aftermath of the attack, the British military were given the power to execute anyone found carrying arms and ammunition, to search houses, impose curfews, try suspects in military rather than civilian courts and to intern suspects without trial. On 11 December, in reprisal, the centre of Cork city was burned by Auxiliaries, British soldiers and Black and Tans.White & O'Shea, 9 Macroom Castle was burned out on five separate occasions; the last occasion was on 18 August 1922 following the evacuation of British Auxiliaries from the town. Members of anti-treaty forces, including Erskine Childers and Frank O'Connor, retreated from Cork City to Macroom, burning the castle before leaving. The ruined home of the Cork branch of the Massey family, burned out and abandoned during the War of Independence. The hill on which it is located is known as \\"Mount Massey\\". Mount Massey, now ruined, was the 18th and 19th century home of the members of the Massey family, and is located north by Kilnagurteen and gave the townland of Masseytown its name. The family were major landowners with land covering 13,363 acres, extending from Clondrohid to Drishane. During the 19th century they tried to temper nascent nationalism by sponsoring the local town fair. Later their home was sieged and eventually burned in December 1920, during the War of Independence.\\"Estate: Massy (Mount Massy)\\". NUI Galway.

Carrigaphooca Castle Carrigaphooca Castle from the north east Carrigaphooca Castle is a ruined five storey rectangular tower house situated on a steep-sided rock overlooking the River Sullane. It is located 6 km west of Macroom, in an area once known as Gleann na n-Dearg (Valley of the Reds).O'Brien (1990), 31 The tower dominates the landscape of Lissacresig (Fairyland) in Clondrohid, and Lower Shanballyshane, in Kilnamartyra.O'Brien (1990), 30 Carrigaphooca is made of sandstone and limestone and was built as a defensive tower by MacCarthy clan member Donal MacCarthy of Drishane c. 1336–51. Cormac Teige McCarthy, the Lord of Blarney took refuge in the tower after he had sided with the Irish during the Siege of Kinsale in 1601. He stayed there until he was forgiven by Elizabeth I after he had written a personal letter of apology to her.O'Brien (1990), 32 In 1602, the castle was attacked and taken by Donal Cam O'Sullivan BeareO'Murchadah (1993), p. 223 and another member of the extended McCarthy family. After a protracted siege, their forces broke through the outer wall and burned the timber door at the north face entrance.

Intuitively, a subcategory of C is a category obtained from C by \\"removing\\" some of its objects and arrows.  Formal definition  Let C be a category. A subcategory S of C is given by *a subcollection of objects of C, denoted ob(S), *a subcollection of morphisms of C, denoted hom(S). such that *for every X in ob(S), the identity morphism idX is in hom(S), *for every morphism f : X → Y in hom(S), both the source X and the target Y are in ob(S), *for every pair of morphisms f and g in hom(S) the composite f o g is in hom(S) whenever it is defined. These conditions ensure that S is a category in its own right: its collection of objects is ob(S), its collection of morphisms is hom(S), and its identities and composition are as in C. There is an obvious faithful functor I : S → C, called the inclusion functor which takes objects and morphisms to themselves. Let S be a subcategory of a category C. We say that S is a full subcategory of C if for each pair of objects X and Y of S, :\\\\mathrm{Hom}_\\\\mathcal{S}(X,Y)=\\\\mathrm{Hom}_\\\\mathcal{C}(X,Y). A full subcategory is one that includes all morphisms between objects of S. For any collection of objects A in C, there is a unique full subcategory of C whose objects are those in A.  Examples  * The category of finite sets forms a full subcategory of the category of sets. * The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are bijections forms a non-full subcategory of the category of sets. * The category of abelian groups forms a full subcategory of the category of groups. * The category of rings (whose morphisms are unit- preserving ring homomorphisms) forms a non-full subcategory of the category of rngs. * For a field K, the category of K-vector spaces forms a full subcategory of the category of (left or right) K-modules.  Embeddings  Given a subcategory S of C, the inclusion functor I : S → C is both a faithful functor and injective on objects. It is full if and only if S is a full subcategory. Some authors define an embedding to be a full and faithful functor. Such a functor is necessarily injective on objects up to isomorphism. For instance, the Yoneda embedding is an embedding in this sense. Some authors define an embedding to be a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects. Other authors define a functor to be an embedding if it is faithful and injective on objects. Equivalently, F is an embedding if it is injective on morphisms. A functor F is then called a full embedding if it is a full functor and an embedding. With the definitions of the previous paragraph, for any (full) embedding F : B → C the image of F is a (full) subcategory S of C, and F induces an isomorphism of categories between B and S. If F is not injective on objects then the image of F is equivalent to B. In some categories, one can also speak of morphisms of the category being embeddings.  Types of subcategories  A subcategory S of C is said to be isomorphism- closed or replete if every isomorphism k : X → Y in C such that Y is in S also belongs to S. An isomorphism-closed full subcategory is said to be strictly full. A subcategory of C is wide or lluf (a term first posed by Peter Freyd) if it contains all the objects of C. A wide subcategory is typically not full: the only wide full subcategory of a category is that category itself. A Serre subcategory is a non-empty full subcategory S of an abelian category C such that for all short exact sequences :0\\\\to M'\\\\to M\\\\to M\\\\to 0 in C, M belongs to S if and only if both M' and M do. This notion arises from Serre's C-theory.  See also  *Reflective subcategory *Exact category, a full subcategory closed under extensions.

It is located south of the Tatras proper, from which it is separated by the valleys of the Váh and Poprad rivers (the Liptov-Spiš abasement). The valley formed by the Hron River is situated south of the Low Tatras range. The ridge runs west- eastwards and is about 80 km long. The Čertovica pass divides the range into two parts. The highest peaks of the Low Tatras are located in its western part. Ďumbier is the highest mountain at 2,042 m AMSL. Its neighbour Chopok (2,024 m) is accessible by a chairlift, and it is the most visited place in the Low Tatras. Other peaks in the western part include Dereše (2,004 m) and Chabenec (1,955 m). The highest peak in the eastern part is Kráľova hoľa (1,946 m). The best viewpoints in western part are Veľká Chochuľa, Salatín, Chabenec, Skalka, Chopok, Ďumbier, Siná, Poludnica and Baba. Several karst areas are situated in limestone and dolomite strata at the southern and northern edges of the main ridge, which is composed of granite and gneiss. Among many discovered caves, Bystrianska Cave (Bystrianska jaskyňa), Cave of Dead Bats (Jaskyňa mŕtvych netopierov), Demänovská jaskyňa Slobody, Demänová Ice Cave (Demänovská ľadová jaskyňa), and Važecká Cave (Važecká jaskyňa) are open to the public. The biggest canyon is Hučiaky under Salatín in Ludrová valley near Ružomberok (7 caves - not open for public), suitable for canyoning. The highest waterfall is under Brankov near Ružomberok - Podsuchá (55 m high), reachable by green marked footpath from Podsuchá (20 min). The biggest tarn is Vrbické pleso in the Demänovská dolina Valley. The mountains are densely forested and their rich fauna includes bear, wolf, and lynx. The alpine meadows are the habitat of chamois. National Park Most of the Low Tatras is protected by the Low Tatras National Park (Národný park Nízke Tatry; abbr. NAPANT), established in 1978. The area of the National Park is 728 km² (281.08 mi²) and the buffer zone takes 1,102 km² (425.48 mi²); 1,830 km² (706.56 mi²) together. Tourism Tourism is very popular in the Tatras. During the winter there are several ski resorts in Low Tatras, for example Jasná, Mýto pod Ďumbierom, and Tále. Not only are these hubs of hiking and cross-country skiing trails, but Jasna is the largest ski resort in Central Europe and is served by the tourist town of Liptovsky Mikulas. Liptovsky Mikulas also offers a range of summer activities such as rafting, kayaking, boating on the lake, fishing, a hot springs aqua park and hiking. There are many places to stay, restaurants and bars in the town. The steep northern slopes of the range are popular with climbers. Other attractions include an 18-hole golf course near Tále. The Path of the heroes of Slovak national uprising follows the axis of the mountain range. At the very top there are several huts or hotels that can offer refuge to those who want to traverse the entire range from east to west.

Primary uses *Channel and personal protection against any types of attacks (flooding, spamming, CTCP floods, etc.). *Dialog windows can be created in mIRC to better serve user-compatibility. **Popular mIRC dialog extensions include MDX (mIRC Dialog Extension) and DCX (Dialog Control Extension). There are also a few versions of mdx.dll and dcx.dll modded by IRC hackers. *Bots that provide automated IRC channel management, trivia or other games, and other desired functions for chatters. *Commands that save typing or otherwise simplify life on IRC (such as automatically identifying as the owner of a nickname). Script storage Scripts are stored as either plain text files, usually with a .mrc file extension, or as INI files. They, however, can be stored with any extension. Multiple script files can be loaded at one time, although in some cases, one script will conflict with another and cause one or both of them to no longer work properly. Language features mIRC scripting language uses its own nomenclature to refer to language constructs. (However, whilst this can be a little confusing to newcomers, they do not impact on the functionality of mSL.) *Built-in functions are termed commands or, if they return a value, identifiers. *Custom scripted functions are called aliases. Aliases that return a value are known as custom identifiers. Both are called from the command line or other parts of a script in the same ways as built-in commands and identifiers (and can even supersede them). *Popups are scripted context menu items. Popups are called when they are selected by the user. The term originally referred to the menus—which pop up upon a right click. It is still used this way in the manual. *Remotes are event-handling scripts. Remotes are called when the event they handle occurs. *All variables are dynamically typed. *mIRC scripts make use of sigils. Identifiers (whether custom or built-in) are preceded by \`$\`, binary variables are preceded by \`&\`, and other variables (whether local or global) are preceded by \`%\`. Commands and aliases are not preceded by any particular character (although when entered from a window's command line they must be preceded by the command prefix, usually \`/\`). File handling *Scripts can read from and write to files [\`$read(file,[args])\`  \`/write\` ] The above is intended for singular access to the file. Because each time you issue \`$read\` or \`/write\` you open and close the file for access. Multiple accesses, during a loop for instance, is best handled through \`/fopen\`, \`/fwrite\` and \`/fclose\`. Since this opens the file only once. In some cases \`/filter\` and \`/savebuf\` is an even more efficient (non scripted loop) method. *Scripts can also copy and delete files. [\`/copy\`  \`/remove\`] Binary variables *Contain unlimited (8192 bytes prior to mIRC 6.1) raw data *Globally accessible via commands and identifiers *Automatically unset when script returns control to mIRC (and not to another part of a script) *Prefixed with \`&\` (e.g. \`&Variable;\`) *Cannot be accessed other than by \`/bread\` and \`/bwrite\`, so these variables cannot be passed onto other parts of the script Hash tables *May contain unlimited binary data or up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of plain text. This limit is imposed by mIRC's scripting parser's own line length limitation (unless assigning a binary variable) *Globally accessible via commands and identifiers *Automatically unset when exiting mIRC as they are only stored in memory *Can be saved for later use *Not prefixed *Faster than accessing from a file, as hash tables are stored in memory rather than the hard disk *Size limited only by the computer's memory limits. *Allows any bucket size to be used Global variables *May contain up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of data including its name (however due to line-length limitations in mIRC's scripting parser, a maximum of 4,146 bytes can be assigned explicitly using /set or /var — this number decreasing as the variable's name grows longer) *Cannot store NUL (ASCII 0) or trailing spaces *Globally accessible *Do not automatically unset unless a switch is used (stored automatically in a mIRC initialization file) *Prefixed with \`%\` (e.g. \`%Variable\`) *Created using the \`set\` command or \`var -g\` or \`%Variable = value\` notation Local variables *May contain up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of data including the variable name (however due to line-length limitations in mIRC's scripting parser, a maximum of 4,146 bytes can be assigned explicitly using the /set or /var commands — this number decreasing as the variable's name grows longer) *Can store NUL (ASCII 0) or trailing spaces *Are destroyed when the triggered alias or event ends *Prefixed with \`%\` (e.g. \`%Variable\`) *Created using the \`var\` command. \`var\` is merely an internal alias for \`set -l\` but \`var\` poses the means to declare multiple local variables on a single line (e.g. \`var %a = 1, %b, %c = 2\`) Limitations *Scripting parser supports a maximum of 8,292 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) characters per line (not including newlines or indentation). *Strings are not syntactically enclosed, creating ambiguities in code where characters meant as literal strings are treated as part of the language's syntax. *Each line of code is broken down into a set of space-delimited tokens. As mIRC's parser does not support null tokens and the language doesn't provide a syntax to clearly differentiate literal strings from code; Prior to mIRC version 6.2 it was impossible to pass multiple consecutive spaces to any command or alias.

The tactics used by Sea Shepherd have attracted opposition, with the group accused of eco-terrorism by both the Japanese government and Greenpeace. Watson is a citizen of Canada and the United States. The Toronto native joined a Sierra Club protest against nuclear testing in 1969. He was a co-founder of Greenpeace, crewed and skippered for it and a founding board member in 1972. He has been credited by The New York Times, The New Yorker, and other publications with being a founder of Greenpeace. The documentary How to Change the World shows that Watson was indeed one of the original founding members of Greenpeace. Because Watson argued for a strategy of direct action that conflicted with the Greenpeace interpretation of nonviolence, he was ousted from the board in 1977 and subsequently left the organization. That same year, he formed the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The group was the subject of a reality show named Whale Wars. He promotes veganism, and a biocentric, rather than anthropocentric, worldview. Watson's activities have led to legal action from authorities in countries including the United States, Canada, Norway, Costa Rica and Japan. He was detained in Germany on an extradition request by Costa Rica in May 2012. The Interpol red notice was issued on September 14, 2012, at the request of Japan and Costa Rica. After staying at sea for 15 months, he returned to Los Angeles late October 2013, going through customs and \\"was not arrested\\". He appeared before a US appeals court on November 6, 2013, stating that neither he nor Sea Shepherd violated a 2012 order requiring them to leave whaling vessels alone. Although the United States is a signatory member of Interpol, Watson has not been detained for extradition to Japan or Costa Rica. He is living in Vermont, writing books. He was in Paris since July 1, 2014 but has since returned to USA. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice.https://www.maritime- executive.com/article/costa-rica-drops-charges-against-sea-shepherd-s-paul- watson Early and personal life According to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Paul Watson was born in Toronto to Anthony Joseph Watson and Annamarie Larsen, and grew up in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, along with two sisters and three brothers. As a child he was a member of the Kindness Club, which he has credited with teaching him to \\"respect and defend animals\\". After working as a tour guide at Expo 67, the World's Fair that took place in Montreal in 1967, Watson moved to Vancouver. According to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, in 1968 and the early 1970s, he joined the Canadian Coast Guard, where he served aboard weatherships, search and rescue hovercraft, and buoy tenders. He signed up as a merchant seaman in 1969 with the Norwegian Consulate in Vancouver and shipped out on the 35,000 ton bulk carrier Jarl R Trapp as a deck hand. The Jarl R Trapp was registered in Oslo, Norway and manifested for the Indian Ocean and Pacific trade. Watson has one daughter Lilliolani (born 1980) with his first wife, Starlet Lum, who was a founding director of Greenpeace Quebec, Earthforce!, Project Wolf, and Sea Shepherd. His second wife, Lisa Distefano, a former Playboy model, was Sea Shepherd's Director of Operations during the Makah anti-whaling campaigns in Friday Harbor. His third wife, Allison Lance, is an animal rights activist and a volunteer crew member of Sea Shepherd. Watson has two grandchildren.\\"Prosecutor Agrees to Release Allison and Alex jailed 22 days ... but Fines Sea Shepherd 800,000 Yen ($8,000 US) for freeing dolphins!\\" December 3, 2003. .

Retrieved July 22, 2016.Shukovsky, Paul. \\"No perjury charges vs. animal activist.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, September 9, 2004. Watson married his fourth wife Yana Rusinovich on February 14, 2015, in Paris, France. Watson and Rusinovich had a son, Tiger, on September 29, 2016. He ran for parliament in Canada's federal elections twice. Activism Early years In October 1969, Watson joined a Sierra Club protest against nuclear testing at Amchitka Island. The group which formed as a result of that protest was the Don't Make a Wave Committee, which evolved into the group known today as Greenpeace. In the early 1970s, Watson was also active with the Vancouver Liberation Front and the Vancouver Yippies.Larry Gambone, No Regrets, page 97. Black Cat Press, 2015. Watson sailed as a crew member aboard the Greenpeace Too! ship in 1971 and skippered the Greenpeace boat Astral in 1972. Paul Watson continued as a crew member, skipper, and officer aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s. According to The New Yorker, The New York Times, and other sources,\\"On the Frontlines: With Captain Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society\\", (Fall 2009), Resistance: Journal of the Earth Liberation Movement Battle Against Whaling, Groups Split on Strategy The New York Times \\" The shift infuriates Paul Watson, the Sea Shepherd founder and the captain of the Steve Irwin. One of the original founders of Greenpeace in the early 1970s, he parted ways with the group in 1978 because he wanted it to be more aggressive.\\" November 23, 2008 Watson was a founding member of Greenpeace, but the organization denies this stating he \\"was an influential early member but not, as he sometimes claims, a founder.\\" Greenpeace claims that Watson joined Greenpeace on its Amchitka expedition, which they claim to be their second expedition, but Paul Watson claims that this was Greenpeace's first meeting. Sea Shepherd Conservation Society The first Sea Shepherd vessel, the Sea Shepherd, was purchased in December 1978 with assistance from the Fund for Animals and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Sea Shepherd soon established itself as one of the more controversial environmental groups, known for provocative direct action tactics. These tactics have included throwing objects onto the decks of whaling ships, the use of \\"prop foulers\\" in an attempt to sabotage the ships, boarding whaling vessels, and the scuttling of two ships in an Icelandic harbor. In January 2013, Watson relinquished captaincy of the Steve Irwin. The organization and its activities to halt whaling are the focus of a reality TV series, Whale Wars, airing on Animal Planet. In 2010, Watson personally received more than $120,000 from Sea Shepherd. Because of mounting legal complications, Watson has stepped down as head of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2013, to abide by an injunction barring him from proximity with Japanese whaling ships. After the resolution of legal issues involving the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research, Watson returned as President of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Commander of the Sea Shepherd fleet. Other environmental activities Watson was a field correspondent for Defenders of Wildlife from 1976 to 1980 and a field representative for the Fund for Animals from 1978 to 1981. Watson also was a co-founder of Friends of the Wolf and Earthforce Environmental Society. During the 1980s, Watson declared his support for Earth First! and cultivated friendships with David Foreman and Edward Abbey. He proclaimed Sea Shepherd to be the \\"navy\\" of Earth First! According to The New Yorker, Watson revived the 19th-century practice of tree spiking. Watson worked with the Green Party of British Columbia in Vancouver in the 1980s and 90s. He ran for mayor in 1996, placing fourth. In April 2003, Watson was elected to the board of directors of the Sierra Club for a three-year term. In 2006, he did not seek re-election. He resigned from the board a month before his term ended, in protest against the organization's sponsorship of a \\"Why I Hunt\\" essay contest. In January 2008, Paul Watson was named by The Guardian as one of its \\"50 people who could save the planet\\" for the work of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Writings on activism Watson published Earthforce!, a guide to strategy for environmental activists in 1993.Paul Watson. 1993. Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy. La Caňada, CA: Chaco Press. In it, he specifically endorsed the tactics of \\"monkeywrenching\\" previously described by Dave ForemanForeman, Dave, and Bill Haywood, eds. Ecodefense: A field guide to monkeywrenching. Tucson, AZ: Ned Ludd Book, 1987. and Edward Abbey.Abbey, Ed. The monkeywrench gang. Salt Lake City: Dream Garden Press, 1985. According to Foreman in Eco-Defense—The Field Guide to Monkey-Wrenching— these are tactics of sabotage, covert activity, and direct action.Paul Watson. 1993. Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy. La Caňada, CA: Chaco Press, p. 61. Watson says he incorporated his own personal experience in writing the book.Paul Watson. 1993. Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy. La Caňada, CA: Chaco Press, p. 10. In Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy, Watson expressed disdain for the truthfulness of mainstream media: > The nature of the mass media today is such that the truth is irrelevant. > What is true and what is right to the general public is what is defined as > true and right by the mass media. Ronald Reagan understood that the facts > are not relevant. The media reported what he said as fact. Follow-up > investigation was \\"old news.\\" A headline comment on Monday's newspaper far > outweighs the revelation of inaccuracy revealed in a small box inside the > paper on Tuesday or Wednesday.Paul Watson. 1993. Earthforce! An Earth > Warrior's Guide to Strategy. La Caňada, CA: Chaco Press, p. 42. Watson was explicit about what he perceived to be the lack of truthfulness in mass media: \\"If you do not know an answer, a fact, or a statistic, then simply follow the example of an American President and do as Ronald Reagan did—make it up on the spot and deliver the information confidently and without hesitation.\\"Paul Watson. 1993. Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy. La Caňada, CA: Chaco Press, p. 43.Militants sink two of Iceland's Whaling Vessels. New York Times, November 10, 1986. In a subsequent book, Ocean Warrior, Watson expanded on this view, saying: \\"Survival in a media culture meant developing the skills to understand and manipulate media to achieve strategic objectives.\\"Watson, Paul. Ocean Warrior. Toronto: Key Porter Books, 1994, pp. 23–24. In 2007 Watson explained his view of needed population control and the future of humanity: > No human community should be larger than 20,000 people and separated from > other communities by wilderness areas [...] We need to radically and > intelligently reduce human populations to fewer than one billion [...] > Curing a body of cancer requires radical and invasive therapy, and > therefore, curing the biosphere of the human virus will also require a > radical and invasive approach [...] Who should have children? Those who are > responsible and completely dedicated to the responsibility which is actually > a very small percentage of humans.The Beginning of the End for Life as We > Know it on Planet Earth? - There is a Biocentric Solution, Paul Watson, > seashepherd.org/archive.org, 05/04/2007 Controversy Separation from Greenpeace Paul Watson continued as a crew member, officer, and skipper (in 1972) aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s. He considers himself a founding member of Greenpeace and Greenpeace International, a claim Greenpeace disputes despite being pointed out in the documentary, \\"How to Change the World\\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/how-change-world-sundance- review-766087 which shows that Watson was indeed one of the original founding members of Greenpeace. Watson has since accused Greenpeace of rewriting their history. In 1977, Watson was expelled from the Greenpeace's board of directors by a vote of 11 to 1 (Watson himself cast the single vote against it). The group felt his strong, \\"front and center\\" personality and frequently voiced opposition to Greenpeace's interpretation of \\"nonviolence\\" were too divisive. Watson subsequently left the group. The group has since labeled his actions at the time as those of a \\"mutineer\\" within their ranks. That same year, he founded his own group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. During an interview in 1978 with CBC Radio, Watson spoke out against Greenpeace (as well as other organizations) and their role and motives for the anti-sealing campaigns. Watson accused these organizations of campaigning against the Canadian seal hunt because it is an easy way to raise money and it is a profit maker for the organizations. Greenpeace has called Watson a violent extremist and will no longer comment on his activities. Charges and prosecutions Watson was sentenced to 10 days in prison and fined $8,000 for his actions during a Canadian seal hunt protest in 1980. He was convicted of assaulting a fisheries officer. He was also found guilty under the Seal Protection Act for painting harp seal pups with red dye to devalue their pelts. Watson was arrested in 1993 in Canada on charges stemming from actions against Cuban and Spanish fishing boats off the coast of Newfoundland. In 1997, Watson was convicted in absentia and sentenced to serve 120 days in jail by a court in Lofoten, Norway on charges of attempting to sink the small scale Norwegian fishing and whaling vessel Nybrænna on December 26, 1992. Dutch authorities refused to hand him over to Norwegian authorities although he did spend 80 days in detention in the Netherlands pending a ruling on extradition before being released. There have not been any successful attempts at prosecuting Watson for his activities with Sea Shepherd since the trial in Newfoundland. Watson defends his actions as falling within international law, in particular Sea Shepherd's right to enforce maritime regulations against illegal whalers and sealers. Paul Watson leads protest against Makah whaling, Port Angeles, Washington, 1998. Sea Shepherd activists Rod Coronado and David Howitt went to Iceland in 1986 and scuttled two whaling ships in port at Reykjavík and also damaged a whale meat processing factory. Watson took responsibility for the operation, abiding by published Sea Shepherd principles. He went to Iceland saying, \\"I am responsible for all activities undertaken in the name of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. I give the orders.\\" He was deported without being charged and is considered a persona non grata by Iceland In April 2010 the Japanese Coast Guard obtained an arrest warrant for Watson \\"...on suspicion of ordering sabotage activities against Japan's whaling fleet\\", and Interpol has listed him as wanted at the request of Japan. The red notice has the charges issued by Japan as, \\"Breaking into the Vessel, Damage to Property, Forcible Obstruction of Business, Injury\\". In March 2012 Interpol issued a \\"written statement to all 190 member countries making it clear that it would not publish a Red Notice\\" for the detention of Watson, but reversed that position in September 2012. In both statements Interpol stated that a \\"Red Notice is not an international arrest warrant\\" that it is \\"a request for any country to identify or locate an individual with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition in accordance with the country's national laws\\". A sign calling for the dropping of charges against Watson In May 2012 Watson was detained by German authorities at the Frankfurt Airport because of a request from the government of Costa Rica. The charge stemmed from an altercation at sea in 2002 in which Sea Shepherd said that the other vessel was illegally shark finning in Guatemalan waters. Crew members of the other ship accused Sea Shepherd of trying to kill them. Watson was charged with violating navigational regulations with the Interpol alert stating the charge as, \\"peligro de naufragio\\" (danger of shipwreck). The conflict took place during filming for the documentary Sharkwater and the charges were dropped by prosecutors after video of the incident made by the documentary film makers was shown. On May 21, Watson was released on bail of €250,000 but required to report to police in Frankfurt on a daily basis. In June, Costa Rica formally requested Watson's extradition from Germany. On July 19, 2012, Japan applied for an extradition order and Watson left Germany, resulting in a German court ordering his immediate re-arrest. It is understood the statute of limitations on his Costa Rican charges was set to expire in June 2013. On August 7, 2012 Interpol renewed the Red Notice for Watson on the charges of \\"causing a danger of drowning or of an air disaster\\" laid by Costa Rica. It was reported that Watson would come out of hiding to join Sea Shepherd in the 2012–13 campaign against Japanese whaling. Watson rejoined the crew of the Steve Irwin in the South Pacific in late November 2012. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice.https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/costa-rica-drops-charges- against-sea-shepherd-s-paul-watson Sierra Club immigration stance In 1999, Watson ran unsuccessfully for election to the national Sierra Club Board of Directors, with the backing of the anti-immigration faction Sierrans for US Population Stabilization (SUSPS). After his election to the board in 2003, Watson supported an unsuccessful slate of candidates supporting strict immigration controls as an element of a population stabilization policy. This effort was denounced by another candidate in the election, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, as a \\"hostile takeover\\" attempt by \\"radical anti- immigrant activists.\\"Davila, Florangela, – Immigration dispute spawns factions, anger in Sierra Club, Seattle Times, February 18, 2004. Watson responded by saying that the only change he was seeking in the organization's immigration stance was to restore the position it had held before its 1996 \\"neutrality policy.\\"Pedro Monteiro. Questions and Answers About the Sierra Club Elections: An Interview with Sierra Club Director Paul Watson . April 6, 2004. Retrieved January 22, 2009. Watson left the Sierra Club board in 2006. Anti-sealing activities In April 2008, Watson stated that, while the deaths of three Canadian seal hunters (a fourth one is still missing) in a marine accident involving a Canadian Coast Guard vessel and a fishing boat during the 2008 Canadian Commercial Seal Hunt were a tragedy, he felt that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seals is an even greater tragedy. Canadian Federal Fisheries Minister Loyola Hearn accused Watson of trivializing the memory of the lost sealers.CBC News at Six, CBHT-TV, Nova Scotia, April 2, 2008. Watson replied that Hearn was trying to distract attention from his government's incompetence as the boat the men were on capsized while under tow by a Canadian Coast Guard vessel, while his political ambitions continued to support and subsidize an industry that had no place in the 21st century. In 1978, Watson expressed opposition to seal hunt protest organization, suggesting in an interview with CBC's Barbara Frum that saving seals is a cheap and easy fundraiser and that seals do not deserve special status over other species., http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2008/04/april-15-2008.html Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams was quoted as saying, \\"I think what a lot of people don't realize is that this man is a terrorist.\\" Australian visa issues In October 2009, Watson, who carries a US passport,Sea Shepherd undeterred by US court order 3 News, December 19, 2012. complained to media outlets about having his request for an Australian visa denied. He states that the Australian government was attempting to sabotage the upcoming 2010 Sea Shepherd campaign by denying him entry into the country. Watson and several other shipmates were also unable to join the Steve Irwin on its promotional tour of Australia until they were able to provide documentation from the governments of the United States, Canada and Norway, exonerating them from previously claimed acts of violence, specifically claims by Sea Shepherd of intentionally sinking a ship in Norway. In January 2013, Paul Watson was presented with an Aboriginal passport by the Krautungalung people of the Gunnai Nation. Alleged shooting Farley Mowat crew in 2005 On March 17, 2008, Paul Watson said that he was shot by the Japanese crew or coast guard personnel during the Operation Migaloo anti-whaling campaign in the Southern Ocean. The incident is documented during the season finale of season 1 of the Whale Wars TV reality show, and the first six episodes are covered as a buildup to what is portrayed as the major incident during the campaign. The Japanese respond by throwing stun grenades, one crew member is injured from a grenade detonating close behind him and another injured trying to escape the explosions. Watson is then shown reaching inside his jacket and body armour and remarking \\"I've been hit.\\" Back inside the bridge of the Steve Irwin, a metal fragment is found inside the vest. The Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research disputes Sea Shepherd's statements. The Institute and Coast Guard said that they used seven stun grenades designed to temporarily debilitate a target by rendering them blind and deaf for a period of time. The Japanese government also alleged that the whalers launched \\"noise balls\\", described as \\"loud explosive deterrent devices\\". Neither of the two conflicting accounts have been independently verified. The Australian Foreign Affairs Department had condemned \\"actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury\\". Two media releases were made on the same day from the office. One said that the Australian Embassy in Tokyo had been informed by the Japanese that the whalers had \\"fired warning shots\\" while the updated version used the phrase \\"'warning balls' – also known as 'flashbangs' – had been fired\\". Accusations of terrorism Watson has been called an eco-terrorist by the Japanese government for his direct action tactics against whalers, and it repeated its position after conflicts during the 2009–10 whaling season. At an animal rights convention in 2002, Paul Watson was also quoted as saying, \\"There's nothing wrong with being a terrorist, as long as you win. Then you write the history.\\" In 2010, Fox News commentator Glenn Beck also discussed the comment, criticizing Watson's views. Watson responded to Beck's comments on the official Sea Shepherd website by stating that he had said that but that it was taken out of context, quoting Gerald Seymour's \\"One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.\\" Comments following 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami Watson was criticized for his poem published immediately following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which suggested the disaster was Neptune's anger. Watson responded to critics with a commentary on the Sea Shepherd website expressing \\"deepest concern and sympathy for the people of Japan who are suffering through one of the worst natural disasters in the history of civilization\\". Criticism of New Zealand over whaling In 2013, three Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ships docked in New Zealand, and were searched by New Zealand authorities to see if Watson was aboard. He was not, having transferred to another ship in international waters, aware New Zealand was required to notify Interpol if he entered the country. Watson criticised the search, accusing New Zealand of siding with Japan on the issue of whaling in the Southern Ocean. Reactions to activism and leadership Watson has stated that he does not consider himself a 'protester', but an 'interventionist', as he considers protesting as too submissive. He often takes the attitude that he represents (or stands in for) law enforcement which is either unwilling or unable to enforce existing laws. His leadership style has variously been called arrogant, as well as pushing himself too much \\"front and center\\", which was cited as one of the reasons for expulsion from Greenpeace. The atmosphere aboard his vessels has been compared to an \\"anarchy run by God\\". The former member of Sea Shepherd and captain of the Pete Bethune described Watson as \\"morally bankrupt\\" who would order the intentional sinking of his own ships like the Ady Gil as a means to \\"garner sympathy with the public and to create better TV\\". Watson denied this, saying \\"No one ordered him to scuttle it. Pete Bethune was captain of the Ady Gil; all decisions on the Ady Gil were his.\\" Awards Paul Watson received the Jules Verne Award on October 10, 2012. He was the second person after Captain Jacques Cousteau to be honored with a Jules Verne Award dedicated to environmentalists and adventurers. On June 28, 2010 Paul received the Asociación de Amigos del Museo de Anclas Philippe Cousteau: Defense of Marine Life Award, in recognition of his merits achieved by the work done in defense of marine life. In 2002, Paul was inducted into the US Animal Rights Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions to animal liberation.U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame . Paul received the George H. W. Bush Daily Points of Light Award in 1999 and in 2000, he was named one of Time Magazine's Top 20 Environmental Heroes of the 20th Century. On May 23rd, 2019, Captain Paul Watson received an official commendation by Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont stating that the \\"State of Connecticut conveyed both honor and recognition to Captain Paul Watson.\\"https://seashepherd.org/2019/05/24/victory-for-sharks-in-connecticut./ In 2007 Captain Watson received the Amazon Peace Prize presented by the Vice President of Ecuador Lenin Moreno. https://www.seashepherd.org.uk/news-and- commentary/news/archive/captain-watson-receives-the-amazon-peace-prize.html/ Media portrayals A biographical documentary on Paul Watson's early life and background entitled Pirate for the Sea was produced by Ron Colby in 2008. The 2008 documentary At the Edge of the World chronicled the efforts of Watson and 45 volunteers to hinder the Japanese whaling fleet in the waters around Antarctica. In 2010, long time friend and filmmaker Peter Brown released the documentary Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist, a satirical look back at the last 30 years of actions. The documentary Eco-Pirate: The Story of Paul Watson from 2011 features interviews and footage with early Greenpeace members Rex Weyler and Patrick Moore. Watson, Whale Wars, and the Japanese whaling industry were satirized in the South Park episode \\"Whale Whores\\". In its fictional Larry King show, Watson himself was called \\"An unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause\\" and \\"A smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility\\". Watson responded to the South Park episode by stating; \\"My understanding is that the Japanese Prime Minister was not amused and the whalers and dolphin killers are enraged at the way they were portrayed,\\" Watson said. \\"That's music to my ears. If the humorless whale killers and the bank rollers of the dolphin killers did not like the show, then that's all I need to applaud it.\\" Watson was portrayed (along with whale biologist, Nan Hauser), during a 60 Minutes episode that aired in 2013, as contributing to the return of the Humpback whale populations in the South Pacific. In 2019 a biopic film called, \\"Watson\\" from the Director of Inconvenient Truth, \\"Lesley Chilcott\\" was released and also aired on Animal Planet on December 22nd, 2019.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/watson-1205450https://www.forbes.com/sites/lavanyasunkara/2019/12/22/sea- shepherds-paul-watson-on-conservation-and-how-travelers-can-give- back/#3b47abad79d4.

Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. Published Dec. 18, 2008.  Roman Catholicism  The Second Vatican Council, commonly known as Vatican II, which closed in 1965, was instrumental in producing the document called Nostra aetate, which read in part: :True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures. All should see to it, then, that in catechetical work or in the preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that does not conform to the truth of the Gospel and the spirit of Christ. Furthermore, in her rejection of every persecution against any man, the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love, decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone. To further the goal of reconciliation, the Roman Catholic Church in 1971 established an internal International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations. After the committee met on May 4, 2001, Church officials stated that they would change the way Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools. This new understanding of the relationship between Christians and Jews is reflected in the revised liturgy of Good Friday in a particular way. The Good Friday Prayer of the Roman Rite had Catholics praying that the \\"perfidious Jews\\" might be converted to \\"the truth.\\" The ancient meaning of the Latin word \\"perfidis\\" in that context was \\"unbelieving\\", yet the English cognate \\"perfidious\\" had, over the centuries, gradually acquired the meaning of \\"treacherous.\\" In order to eliminate misunderstanding on this point, Pope Pius XII ordered in 1955 that, in Catholic liturgical books, the Latin word \\"perfidis\\" be more correctly translated as \\"unbelieving\\", ensuring that the prayer be understood in its original sense: praying for the Jews who remained \\"unbelieving\\" concerning the Messiah. Indeed, the same adjective was used in many of the ancient rituals for receiving non-Christian converts into the Catholic Church. Owing to the enduring potential for confusion and misunderstanding because of the divergence of English usage from the original Latin meaning, Pope John XXIII ordered that the Latin adjective \\"perfidis\\" be dropped from the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews; in 1960 he ordered it removed from all rituals for the reception of converts.Time Magazine August 15 1960 The term \\"traditionalist Catholics\\" often is used to apply to Catholic Christians who are particularly devoted to practicing the ancient traditions of the Church; yet there are also groups calling themselves \\"traditionalist Catholics\\" that either reject many of the changes made since Vatican II, or regard Vatican II as an invalid Council, or who broke away entirely from the Catholic Church after Vatican II. Some of these so-called traditionalist Catholics believe that the Pope at the time, and all Popes since, have led the majority of Catholic clergy and laity into heresy. They view interfaith dialogue with Jews as unnecessary and potentially leading to a \\"watering-down\\" of the Catholic faith. In the view of some traditionalist Catholics, Jews are believed to be damned unless they convert to Christianity. This, of course, is not the view of all who identify themselves as \\"traditional\\". In 2002, the Pontifical Biblical Commission released \\"The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures\\". In this document, the Catholic Church further clarifies its current position on Jews and their Scriptures, taking careful steps to avoid the appearance of sanctioning any Catholic hostility toward Jews. The Commission writes, \\"Jewish messianic expectation is not in vain. It can become for us Christians a powerful stimulant to keep alive the eschatological dimension of our faith. Like them, we too live in expectation. The difference is that for us the One who is to come will have the traits of the Jesus who has already come and is already present and active among us.\\" It continues, \\"It cannot be said, therefore, that Jews do not see what has been proclaimed in the text, but that the Christian, in the light of Christ and in the Spirit, discovers in the text an additional meaning that was hidden there.\\" In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Jews do not need to be converted to find salvation, and that Catholics should work with Jews to fight anti-semitism. Protestant churches In its Driebergen Declaration (1991), the European Lutheran Commission on the Church and the Jewish People rejected the traditional Christian “teaching of contempt” towards Jews and Judaism, and in particular, the anti-Jewish writings of Martin Luther, and called for the reformation of church practice in the light of these insights.  Christian Scholars Group  The Christian Scholars Group on Christian-Jewish Relations is a group of 22 Christian scholars, theologians, historians and clergy from six Christian Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church, which works to \\"develop more adequate Christian theologies of the church's relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people.\\"  Orthodox Christianity  The Orthodox Church has a history of antisemitism associated with it. For example, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were published under the aegis of Orthodox priests in Tsarist Russia. The Orthodox Christian attitude to the Jewish people is seen in the virulently Anti-Semitic eastern Orthodox organizations which arose in the post Soviet eastern bloc.  Joint efforts  The International Council of Christians and Jews (ICCJ) is an umbrella organisation of 38 national Jewish-Christian dialogue organisations worldwide, governed according to the principles of the Ten Points of the Seelisberg Conference, which was held in 1947 to explore the relationship basis of Christianity and antisemitism. The institute was founded in 1987.The Center for Catholic Jewish Studies In 1993 the ICCJ published Jews and Christians in Search of a Common Religious Basis for Contributing Towards a Better World. The document \\"contains both separate Jewish perspectives and Christian perspectives concerning mutual communication and cooperation as well as a joint view of a common religious basis for Jews and Christians to work together for a better world....These considerations are not \\"the official theological, philosophical nor ideological underpinnings of the ICCJ and its member organisations, but are an invitation to consider what our work is all about. They have no authority other than their intrinsic world...\\"ICCJ 1993 Jews and Christians in Search of a Common Religious Basis for Contributing Towards a Better World Another initiative to promote joint initiatives between Jews and Christians began in October 2002, with the establishment and approval of the bylaws of the Council of Centers of Jewish-Christian Relations. The Council is an association of centers and institutes in the United States and Canada devoted to enhancing mutual understanding between Jews and Christians. Although most of these centers or institutes are located in the United States, there are also affiliate members from Europe and Israel. Representatives from major Christian and Jewish agencies and religious bodies in the United States are also members. The Council of Centers of Jewish- Christian Relations  Jewish responses  The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia article on Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah notes the following Jewish-Christian reconciliation: Robert Gordis, a Conservative rabbi, wrote an essay on Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue; through his writings and similar writings of other rabbis in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by all parties engaging in interfaith dialogue.The Root and the Branch, Chapter 4, Robert Gordis, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962 Rabbis from all the non-Orthodox movements of Judaism became involved in inter-faith theological dialogue with a number of Christian churches. Conservative Jews and Reform Jews now commonly engage in inter-faith theological dialogue; a small number of Modern Orthodox rabbis engage in such dialogue as well. Most Orthodox rabbis do not engage in such dialogue. The predominant position of Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik; he held that Judaism and Christianity are \\"two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic\\". In his view \\"the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level... the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider...\\" As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible. However, Rabbi Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but \\"desirable and even essential\\" on non- theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism. As a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not cooperate in interfaith discussions between the Catholic Church and Judaism, nor did they participate in the later interfaith dialogues between Protestant Christian groups and the Jewish community. Modern papal views Pope John Paul II made special effort to improve relations between Christianity (Catholicism in particular) and Jews and is often seen as a major figure in opening up dialogue between the Catholic and Jewish communities. He was the first pope to make an official visit to a synagogue, and made official apologies on behalf of the Catholic Church for wrongdoing against Jews throughout history. His theology often posed a dual covenant quality, and referred to Judaism as \\"the older brother\\" of Christianity. Pope Benedict XVI has expressed very similar views to those of some Orthodox rabbis, saying in a 2004 book with Marcello Pera that inter- cultural dialogue could often be positive, but that theological dialogue was practically impossible and not always desirable.  National Council of Synagogues  The National Council of Synagogues (NCS) is a partnership of the non-Orthodox branches of Judaism. (Orthodox Jews have been invited to join, but Orthodox leaders have ruled that an Orthodox rabbi may not work with non-Orthodox rabbis as a matter of religious principle.) This group deals with interfaith issues, and meets regularly with the representatives of the United States Catholic Bishops Conference, the National Council of Churches of Christ and various other denominations and religions. Their goal is to foster religious conversation and dialogue in the spirit of religious pluralism. Today Today the Jewish leaders are having connection with the Christian leaders. Reflections on Covenant and Mission is a statement developed jointly by the NCS and the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.  Dabru Emet  Recently, more than 220 rabbis from all branches of Judaism signed a document called Dabru Emet (\\"Speak the Truth\\") that has since been used in Jewish education programs across the U.S. Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity On 3 December 2015, the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians. The unprecedented Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity, entitled \\"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States and Europe and now has over 60 signatories. Between Jerusalem and Rome On 31 August 2017, representatives of the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and presented the Holy See with a statement entitled Between Jerusalem and Rome. The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council's Declaration Nostra Aetate, whose fourth chapter represents the “Magna Charta” of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement Between Jerusalem and Rome does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future. Spanish and Portuguese law of return On 16 December 1968, Spain formally revoked the Alhambra Decree, the 1492 edict expelling Jews from Spain.1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain – THe New York Times, 17 Dec 1968 The Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, King Juan Carlos (wearing a skullcap) prayed alongside Israeli president Chaim Herzog and members of the Jewish community in the Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain). The King said that \\"Sefarad (the Hebrew name for Spain) is no longer nostalgia, nor a place where Jews should feel as if at home, because Hispano-Jews are home in Spain. What matters is the desire to analyse and project the past in regards to our future.\\" As of November 2012, Sephardic Jews have been given the right to automatic Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardic Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners). While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardic Jews will be entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain. This made Spain the only nation aside from Israel to grant automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews. Today, the number of Jews in Spain is estimated at 50,000. The deadline for applications under the Spanish law was September 2019, by which time 130,000 Jews had applied.Over 130,000 Jews of Sephardic heritage applied for Spanish citizenship under law of return In April 2013, Portugal passed a law of return, allowing descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled in the inquisition to claim Portuguese citizenship provided that they \\"belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal\\" without a requirement for residence. The amendment to Portugal's \\"Law on Nationality\\" was approved unanimously on 11 April 2013. The law came into effect in March 2015, and is open-ended.

Herbert H. Franklin, the founder, began his career in the metal die casting business before establishing his automobile enterprise. Controlled by Herbert H Franklin it had very few other significant shareholders. Franklin bought its vehicles from the H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company which was only moderately profitable and frequently missed dividends on common stock.Sinclair Powell. The Franklin Automobile Company, Society of Automotive Engineers Inc., Warrendale PA, 1999 The two major characteristics of their automobiles were their air-cooled engines and in the early years their lightness and responsiveness when compared with other luxury cars. The Franklin companies suffered financial collapse in April 1934. Aside from his consequent retirement CEO Herbert Franklin's lifestyle was unaffected. Franklin innovations All Franklin cars were air-cooled, which the company considered simpler and more reliable than water cooling, and the company considered light weight to be critical in making a well-performing car given the limited power of the engines then available. Most Franklins were wood-framed, though the very first used an angle iron frame (1902) and, beginning in 1928, the heavier cars adopted a conventional pressed-steel frame. Lightweight aluminum was used in quantity, to the extent that Franklin was reckoned to be the largest user of aluminum in the world in the early years of the company. Production Offerings for 1904 included a touring car model with a detachable rear tonneau and which seated 4 passengers. The transverse-mounted, vertical straight-four engine, producing 10 hp (7.5 kW), was mounted at the front of the car. A 2-speed planetary transmission was fitted. The car weighed 1100 lb (499 kg). List price was US$1300. By contrast, the Ford Model F in 1905 was priced at $2,000, the FAL was US$1750,Clymer, p.104. a Cole 30 or Colt Runabout was US$1500,Clymer, p.63. the Ford Model S $700, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout US$650,Clymer, p.32. Western's Gale Model A US$500,Clymer, p.51. the Black could be as low as $375,Clymer, p.61. and the Success hit the amazingly low US$250. Franklin cars were technological leaders, first with six cylinders (by 1905) and automatic spark advance, in 1907. Demonstrating reliability, L.L. Whitman drove a Franklin from New York City to San Francisco in 1906 in 15 days 2 hours 15 minutes, a new record.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.158. Franklin were undisputed leaders in air- cooled cars at a time when virtually every other manufacturer had adopted water cooling as cheaper and easier to manufacture. Before the invention of antifreeze, the air-cooled car had a huge advantage in cold weather, and Franklins were popular among people such as doctors, who needed an all-weather machine. The limitation of air-cooling was the size of the cylinder bore and the available area for the valves, which limited the power output of the earlier Franklins. By 1921, a change in cooling--moving the fan from sucking hot air to blowing cool air--led the way to the gradual increase in power. Franklins were often rather odd-looking cars, although some were distinctly handsome with Renault-style hoods. Starting in 1925, at the demand of dealers, Franklins were redesigned to look like conventional cars sporting a massive nickel-plated \\"dummy radiator\\" which served as an air intake and was called a \\"hoodfront\\". This design by J. Frank DeCausse enabled the Franklin to employ classic styling. The same year, Franklin introduced the boat-tail to car design. Improved engine design In 1930 Franklin introduced a new type of engine which ultimately produced , with one of the highest power-to-weight ratios of the time. In 1932, in response to competition amongst luxury car makers, Franklin brought out a twelve-cylinder engine. Air cooled with 398 cubic inches (6.5 L) it developed 150 hp (110 kW). It was designed to be installed in a lightweight chassis, but the car became a 6000 pound behemoth when Franklin engineers were overruled by management sent in from banks to recover bad loans. Although attractive, the Twelve did not have the ride and handling characteristics of its forebears. Unfortunately, this was simply the wrong vehicle to be building after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. The cars sold poorly and came nowhere near to recouping the company's investment. The company declared bankruptcy in 1934. Car production did not survive, but the name and assets were sold and production of air- cooled engines for commercial and aircraft use was continued by Aircooled Motors of Syracuse. This company was bought after World War II by Preston Tucker. The flat-six engines were fitted with water-cooling jackets and used in the short lived Tucker automobile. The company was sold again after Tucker was disbanded. Franklin engines powered numerous light planes as well as (thanks to their light weight) most early American-built helicopters. Aircooled Motors, the last company to manufacture air-cooled engines under the Franklin name, declared bankruptcy in 1975 and its designs were sold to the Polish government. Engines based on these designs are still in production. In retrospect In his book for the Society of Automotive Engineers Inc, The Franklin Automobile Company, Sinclair Powell gave the following reasons for the end of Franklin: :While the cars were ranked among the industry's top products and in some years more than half the sales were to previous Franklin owners on top of major economic forces there were difficulties from within the firm itself. # Profit per vehicle was enough to pay a proper dividend in only one year, 1925 # Franklin held on to its \\"craft shop\\" approach whereas Packard and Cadillac moved on without any loss of quality # Franklin went on making many components when they might have been bought in at a much lower cost # Walker Body Company was chosen to supply aluminium bodies of high quality when (heavier) steel bodies were available at relatively low cost # Franklin dealers might be in insignificant locations and in any case did not occupy the imposing establishments of Packard and Cadillac dealers Debt taken on to greatly expand production in 1929 produced extra cars saleable only for very large discounts. This discounting seriously weakened both Franklin and its dealerships even before the onset of the Great Depression. Similar discounting to move unsold stock was repeated in 1930 and again in 1931 and Franklin's position became hopeless. It struggled on until adjudged bankrupt in April 1934.

(A set of rank < λ is one of the elements of the set Vλ of the von Neumann hierarchy.) *Axiom I3: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of Vλ into itself. *Axiom I2: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of V into a transitive class M that includes Vλ where λ is the first fixed point above the critical point. *Axiom I1: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of Vλ+1 into itself. *Axiom I0: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of L(Vλ+1) into itself with critical point below λ. These are essentially the strongest known large cardinal axioms not known to be inconsistent in ZFC; the axiom for Reinhardt cardinals is stronger, but is not consistent with the axiom of choice. If j is the elementary embedding mentioned in one of these axioms and κ is its critical point, then λ is the limit of j^n(\\\\kappa) as n goes to ω. More generally, if the axiom of choice holds, it is provable that if there is a nontrivial elementary embedding of Vα into itself then α is either a limit ordinal of cofinality ω or the successor of such an ordinal. The axioms I0, I1, I2, and I3 were at first suspected to be inconsistent (in ZFC) as it was thought possible that Kunen's inconsistency theorem that Reinhardt cardinals are inconsistent with the axiom of choice could be extended to them, but this has not yet happened and they are now usually believed to be consistent. Every I0 cardinal κ (speaking here of the critical point of j) is an I1 cardinal. Every I1 cardinal κ (sometimes called ω-huge cardinals) is an I2 cardinal and has a stationary set of I2 cardinals below it. Every I2 cardinal κ is an I3 cardinal and has a stationary set of I3 cardinals below it. Every I3 cardinal κ has another I3 cardinal above it and is an n-huge cardinal for every n<ω. Axiom I1 implies that Vλ+1 (equivalently, H(λ+)) does not satisfy V=HOD. There is no set S⊂λ definable in Vλ+1 (even from parameters Vλ and ordinals <λ+) with S cofinal in λ and S<λ, that is, no such S witnesses that λ is singular. And similarly for Axiom I0 and ordinal definability in L(Vλ+1) (even from parameters in Vλ). However globally, and even in Vλ,Consistency of V = HOD With the Wholeness Axiom, Paul Corazza, Archive for Mathematical Logic, No. 39, 2000. V=HOD is relatively consistent with Axiom I1. Notice that I0 is sometimes strengthened further by adding an \\"Icarus set\\", so that it would be *Axiom Icarus set: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of L(Vλ+1, Icarus) into itself with the critical point below λ. The Icarus set should be in Vλ+2 − L(Vλ+1) but chosen to avoid creating an inconsistency. So for example, it cannot encode a well-ordering of Vλ+1. See section 10 of Dimonte for more details.

He is Associate Director of Research at the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) and founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), a nonprofit organization whose principal activity is promoting the passage and implementation of outpatient commitment laws and civil commitment laws and standards in individual states that allow people diagnosed with mental illness to be forcibly committed and medicated easily throughout the United States. Torrey has conducted numerous research studies, particularly on possible infectious causes of schizophrenia. He has become well known as an advocate of the idea that severe mental illness is due to biological factors and not social factors.Princeton Alumni News, 11/5/2003 He has appeared on national radio and television outlets and written for many newspapers. He has received two Commendation Medals by the U.S. Public Health Service and numerous other awards and tributes. He has been criticized by a range of people, including federal researchers and others for some of his attacks on de-institutionalization and his support for forced medication as a method of treatment. Torrey is on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), which describes itself as being \\"a national nonprofit advocacy organization\\". TAC supports involuntary treatment when deemed appropriate by a judge (at the urging of the person's psychiatrist and family members). Torrey has written several best-selling books on mental illness, including Surviving Schizophrenia. He is also a distant relative of abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey and has written his biography. Education and early career Torrey earned his bachelor's degree from Princeton University, and his M.D. from the McGill University Faculty of Medicine. Torrey also earned a master's degree in anthropology from Stanford University, and was trained in psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. At McGill and later at Stanford, he was exposed to a biological approach and recalls that one of his first-year instructors at McGill was Heinz Lehmann, the first clinician in North America to use the first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine. The medical school was housed next door to the Montreal Neurological Institute, a premier neuroscience center. Torrey then practiced general medicine in Ethiopia for two years as a Peace Corps physician and later on he practiced in the South Bronx. From 1970 to 1975, he was a special administrative assistant to the National Institute of Mental Health director. He then worked for a year in Alaska in the Indian Health Service. He then became a ward physician at St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C. for nine years, where he reportedly worked with the most challenging patients and aimed to avoid the use of seclusion or restraints on the acute admission units. He also volunteered at Washington, D.C. homeless clinics. Stanley Medical Research Institute Torrey is the founder and Executive Director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), a large, private provider of research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the U.S. SMRI also maintains a collection of postmortem brain tissue from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression and from unaffected controls, which are made available to researchers without charge. After reading Torrey's book Surviving Schizophrenia, Theodore Stanley, a businessman who had made a fortune in direct-mail marketing and whose son had been diagnosed in the late 1980s with bipolar disorder, contacted Torrey and he and his wife provided the funds for the new institute. the Stanley Institute had 30 employees and funded half of all U.S. research on bipolar disorder and about a quarter of all schizophrenia research. In 2003 the institute's rapidly growing research budget exceeded $40 million, 74 percent of which was given out to other researchers through grants. It reports that 75% of its expenditure goes towards the development of new treatments. The Stanley Medical Institute in Bethesda, Maryland has collected in excess of 600 brains. In ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/VOL 61, NOV 2004, in a report called, \\"Brain Anatomy in Adults With Velocardiofacial Syndrome With and Without Schizophrenia\\", SMRI published results of a Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study showing difference in brain structure of people with and without schizophrenia. The SMRI has been sued for allegedly taking brains for use in research without proper consent. One lawsuit was settled out of court.A Dispute Over Brain Donations SMRI was also supporting the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, which plans to scan the entire genome for variants that predispose to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and screen hundreds of thousands of compounds against new molecular targets prior to clinical testing. The center was co-founded by Pamela Sklar, who published the first statistically meaningful gene identifications in schizophrenia and has demonstrated that schizophrenia is likely caused by many rare genetic variants. SMRI reports that it has a close relationship with and is the supporting organization for the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC). Treatment Advocacy Center Torrey is a founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national organization that supports outpatient commitment for certain people with mental illness who, in his view of their treatment history and present circumstances, are judged unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision. TAC has been credited by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and others with helping pass Kendra's Law in the state. Kendra's Law allows court-ordered involuntary treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness who have a history of not following psychiatric advice, i.e., individuals who are, \\"as a result of his or her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan.\\"AOT Summary Previously, only inpatient programs were available to submit a person to involuntary treatment. TAC's efforts to pass Kendra's Law led to similar successful passage of Laura's Law in California, and similar laws in Florida and elsewhere. Torrey has testified numerous times in front of Congress. National Alliance on Mental Illness Torrey was for many years an active advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt that he spoke up for them when much of the medical establishment had previously held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the hardcover royalties from the sale of his book Surviving Schizophrenia.Winerip, M. (1998) Schizophrenia's Most Zealous Foe New York Times, February 22 Although Torrey, TAC, and NAMI remain aligned, NAMI may have tried to distance itself from TAC in 1998. One source The Psychiatric Times, reported that TAC was designed from the start to be \\"a separate support organization with its own source of funding.\\" According to MindFreedom International, an association of survivors of psychiatric treatment opposed to involuntary treatment, NAMI severed its relationship with TAC because of pressure from groups opposed to Torrey both from within NAMI and outside NAMI. Torrey is, according to MindFreedom, one of 'the most feverishly pro-force psychiatrists in the world'. MindFreedom suggests that the 'links between NAMI and TAC are simply going from overt to covert.' In 2002, NAMI's Executive Director issued a statement highly critical of 60 Minutes for producing a piece entitled \\"Dr. Torrey's War.\\" In the statement, NAMI alternately criticized and backed various positions espoused by Torrey while aiming its criticism at 60 Minutes for what NAMI called \\"sound bite journalism.\\" Torrey was also the keynote speaker at the 23rd annual NAMI convention in 2002. In 2005, NAMI gave Torrey a tribute on its 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall, for those who have donated over $25,000. It called him a groundbreaking researcher, a ferociously resolute advocate, a prominent and admired author of dozens of books and a dedicated practicing clinician, and said that he had \\"touched the lives of countless NAMI members throughout this nation.\\" NAMI has some continuing links to TAC via their board of directors. Frederick Frese, a psychologist who died in 2018, was on both the NAMI and TAC boards. TAC has two other former NAMI board members on their board and Laurie Flynn, the former NAMI executive director, is part of the TAC Honorary Advisory Committee. In 2008, Torrey disagreed with a NAMI view on second-generation antipsychotics and accused the medical director and executive director of failing to disclose conflicts of interest, because they are employees of an organization that receives more than half its budget from pharmaceutical companies. He argued they were not representing the views of many members of NAMI including himself.Torrey, E.F. (2008) A Question of Disclosure Psychiatr Serv 59:935, August 2008 Scientific research and views In the 1950s, it was commonly thought that schizophrenia was caused by 'bad parenting'. Torrey has argued that this theory had a toxic effect on parents. His sister had severe schizophrenia and spent most of five decades in hospitals and nursing homes until her death.Moran, M. (2007) Search for Schizophrenia's Roots Started at Home Psychiatr News July 6, Volume 42, Number 13, page 17 Torrey has been a fierce opponent of the influence of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. He has also argued that psychiatry should focus only on severe mental illness, conceived as neurological disorders, rather than other mental issues that he viewed as non-medical.Mihm, S. (2001) Pet Theory: Do Cats Cause Schizophrenia? The New York Times Magazine on the WebStevens, L. Why Psychiatry Should Be Abolished as a Medical Specialty Retrieved on Aug-10-2008 Torrey was principal investigator of a NIMH Schizophrenia/Bipolar Disorder Twin Study conducted at the Neuroscience center of St Elizabeth's Hospital in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and copublished more than a dozen studies on structural brain differences between affected and unaffected siblings. He differed from his collaborators in arguing that the genetic heritability of schizophrenia was lower than typically estimated. A review of Torrey's data analysis, however, suggested he had erroneously compared different sorts of concordance statistics. In the early 1970s, Torrey became interested in viral infections as possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a parasite Toxoplasma gondii whose definitive host is the cat, but whose intermediate host can be any mammal, including humans. Up to one third of the world's human population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection. Since then he has published, often with Robert Yolken, more than 30 articles on seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia, focusing especially on Toxoplasma gondii. He is involved in five or six ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics such as minocycline and azithromycin) as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes will eventually explain the \\"vast majority\\" of schizophrenia cases. Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor. Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and Toxoplasma gondii, by different authors in different countries, are funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on the causes of schizophrenia, although infections may be seen as one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early neurodevelopment in some cases. Torrey has generally been in favor of antipsychotic drugs. He has claimed that taking antipsychotics reduces the risk of violence, homelessness and prison. He has argued that \\"noncompliance\\" in about half of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is due to lack of \\"insight\\" into the illness because the part of the brain for self-awareness has been affected; and that in some who are aware it is due to adverse effects ranging from tremors or sedation to sexual dysfunction to substantial weight gain.E. Fuller Torrey Reinventing Mental Health Care City Journal, Autumn 1999 He has also reported that at least some antipsychotics cause medical conditions that can be fatal in some people, especially African Americans. He has also argued that pharmaceutical companies have too much influence over psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists, effectively buying them off.E. Fuller Torrey (2002) The Going Rate on Shrinks: Big Pharma and the buying of psychiatry The American Prospect, July 14. Torrey has advocated in favor of a flexible well-funded range of community mental health services, including Assertive Community Treatment, clubhouses (staffed by professionals with consumers as members), supported housing and supported employment, emphasizing illness and medication compliance throughout. Recognition Torrey has appeared on national radio and television (outlets like NPR, Oprah, 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Dateline) and has written for many newspapers. He has received a 1984 Special Families Award from NAMI, two Commendation Medals from the U.S. Public Health Service, a 1991 National Caring Award, and a humanitarian award from NARSAD (now known as the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation). In 1999, he received a research award from the International Congress of Schizophrenia. In 2005, a tribute to Torrey was included in NAMI's 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall.Treatment Advocacy Center PRESIDENT, E. FULLER TORREY, M.D. Retrieved on Aug-10-2008 Criticism Torrey has criticized many organizations. He has charged the National Institute of Mental Health with not concentrating its resources sufficiently on severe mental illness and directly applicable research; NIMH has disputed his statistics and viewpoint. Torrey has been charged with acting to limit the voice of those consumers, survivors and ex-patients that he disagrees with, opposing their civil rights and censoring and ridiculing their ideas and those of their supporters. Torrey has been a long-time critic of the Center for Mental Health Services that provides support and advocacy, on the grounds that they support anti-psychiatry groups and those opposed to outpatient commitment, claiming they neglect the seriously mentally ill due to a hippie '60s attitude, distribute funds on the basis of other factors such as \\"community cohesion\\" and ethnic minority involvement, and are more dysfunctional than the individuals they are supposed to help. He has specifically opposed public funding for the National Empowerment Center, for rejecting the medical model and arguing for a recovery model without necessarily needing medication; it has since lost its funding from the CMHS. Torrey has in general been instrumental in lobbying against, and undermining, community-based consumer projects because they promoted social and experiential recovery and questioned the standard medical model. Consumer organizations have protested that they are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to political whim while Torrey and his organizations have rich and powerful backers.McLean, A. (2003) Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part II: Impact of Managed Care and Continuing Challenges International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation. 8, 58-70. It has been argued that Torrey and other psychiatric and family member advocates do not necessarily have the same interests as consumers/survivors themselves. Differences in ideology sharpened after the development of NAMI.McLean, A. (2003). Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part I: Legitimization of the Consumer Movement and Obstacles to It. International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation. 8, 47-57 In criticizing the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health for not recommending forced outpatient medicating, Torrey claimed that stigma against people with mental disorders was largely due to them committing violent acts due to not taking medication, and called the recovery model harmful for sending a cruel message of hope, or implicit blame, to those he believes cannot engage in a recovery process, despite being a laudable long-term vision for the Commission.Torrey (2003) Treatment Advocacy Center Statement Newswire. Retrieved on Aug 12 2008 Torrey hopes to live long enough to see vaccines to prevent many or most cases of schizophrenia. Although Torrey described family members as \\"surviving schizophrenia\\" in his book of that title, in 1997 he said the term \\"psychiatric survivor\\" used by ex-patients to describe themselves was just political correctness and he blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, for the deaths of half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the street.E. Fuller Torrey (1997) Taking Issue: ‘Psychiatric Survivors’ and Non-Survivors , 48:2 Psychiatric Services 143 His comments elicited a record number of letters in response, some in favour of Torrey but most against. The accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely unsubstantiated, and issues of self-determination and self-identity said to be more complex than Torrey realizes. In the same journal in 1999, Torrey and Miller of the Stanley Foundation Research Program argued for an incentivised schizophrenia treatment system backed by a credible threat of force, modeled on that used for the fatal infectious disease tuberculosis;E. Fuller Torrey, M.D and Judy Miller, B.A. Can Psychiatry Learn From Tuberculosis Treatment? Psychiatr Serv 50:1389, November 1999 replies criticized the logic of the analogy and resort to forced drugging rather than developing alliances and understanding, to which Torrey accused the director and members of MindFreedom International of living off federal funds while denying illness and not caring about the mentally ill on the streets and in prisons.Hughes, W.C. (2001) Schizophrenia Is Not Contagious Psychiatr Serv 52:384, March 2001 Torrey has been a vocal critic of the failures of deinstitutionalization and inadequate community mental health services. He has generally linked this to issues of violence, homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper focus by the relevant governmental organizations.Torrey, E.F. & Zdanowicz, M. (1998) Why deinstitutionalization turned deadly The Wall Street Journal August 4 He has been accused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance, including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When a California NAMI journal editor included a questioning of Torrey's statistics, the local board glued together the pages and effectively shut down the journal. Others, while agreeing that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued that Torrey's solutions are outdated and that his book The Insanity Offense is based on unsubstantiated portrayals of certainty on the statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication, stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating one-dimensional solutions. TAC's attempts to associate violent incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as wild hyperbole, and the use of the term \\"assisted treatment\\" has been described as a euphemism for forced drugging.Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder, Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies, Ethical Human Sciences and Services 3(3) Fall/Winter 2001, pp. 147-159. Torrey has been criticized by, and has criticized, Thomas Szasz, a libertarian psychiatrist and author of The Myth of Mental Illness (1961), who is opposed to involuntary treatment.Szasz T.(2004) Psychiatric Fraud and Force: A Critique of E. Fuller Torrey J Humanist Psychol 2004;4:416-430. PDFSullum, J. (2005) Thomas Szasz Takes on His Critics: Is mental illness an insane idea? Reason Online, May 2005 Torrey has said he admires Szasz for his outspoken criticisms of many psychiatric practices, including \\"diagnostic creep\\" (disease mongering) and the potential for the political abuse of psychiatric labels, but he has criticized Szasz for asserting that schizophrenia is not an organic disease of the brain like, for example, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.

He is best known for his work with new wave band Ultravox, who achieved their greatest commercial success in the 1980s. Biography Currie had an interest in music from an early age. As a child he sang a lot and at the age of ten he got a guitar. In 1961 he picked up the violin at school and also sang in a choir. A year later he was in the school orchestra, but had to change instrument to viola to get a place at the Huddersfield School of Music, which he joined in 1965. The education was a preparation to become an orchestral player, learning viola with piano as his second instrument and also studying composition and harmony. During this time he joined a string quartet, played viola in an orchestra and performed with a viola, clarinet and piano trio. At this time Currie was excited to discover composers like Béla Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Honegger and Edgar Varese. By 1967 he became increasingly interested in rock music, excited by the fact that bands created something unique and original together. In 1969 he had qualified for a place at the Royal Academy of Music in London for further education, but decided not to go. Currie was interested in breaking into other areas of music and joined a rock band instead, playing viola. In the early 1970s he was a member of the experimental art group The Ritual Theatre, which included four classically trained musicians and four dancers. With this group Currie performed in Holland, Edinburgh Festival and various other places. In 1974, Currie left Ritual Theatre to join the glam rock band Tiger Lily on viola and keyboard. In 1976, after several name changes, the band ultimately became Ultravox and recorded three albums, Ultravox!, Ha!-Ha!-Ha! and Systems of Romance, before singer John Foxx left to pursue a solo career in March 1979. During Ultravox's subsequent hiatus, Currie dedicated himself to different projects. He collaborated with Gary Numan who had admired the Systems Of Romance album and asked Currie to record some songs that were included on his first solo album, The Pleasure Principle. Currie toured with Numan's band during 1979. During soundchecks for the tour Currie, with Gary Numan band musicians Chris Payne and Cedric Sharpley began to develop a song of their own called \\"Toot City\\". Currie had also joined the studio-based band Visage, fronted by Steve Strange, that also included Midge Ure. Currie and Ure developed a solid working relationship. Visage drummer Rusty Egan encouraged Currie to ask Ure to join the defunct Ultravox as lead singer/guitarist. Whilst composing material for a new Ultravox album and for the debut Visage album, Ure collaborated with Currie on the \\"Toot City\\" track which eventually became \\"Fade to Grey\\". The single became a huge hit for Visage in early 1981. However, this was surpassed by Ultravox's hit \\"Vienna\\", released around the same time. Both Ultravox and Visage became highly successful recording acts in the early 1980s. Ure decided to leave Visage to focus on Ultravox full-time in 1982. Currie remained with Visage for a while longer, but he too had left by 1984. From 1980–86, Ultravox released seven top 10 albums, including a live album and a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation and featured in Live Aid in Wembley Stadium on 13 July 1985. During the last days of the band, there were tensions between Currie and Ure. With an underwhelming response to their 1986 album U-Vox, the band effectively disintegrated. In 1988, Currie put out an instrumental solo album Transportation, released on the IRS NoSpeak record label. Steve Howe played guitar on some of the tracks. In 1989 he formed the band Humania. An album by them called Sinews of Soul was released in 2005. In 1992, Currie reformed Ultravox with a new line-up (himself being the only original member involved). With Tony Fennell on vocals, they recorded the album \\"Revelation\\". At the outset of the subsequent tour, Fennell left to be replaced by Sam Blue. The tour took in the former USSR and Malta amongst other locations. Many of the synthesisers for which Currie was famous, apart from the often-volatile OSCar and Minimoog, were abandoned for this tour, replaced with Korg Wavestations and T-series keyboards. A further Ultravox album featuring this line-up, \\"Ingenuity\\", was released in 1994. Both albums were commercially unsuccessful. Since 2001 Billy Currie has released several solo albums on his own label. These include Unearthed, completed in 1998, and Keys and the Fiddle, which includes Curries soundtrack to the short film The Fragile Skin (1999), new material and a previously unreleased 1983 collaboration with Steve Howe and Hazel O'Connor. In 2009 and 2010, the \\"classic\\" Ultravox line-up from the 1980s (Currie, Ure, Chris Cross, and Warren Cann) reformed for two successful tours – their first together in over twenty years. In 2016 Currie announced his retirement from Ultravox. In May 2016 he released his 10th solo album Doppel. Instruments Currie is noted for his use of analogue synthesisers, such as the Elka Rhapsody, and in particular his trademark soloing sound, which typically consisted of soaring fluid lines on an ARP Odyssey, making use of oscillator sync, later re-created with the Oxford Synthesiser Company \\"OSCar\\" synth. Currie's original instrument whilst at music college was the viola, and he frequently added solo violin or viola to the arrangements of songs he played on, a relatively unusual choice in pop music. At the height of Ultravox's career, Billy Currie's keyboard rig included a Yamaha CP70 electric piano and SS30 string machine, CS80 synthesiser, a PPG Wave 2.2 digital synth, a Sequential Circuits Prophet T8 synth as well as his trademark ARP Odyssey. Other synths used by Ultravox included the Moog MiniMoog, Yamaha GS1 (the pad sound on \\"Lament\\") and Emulator II sampler. Personal life Currie is married to Heidi and has an adult son named Tom and daughter. He lives in North London.

He served as a member from the Democratic Party from 1977 to 1983 and then later a member of the Republican Party until the end of his tenure as congressman. Early life and career Stump was born in Phoenix, and was a U.S. Navy World War II combat veteran, where he served on the USS Tulagi from 1943 to 1946. He graduated from Tolleson High School in 1947, and Arizona State University in 1951 where he was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He owned a cotton and grain farm in the Phoenix suburb of Tolleson for many years. He served four terms in the Arizona House of Representatives from 1959 to 1967, and five terms in the Arizona State Senate, from 1967 to 1976. He served as President of the Arizona State Senate from 1975 to 1976. Member of Congress He was first elected to the 95th Congress on November 2, 1976, originally as a Democrat from the 3rd Congressional District, a vast district stretching from western Phoenix through Prescott to Lake Havasu City and the Grand Canyon. He defeated state senate minority leader Fred Koory with 47 percent of the vote.https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30936 Stump wore his party ties very loosely. He considered himself a \\"Pinto Democrat,\\" the popular name for conservative Democrats from rural Arizona, and his voting record was strongly conservative. His profile was similar to those of conservative Democrats from the South. He voted for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981. Shortly after that vote, he announced he would become a Republican when Congress reconvened in January 1982. Regardless of his party affiliation, he never faced serious competition at the ballot box. After his initial run for Congress, he only dropped below 60 percent of the vote once, in 1990. He only faced an independent in 1978, and was completely unopposed in 1986.https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=635 He briefly considered running for the Senate in 1986 after Barry Goldwater decided to retire. Described as \\"quiet\\" and \\"assiduously private\\", Stump kept a fairly low profile for most of his tenure. He had only a skeleton staff; he was known to answer the phone himself at his Washington, D.C. office, and to open his own mail. Stump usually returned home to work his farm in Tolleson on weekends. In his 26 years in the House he became a noted member of the House Armed Services Committee, serving as chairman from 2001 to 2003. He'd chaired the House Veterans' Affairs Committee from 1995 to 2001, when he was forced to give that post up due to caucus-imposed term limits. He is one of the few members of the House to chair both committees.AZ HCR 2043 He consistently supported increased spending on the military and veterans. The 2003 military appropriations authorization act was named after him in recognition of his commitment to the military as the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003.Public Law 107–314—December 2, 2002 Stump sponsored bills to make English the official language for government business and to alter laws so that children born on US soil to non-citizen parents would not automatically be citizens. According to Amy Silverson, he was \\"best known in Congress as a perpetual naysayer, casting votes against almost all spending programs.\\" Between 1976 and 2002, he accumulated a lifetime score of 97 (out of 100) from the American Conservative Union.ACU House Ratings 2002. He received very low scores from the National Council of Senior Citizens, the American Civil Liberties Union, the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, and the League of Conservation Voters. Although his district included the entire northwestern portion of Arizona, the great majority of its residents lived in the West Valley. Stump was often accused of addressing himself mainly to the West Valley and ignoring the other portions of his sprawling district, even though the district's center of gravity had moved to the West Valley as early as the 1970s. Indeed, many of his constituents rarely saw him. He maintained his district office in downtown Phoenix, outside his own district, for many years. Bob Hope announcement After the Associated Press mistakenly placed Bob Hope's obituary on its web site in June 1998, Stump announced on the floor of the House that the entertainer had died.House Proceeding, June 5, 1998 (6:01:45 from start). From C-SPAN. This was quickly denied by his daughter and publicist; Hope outlived Stump by five weeks, dying in 2003 at the age of 100. Death and legacy Grave site of Robert Lee Stump and Nancy Stump (who is still alive, ) He decided not to run for re-election in 2002 due to declining health. He endorsed his longtime chief of staff, Lisa Jackson Atkins, as his successor in what was then numbered as the 2nd District. Atkins had been very visible in the district, to the point that many thought she actually represented it rather than Stump. However, Atkins was defeated in a seven way Republican primary by Trent Franks, who held the seat until December 2017. Stump died June 20, 2003 of myelodysplasia, a blood disorder and was buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery in Phoenix with full military honors. In 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Prescott, Arizona, was renamed the Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Stump is no relation to the member of the Arizona Corporation Commission of the same name. In 2006, SR 303L was renamed the Bob Stump Memorial Highway.http://www.azdot.gov/Highways/Valley_Freeways/Loop_303/North/PDF/SR303L_DESIGN_CONCEPT_REPORT_Appendices.pdf In 2018, Stump's widow issued a letter, criticizing an Arizona state government politician of the same name for allegedly capitalizing on her late husband's name. The letter was met with a sharp rebuke by the state government politician's mother.

This article presents a possible chronological listing of the composition of the plays of William Shakespeare. Shakespearean scholars, beginning with Edmond Malone in 1778, have attempted to reconstruct the relative chronology of Shakespeare's oeuvre by various means, using external evidence (such as references to the plays by Shakespeare's contemporaries in both critical material and private documents, allusions in other plays, entries in the Stationers' Register, and records of performance and publication), and internal evidence (allusions within the plays to contemporary events, composition and publication dates of sources used by Shakespeare, stylistic analysis looking at the development of his style and diction over time, and the plays' context in the contemporary theatrical and literary milieu). Most modern chronologies are based on the work of E.K. Chambers in \\"The Problem of Chronology\\" (1930), published in his book William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I.  Introduction  Since the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of Romeo and Juliet was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime. Thus, performance history reveals little about the date of composition. Similarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the First Folio (1623), prepared by John Heminges and Henry Condell, and published by Edward Blount, William Jaggard and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, Titus Andronicus was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, Othello was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, King Lear was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining so much more speculative. In addition, some scholars dissent from the conventional dating system altogether. A notable scholar to do so is E. A. J. Honigmann, who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career four or five years to the mid-1580s, with his \\"early start\\" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with Titus Andronicus in 1586 (the conventional school of thought is that Shakespeare began writing plays upon arriving in London c.1590). Most scholars, however, adhere to a more orthodox chronology, and some, such as Gary Taylor and Sidney Thomas, argue that the early start theory causes more problems than it solves.  Scholarship   E.K. Chambers  The chronology presented by E.K. Chambers in 1930 is as follows: * Henry VI, Part 2 (1590–1591) * Henry VI, Part 3 (1590–1591) * Henry VI, Part 1 (1591–1592) * Richard III (1592–1593) * The Comedy of Errors (1592–1593) * Titus Andronicus (1593–1594) * The Taming of the Shrew (1593–1594) * The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1594–1595) * Love's Labour's Lost (1594–1595) * Romeo and Juliet (1594–1595) * Richard II (1595–1596) * A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595–1596) * King John (1596–1597) * The Merchant of Venice (1596–1597) * Henry IV, Part 1 (1597–1598) * Henry IV, Part 2 (1597–1598) * Much Ado About Nothing (1598–1599) * Henry V (1598–1599) * Julius Caesar (1599–1600) * As You Like It (1599–1600) * Twelfth Night (1599–1600) * Hamlet (1600–1601) * The Merry Wives of Windsor (1600–1601) * Troilus and Cressida (1601–1602) * All's Well That Ends Well (1602–1603) * Measure for Measure (1604–1605) * Othello (1604–1605) * King Lear (1605–1606) * Macbeth (1605–1606) * Antony and Cleopatra (1606–1607) * Coriolanus (1607–1608) * Timon of Athens (1607–1608) * Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1608–1609) * Cymbeline (1609–1610) * The Winter's Tale (1610–1611) * The Tempest (1611–1612) * Henry VIII (1612–1613) * The Two Noble Kinsmen (1612–1613)  Modern Complete Works  There are six major modern scholarly editions of the Complete Works of Shakespeare: * The Riverside Shakespeare (edited by G. Blakemore Evans in 1974, with a second edition in 1996) * The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works (edited by Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery in 1986, with a second edition in 2005) * The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition (edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard and Katharine Eisaman Maus in 1997, with a second edition in 2008 and a third in 2015) * The Arden Shakespeare: Complete Works (edited by Richard Proudfoot, Ann Thompson and David Scott Kastan in 1998, with a second edition in 2002 and a third in 2011) * The Complete Pelican Shakespeare (edited by Stephen Orgel and A. R. Braunmuller in 2002), and * The RSC Shakespeare: Complete Works (edited by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen in 2007). Additionally, as with Oxford, Arden, Pelican and the RSC, the New Cambridge Shakespeare, the New Penguin Shakespeare, the Signet Classic Shakespeare, the Dover Wilson Shakespeare, the Shakespeare Folios and the Folger Shakespeare Library all publish scholarly editions of individual plays, although none have issued a complete works volume. Arden presents the plays alphabetically without any attempt to construct an overall chronology. Oxford, Riverside, Norton and RSC all present chronologies which differ from one another and which attempt to construct only approximate dating. The following list is based on that of The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works (2nd ed.) and the accompanying William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (Revised ed.), edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. However, none of the major chronologies has any real authority over any of the others.  Chronology   The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1589–1591)  Extract from Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598), which makes reference to twelve of Shakespeare's plays. :First official record: in Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598), referred to as \\"Gentlemen of Verona.\\" :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: an adaptation by Benjamin Victor was performed at Drury Lane in 1762. The earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Covent Garden on 15 April 1784, although because of the reference to the play in Palladis Tamia, we know it was definitely performed in Shakespeare's lifetime. :Evidence: Stanley Wells argues that the play's \\"dramatic structure is comparatively unambitious, and while some of its scenes are expertly constructed, those involving more than, at the most, four characters betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\\" The play is therefore considered one of the first Shakespeare composed after his arrival in London c.1590, at which point he would have lacked theatrical experience. Furthermore, the discussion between Launce and Speed regarding the vices and virtues of Launce's mistress (3.1.276-359For each play, line references, and occasionally even scene numbers and divisions, can differ substantially from edition to edition. In order to maintain a degree of continuity, all line references throughout this article are to the individual Oxford Shakespeare editions, unless otherwise noted.) seems to borrow from John Lyly's Midas, which was written in late 1588 and/or early 1589, thus fixing a terminus post quem for the play. This situates the date of composition as somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known Shakespeare was working on the Henry VI plays. In his 2008 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests Shakespeare may have written the play prior to his arrival in London, possibly as early as 1587, although he acknowledges this theory is purely speculative.  The Taming of the Shrew (1590–1591)  1596 second quarto of A Shrew :First official record: possible version of the play entered into Stationers' Register by Peter Short on 2 May 1594 as \\"a booke intituled A plesant Conceyted historie called the Tayminge of a Shrowe.\\" First record of the play as it exists today is found in the First Folio (1623). :First published: possible version of the play published in quarto in 1594 as A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called The taming of a Shrew (printed by Peter Short for Cuthbert Burby). This text was republished in 1596 (again by Short for Burby) and 1607 (by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling). The play as it exists today was first published in the First Folio as The Taming of the Shrew. :Additional information (publication): there is a general lack of scholarly agreement regarding the exact relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Originally, A Shrew was seen as a non-Shakespearean source for The Shrew, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. This remained the predominant theory until 1850, when Samuel Hickson suggested that A Shrew was in some way derived from The Shrew. Peter Alexander developed Hickson's work into his reported text/bad quarto theory, which necessitates that The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594. However, there are other theories about the relationship between the texts. In 1942, R.A. Houk posited the \\"Ur-Shrew\\" theory, suggesting that the plays are two completely unrelated texts by different authors based on the same (now lost) source. In 1943, G.I. Duthie refined this theory, suggesting that A Shrew was a reported text of an early draft of The Shrew. In his 1998 edition of A Shrew for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Stephen Roy Miller suggested A Shrew was an adaptation of The Shrew written by someone other than Shakespeare. Critics remain divided on this issue. :First recorded performance: according to Philip Henslowe's diary, a play called The Tamynge of A Shrowe was performed at Newington Butts on 11 June 1594. This could have been either the 1594 A Shrew or the Shakespearean The Shrew, but as the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's own company, were sharing the theatre at the time, and, thus, Shakespeare himself was probably there, scholars tend to assume that it was The Shrew The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before Charles I and Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as \\"likt.\\" :Evidence: a terminus ante quem for A Shrew would seem to be August 1592; a stage direction at 3.21 mentions \\"Simon,\\" which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell, who was buried on 21 August 1592. The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593, as Anthony Chute's Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore's wife (published in June 1593) contains the line \\"He calls his Kate, and she must come and kiss him.\\" This must refer to The Shrew, as there is no corresponding \\"kissing scene\\" in A Shrew. There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave (first performed in June 1592). Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew, but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew. This suggests The Shrew was on stage prior to June 1592. However, Kier Elam further narrows the terminal date of The Shrew to 1591, based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year; Abraham Ortelius' map of Italy in the fourth edition of Theatrum Orbis Terrarum and John Florio's Second Fruits. As neither Shrew play is likely to have been written any earlier than 1590, this places the likely date of composition of The Shrew as 1590–1591, with A Shrew written sometime prior to August 1592.  Henry VI, Part 2 (1591)  1594 quarto of The First part of the Contention :First official record: version of the play entered into the Stationers' Register by Thomas Millington on 12 March 1594 as \\"a booke intituled, the firste parte of the Contention of the twoo famous houses of York and Lancaster with the deathe of the good Duke Humfrey and the banishement and Deathe of the Duke of Suffolk and the tragicall ende of the prowd Cardinall of Winchester, with the notable rebellion of Jack Cade and the Duke of Yorkes ffirste clayme unto the Crowne.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1594 as The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster, with the death of the good Duke Humphrey: And the banishment and death of the Duke of Suffolke, and the Tragicall end of the proud Cardinal of Winchester, with the notable Rebellion of Jack Cade: and the Duke of Yorke's first claim unto the Crowne (printed by Thomas Creede for Thomas Millington). This text was republished in 1600 (by Valentine Simmes for Millington) and in 1619. The 1619 text was printed with the 1595 octavo of Henry VI, Part 3 under the title The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke. With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt, as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 Folio text of 2 Henry VI appears under the title The second Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Good Duke Humfrey. :Additional information (publication): scholars are undecided as to the exact nature of the relationship between the 1594 The Contention and the 1623 2 Henry VI. There are four main theories: The Contention is a bad quarto, a reported text constructed from memory based upon a performance of 2 Henry VI; The Contention is an early draft of 2 Henry VI; The Contention is both a bad quarto and an early draft (i.e. a reported text based upon a staging of an early draft of the play); The Contention is an anonymous source for 2 Henry VI. Originally, the bad quarto theory was generally accepted by scholars. First suggested by Samuel Johnson in the original edition of The Plays of William Shakespeare (1765), it remained the predominant theory until challenged by Edmond Malone in The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare (1790), favouring the early draft theory. In 1929, Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory. Scholars have continued to debate the issue since then, with no real consensus reached. The source theory, originated by Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849 has fallen out of favour in the twentieth and twentieth-first centuries. :First recorded performance: although it is known that the play was definitely performed in Shakespeare's day, adaptations dominated the stage throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The earliest known such adaptation was in 1681, with John Crowne's two-part play, Henry the Sixth, The First Part and The Misery of Civil War. Two more adaptations followed in 1723. The first was Humfrey Duke of Gloucester by Ambrose Philips, the second was Theophilus Cibber's King Henry VI: A Tragedy, both of which adapted scenes from 2 Henry VI. Another adaptation followed in 1817, J.H. Merivale's Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster, which used material from all three Henry VI plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean 2 Henry VI was on 23 April 1864 at the Surrey Theatre, directed by James Anderson. :Evidence: it is known that True Tragedy (i.e. 3 Henry VI) was on stage by June 1592. It is also known that True Tragedy was definitely a sequel to The Contention, meaning The Contention must also have been on stage by early 1592 at the latest. It is also thought that Henry VI, Part 1 was a new play in March 1592. If The Contention predates 1 Henry VI, the theatrical evidence would place the likely date of 2 Henry VI as 1591.  Henry VI, Part 3 (1591)  Robert Green's Groatsworth of Wit, which helps fix a date for 3 Henry VI. :First official record: version of the play published in octavo in 1595. 3 Henry VI was never entered into the Stationers' Register. :First published: version of the play published in octavo in 1595 as The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke (printed by Peter Short for Thomas Millington). This text was republished in quarto in 1600 (by William White for Millington) and in 1619. The 1619 text was printed with the 1594 quarto of 2 Henry VI under the title The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke. With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt, as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 Folio text of 3 Henry VI appears under the title The third Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Duke of Yorke. :Additional information (publication): scholars are undecided as to the exact nature of the relationship between the 1595 True Tragedy and the 1623 3 Henry VI. There are four main theories: True Tragedy is a \\"bad octavo\\", a reported text constructed from memory based upon a performance of 3 Henry VI; True Tragedy is an early draft of 3 Henry VI; True Tragedy is both a bad quarto and an early draft (i.e. a reported text based upon a staging of an early draft of the play); True Tragedy is an anonymous source for 3 Henry VI. Originally, the bad quarto theory was generally accepted by scholars. First suggested by Samuel Johnson in the original edition of The Plays of William Shakespeare (1765), it remained the predominant theory until challenged by Edmond Malone in The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare (1790), favouring the early draft theory. In 1929, Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory. Scholars have continued to debate the issue since then, with no real consensus reached. The source theory, originated by Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849 has fallen out of favour in the twentieth and twentieth-first centuries. :First recorded performance: although it is known that the play was definitely performed in Shakespeare's day, adaptations dominated the stage throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The earliest known such adaptation was in 1681, with John Crowne's two-part play, Henry the Sixth, The First Part and The Misery of Civil War. In 1699, 3 Henry VI was also partly incorporated into Colley Cibber's The Tragical History of King Richard the Third. In 1723, Theophilus Cibber's King Henry VI: A Tragedy also adapted scenes from 3 Henry VI. Another adaptation followed in 1817, J.H. Merivale's Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster, which used material from all three Henry VI plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean 3 Henry VI was on 4 May 1906 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, directed by F.R. Benson. :Evidence: in Groatsworth of Wit, Robert Greene writes about \\"an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his 'tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide', supposes that he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you, and being an absolute Johannes fac totum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.\\" Obviously directed at Shakespeare, this is a reference to a line in 3 Henry VI, when York refers to Margaret as a \\"tiger's heart wrapped in woman's hide\\" (1.4.137). As Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register on 20 September 1592, this means that True Tragedy must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592, as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written sometime in 1591.  Henry VI, Part 1 (1591–1592)  :First official record: possibly in Philip Henslowe's diary. On 3 March 1592, Henslowe reports seeing a \\"ne\\" play called \\"Harey the vj\\" (i.e. Henry VI), which could be a reference to 1 Henry VI, although this is not universally accepted. An entry found in the Stationers' Register on 19 April 1602 transferring the rights from Thomas Millington to Thomas Pavier of \\"The first and Second parte of Henry VJ\\" is thought to refer to what we today call 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI, not 1 Henry VI. The first definite record of the play was not until the First Folio in 1623. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The first Part of Henry the Sixt. :First recorded performance: possibly on 3 March 1592 at The Rose, as seen by Philip Henslowe. The earliest definite performance was on 13 March 1738 at Covent Garden. :Additional information (attribution): many critics consider 1 Henry VI to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, The Contention and True Tragedy. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists. :Evidence: on 3 March 1592, Philip Henslowe saw a new play called \\"Harey the vj\\" at The Rose, but he gives no further information. In August, Thomas Nashe published Pierce Penniless, His Supplication to the Divell, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in 1 Henry VI. Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as supportive of the fact that the play Henslowe saw was 1 Henry VI. If, then, it was a new play in March 1592, and if we also assume that it was a prequel written after the other two plays in the trilogy, the play was most likely written in 1591 or very early 1592.  Titus Andronicus (1591–1592)  1594 quarto of Titus Andronicus :First official record: Philip Henslowe's diary, 24 January 1594, where he records seeing the play \\"titus & ondronicus\\" at The Rose. :First published: published in quarto in February 1594 as The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedie of Titus Andronicus, the first known printing of a Shakespearean play (printed by John Danter for Edward White and Thomas Millington). The play was republished in 1600 (printed by James Roberts for White) and 1611 (printed by Edward Allde for White). The Folio text appears under the title The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus. :First recorded performance: on 24 January 1594 performed by Sussex's Men at The Rose, as recorded in Henslowe's diary. :Additional information (attribution): Titus is most likely a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist, probably George Peele. :Evidence: E.A.J. Honigmann dates the play 1586, arguing it to be Shakespeare's first piece, written several years prior to his arrival in London. In his 1994 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Alan Hughes makes a similar argument, suggesting a date of 1588. Most scholars, however, tend to favour a post-1590 date, although there is by no means a consensus amongst them as to what that date may be. In his introduction to the 2001 edition of the play for the New Penguin Shakespeare (edited by Sonia Massai), Jacques Berthoud argues for a date of 1591; in his 1984 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, Eugene M. Waith argues for a date of 1592; in his 1995 edition for the Arden Shakespeare, Jonathan Bate argues for a date of 1593. What is known is that the play is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. Additionally, stylistic analysis has shown that Titus belongs to Shakespeare's pre-plague group of plays. If it is assumed that the Henry VI trilogy was complete by March 1592 at the latest, it would suggest Titus was composed either immediately afterwards, or perhaps simultaneously as he was completing them, suggesting a date of late 1591/early 1592.  Richard III (1592–1593)  1597 quarto of Richard III :First official record: version of the play entered into the Stationers' Register by Andrew Wise on 20 October 1597 as \\"The tragedie of kinge Richard the Third w the death of the duke of Clarence.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in December 1597 as The tragedy of King Richard the third. Containing, his treacherous plots against his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall usurpation: with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserved death (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise). This text was republished in 1598 (by Thomas Creede for Wise), 1603 (again by Creede for Wise), 1605 (by Creede for Matthew Lawe), 1612 (again by Creede for Lawe) and 1622 (by Thomas Purfoot for Lawe). The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field. :Additional information (publication): because the 1597 quarto is of such good quality, without the obvious errors common to the 'original' bad quartos, as designated by Alfred W. Pollard (the 1597 Romeo and Juliet, the 1602 The Merry Wives of Windsor, the 1600 Henry V and the 1603 Hamlet), scholars are undecided as to the exact relationship between the quarto and the 1623 folio texts. If Q1 is a bad quarto, it is an uncommonly \\"good\\" bad quarto. It is thought that F1 was set from Q3 (the 1605 text), Q6 (the 1622 text) and the author's foul papers, and, as a result, Q1 and F1 differ from one another substantially. Most significantly, F1 contains roughly 230 lines not in Q1, Q1 contains roughly 40 lines not in F1, there are over 2000 textual differences, some scenes are arranged differently (including the order of the entry of the ghosts in 5.4), and Q1 has fewer characters than F1. There are two main theories: the quarto is a reported text, reconstructed from memory based on a performance of the play; the quarto is a performance text, a refined version of the longer folio text written by Shakespeare himself after the play had been staged. No real consensus has been reached on this issue. :First recorded performance: the play was performed extensively in Shakespeare's lifetime, and evidence would seem to suggest it was one of his most popular plays; it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia in 1598 (as \\"Richard the 3.\\"), and by the time of the First Folio in 1623, had been published in quarto six times, and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard, probably at the Globe, where his performance so impressed a female member of the audience that she asked him to visit her later that night in the guise of Richard. The earliest definite performance was at St James's Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King's Men. :Evidence: it is known that Richard III was definitely a sequel to True Tragedy, which was on stage by 23 June 1592, hence Richard III must have been written roughly around the same period. A common argument regarding Shakespeare's chronology at this point in his career is that Richard III is a significantly better play than any of the Henry VI plays, with a much tighter structure, a more mature manner and a greater degree of stylistic control. This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of Senecan tragedy when composing Titus, which he was then able to incorporate into Richard. Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for Lord Strange's Men, but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to Pembroke's Men, a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, a direct descent of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir Thomas More's History of King Richard III) regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, when it was in fact his brother William who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined Richmond's cause is read aloud, two of whom are \\"Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier\\" (4.5.9) and \\"redoubted Pembroke\\" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by \\"three lords\\" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.  Edward III (1592–1593)  1596 quarto of Edward III :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as \\"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w kinge Iohn of Fraunce.\\" :First published: published in quarto in 1596 as The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third (printed anonymously for Burby). This text was republished in 1599 (printed by Simon Stafford for Burby). :First recorded performance: although it is known from the 1596 quarto title page that the play had been performed in London during the 1590s, the earliest recorded performance was not until 6 March 1911 at the Little Theatre, directed by Gertrude Kingston and William Poel. However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the Edward's infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, The King and the Countess, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, Jacob and Esau. The first known performance of the complete text took place in June 1986 at the Globe Playhouse in Los Angeles, directed by Dick Dotterer, as part of the Shakespeare Society of America's presentation of the entire 'canon' of Shakespeare Apocrypha. The first known production of the play in the United Kingdom was in July 1987, at the Theatr Clwyd, directed by Toby Robertson. :Additional information (attribution): first attributed to Shakespeare by the booksellers Richard Rogers and William Ley in 1656, Shakespeare's possible authorship of the play was first investigated by Edward Capell in 1760. Although the question of authorship remains unresolved, many scholars do now agree that Shakespeare was involved in some way with writing the play, and that it deserves a place in the Shakespearean canon. Specifically, the argument has been made that if 1 Henry VI can be attributed to Shakespeare so too can Edward III, as some scholars argue that Shakespeare only wrote about 20% of 1 Henry VI, whereas estimates for Edward III tend to range from 40% to all of it. The play was included in the 2nd edition of the Riverside Shakespeare in 1996. In 1998, Giorgio Melchiori edited the first stand-alone scholarly edition of the play, for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. The play was also included in the 2nd edition of The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works in 2005, edited by William Montgomery, and in the 2nd edition of the Norton Shakespeare in 2008. The Arden Shakespeare published an edition of the play in 2017, edited by Richard Proudfoot and Nicola Bennett. :Evidence: Edward III has been assigned many different possible dates of composition by a number of scholars. For example, Karl P. Wentersdorf favours a date of 1589–1590. MacDonald P. Jackson argues for 1590–1591. Roger Prior argues for a date of 1594. Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. A terminus post quem of 1590 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of several post-1590 accounts of the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. According to the title page of the 1596 quarto, the play had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. However, both MacDonald P. Jackson and Richard Proudfoot have argued that Edward III must have been part of the repertory of Pembroke's Men. This would explain the absence of an acting company on the title page; the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594 (Pembroke's Men disbanded in September 1593). Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; Taming of the Shrew, The Contention, True Tragedy, Titus and Richard III. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. Edward III, however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to True Tragedy or Richard III, and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.  The Comedy of Errors (1594)  :First official record: Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598), referred to as \\"Errors.\\" :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594, at Gray's Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court). The only known evidence for this performance is the Gesta Grayorum, a 1688 text printed for William Canning based on a manuscript apparently handed down from the 1590s, detailing the \\"Prince of Purpoole\\" festival from December 1594 to February 1595. According to the text, after a disastrous attempt to stage \\"some notable performance […] it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menaechmus) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to a performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men. The earliest known definite performance was at court on 28 December 1604. :Evidence: traditionally, Errors has been dated quite early, and has often been seen as Shakespeare's first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism-in-verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests the play may have been written specifically for the Gray's Inn performance. This would place its composition in the latter half of 1594.  Love's Labour's Lost (1594–1595)  1598 quarto of Love's Labour's Lost :First official record: the play was published in quarto in 1598, although the exact date is unknown, as it was not entered into the Stationers' Register at the time. Also in 1598, Robert Tofte mentioned the play in his sonnet sequence Alba. The months minde of a melancholy lover; \\"Love's Labour Lost, I once did see, a play/Y'cleped so, so called to my pain.\\" The date of publication of Alba is unknown as it also was not entered into the Register. Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play. :First published: published in quarto in 1598 as A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loues labors lost, the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page (printed by William Wright for Cuthbert Burby). However, due to the note \\"Newly corrected and augmented,\\" it is known that a previous publication must have existed, which has apparently been lost. :First recorded performance: according to the quarto title page, the play was performed at court for Queen Elizabeth sometime over Christmas 1597, however, no further information is provided. The earliest definite performance took place sometime between 8 and 15 January 1605, for Anne of Denmark, at either Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton or Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury's house. :Evidence: obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. For example, Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \\"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeares Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think that it is his first.\\"Quoted in For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated to 1590, until Edmond Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be slightly more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594–1595, and the play is often grouped with the 'lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to the period 1594–1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Gary Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in 5.2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satirical presentation of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt by Jean Châtel. All of this suggests a date of late 1594 to early 1595.  Love's Labour's Won (1595–1596)  Christopher Hunt's list of plays; the bottom entry reads \\"Loves labor won.\\" :First official record: Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598), referred to as \\"Love labours wonne.\\" :First published: prior to 1603; format and exact date unknown. :First recorded performance: there are no recorded performances of the play, but the fact that it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia strongly suggests it was performed. :Additional information (existence): there are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is a fragment of Christopher Hunt's inventory, listing sixteen \\"ludes and tragedyes\\" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; The Merchant of Venice, The Taming of a Shrew, Love's Labour's Lost, and Love's Labour's Won. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, Troilus and Cressida and All's Well That Ends Well have also been cited as possibilities, with All's Well the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost. :Evidence: the play's position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost.  Richard II (1595)  Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1596). In 1601, Devereux staged the earliest definite production of Richard II. :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Andrew Wise on 29 August 1597 as \\"the Tragedye of Richard the Second.\\" :First published: published in quarto in 1597 as The Tragedie of King Richard the second (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise). This text was republished twice in 1598 (on both occasions by Simmes for Wise), 1608 (by William Wright for Matthew Lawe) and 1615 (again by Wright for Lawe). The Folio text appears under the title The life and death of King Richard the Second. :First recorded performance: possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir Edward Hoby's house. On that date, Hoby's wife, Margaret Carey, daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men), wrote a letter to Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see \\"K. Richard present him self to your vewe.\\" This could be a reference to a private performance of Richard II, especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare's company. However, some scholars argue that \\"K. Richard\\" could be a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that even if it is a play, it necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe on 7 February 1601, organised by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. This performance was probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. :Evidence: Richard II is usually seen as one of the 'lyrical plays', along with Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594–1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595.  Romeo and Juliet (1595)  1599 second quarto of Romeo and Juliet :First official record: version of the play published in quarto in 1597. The play was not entered into the Stationers' Register at the time, not appearing until 22 July 1607. :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as An excellent conceited tragedie of Romeo and Iuliet (printed by John Danter for Cuthbert Burby). A revised version, \\"newly corrected, augmented and amended,\\" was published in 1599 as The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Iuliet (printed by Thomas Creede for Burby). This text was republished in 1609 (by John Windet for John Smethwick) and 1622 (by William Stansby for Smethwick). The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet. :Additional information (publication): the 1597 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. However, in his 2007 edition of the quarto text for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Lukas Erne argues that although the text does exhibit many signs of memorial reconstruction, there is also evidence of authorial revision, and he believes the Q1 text is a closer representation of the play as it would have been performed at the time than either the longer Q2 or the 1623 Folio text (which was set from Q2). :First recorded performance: 1 March 1662 at Lincoln's Inn Fields, performed by the Duke's Company. Samuel Pepys wrote of the production (the first since the reopening of the theatres), \\"it is the play of itself the worst that ever I heard in my life, and the worst acted that ever I saw these people do.\\" :Evidence: as there is virtually no external evidence (other than the quarto text which establishes 1597 as a terminus ante quem) with which to date the play, most arguments tend to centre on references within the play to topical events, publication dates of Shakespeare's influences, and stylistic evidence. A much discussed possible topical allusion is the Nurse's reference to an earthquake which took place eleven years previously (1.3.24-36). The specificity of this reference has led many scholars to argue that Shakespeare must have been referring to a real earthquake. Originally, Thomas Tyrwhitt suggested the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake, which would place the composition of the play in 1591. Sidney Thomas, on the other hand, argues it may refer to a quake on 1 March 1584, mentioned in William Covell's Polimanteia, which was published in 1595 and with which Shakespeare was apparently familiar. This would suggest a date of composition of 1595. Influences on the play include Samuel Daniel's Complaint of Rosamund (1592) and John Eliot's Ortho-epia Gallica (1593), suggesting the play could not have been composed earlier than 1593. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it closest to Richard II, Ants Oras' pause test places it immediately after Love's Labour's Lost and immediately prior to A Midsummer Night's Dream, and a rare word test links it most closely to Love's Labour's Lost. Stylistically, the play is also firmly situated within the 'lyrical plays', which are all dated 1594–1595. This would correspond to the 1584 earthquake (assuming Shakespeare had in mind a particular quake at all), and suggest a main composition date of 1595. However, in her 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Jill L. Levenson argues that the play was most likely composed over several years, possibly covering a span as wide as 1593–1599.  A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595)  1619 \\"False Folio\\" title page of A Midsummer Night's Dream :First official record: Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \\"Midsummers night dreame.\\" :First published: published in November or December 1600 as A Midsommer nights dreame (printed by Richard Bradock for Thomas Fisher). This text was republished in 1619, with a title page date of 1600 and the name of the printer James Roberts. However, this reprint was part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). The play had never been printed by Roberts. :First recorded performance: possibly on 1 January 1604 at court, when Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester reported to John Chamberlain the acting of a masque \\"of Robin goode-fellow.\\" The first definite performance took place on 29 September 1662 at Drury Lane, as reported by Samuel Pepys, who described it as \\"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life.\\" :Evidence: stylistically, Midsummer Night is very much part of the 'lyrical plays', which would suggest a date of composition in 1594 or 1595. A strong argument that it was written immediately after Romeo and Juliet is the nature of Pyramus and Thisbe, which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F. Brooks argues that Shakespeare used the source story from Ovid's Metamorphoses first to examine the tragic potential and then to exploit its comic and farcical elements in his next play. A possible topical allusion is the line \\"the death/Of learning, late decreased in beggary\\" (5.1.52-53), which could refer to the spate of deaths of popular playwrights in the early 1590s; Robert Greene in 1592, Christopher Marlowe in 1593 and Thomas Kyd in 1594. That the play culminates with the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta has led some to theorise it may have been written specifically for a wedding, with the most likely candidates being either the marriage of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby and Elizabeth de Vere on 26 January 1595, or that of Sir Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey on 19 February 1596. That the second is the more likely of the two is due to the fact that Elizabeth's grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and her father was George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. If the play was written for a wedding in February 1596, it was most likely composed in 1595. However, there is no solid evidence to suggest that the play was in fact written for a wedding, and most scholars are in agreement that stylistic evidence alone is sufficient to date the play to c.1595.  King John (1596)  The First and Second Part of the troublesome Raigne of King John of England, falsely attributed to \\"W.Sh.\\" :First official record: Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598), referred to as \\"King Iohn.\\" :First published: First Folio (1623), as The life and death of King Iohn. :First recorded performance: although numerous references to the play throughout the seventeenth century indicate that it was performed with some frequency and success, there is no definite record of any specific performance. The first documented performance was on 26 February 1737, produced by John Rich at Drury Lane. :Evidence: King John can be a difficult play to date due to the lack of any real external evidence or internal topical allusions. Scholars have instead been forced to rely on stylistic evidence, and speculation regarding the play's relationship with the anonymous two-part play The Troublesome Reign of King John (c.1589), which was published in 1611 and 1622 under Shakespeare's name. King John was obviously in existence by 1598, as it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia, and most scholars agree that Shakespeare used Troublesome Reign as a source, meaning it must have been written after 1589. In his 1954 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, however, E.A.J. Honigmann argues that Troublesome Reign is actually an adaptation of Shakespeare's King John based on the recollections of a performance, and hence King John was written prior to 1589. Although most scholars disagree with Honigmann on this point, the exact nature of the relationship between the two plays remains open to question. Stylistic evidence serves to locate the play in the mid-1590s. Both a rare word test and Ants Oras' pause test place it after Richard II. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it prior to the two Henry IV plays. All three of these plays were definitely written during the 1590s, suggesting King John must also have been written in that decade. Furthermore, Barron Brainerd's statistical analysis of Shakespeare's plays places King John just past the mid-way point of the decade, after Richard II and prior to Henry IV, Part 1.  The Merchant of Venice (1596–1597)  :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by James Roberts on 22 July 1598 as \\"a booke of the Marchaunt of Venyce or otherwise called the Iewe of Venyce.\\" :First published: published in quarto in 1600 as The Excellent History of the Merchant of Venice. With the extreame crueltie of Shylocke the Jewe towards the sayd merchant, in cutting a just pound of his flesh: and the obtayning of Portia by the choyse of three chests (printed by James Roberts for Thomas Heyes). This text was republished in 1619, with a title page date of 1600 and the name of the printer James Roberts. This reprint was part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). :First recorded performance: although the title page of the 1600 quarto indicates the play was performed in the latter years of the sixteenth century, the earliest recorded performance was by the King's Men at Whitehall Palace for King James on 10 February 1605. James liked the play so much that he asked for it to be performed again two days later, on Shrove Tuesday. :Evidence: the play was obviously in existence by 1598. However, other evidence places its date of composition as probably 1596 or very early 1597. An important topical allusion is Salarino's reference to \\"my wealthy Andrew docked in sand\\" (1.1.28). This is thought to refer to the San Andrés, a Spanish galleon that ran aground in Cádiz in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the St. Andrew and incorporated into the Royal Navy. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the Thames Estuary. In August, she served as a troopship during the Islands Voyage, and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the Goodwin Sands, a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5). All of this suggests the play was written in the latter half of 1596 or very early 1597, when audiences would have been most perceptive to the Andrew reference. It has also been theorised that the play may have been written to capitalise on the enormous success of Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta. Although Malta had been written in 1589 or 1590, it remained extremely popular throughout the 90's, and was revived on stage in 1596 when it was performed eight times by the Lord Admiral's Men.  Henry IV, Part 1 (1596–1597)  1598 quarto of Henry IV, Part 1 :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Andrew Wise on 25 February 1598 as \\"a booke intituled The historye of Henry the IIIJ with his battaile of Shrewsburye against Henry Hottspurre of the Northe with The conceited mirthe of Sir John Ffalstoff.\\" :First published: two quarto texts were published in 1598. Only a fragment of one (designated Q0) has survived, running from 1.3.201-2.2.105. The other copy (Q1) was published under the title The History of Henrie the Fourth, with the battell at Shrewsburie between the King and Lord Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur of the North, with the humorous conceits of Sir John Falstaffe (printed by Peter Short for Andrew Wise). This text was republished in 1599 (by Simon Stafford for Wise), 1604 (by Valentine Simmes for Matthew Lawe), 1608 (by John Windet for Lawe), 1613 (by William White for Lawe) and 1622 (by Thomas Purfoot for Lawe). The Folio text appears under the title The First Part of Henry the Fourth, with the Life and Death of Henry Sirnamed Hot-spurre. :First recorded performance: possibly on 6 March 1600 at the house of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon for the Flemish ambassador. In a letter dated 8 March from Rowland Whyte to Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, Whyte mentions that Hunsdon employed the Lord Chamberlain's Men to perform a play called \\"Sir John Old Castlle.\\" Originally, Falstaff was called Sir John Oldcastle, but Shakespeare was pressured into changing the name. Although \\"Sir John Old Castlle\\" could be a reference to Sir John Oldcastle by Anthony Munday, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye and Robert Wilson, the fact that Hunsdon was using Shakespeare's own company, rather than the rival Lord Admiral's Men, suggests the play referred to was in fact 1 Henry IV. Another possible performance took place on or around 14 February 1613, when either 1 Henry IV or Henry IV, Part 2 (or both) were performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. A play performed under the title The Hotspur is thought to refer to 1 Henry IV. The first definite performance was on 1 January 1625 at Whitehall as The First Part of Sir John Falstaff. :Evidence: as with Richard II, the play uses Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars as a source, meaning it could not have been written earlier than 1595. The fact that it is a direct sequel to Richard II would further limit the date of composition to no later than 1597 as Shakespeare would not have wanted to wait too long to capitalise on the success of the previous play. The controversy regarding the Oldcastle character also helps date the play. Shakespeare was pressured into changing the name by the descendants of the historical Sir John Oldcastle, particularly William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham and his son Henry. William served as Lord Chamberlain from August 1596 to March 1597, and only in that period would he have had the authority to demand the alteration of a play which he found objectionable. This could indicate an initial performance in late 1596 or early 1597, suggesting composition took place roughly around the same time.  The Merry Wives of Windsor (1597)  1602 quarto of The Merry Wives of Windsor :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by John Busby on 18 January 1602 as \\"A booke called An excellent and pleasant conceited commedie of Sir John Faulstof and the merry wyves of Windesor.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1602 as A most pleasaunt and excellent conceited Comedie, of Syr John Falstaffe, and the merrie Wives of Windsor. Entermixed with sundrie variable and pleasing humours, of Syr Hugh the Welch knight, Justice Shallow, and his wise cousin M. Slender. With the swaggering vaine of Auncient Pistoll, and Corporall Nym (printed by Thomas Creede for Arthur Johnson). This text was republished in 1619 as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). :Additional information (publication): the 1602 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. The quarto text is 1620 lines, compared to the 2729 line Folio text. 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and much of 5.5 are absent from Q1, 3.4 and 3.5 are transposed and numerous speeches within individual scenes are also transposed. In his 1910 edition of the quarto text, W.W. Greg wrote \\"my own study of Merry Wives has led me to doubt whether any limit can be set to the possible perversion which a text may suffer at the hands of a reporter.\\" However, more recent editions of the play, such as David Crane's 1997 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare and Giorgio Melchiori's 2000 edition for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, have questioned the likelihood of memorial reconstruction being wholly responsible for the text, arguing for a more complex provenance. :First recorded performance: on 4 November 1604, in the banqueting hall of Whitehall Palace, performed by the King's Men for Charles I. :Evidence: writing in 1702, John Dennis claimed Shakespeare wrote the play in fourteen days at the behest of Queen Elizabeth. In 1709, Nicholas Rowe claimed Elizabeth commissioned Shakespeare to write the play, because she liked the character of Falstaff so much in 1 Henry IV that she wanted to see him in love. Neither claim is given much weight by scholars today. The composition of the play definitely postdates the Oldcastle controversy concerning 1 Henry IV, as the character is, and seemingly, always was, called Falstaff in Merry Wives. One area examined by scholars in an effort to date the composition of the play is where in the plot of the Henriad the narrative of Merry Wives is supposed to take place. 1 Henry IV was definitely written by early 1597. Henry V was completed by September 1599. 2 Henry IV was written at some point between these two. Exactly where Merry Wives fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall Henriad have proved fruitless. The plot of Merry Wives does not fit into the plot of the Henriad in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and Mistress Quickly don't know one another at the start of Merry Wives, whereas in 1 Henry IV, they have known one another for over thirty years. John Jowett, editor of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works, argues it is not supposed to fit into the Henriad at all, it is \\"essentially an Elizabethan comedy, the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England. The play is full of details that would have been familiar to Elizabethan Londoners, and the language is colloquial and up to date.\\" Textual evidence and topical allusions led John Leslie Hotson to argue the play was specifically commissioned for a performance on Saint George's Day (23 April) 1597, as part of the celebrations for the Garter Feast (an annual meeting of the Order of the Garter). Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights. Hotson contends the play was his contribution to the festivities. If one accepts this theory, it suggests that Shakespeare interrupted his composition of 2 Henry IV to hastily compose Merry Wives after Hunsdon's commission. This is important because traditionally, Merry Wives has been dated c.1600, a date supported by verse analysis. However, verse makes up very little of the play, and if Shakespeare was writing extremely fast, the reliability of the test would be compromised. Scholars who accept the theory that Shakespeare stopped writing 2 Henry IV to write Merry Wives theorise that he did so somewhere between 3.2 and 4.2.  Henry IV, Part 2 (1597–1598)  1600 quarto of Ben Jonson's Every Man out of His Humour, which contains an allusion to 2 Henry IV. :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August 1600 as \\"the seconde parte of the history of Kinge Henry the iiij with the humours of Sir Iohn Ffallstaff.\\" Jointly entered with Much Ado About Nothing. :First published: published in quarto in 1600 as The second part of Henrie the fourth, continuing to his death, and coronation of Henrie the fift. With the humours of Sir John Falstaffe, and swaggering Pistoll (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley) The 1623 Folio text appears under the title The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, Containing his Death: and the Coronation of King Henry the Fift. :First recorded performance: probable performance took place on or around 14 February 1613, when either 1 Henry IV or 2 Henry IV (or both) were performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. A play performed under the title Sir Iohn Falstaffe is thought to refer to 2 Henry IV. It is unlikely to refer to 1 Henry IV as a play under the name The Hotspur would seem to indicate that play. Additionally, a list of plays under consideration for court performance in 1620, compiled by George Buck, Master of the Revels, mentions the \\"Second part of Falstaffe not plaid theis 7\\\\. yeres.\\" This would seem to confirm the 1613 performance as 2 Henry IV, as, due to the lack of republication of the initial 1600 quarto text, it is known that 2 Henry IV was not nearly as popular as 1 Henry IV (which was republished five times prior to 1623). :Evidence: as a sequel to 1 Henry IV and a prequel to Henry V, the play was obviously written at some point between the two. We know that 1 Henry IV was probably written by early 1597 at the latest, and that Henry V was written by September 1599, so 2 Henry IV can be dated from early 1597 to September 1599. There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of 2 Henry IV would suggest the play was written after the censoring of 1 Henry IV in 1596/1597. The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for 1 Henry IV does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that 2 Henry IV could not have been completed by that date. There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in Ben Jonson's Every Man out of His Humour, which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.  Much Ado About Nothing (1598–1599)  :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as \\"The cōmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.\\" Grouped with Henry V, As You Like It and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour under the heading \\"to be staied.\\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \\"to be staied\\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as \\"Muche a Doo about nothing.\\" Jointly entered with 2 Henry IV. :First published: published in quarto in 1600 as Much adoe about Nothing (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley). :First recorded performance: on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elzabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. :Evidence: the play is not mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia, which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598. Although it has been suggested that Much Ado could be Love's Labour's Won, the discovery of the list written by Christopher Hunt in 1603 refutes this possibility, as Hunt mentions Love's Labour's Won three years after Much Ado had been published under its own name. Furthermore, the quarto text includes the name \\"Kempe\\" as a speech heading throughout 4.2. This is universally recognised as referring to William Kempe, the leading comic actor of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with the inference being that the role of Dogberry was specifically written for him. However, Kempe left the Lord Chamberlain's Men sometime in early 1599, suggesting the play must have been written before then. This suggests a date of composition in late 1598 and/or early 1599.  Henry V (1599)  1600 quarto of Henry V :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as \\"Henry the ffift.\\" Grouped with Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour under the heading \\"to be staied.\\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \\"to be staied\\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. Henry V was formally entered into the Register by Thomas Pavier on 14 August as \\"The historye of Henrye the v w the battell of Agencourt.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1600 as The cronicle history of Henry the fift, with his battell fought at Agin Court in France. Togither with Auntient Pistoll (printed by Thomas Creede for Thomas Millington and John Busby). This text was republished in 1602 (by Creede for Thomas Pavier) and 1619, as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Pavier). The 1619 text is falsely dated 1608. The 1623 First Folio text appears under the title The Life of Henry the Fift. :Additional information (publication): the 1600 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. However, in his 2000 edition of the quarto text for the New Cambridge: The Early Quartos series, Andrew Gurr argues that although the text was partially constructed from memory, it also represents a performance text, an abridged version of the Folio text constructed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men specifically for performance. :First recorded performance: 7 January 1605 at court, performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men for King James. :Evidence: of all Shakespeare's plays, Henry V is perhaps the easiest to date. A reference by the Chorus to the 1599 Irish expedition of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (5.0.29-34) means the play was most likely written sometime between 27 March 1599 (when Essex left for Ireland) and 24 September 1599 (when he returned in disgrace).  Julius Caesar (1599)  :First official record: mentioned in Thomas Platter the Younger's Diary on 21 September 1599. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Tragedie of Ivlivs Cæsar. :First recorded performance: in his diary on 21 September 1599, Thomas Platter records \\"I went with my party across the water; in the straw-thatched house we saw the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius Caesar, very pleasingly performed, with approximately fifteen characters.\\" This is almost universally accepted as a reference to a performance of Julius Caesar at the recently opened Globe Theatre. :Evidence: obviously, the play was completed by September 1599, and may have been composed specifically as the opening play for the new theatre. Other pieces of evidence also serve to link it to 1599. For example, the play's absence from Palladis Tamia suggests it had not been performed by September 1598. Furthermore, an apparent indebtedness to John Davies' Nosce teipsum at 1.2.51-58 and another to Samuel Daniels' Musophilus at 3.1.111-116 help situate the play in 1599. Musophilus was entered into the Stationers Register on 9 January of that year, and Nosce teipsum on 14 April. Both were published for the first time in 1599, fixing 1599 as the terminus post quem. Two allusions to the play in Jonson's Every Man Out Of His Humour, registered on 8 April 1600, fix 1600 as the latest possible date of composition. Additionally, textual analysis has connected the play closely to Henry V, which was definitely written in 1599. In the fifth-act prologue of Henry V, the Chorus refers to \\"antique Rome,\\" \\"plebeians\\" and \\"conqu'ring Caesar\\" (5.0.26-28), suggesting Shakespeare may already have had his mind on his next play. Metrically, Caesar is closest to Henry V, and a colloquialism-in-verse test places it between Henry V and As You Like It.  As You Like It (1599–1600)  Wilton House; the location of a possible early staging of As You Like It. :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as \\"As y like yt.\\" Grouped with Much Ado About Nothing, Henry V and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour under the heading \\"to be staied.\\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \\"to be staied\\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. The play was not formally entered into the Register until its entry for the 1623 First Folio. :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: possibly on 20 February 1599 at Richmond Park for Queen Elizabeth. The evidence comes from a payment to the Lord Chamberlain's Men for performances of three unnamed plays on St. Stephen's Day 1598, New Year's Day 1599, and Shrove Tuesday 1599 (i.e. 20 February). Juliet Dusinberre believes Touchstone's reference to pancakes (1.2.50-51) provides evidence that As You Like It was the unnamed play performed on 20 February. Another possible early performance may have taken place in December 1603 at Wilton House. In 1865, William Johnson Cory said that whilst visiting Wilton, he was told of a letter from the Countess of Pembroke to her son, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, urging him to bring King James from Salisbury so he may see a performance of As You Like It at the house. James did come, residing at Wilton from 24 November to 12 December. Although Cory did not actually see the letter himself, and it has never been found or verified, a record of a payment to the Lord Chamberlain's Men for an unnamed play in December does exist, suggesting that something was performed at Wilton, but whether it was As You Like It seems impossible to ascertain. A Charles Johnson rewrite of the play, called Love in a Forest, was performed at Drury Lane on 9 January 1723. The earliest definite performance of the Shakespearean text was on 20 December 1740 at Drury Lane. :Evidence: As You Like It is a difficult play to date due to lack of solid external evidence, forcing scholars to rely on topical allusions, parallels with other work and stylistic analysis. Obviously, it was completed by August 1600. It is not mentioned in Palladis Tamia, which could fix the date of composition as sometime between September 1598 and August 1600. In 1600, Thomas Morley published his First Book of Airs, which includes a variation of the page's song from 5.3 of As You Like It. According to the introduction of Airs, Morley compiled the book during the summer of 1599. It is unknown if Shakespeare borrowed from Morley, Morley from Shakespeare or if they collaborated, but irrespective of the exact nature of the relationship, it suggests that that particular passage was written between the summer of 1599 and early 1600. Possible topical allusions also locate the play in 1599/1600. For example, the line \\"the little wit that fools have was silenced\\" (1.2.82-83) may refer to the book burnings of June 1599, and Jacques' \\"All the world's a stage\\" monologue (2.7.139-166) is a possible reference to the motto of the newly opened Globe Theatre; \\"Totus mundus agit histrionem\\" (\\"all the world is a playground\\"), taken from Petronius. The Globe was open by 21 September 1599 at the latest, and possibly as early as 16 May 1599. Stylistic analysis has proved inconclusive in terms of establishing exactly where in the canon the play fits, but has served to locate its composition to the turn of the century, and most scholars agree with a rough date of 1599 to 1600.  Hamlet (1599–1601)  Red Dragon, upon which the earliest recorded performance of Hamlet took place. :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by James Roberts on 26 July 1602 as \\"a booke called The Revenge of Hamlett Prince Denmarke.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1603 as The tragicall historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke (printed by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling and John Trundell). A revised text, \\"newly imprinted, and enlarged to almost as much againe as it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie\\" was published in 1604/1605 (by Simmes for Ling). This text was republished in 1611 (by George Eld for John Smethwick) and 1622 (by William Stansby for Smethwick). The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke. :Additional information (publication): the 1603 quarto text is considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. The 1603 quarto (Q1), the 1604/1605 quarto (Q2) and the 1623 Folio (F1) texts differ substantially from one another. Q1 is roughly 2200 lines, whilst Q2 is roughly 3800 lines. F1 is 230 lines shorter than Q2 but does include 77 lines not found in either Q1 or Q2. Verbal, grammatical and stylistic differences between the three texts number in the thousands. So different are Q1, Q2 and F1 that both Cambridge and Arden have issued two separate editions of the play; Cambridge published their standard scholarly edition in 1985, edited by Philip Edwards. In 1998, they followed this with a scholarly edition of the 1603 quarto as part of their Early Quartos series, edited by Kathleen O. Irace. Similarly, in 2006, Arden published two editions of the play; the standard edition (which uses Q2 as the control text) and a second edition, under the title Hamlet: The Texts of 1603 and 1623, both editions edited by Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor. The exact nature of the relationship between the three texts is still under debate. There is also the problem of Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Some scholars however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed, which many doubt) was most likely an early draft. :First recorded performance: the entry in the Stationers' Register in July 1602 states that the play was \\"latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes.\\" The title page of Q1 states that it had been performed in London, at Cambridge and Oxford universities, \\"and else- where.\\" However, there is no record of any of these performances. The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the Red Dragon, anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496–1631 (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain William Keeling, who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the East India Company that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The Red Dragon, Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed Hamlet on the nights of 5 September and \\"31 September\\" (presumably 1 October), and Richard II on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to Hamlet and Richard II were not included by the editor, Samuel Purchas. In his 1898 book, Life of Shakespeare, Sidney Lee claimed the entire Red Dragon episode was probably a forgery by John Payne Collier, and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, William Foster pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play. The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine. The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619. 1603 quarto of Hamlet :Evidence: because the three versions of Hamlet which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. In his 1987 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare (which uses F1 as the control text), G R. Hibbard writes \\"exactly when Hamlet was composed depends in part on which Hamlet is under consideration, for the play exists in three different forms.\\" Hamlet was originally written sometime between September 1599 and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). The terminus post quem of September 1599 is fixed by a reference to Julius Caesar (3.2.96-97), the earliest recorded performance of which took place in September 1599. Another important internal piece of evidence is found in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's report to Hamlet of \\"an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't\\" (2.2.335-337). This is probably a reference to the Children of the Chapel, a playing company of young boys who performed at Blackfriars with such success as to make them genuine rivals to the adult acting companies. The subsequent comment, \\"there has been much to-do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in to the question\\" (2.2.348-352) is thought to refer to the War of the Theatres between Ben Jonson on one side and John Marston and Thomas Dekker on the other. The conflict began in 1599 when Marston mocked Jonson with the character of Chrisoganus in Histriomastix. Jonson responded by satirizing Marston's style in Every Man out of His Humour, leading to a series of plays in which the various writers mocked one another. The \\"conflict\\" concluded in 1601, when Dekker mocked Jonson with the character of Horace in Satiromastix, at which point Jonson and Marston apparently reconciled. Both the reference to the child actors and the War of the Theatres suggest a date of composition of 1600–1601. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, Gabriel Harvey has written in a marginal note that Shakespeare's \\"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort.\\" Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601. However, not all scholars accept that Harvey's note can be used for dating purposes, mainly due to the fact that it infers Thomas Watson (d.1592) and Edmund Spenser (d.1599) are both still alive, but also mentions John Owen's 1607 epigrams, making it impossible to ascertain exactly when the note was written. Stylistic evidence has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601, with subsequent revisions up to, and possibly beyond, 1605. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted.  Twelfth Night (1601)  Edward Wright's \\"A Chart of the World on Mercator's Projection\\" (), published in Richard Hakluyt's 1600 edition of The Principal Navigations... and thought to have been referenced in the play. :First official record: John Manningham's diary on 2 February 1602. :First published: First Folio (1623), as Twelfe Night, Or what you will. :First recorded performance: John Manningham saw the play performed at the Middle Temple on Candlemas (2 February) 1602. The acting company is unrecorded but is thought to have been the Lord Chamberlain's Men. :Evidence: obviously the play was complete by February 1602. However, John Leslie Hotson believes it to have been written earlier, probably in late 1600. On the night of the Feast of the Epiphany (6 January) 1601, it is known the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed a play at Whitehall for Queen Elizabeth and Virginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. However, although official records contain much information on the preparations for the play, the name of the play itself is never mentioned. An official description of the unnamed play dictates \\"that [it] shall be best furnished with rich apparel, have great variety and change of music and dances, and of a subject that may be most pleasing to her Majesty.\\" Hotson believes the unnamed play of 1601 was Twelfth Night, the title of which refers to the Twelfth Night celebrations which bridge Christmas and the epiphany. Most scholars disagree with Hotson on this point, however, believing the description could just as easily fit Much Ado as Twelfth Night, and arguing that rather than Shakespeare naming the character of Orsino in honour of the Duke who would be watching the play, it is more likely he took the name after meeting the Duke prior to writing it. Topical allusions serve only to fix 1599 as a terminus post quem. Maria makes reference to \\"the new map with the augmentation of the Indies\\" (3.2.74). This probably refers to Edward Wright's \\"Chart of the World on Mercator's Projection\\" in Certaine Errors in Navigation, which was published in 1599, or, less likely, to the second edition of Richard Hakluyt's Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation, published the same year. Two references to the \\"sophy\\" (2.5.170 and 3.4.269) refer to the Shah of Persia, who at the time was Abbas I. In 1599, Sir Anthony Shirley had returned from his travels in Persia, publishing his memoirs in 1600 to great success. This is further evidence of composition around the turn of the century. However, Feste's avoidance of the phrase \\"out of my element\\" because the word \\"element\\" is \\"overworn\\" (3.1.58) may be a reference to Thomas Dekker's Satiromastix, which mocks the expression \\"out of my element\\" three times. Satiromastix was first acted in 1601, meaning, if one accepts the reference, 1601 must be the earliest possible date of composition.  Troilus and Cressida (1600–1602)  1609 Q edition of Troilus and Cressida :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by James Roberts on 7 February 1603 as \\"the booke of Troilus and Cresseda.\\" :First published: two different versions of the play were published in quarto in 1609. Q was published under the title The Historie of Troylus and Cresseida. Q was published under the title The Famous Historie of Troylus and Cresseid. Excellently expressing the beginning of their loves, with the conceited wooing of Pandarus, Prince of Licia. Both Q and Q were printed by George Eld for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley. Both versions of the play are identical apart from a different title page, and a note to the reader added to Q. The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedie of Troylus and Cressida. :Additional information (publication): Troilus and Cressida has attained a degree of infamy amongst Shakespearean scholars due to the range of unanswered questions it raises. For example, it is unknown if the play was ever performed in Shakespeare's day. Q claims it had been acted by the King's Men at the Globe, but Q omits the reference to the King's Men and instead includes a note headed \\"A neuer writer, to an euer reader. Newes,\\" which claims the play has never been staged. Apparently when Q was at press, the printers were informed that the play had not been performed and they therefore prepared a cancel title- page and the note to the reader, which claims it is a sign of the quality of the play that it has never been publicly staged (\\"never staled with the stage, never clapper-clewed with the palms of the vulgar\\"). It is unknown however, which text is correct – Q or Q. E.A.J. Honigmann has suggested that the play was written early in 1601, but never acted because of fears it may have been seen as a political allegory sympathetic to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. :First recorded performance: Troilus and Cressida has never been popular on stage, apparently even in Shakespeare's day. The earliest known performance is an adaptation by John Dryden, called Troilus and Cressida, Or Truth Found Too Late, which was staged at the Duke's Theatre in 1679. Although there is a record of a performance at Smock Alley in Dublin some time prior to 1700, it is unknown if this production was of Shakespeare's original text, or Dryden's adaptation, which was being revived as late as 1734. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean text was a heavily edited German language all- male production on 23 April 1898, at the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich. The first known production of the play in the United Kingdom was on 1 June 1907 at the Great Queen Street Theatre, directed by Charles Fry, using a mixture of amateur and professional actors in modern dress. :Evidence: just as its early performance history is far from clear, so too is the date of the play's composition. 1598 can be fixed as a terminus post quem, as Shakespeare definitely used George Chapman's Seven Books of the Illiad of Homer as a source, which was entered into the Stationers' Register in April 1598. Some scholars have attempted to link the play to the War of the Theatres, particularly the reference to the \\"Prologue armed\\" (l.23), which may be an allusion to the prologue in Jonson's The Poetaster (1601), in which an obviously infuriated Jonson lashes out at his detractors. However, the prologue in Troilus was not included in either Q or Q, making it difficult to directly connect it to the squabbles between the playwrights. Stylistic evidence is also inconclusive. A rare word test places it closest to Hamlet. Ants Oras' pause test places it after Henry IV and before Othello, but is unable to determine exactly where the play lies between the two. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after Hamlet and before Twelfth Night. Metrical analysis places it after Hamlet and Twelfth Night but before Measure for Measure and Othello. This all suggests a date of composition of somewhere between 1600 and 1602, but the exact order in which Hamlet, Twelfth Night and Troilus and Cressida were written seems impossible to determine.  Sir Thomas More (1592–1595; Shakespeare's involvement, 1603–1604)  MS page of Sir Thomas More, believed to be in Shakespeare's handwriting. :First official record: in the diary of Thomas Hearne, on 17 January 1728. Hearne wrote \\"On the 12th of Oct. last M MurrayApparently an unknown John Murray. lent me a thin folio Paper MS done or sowed up in a Vellum Cover; on w it is intitled, The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore. This I have read over. It is wrote in the nature of a Play or Interlude, soon after his death, I believe. Tho' it appears from thence plainly, what a great, wise, good and charitable man Sir Thomas was, yet there is no particular of History in it, but what we know already. It is the original, being in many places strangely scored & in others so altered that 'tis hard to make some things out.\\"Quoted in :First published: 1844, edited by Alexander Dyce for the Shakespeare Society. Published under the name Sir Thomas More, A Play; now first printed. :Additional information (attribution): that Shakespeare was involved in the composition of Sir Thomas More is now generally agreed upon. The first major scholarly edition of the play was published by Manchester University Press in 1990, under its \\"Revels Plays\\" banner, edited by Vittorio Gabrieli and Giorgio Melchiori. In 2011, the Arden Shakespeare also published a full scholarly edition, edited by John Jowett (who had also edited the play for the 2nd edition of the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works in 2005), The Revels Plays edition is subtitled \\"A play by Anthony Munday and Others. Revised by Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood and William Shakespeare.\\" The Arden edition includes the subheading \\"Original Text by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle. Censored by Edmund Tilney. Revisions co-ordinated by Hand C. Revised by Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood and William Shakespeare.\\" The MS is a foul paper in the handwriting of Anthony Munday. Censorship notes are included throughout by Edmund Tilney, Master of the Revels. Revisions are by Chettle (Hand A), Dekker (Hand E), Heywood (Hand B) and, probably, Shakespeare (Hand D). Hand C is an unknown professional theatrical scribe who made several annotations on top of the alterations. Shakespeare is thought to have worked on Scene 6, based upon handwriting and stylistic analysis. He may also have worked on Scene 8, although this is based purely on stylistic analysis, as Scene 8 exists only in a transcribed version by Hand C. Shakespeare's name was first linked to the play by Richard Simpson in 1871. One year later, James Spedding elaborated upon and rejected some of Simpson's claims, but ultimately concurred that Hand D was Shakespeare's. In 1923, Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More saw a quintet of major scholars (Alfred W. Pollard, W.W. Greg, E. Maunde Thompson, J. Dover Wilson and R.W. Chambers) support the Shakespearean attribution. What is known for certain is that Hand D does bear a striking resemblance to the extant examples of Shakespeare's handwriting, and if it is not his handwriting, it is not the handwriting of any contemporary playwright whose handwriting has survived. Thus, the vast majority of contemporary paleographers believe that Hand D is that of William Shakespeare. :First recorded performance: it is unknown if the play was ever performed during Shakespeare's day, although due to its censorship problems, it is highly unlikely. The earliest recorded performance occurred at Birkbeck, University of London in December 1922, where it was performed by the students and produced by members of the English department. :Evidence: the original play is traditionally believed to have been written sometime between 1592 and 1595 by Munday and Chettle. The early scenes of the play depict \\"Evil May Day\\", the name given to an anti-alien riot in London in May 1517. Anti-alien riots also occurred in 1593 and 1595, followed by the execution of the ringleaders. In the play, Henry VIII is depicted as being relatively merciful to the instigators of the riots, whereas in 1595, Queen Elizabeth showed no such leniency. The theory is that no playwright would have written a play which knowingly portrayed the current monarch in such a negative light when compared to a previous monarch, and as Munday was an occasional government spy, he would be even less likely to do so. This places the date of initial composition as prior to the 1595 executions but probably after the initial re- emergence of xenophobia in the autumn of 1592. Tilney's specific objections to the depiction of the riots and their aftermath suggest that he received the play when these issues were still considered sensitive. Due to these censorship issues, the play was probably laid aside until after the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, when Tilney's objections would have carried less weight. The revisions were made at this point, although without the participation of Munday. Several aspects of the revision work support a date of 1603–1604. For example, the additions contain twenty-seven profanities forbidden by the Act to Restrain Abuses of Players (1606), making it highly unlikely they were added after this date. There are also three references in Chettle's revision work to the court (Sc.13.64Line references are to the 2011 Arden Shakespeare edition, edited by John Jowett, which does not divide the play into acts.), the King (Sc.13.78-80) and \\"Lord Spend-All's Stuart's\\" (Sc.13.110) which are probably references to James I, who came to power in 1603. There are also several parallels with Chettle's The Tragedy of Hoffman (written between 1602 and 1604). Stylistic analysis of Scene 6 also supports this date. MacDonald P. Jackson's examination of vocabulary and pauses-in- verse place the material between Twelfth Night and Macbeth. A colloquialism- in-verse test places it after Twelfth Night and Troilus and Cressida.  Measure for Measure (1603–1604)  :First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 26 December 1604 of \\"Mesur for Mesur\\" by \\"Shaxberd.\\" :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 26 December 1604, by the King's Men. :Evidence: obviously the play was written prior to December 1604. Internal evidence in the form of topical allusions suggest a date of 1603–1604. For example, 1.1.68-73 may allude to King James' dislike of crowds, which had become apparent in June 1603. Another example is found at 4.3.8 (\\"the old women were all dead\\"). This is thought to refer to the plague sweeping London, which had become a significant problem in May 1603. In 1.2, Lucio discusses with two gentlemen the possibility of an imminent peace, which would deprive soldiers of their occupation, followed immediately by a reference to a \\"sanctimonious pirate\\" (1.2.1-7). This may refer to King James' attempts in the summer of 1604 to negotiate a peace treaty with Spain, which would greatly reduce the activities of pirates. If these allusions are accurate, it would place the date of composition as somewhere between summer 1603 and late 1604. This date is supported by stylistic analysis. Both a colloquialism-in-verse test and a metrical test place Measure after Twelfth Night and Troilus, but before All's Well, and a rare word test links it most closely to All's Well.  Othello (1603–1604)  1622 quarto of Othello. :First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1604 of \\"The Moor of Venis\\" by \\"Shaxberd.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1622 as The Tragœdy of Othello, The Moore of Venice (printed by Nicholas Okes for Thomas Walkley). The Folio text appears under virtually same name; The Tragedie of Othello, the Moore of Venice. :Additional information (publication): although the 1622 quarto text is not usually considered a bad quarto, it does differ significantly from the Folio text; F1 features roughly 160 lines not in Q1, and Q1 features twelve lines not in F1. The word ordering in some sentences is also different at several points throughout the play. In his 2001 edition of Q1 for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Scott McMillin argues the quarto was created by a professional theatrical scribe listening to the actors performing the play, and in this sense, it represents as pure a performance text as it is possible to have. :First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1604, by the King's Men. :Evidence: obviously the play was written by November 1604, and conventionally, it tends to be dated 1603–1604. An important element in this dating is Shakespeare's use of sources. For example, \\"burn like the mines of sulphur\\" (3.3.331), \\"one entire and perfect chrysolite\\" (5.2.143), and \\"Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees/Their medicinal gum (5.2.349-350) are all thought to allude to Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny the Elder's Naturalus Historia, published in 1601. Additionally, Shakespeare probably took the information regarding the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (found in 1.3, 2.1 and 2.2) from Richard Knolles' General History of the Turks, which contains an epistle dated 30 September 1603. Specifically, he may have got the name Signor Angelo, mentioned in the sailor's report (1.3.16), from Angelus Sorianus, a Venetian commander discussed in Knolles. Also, the sailor's description of Turkish tactics, \\"The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,/Steering with due course toward the island of Rhodes,/Have there injoined with an after fleet\\" (1.3.34-36), may have come from Knolles' description of the Turkish fleets' actions prior to the siege of Nicosia. This suggests September 1603 as a likely terminus post quem. A possible terminus ante quem could be March 1604, when Philip Henslowe paid Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton for Part 1 of The Honest Whore, which contains the line \\"more savage than a barbarous Moor.\\" Whilst not specific enough to be a definite reference to Shakespeare, it is known that Othello was immensely popular from its very inception, and such a reference would certainly have made sense to an audience at the time. It has also been argued that the play may have been written with an eye to pleasing the new king, James I. James was interested in Turkish history, and had written a poem in 1591 about the Battle of Lepanto. The poem was republished upon his accession in 1603, and a play set amongst the events which ultimately led to that battle would have had a special interest for the king. This would also support a date of 1603–1604. However, following H.C. Hart's 1928 edition of the play for the first series of the Arden Shakespeare, E.A.J. Honigmann dates the play mid-1601 to mid-1602, believing it to have influenced the bad quarto of Hamlet (in existence by July 1602). For example, he cites the substitution of the name \\"Montano\\" for \\"Reynaldo.\\" Montano occurs in no other play except Othello, and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on Hamlet Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of Othello, and unconsciously mixed up the names. Additionally, MacDonald P. Jackson's pause analysis of the plays places Othello closest to Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night and Measure for Measure, in that order. The \\"average date\\" for these four plays is 1602. In his 2006 Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play, however, Michael Neill discusses Honigmann and Jackson's arguments, finding them suggestive, but not wholly persuasive, and ultimately settling for a \\"compromise date\\" of 1602–1603.  All's Well That Ends Well (1604–1605)  Samuel Taylor Coleridge by Washington Allston (1814). Coleridge's theory regarding the composition of All's Well was accepted for much of the nineteenth century. :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register entry for the First Folio on 8 November 1623. :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: at Goodman's Fields in 1741, billed as \\"written by Shakespeare and not acted since his time.\\" :Evidence: a notoriously difficult play to date, with estimates ranging from 1595 to 1607. As an example of the disparity the play can cause in relation to its date, the 1997 revised edition of William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion from Oxford University Press dates the play 1604–1605, placing it between Othello and Timon of Athens. However, the 2nd edition of the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works in 2005, compiled by the same editors as the Textual Companion, date it 1606–1607, placing it between Antony and Cleopatra and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Another example of scholarly mutability regarding the date of All's Well is Edmond Malone. In his 1778 chronology, Malone had accepted a theory originated by Thomas Percy and advanced by Richard Farmer that All's Well was Love's Labour's Won, and so dated the play 1598. However, by the time of his death, Malone had changed his mind, and in the Third Variorum edition of 1821, edited by James Boswell based on Malone's notes, he dated it 1606, based on a stylistic analysis of the anti-Puritan satire in 1.3, which he believed was written for King James' amusement. Another scholar who has attempted to tackle the dating issues is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1813, he formulated the theory that the play \\"as it has come down to us, was written at two different, and rather distinct periods of the poet's life.\\" Further elaborated upon by John Payne Collier, this theory was widely accepted throughout the nineteenth century, with most scholars arguing for an initial period of composition in the mid-1590s and a second period in the mid-1600s. The basis of the argument was that although the play exhibited stylistic and thematic connections with Hamlet and Measure for Measure, certain sections were seen as immature, and more akin to the type of material found in Two Gentlemen, Taming of the Shrew or Comedy of Errors. Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the rhyming couplets in 2.1 and 2.2. Similarly, Parolles was seen by some as an early study for Falstaff, and the Clown was often seen as being similar to Launce in Two Gentlemen; amusing, but not integrated into the plot particularly well. Modern scholarship, however, which tends to see the play as more complex and serious than earlier scholars, has rejected the two-periods- of-composition theory. Topical allusions in the play are sparse at best, with the only allusion recognised by most scholars being 1.3.94-95 (\\"wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart\\"), which is thought to be a reference to the enforcement of the surplice in 1604. Stylistically, a rare word test links the play most closely with Measure for Measure. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after Measure and Othello but before Timon of Athens. A metrical test places it after Measure and Othello but before Lear. If one accepts the surplice reference, in tandem with the stylistic evidence, a date of 1604–1605 seems likely, but the exact order of composition of plays in this period remains open to speculation.  King Lear (1605–1606)  1608 quarto of King Lear. :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Nathaniel Butter and John Busby on 26 November 1607 as \\"A booke called. M William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear.\\" :First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1608 as M. William Shakspeare: His True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King Lear and his three Daughters. With the unfortunate life of Edgar, sonne and heire to the Earle of Gloster, and his sullen and assumed humor of Tom of Bedlam (printed by Nicholas Okes for Nathaniel Butter). This text was republished in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\" (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 Folio text appears under the title The Tragedie of King Lear. :Additional information (publication): although the 1608 quarto text is not usually considered a bad quarto per se, it does differ substantially from the Folio text; Q1 contains 285 lines not in F1, and F1 contains about 115 lines not in Q1. Additionally, over one thousand individual words are different between the two texts, each text has completely different punctuation, much of the verse in F1 is printed as prose in Q1, several speeches are given to different characters (including the final speech of the play – Albany in Q1, Edgar in F1) and each text features different scene divisions. The New Cambridge Shakespeare has published scholarly editions of both texts; F1 in 1992, and Q1 in 1994 as part of their Early Quartos series, both versions edited by Jay L. Halio. The 1999 Pelican Shakespeare edition of the play, edited by Stephen Orgel included both Q1 and F1, as well as the conflated text originally created by Alexander Pope in 1725. Similarly, the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works also included both versions of the play in their second edition of 2005, each edited by Gary Taylor. The Q1 text appears under the title The History of King Lear, and is dated 1605–1606. The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of King Lear and is dated 1610. Taylor believes Q1 represents an early draft of the play, written prior to performance, and F1 represents a revision written four or five years later, after numerous performances. He feels the differences in the two texts represent a \\"more theatrical\\" version of the play, which streamlines the plot and improves the characterisation of Edgar, at the expense of Kent and Albany. Although Halio disagrees with Taylor's assessment of F1 as \\"more theatrical,\\" he reaches the same conclusion regarding the provenance of the text; Q1 was probably set from Shakespeare's foul papers, whilst F1 represents a performance text, probably altered by Shakespeare himself. Most scholars today are in agreement with this theory.See, for example, the essays in :First recorded performance: according to the entry in the Stationers' Register in November 1607, the play was performed at Whitehall on 26 December 1606. Samuel Harsnett's A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures (1603), one of Shakespeare's sources for Lear. :Evidence: although the existence of two distinct texts complicates the issue of dating the play, what is known for certain is that it must have been completed (in some form) by December 1606. The play could not have been written any earlier than March 1603, as determined by Shakespeare's use of Samuel Harsnett's Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures, from which he took some of Tom O'Bedlam's dialogue, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 16 March 1603. However, the terminus post quem can possibly be pushed forward to 1605. Gary Taylor believes that Lear was influenced by George Chapman, Ben Jonson and John Marston's Eastward Ho, written in early 1605, and George Wilkins' The Miseries of Enforced Marriage, written no later than mid-1605. Furthermore, the line \\"these late eclipses in the sun and moon\\" (Sc.2.101Stanley Wells' 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.) could refer to the lunar eclipse of 17 September and the solar eclipse of 2 October 1605. Of vital importance in dating the play, however, is the 1605 publication of an older version of the story, the anonymous play The true Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan and Cordella. The publication of Leir in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's Lear was on stage by 1605. Leir was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to c.1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play. On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, R.A. Foakes argues the 1605 publication of Leir inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used Leir as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 Leir to \\"alert\\" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in Leir, and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than Leir. If Foakes is correct, it means Shakespeare could not have started writing Lear until May 1605. In his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, however, Stanley Wells argues there are echoes of Leir in plays as chronologically wide-ranging as The Taming of the Shrew, Richard II, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, suggesting Shakespeare was very familiar with the play from at least the early 1590s. The publication of Leir in 1605 could also be connected to the case of Brian Annesley, a wealthy Kentishman, who may, or may not, have influenced Shakespeare in writing Lear. In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604–1606. Whatever the case regarding Leir and Annesley, however, Halio, Foakes, and Wells all date the initial composition of the play to 1605–1606. In regards to the revision of the text, stylistic analysis tends to view Q1 and F1 as two distinct texts, and in this sense, a rare word test, pause test and metrical test of Q1 all place it between Othello and Macbeth, and either immediately before or immediately after Timon of Athens. A rare word test of the passages unique to F1, however, place it closest to The Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, The Tempest and Henry VIII.  Timon of Athens (1605–1606)  Thomas Middleton, who probably worked on Timon in some capacity. :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register entry for the First Folio, on 8 November 1623. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Life of Tymon of Athens. :First recorded performance: there is no known evidence of a performance in Shakespeare's lifetime. The earliest known production of the play was in 1674, when Thomas Shadwell wrote an adaptation under the title The History of Timon of Athens, The Man-hater. Multiple other adaptations followed over the next century, by writers such as Thomas Hull, James Love and Richard Cumberland. Although the earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Smock Alley in Dublin in 1761, adaptations continued to dominate the stage until well into the twentieth century. The earliest known production of a predominantly Shakespearean version of the play in the United Kingdom was at Sadler's Wells in 1851. Adapted by Samuel Phelps, the production cut all scenes involving the Fool, the return of the Poet and the Painter and much of the sexual material. He also changed the ending, having a solemn Alcibiades marching to Timon's grave and reading the epitaph himself, a far less ambiguous ending than the original. :Additional information (attribution): dating Timon of Athens is rendered more difficult because of the probable involvement of Thomas Middleton. The play contains several narrative inconsistencies uncharacteristic of Shakespeare, an unusually unsatisfying dénouement, drastically different styles in different places and an unusually large number of long lines which don't scan. One theory is that the play as it appears in the First Folio is unfinished. E.K. Chambers believes Shakespeare began the play, but abandoned it due to a mental breakdown, never returning to finish it. F.W. Brownlow believes the play to have been Shakespeare's last, and remained uncompleted at his death. A more predominant theory, however, is one proposed by Charles Knight in 1838; the play was a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist. Today, many scholars believe that other dramatist was Thomas Middleton. However, the exact nature of the collaboration is disputed. Did Middleton revise a piece begun by Shakespeare, did Shakespeare revise Middleton's work, or did they work together? John Jowett, editor of the play for both the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works and the individual Oxford Shakespeare edition, believes Middleton worked with Shakespeare in an understudy capacity and wrote scenes 2 (1.2 in editions which divide the play into acts), 5 (3.1), 6 (3.2), 7 (3.3), 8 (3.4), 9 (3.5), 10 (3.6) and the last eighty lines of 14 (4.3). :Evidence: because there is no reference to Timon until 1623, attempts to date the play must rely on topical allusions and stylistic analysis. A possible terminus ante quem is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the Folio text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. Timon is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608. A terminus post quem may come from a possible topical allusion to the Gunpowder Plot of November 1605; \\"those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire\\" (Sc.7.32-33John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts. In editions which do divide the play, Oxford's Scene 7 is usually Act 3, Scene 3.). In the context of the play, the line is referring to religious zeal, but some scholars feel it is a subtle reference to the events of November. The play may also have been influenced by a pamphlet published in June 1605, Two Unnatural and Bloody Murders, which served as the primary source for Thomas Middleton's A Yorkshire Tragedy. This would narrow the possible range of dates to sometime between November 1605 and August 1608. Narrowing the date further, however, must come wholly from stylistic analysis. A metrical test links the play most closely with Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and King Lear, whilst a colloquialism-in- verse test places it after All's Well but before Macbeth. Furthermore, MacDonald P. Jackson's rare word test found the conjectured Shakespearean parts of the text date to 1605–1606. However, if one were to analyse the conjectured non-Shakespearean sections as if they were by Shakespeare, the rare word test produces a date of 1594–1595, an obvious impossibility. Going further, Jackson found that if one examines the non-Shakespearean sections in the context of Middleton's career, a date of 1605–1606 also results.  Macbeth (1606)  Henry Garnet, executed for his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot, and possibly referred to by the Porter in Macbeth. :First official record: in his notes for a book on \\"Common Policy\\" (i.e. public morals), Simon Forman records seeing the play at the Globe on 20 April 1611. He actually dates the performance \\"1610, the 20th April, Saturday,\\" but in 1610, 20 April was a Tuesday, and most scholars feel he accidentally wrote the wrong year. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Tragedie of Macbeth. :First recorded performance: possibly on 20 April 1611 at the Globe, recorded by Simon Forman. However, there is some doubt amongst scholars as to the veracity of Forman's account. Initially, the document itself was thought to be a forgery, as it was first brought to light by John Payne Collier amongst a group of documents many of which did prove to be inauthentic. Although J. Dover Wilson proved the document was genuine in 1947, doubts remain as to the reliability of Forman's report. For example, he makes no mention of the apparitions, or of Hecate, and he virtually ignores the conclusion of the play, which is strange considering he was taking notes for a book about morals. He also mentions seeing Macbeth and Banquo on horseback riding through a wood, something highly unlikely on the Globe stage. Furthermore, he describes the Weïrd Sisters as \\"nymphs or fairies,\\" an unusual way to describe the characters as they appear in the play. However, \\"nymphs\\" is how they are described in one of Shakespeare's sources for Macbeth, Holinshed's Chronicles. This suggests Forman may have conflated witnessing a performance with reading the source material. If Forman's account is not accepted as genuine, the first recorded performance was on 5 November 1664, as recorded by Samuel Pepys. :Additional information (revision): because it is theorised by some scholars that the Folio text of Macbeth shows signs of revision, dating the play can be difficult. Macbeth is extremely short for a Shakespearean tragedy, and it is thought that F1 may have been set from a prompt book that had been shortened for performance, rather than from Shakespeare's own foul papers. First suggested by W.G. Clarke and W.A. Wright in their 1869 edition of the play for Clarendon Press, the most likely person to have carried out the revision is Thomas Middleton. The play is listed in the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works as \\"The Tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Adapted by Thomas Middleton,\\" and its date is recorded as \\"1606; adapted 1616.\\" Middleton is conjectured to have written 3.5 and much of 4.1; the only scenes which feature Hecate. The nature of these scenes suggest revision as opposed to collaboration. The main reason Middleton's name is attached to the conjectured revision is because 4.1 calls for the use of two songs from The Witch, a play by Middleton himself. However, Middleton's involvement with the play, and the notion of revision work itself, is not universally accepted. Two notable scholars who dissent from this theory are Jonathan Hope and Brian Vickers. :Evidence: the play is closely connected to King James, and scholars are in general agreement that it is unlikely to have been written prior to his accession in 1603. He considered Banquo his direct ancestor, and eight Stuart kings preceded James, just as Banquo is depicted at the end of \\"a show of eight kings\\" (4.1.126.1-2). In 1790, Edmond Malone dated the play 1606, and the majority of scholars still accept this date even whilst acknowledging little conclusive evidence exists, other than the fact that it 'seems' correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. There are some possible topical allusions, however, which do support a date of 1606. For example, the Porter's mention of \\"an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale\\" (2.3.7-9) is a possible reference to the Gunpowder plot, specifically the trial of Henry Garnet in March 1606. Furthermore, the Weïrd Sisters' account of The Tiger (1.3.8-26) is thought to allude to a ship of the same name that returned to England on 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. At 1.3.22-23, the First Witch says \\"Weary sev'n-nights, nine times nine,/Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.\\" The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion. If this theory is correct, the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. In his 1997 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, however, A.R. Braunmuller finds the arguments for topical allusions inconclusive, and instead argues for a date closer to James' accession in 1603. From a stylistic perspective, a metrical test and colloquialism-in-verse test place the play after Lear and Timon but before Antony and Cleopatra, although Ants Oras' pause test places it before all three plays. A rare word test places it closest to Troilus and Lear.  Antony and Cleopatra (1606)  1607 quarto of The Devil's Charter, which may allude to Antony and Cleopatra. :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Edward Blount on 20 May 1608 as \\"a booke Called Anthony. and Cleopatra.\\" Jointly entered with Pericles, Prince of Tyre. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra. :First recorded performance: in 1669 the Lord Chamberlain's office granted the right to perform the play to Thomas Killigrew, with the added note that it had been \\"formerly acted at the Blackfriars,\\" but no further information is given. The earliest definite performance was in 1759 when it was staged by David Garrick at Drury Lane, from a script prepared by Edward Capell. However, this production was heavily influenced by John Dryden's All for Love, which, along with Charles Sedley's Antony and Cleopatra had dominated the stage from 1677 onwards. Different adaptations were staged by John Philip Kemble at Covent Garden in 1813, William Macready at Drury Lane in 1833, Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells in 1849, Andrew Halliday at Drury Lane in 1873, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre in 1906. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean text was in a production by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic in 1922. :Evidence: obviously, the play was written by May 1608. However, an earlier terminus ante quem can perhaps be established by Samuel Daniel's republication of his play The Tragedie of Cleopatra (originally written in 1594) in a \\"newly altered version,\\" which seems to have been influenced by Shakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra. For example, Daniel includes a newly added allusion to \\"Cydnus\\" as the meeting place of the lovers, adds the characters of Dircetus, Diomedes and Gallus, and includes several verbal echoes. If the play was an influence on Daniel then it must have been on stage by Easter 1607, due to the closing of the theatres because of plague. This suggests it was written in 1606 or very early 1607. That 1606 is the most likely date seems fixed by Barnabe Barnes' The Devil's Charter, acted by the King's Men on 2 February 1607. Barnes refers to \\"aspics,\\" which are used to kill two young princes in their sleep, as \\"Cleopatra's birds,\\" and the princes as \\"competitors with Cleopatra.\\" If Barnes is here alluding to Anthony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra kills herself by making an asp bite her on the breast and arm (5.2.302-312), it must have been on stage by January 1607 at the very latest, suggesting composition in 1606.  Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1607–1608)  1609 quarto of Pericles :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Edward Blount on 20 May 1608 as \\"A booke called. The booke of Pericles prynce of Tyre.\\" Jointly entered with Antony and Cleopatra. :First published: published in quarto in 1609 as The Late and much admired Play, Called Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of the whole History, adventures, and fortunes of the sayd Prince: As also, The no lesse strange, and worthy accidents, in the Birth and Life, of his Daughter Mariana (printed by William White and Thomas Creede for Henry Gosson). This text was republished in 1609 (again by White and Creede for Gosson), 1611 (by Simon Stafford for Gosson) 1619 (as part of William Jaggard's \\"False Folio\\", printed by Thomas Pavier), 1630 (by John Norton for Robert Bird) and 1635 (by Thomas Cotes for Robert Bird). Pericles did not appear in the First Folio (1623), the Second Folio (1632) or the first impression of the Third Folio (1663). It was added to the second impression of the Third Folio (1664; printed by Coates for Philip Chetwinde) as The much admired Play, called, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of the whole History, Adventures, and Fortunes of the sayd Prince. :First recorded performance: the Venetian ambassador to England from 5 January 1606 to 23 November 1608, Zorzi Giustinian, saw a production of the play during his time in London. He was accompanied by the French ambassador, Antoine Lefevre de la Boderie, and his wife, who arrived in England in April 1607. Giustinian noted that he paid admission, so the play must have been public. As the theatres were closed from April to December 1607 and from July to November in 1608, he must have seen the play at sometime between January and June of 1608. The earliest known datable production was at the manor house of Sir John Yorke, Gouthwaite Hall in North Yorkshire, on 2 February 1610, performed by the Cholmley Players. Information concerning the production comes from a case in the Court of Star Chamber taken against the Catholic Yorke by his Puritan neighbour Sir Stephen Proctor. :Additional information (attribution): as the play was not included in the First Folio, there has always been doubt as to whether or not Shakespeare actually wrote it. The second impression of the Third Folio added seven new plays, six of which have been proven to be part of the Shakespeare Apocrypha; Locrine, The London Prodigal, The Puritan, Sir John Oldcastle, Thomas Lord Cromwell, and A Yorkshire Tragedy. Traditionally, for some scholars, the simple fact that Pericles is included with such a group is proof enough that Shakespeare did not write it. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably George Wilkins. Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by Nicolaus Delius. Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22. However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction, there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction. On the other hand, in his 2002 book Shakespeare, Co-Author, Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty. Similarly, in 2003 book, Defining Shakespeare, MacDonald P. Jackson analyses, amongst other aspects, versification, rhyme, function words, pronoun usage, metrical patterns and elisions. He too is especially critical of Delvecchio and Hammond, and he too concludes that Wilkins' status as co-author is virtually certain. :Evidence: in 1608, Wilkins published a prose version of the story called The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre, Being the True History of the Play of Pericles, as it was lately presented by the worthy and ancient poet John Gower, which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines from the play, suggesting work on the play preceded composition of the prose version. In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607–1608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to The Tempest, whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to 1 Henry IV. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to The Tempest makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of 1 Henry IV, Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra. Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.  Coriolanus (1608)  Sir Hugh Myddelton by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen (1628). The play contains a possible allusion to Myddleton's 1608 scheme to bring clean water to London. :First official record: mentioned in the Stationers' Register entry for the First Folio, on 8 November 1623. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Tragedy of Coriolanus. :First recorded performance: the earliest known production of the play was a 1681 adaptation by Nahum Tate performed at Drury Lane. Called The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth; or, The Fall of Coriolanus, the play was specifically written to protest the anti-Catholic riots which arose in response to the \\"Popish Plot\\" to assassinate Charles II. In 1719, John Dennis adapted the play, again into a political protest piece staged at Drury Lane. The Invader of His Country; or, The Fatal Resentment was written in response to the Jacobite rising of 1715. More adaptations followed; James Thomson's 1747 version Coriolanus: A Tragedy was performed at Covent Garden in protest against the Jacobite rising of 1745, and Thomas Sheridan's Coriolanus: The Roman Matron, which combined Shakespeare's original with Thomson's version and was performed at Smock Alley in Dublin in 1752. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean text was on 11 November 1754, when David Garrick staged an abridged production at Drury Lane. :Evidence: the play must have been written between 1605 and 1609. A terminus post quem of 1605 is fixed by Menenius' speech regarding the body politic (1.1.93-152), which is partly derived from a speech attributed to Pope Adrian IV in William Camden's Remaines of a Greater Worke, Concerning Britaine, which was published in 1605. A terminus ante quem of 1609 can be fixed by Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, which mocks the line \\"he lurched all swords of the garland\\" (2.2.99), and Robert Armin's Phantasma the Italian Tailor and his Boy, which contains a close parallel to the line \\"they threw their caps/As they would hang them on the horns o'th'moon\\" (1.1.209-210). Epicœne was written in 1609, and Phantasma was entered into the Stationers Register on 6 February 1609. Topical allusions, however, can be used to narrow the date further. For example, the presentation of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Perhaps significantly, Shakespeare was in Stratford-upon-Avon for much of autumn 1608, organising his mother's funeral and conducting business, and thus would have been close to the origin point of the unrest. The reference to \\"the coal of fire upon the ice\\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607–08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river, and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. Also, an allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring clean water to London from the River Lea (which originated in 1608) has been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians \\"to say he'll turn your current in a ditch/And make your channel his\\" (3.1.98-9). Gary Taylor also finds the use of act divisions in the Folio text important, as the King's Men only began to use act divisions when they occupied the indoors Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608. Lee Bliss argues that the five-act structure is built into the thematic fabric of the play, further strengthening the argument that it was written for Blackfriars. Indeed, Bliss believes Coriolanus may have been the King's Men's debut play at the theatre. Taylor believes that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring 1608. In his 1994 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, R.B. Parker dates the play mid-1608. In his 2000 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Lee Bliss is unconvinced by the arguments that Shakespeare is referring to the freezing of the Thames or to Myddelton's scheme, and settles on a date of late 1608 to early 1609.  The Winter's Tale (1609–1611)  :First official record: in his journal, Simon Forman recorded seeing a performance of the play at the Globe on 15 May 1611. :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: a production of the play by the King's Men was staged at the Globe on 15 May 1611, as recorded by Simon Forman. :Evidence: The Winter's Tale can be a difficult play to date precisely due to a lack of contemporary references and topical allusions. Aside from the Forman reference (and some subsequent dated productions at court), and a possible allusion to a Ben Jonson piece, the play must be dated using stylistic analysis. The possible Jonson reference occurs during the sheep- shearing feast, when twelve countrymen perform a satyrs' dance that three are said to have already \\"danced before the King\\" (4.4.333). This may be an allusion to Ben Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince, which was performed at court on 1 January 1611. This would place the most likely date of composition sometime in mid-1610. However, not all scholars believe the reference need be taken that literally, and even those that do accept the Jonson allusion, such as Stanley Wells (editor of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works), agree that the passage may have been added at a later date, and is therefore of little use in dating the play. Traditionally, the play is paired with Cymbeline in terms of style, theme and tone, with The Winter's Tale seen as the superior play, and therefore the later of the two.See, for example, However, stylistic analysis would suggest Winter's Tale preceded Cymbeline; a rare word test places it closest to Measure for Measure, Ants Oras pause test places it closest to Pericles, a colloquialism-in-verse test places it after Coriolanus but before Cymbeline, a metrical test places it closest to Antony and Cleopatra. In his 2010 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, John Pitcher argues for a date of late 1610-early 1611, believing Shakespeare wrote Winter's Tale, Cymbeline and The Tempest in this period after the reopening of the theatres in early 1611, although he acknowledges this creates a gap in the chronology which would suggest Shakespeare wrote nothing in 1609.  Cymbeline (1610)  1620 quarto of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Philaster, which has strong links with Cymbeline. :First official record: Simon Forman saw a production on an unspecified date in 1611. It is thought he saw the play not long before he died, on 8 September of that year. :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Tragedie of Cymbeline. :First recorded performance: Simon Forman saw the play in 1611, although the date (and location) is unknown. The earliest known datable performance was on 1 January 1634, when the play was performed at court for Charles I and Henrietta Maria, where it was described as \\"well likte by the kinge.\\" :Evidence: obviously, the play was complete by September 1611. A terminus post quem of 1608 can be fixed with reasonable certainty insofar as the spectacular stage direction in 5.3, when \\"Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle,\\" suggests Shakespeare wrote the play with the indoor stage equipment of Blackfriars in mind, which places the date as after August 1608. The play also has connections with two other plays of the period; Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding and Thomas Heywood's The Golden Age. Philaster and Cymbeline have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by Cymbeline, they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. Philaster was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if Philaster was influenced by Cymbeline, it must have been written in the first half of 1610. However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that Philaster was written in late 1609. On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the Philaster MS, making it more likely that Philaster preceded Cymbeline. If Gurr's late 1609 date for Philaster is correct, this would suggest Shakespeare wrote Cymbeline in 1610. The play is also connected to Thomas Heywood's The Golden Age, which, like Cymbeline, features Jupiter descending on a cloud, as well as some tentative verbal parallels. As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that Cymbeline preceded Golden Age. However, the date of Golden Age is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610. If one accepts this date, it suggests a date of mid-1610 for Cymbeline. Further evidence for 1610 is presented by Roger Warren, in his 1998 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare. Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the investiture of James' eldest son Henry as Prince of Wales, which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' Tethys' Festival, which foregrounded Milford Haven as the \\"port of union\\" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in Cymbeline, which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period. In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with Golden Age), agrees with a date of mid-1610.  The Tempest (1610–1611)  :First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611. :First published: First Folio (1623). :First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King's Men. :Evidence: the date of The Tempest can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The terminus post quem of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for Virginia, carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the Sea Venture, was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda. All hands were thought lost, but on 23 May 1610 her passengers arrived safely in Virginia, having found shelter on Bermuda, where they repaired the pinnaces and completed their journey. The play is particularly indebted to William Strachey's A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, written in Virginia, and dated 15 July. The MS was carried back to England by Gates himself, who arrived in London in early September. Although True Reportory was not published until 1625, it is known to have been read widely in MS form. Two pamphlets published later in 1610 were also used as sources; Sylvester Jourdain's A Discovery of the Bermudas, the dedication of which is dated 13 October 1610, and the Virginia Company's own A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia, which was entered into the Stationers Register on 8 November. It is worth noting that although most scholars accept these texts as sources and evidence of dating, not all do so. Kenneth Muir is a notable example of a scholar who questions the argument that Shakespeare used Strachey. Stylistically, a rare vocabulary test, a colloquialism-in-verse test and Ants Oras' pause test all place the play after Coriolanus, Winter's Tale and Cymbeline.  Cardenio (1612–1613)  1728 quarto of Double Falshood :First official record: entered into the Stationers' Register by Humphrey Moseley on 9 September 1653, as \\"The History of Cardenio, by Mr Fletcher and Shakespeare.\\" :First published: as far as is known, Cardenio itself has never been published, but in 1728 Lewis Theobald published a play called Double Falshood; or, The Distrest Lovers, which he claimed was adapted from Shakespeare's Cardenio. Theobald claimed that he had access to the original play in the form of three manuscripts. The play had been staged at Drury Lane in December 1727, to great box office success, and was revived in 1728. According to an article in the Gazetteer on 31 March 1770, \\"the original Manuscript of this play is now treasured up in the Museum of Covent Garden Playhouse.\\" However, the article is unclear on whether it is referring to the original Cardenio manuscript by Shakespeare and Fletcher or the original Double Falsehood script by Theobald. In any case, the library burned down in 1808. Theobald's 1728 publication contains a preface which reads, in part, \\"It has been alleged as incredible, that such a curiosity should be stifled and lost to the world for above a century. To this my answer is short: that though it never till now made its appearance on the stage, yet one of the manuscript copies which I have is of above sixty years standing, in the handwriting of Mr. Downes the famous old prompter; and, as I am credibly informed, was early in the possession of the celebrated Mr. Betterton and by him designed to have been ushered into the world. What accident prevented this purpose of his, I do not pretend to know; or through what hands it had successively passed before that period of time. There is a tradition (which I have from the noble person, who supplied me with one of my copies) that it was given by our author, as a present of value, to a natural daughter of his, for whose sake he wrote it, in the time of his retirement from the stage. Two other copies I have (one of which I was glad to purchase at a very good rate), which may not, perhaps, be quite so old as the former; but one of them is much more perfect, and has fewer flaws and interruptions in the sense.\\"Quoted in :First recorded performance: on 20 May 1613, the King's Company received payment for a court performance of \\"Cardenno.\\" :Additional information (attribution): Cardenio is considered a lost play, and whether or not Shakespeare had anything to do with it is an unanswered (and, given the available evidence, perhaps unanswerable) question. Only two sources attribute it to Shakespeare; Moseley's 1653 Stationers' Register entry and Theobald's 1727 adaptation. Although the 1613 court payment does connect the play to the King's Men, this does not mean Shakespeare wrote it, as the company performed many plays in which he had no hand. The validity of Moseley's attribution is not helped by the fact that he is known to have attributed several other now lost plays to Shakespeare. For example, on 29 June 1660, he made an entry in the Register for \\"the History of King Stephen. Duke Humphrey, a Tragedy. Iphis and Iantha, or a marriage without a man, a Comedy. By Will: Shakespeare.\\" However, Gary Taylor argues that it is unlikely Moseley was aware of the 1613 court payments to the King's Men, which coincides with Shakespeare's collaboration with Fletcher on two other plays (Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen). Taylor believes this adds support to Moseley's claim of Shakespearean authorship, especially as Fletcher's involvement in Henry VIII hadn't been established by 1653. Scholars also continue to debate the validity of Theobald's claims that he was in possession of a Shakespearean play that had been omitted from all previous editions of Shakespeare's work. E.K. Chambers points out several problems with Theobald's asserted ownership of the text; no one else ever confirmed seeing the three manuscripts, Theobald's claim that he owned them is the only evidence we have; there is no evidence Shakespeare had a \\"natural daughter\\" (i.e. an illegitimate daughter), he had two legitimate daughters, and one son, who died age eleven (although John Freehafer argues the reference to \\"a natural daughter\\" is to Henrietta Maria du Tremblay, the wife of Shakespeare's (alleged) illegitimate son, William Davenant ); the manuscripts apparently disappeared after Theobald's death and were not listed in his sale catalogue of 23 October 1744; the play is never mentioned in the writings of either Downes or Betterton; and if Theobald was so certain of Shakespeare's authorship, why did he not include the play in his 1734 edition of the complete works? Scholars remain divided on the issue of Theobald's claims. However, in 2010, Double Falsehood was controversially published under the Arden Shakespeare banner, edited by Brian Hammond, who adopts the position set out by G. Harold Metz in his 1989 book, Sources of Four Plays Ascribed to Shakespeare; \\"Double Falsehood is mainly Theobald, or Theobald with an earlier adapter, with a substantial admixture of Fletcher and a modicum of Shakespeare.\\" Hammond, for the most part, accepts Theobald's claims, although not without some reservations, and believes Double Falsehood to have been adapted from Cardenio, a play written by Shakespeare and Fletcher. :Evidence: the dating of the play is based on the fact that Cardenio is a character in Don Quixote, which was not published in English until Thomas Shelton's 1612 translation.  Henry VIII (1612–1613)  :First official record: a letter by Thomas Lorkin, dated 30 June 1613, in which he describes a fire at the Globe Theatre caused when sparks from an on-stage cannon landed on a thatched roof during a performance of \\"the play of Hen:8.\\" :First published: First Folio (1623), as The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight. :First recorded performance: the production mentioned in Lorkin's letter took place on 29 June 1613. In a letter by Sir Henry Wotton to Sir Edmund Bacon, dated 2 July 1613, Wotton describes the production as \\"a new play called All Is True representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry the VIIIth.\\" Traditionally, this was assumed to have been the first performance. However, in another letter describing the fire, written by London merchant Henry Bluett on 4 July 1613, and only discovered in 1981, the play is described as having \\"been acted not passing 2 or 3 times before,\\" meaning although the 29 June is the first recorded performance, it was not the first actual performance of the play. :Additional information (attribution): the play is thought to be a collaboration with John Fletcher, a theory first proposed in 1850 by James Spedding (following a suggestion by Alfred, Lord Tennyson), who suggested that Shakespeare's original manuscript was touched up by Fletcher and his regular collaborator, Francis Beaumont. Unlike Shakespeare's other collaboration(s) with Fletcher (Two Noble Kinsmen and, possibly, Cardenio), there is no external evidence that Fletcher worked on Henry VIII, and any arguments for collaboration are based wholly on stylistic analysis. However, much of this evidence does suggest two writers; a rare word test, Ants Oras' pause test, the relationship between prose and verse, vocabulary distribution, and a colloquialism-in-verse test all provide evidence that the play had two different authors. The passages most confidently attributed to Shakespeare are 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2 and 5.1. :Evidence: the fact that the 29 June performance was such an early performances suggests a date of composition of 1612–1613, a date with which most modern scholars concur. Ever since Spedding, scholars have tended to link the play with the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine in February 1613. In his 1957 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, R.A. Foakes argues the overriding theme of the play, especially the final scene, showing the christening of the future Queen Elizabeth, would have perfectly suited the political atmosphere of the period. In early 1613, there was much suspicion of Spain, and Catholic conspiracy, and it was hoped that the marriage would produce an alliance with the devoutly Protestant German princes. In terms of stylistic analysis, the most significant data in terms of dating the play is MacDonald P. Jackson's rare word test, which found that the sections of the play thought to be by Shakespeare must be dated to the very end of his career, and if the non-Shakespearean sections were treated as Shakespearean they would be dated to 1599–1600, an obvious impossibility.  The Two Noble Kinsmen (1613–1614)  1634 quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen :First official record: a fragment from the King's Office of the Revels, dated 1619, includes a list of plays which may have been recently performed at court. Two Noble Kinsmen is one of the plays mentioned. :First published: published in quarto in 1634 (printed by Thomas Cotes for John Waterson). :First recorded performance: although the play must have been staged prior to October 1614, records of early productions are vague. The 1619 list may be a list of recently performed plays, but it could also be a list of plays proposed for future performance. The inclusion of two actors' names in stage directions in the 1634 quarto text (4.2.70.1 and 5.3.0.2) suggest the play was staged in 1625 or 1626 (the actors mentioned are \\"Curtis\\" (probably Curtis Greville) and \\"T. Tucke\\", (Thomas Tuckfield), both of whom were with the King's Men for the 1625–1626 season only). The quarto text also claims the play had recently been performed at Blackfriars. However, the earliest known performance is in the form of William Davenant's adaptation The Rivals in 1664. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean/Fletcher text was in The Old Vic on 28 March 1928, directed by Andrew Leigh. :Additional information (attribution): attributed to Shakespeare and Fletcher by both the Stationers' Register entry and the 1634 quarto, there is also much internal evidence that the play was a collaboration between the two. Studies of vocabulary, metre, imagery, pause patterns, the treatment of sources as well as linguistic analysis and rare word tests all suggest the play had two distinct authors. Shakespeare is thought to have written Act 1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and most of Act 5 (except 5.4). :Evidence: the morris dance in 3.5 borrows from Francis Beaumont's The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, which was performed at court on 20 February 1613, probably by the King's Men. A terminus ante quem is fixed by Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair, first performed on 31 October 1614, which twice sarcastically refers to \\"Palemon\\"; Palamon is one of the protagonists in Noble Kinsmen. This establishes a date of composition sometime between February 1613 and October 1614. The argument has also been made that the play may have been commissioned specifically for the festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine in February 1613. At the time, the country was still in mourning for Prince Henry, who had died in November 1612. Henry was devoutly Protestant, a keen proponent of chivalry and was delighted with Elizabeth's choice of husband. Until his death, he was the main planner behind the wedding celebrations and it has been speculated that perhaps Beaumont's The Masque of the Inner Temple was written to cater to Henry's penchant for chivalry. Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Knight's Tale\\", upon which Two Noble Kinsmen is based, is a chivalric romance, and would have been especially fitting for a wedding organised by Henry.

It is the most consumed ale in Ireland. Smithwick's brewery was founded in Kilkenny in 1710 by John Smithwick and run by the Smithwick family of Kilkenny until 1965 when it was acquired by Guinness, now part of Diageo. The Kilkenny brewery was shut down in 2013 and production of all Smithwick's and Kilkenny branded beers moved to Dublin; parts of the old brewery are now a \\"visitor experience\\". History Smithwick's Brewery was founded by John Smithwick in 1710. The brewery is on the site of a Franciscan abbey, where monks had brewed ale since the 14th century, and ruins of the original abbey still remain on its grounds. The old brewery has since been renovated and now hosts \\"The Smithwick's Experience Kilkenny\\" visitor attraction and centre.Smithwick's Experience At the time of its closure, it was Ireland's oldest operating brewery. John Smithwick was an orphan who had settled in Kilkenny. Shortly after his arrival, Smithwick went into the brewing business with Richard Cole on a piece of land that Cole had leased from the Duke of Ormond in 1705. Five years later, John Smithwick became the owner of the land. The brewery stayed small, servicing a loyal local following while John Smithwick diversified. Following John Smithwick's death, the brewery temporarily fell out of family hands. John Smithwick's great-grandson, Edmond bought the brewery land back freehold and worked to reshape its future. Edmond concentrated on discovering new markets and successfully building export trade. Drinkers in England, Scotland and Wales developed a taste for Smithwick's brews and output increased fivefold. As a result of substantial contributions made to St Mary's Cathedral, Edmond became great friends with Irish liberal Daniel O'Connell, who later became godfather to one of his sons. Edmond Smithwick became well known and respected by the people of Kilkenny who elected him town mayor four times. In 1800, export sales began to fall and the brewing industry encountered difficulty. To combat this, the Smithwick family increased production in their maltings, began selling mineral water and delivered butter with the ale from the back of their drays. By 1900, output was at an all-time low and the then owner James Smithwick was advised by auditors to shut the doors of the brewery. Instead, James reduced the range of beers they produced and set out to find new markets. He secured military contracts and soon after saw output increase again. James' son, Walter, took control in 1930 and steered the brewery to success through the hardships of both World War II and increasingly challenging weather conditions.Smithwick's History By January 1950, Smithwick's was exporting ale to Boston. Smithwick's was purchased from Walter Smithwick in 1965 by Guinness and is now, along with Guinness, part of Diageo. Together, Guinness & Co. and Smithwick's developed and launched Smithwick's Draught Ale in 1966. By 1979, half a million barrels were sold each year. In 1980, Smithwick's began exporting to France. In 1993, Smithwick's Draught became Canada's leading imported ale. By 2010, Smithwick's continued to be brewed in Dundalk and Kilkenny with tankers sent to Dublin to be kegged for the on trade market. Cans and bottles were packaged by IBC in Belfast. Production in the Kilkenny brewery finished on 31 December 2013 and Smithwick's brands are now produced in the Diageo St.James's Gate brewery in Dublin. In 2017 Walter Smithwick's son, Paul, launched Sullivan's Ale with his son, Daniel, which has its home in Kilkenny. The original Kilkenny site was sold to Kilkenny County Council, with a small portion of the site dedicated to the opening of a visitor's centre, the \\"Smithwick's Experience Kilkenny\\".Diageo – Smithwicks Smithwick Family Walter and Eileen Smithwick had 6 children; Judge Peter Smithwick, Michael, Anne, Judy, Paul and John.

His eldest daughter Emma Smithwick is a well-known TV producer in London. His daughter Georgina is a technology entrepreneur, named by Sunday Times as Top 100 Innovators in Great Britain. Sullivan's Brewery In the Old Kilkenny Review, year unknown, Peter Smithwick, K.M., Solicitor, wrote that the tradition in Kilkenny is that Sullivan's Brewery was founded in 1702 by Daniel Sullivan, a Protestant, who bought property in trust for Pierse Bryan of Jenkinstown, a Catholic who was prohibited by the Penal Laws from buying land. The property, on the West side of High Street, \\"standing backwards in James's Street\\", is believed to have been the site of Sullivan's Brewery, the forerunner of Smithwicks.\\"The Sullivans of Kilkenny\\" Brands * Smithwick's Draught is an Irish red ale and as the style suggests, has a red tone. It is produced using hops and roasted, malted barley. In 2004, Diageo PLC began distribution in the USA. Smithwick's had previously been marketed in Canada. * Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale is similar to Smithwick's Draught; however, it has a creamy head similar to Guinness, and it has a stronger and more bitter taste than Smithwick's. The Kilkenny name was originally used during the '80s and '90s to market a stronger version of Smithwick's for the European and Canadian market due to local difficulty in pronunciation of the word \\"Smithwick's\\", but it now refers to a similar yet distinctly different beer. * Smithwick's Pale Ale was launched in 2011. The ale is made of pale ale malt, traditional Smithwick's yeast and Amarillo hops and has an ABV of 4.5%.

Carl Wilhelm Eugen Stenhammar (February 7, 1871 – November 20, 1927) was a Swedish composer, conductor and pianist. Biography Stenhammar was born in Stockholm, and was the brother of architect Ernst Stenhammar. He received his first musical education in Stockholm. He then went to Berlin to further his studies in music. He became a glowing admirer of German music, particularly that of Richard Wagner and Anton Bruckner. Stenhammar himself described the style of his First Symphony in F major as \\"idyllic Bruckner\\". He subsequently sought to emancipate himself and write in a more \\"Nordic\\" style, looking to Carl Nielsen and Jean Sibelius for guidance. The latter's Symphony No. 2, especially, had a great effect on him, leading him to change his style and withdraw his own First Symphony from performance. Having seen Sibelius's symphony performed in Stockholm, Stenhammar wrote to him: > You should know that you are in my thoughts daily ever since I heard the > symphony. You magnificent person, it is of course a huge armful of wonder > that you brought up out of the unconscious and ineffable depth. That which I > felt has been verified: You are in this moment for me as the foremost, the > only, the enigmatic one.... I have also just written a symphony. At least it > is called a symphony, and only in accordance with the understanding that you > perhaps have forgotten should it be dedicated to you. However, nothing came > of it. It is quite good, but somewhat superficial. I yearn to reach my inner > self. And you can wait until I have arrived there. The great day when this > happens, I will print your name in large letters on the title page. It may > become a symphony or something else. The result of his search for a new style was the Second Symphony in G minor, composed nearly twelve years after the First Symphony, which shows the influence of Nielsen, Sibelius and Franz Berwald among others. From 1906 to 1922 Stenhammar was Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony, the first full-time professional orchestra in Sweden. In this capacity, he organised many performances of music by contemporary Scandinavian composers. In 1909, he briefly held the position of director of music at Uppsala University, where he was succeeded the following year by Hugo Alfvén. Wilhelm Stenhammar died of a stroke at 56 years of age in Jonsered in the historic province of Västergötland. He is buried in Gothenburg. Work His works were quite varied and included two completed symphonies, a substantial Serenade for Orchestra, two piano concertos, four piano sonatas, a violin sonata, six string quartets, many songs and other vocal works, including several large-scale works for chorus or voices and orchestra: the early ballad Florez och Blanzeflor, Op. 3, written around 1891, Ithaka, Op. 21, from 1904, the cantatas Ett folk (A people) from 1905 and Sången (The song), Op. 44, from 1921. Writing in The Chamber Music Journal, R.H.R. Silvertrust notes that Stenhammar's six string quartets are the most important written between those of Johannes Brahms and Béla Bartók. Whether or not this is so, there is no denying that Stenhammar's quartets represent a very important development during the twenty-five years he was writing chamber music. Tonally, they range from the middle late Romantics to a style akin to mature Sibelius. Though not unknown by the Swedish chamber music public, his string quartets have been neglected elsewhere. In 2008 Musikaliska konstföreningen published the world premiere edition of his Allegro Brillante for piano quartet composed in 1891 and his Allegro non tanto for piano trio composed in 1895. Stenhammar was considered the finest Swedish pianist of his time. Pianists who venture into the realm of the string quartet often wind up writing compositions which sound as though they were composed at, and are perhaps better played on, the piano. That Stenhammar's works show no such trait is because for nearly half of his life, he worked intimately with the Aulin Quartet, the top Swedish string quartet of his day and one of the best then performing in Europe. In fact, he toured throughout Europe with them for many years and a piano quintet was nearly always featured on their programmes. Thus it is no accident that his quartets show a fine grasp of instrumental timbre and technique. The part writing is sure, always idiomatic and evenly distributed. Stenhammar recorded five piano rolls for Welte-Mignon on 21 September 1905. List of compositions  * Orchestral works ** Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, Op. 1 (1893) ** Excelsior!

The brand name is used by the Consumers' Association, a registered charity and company limited by guarantee that owns several businesses, including Which? Financial Services Limited (Which? Mortgage Advisers), Which? Legal Limited and Which? Limited, which publishes the Which? Papers. The vast majority of the association's income comes from the profit it makes on its trading businesses, for instance subscriptions to Which? magazine, which are donated to the campaigning part of the organisation to fund advocacy activity and inform the public about consumer issues. Which? magazine maintains its independence by not accepting advertising, and the organisation receives no government funding. The Consumers' Association is the largest consumer organisation in the UK, with over 573,000 subscribers to its magazine. Until 2006, the association used prize draws similar to those of Reader's Digest to attract subscribers, but following criticism they were discontinued. The Association now attracts subscribers to its publications with free mini-guides and trial offers. History and background The organisation was set up in 1957 as a response to the changing values and concerns of the post-war era, at a time of rapid changes in product markets and consumer behaviour – and a corresponding growth in sharp trading practices. To combat this, Michael Young, research director for the Labour Party, proposed setting up a 'Consumer Advisory Service' to be considered for the party's 1950 manifesto, only to be rejected by Harold Wilson. Encouraged by the efforts of Dorothy Bruchholz Goodman, of the United States, and Ray Goodman,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/756961468914425842/pdf/640280NEWS0Ban00Offical0Use0Only010.pdf Young continued to push the idea and in October 1957 the first Which? magazine was published from a converted garage in Bethnal Green.Which? magazine, October 2007, p. 3. Its central aim was to improve the standard of goods and services available to the public in the UK. Under the editorship of Eirlys Roberts, the publication started as a small 32-page magazine that included reports on electric kettles, sunglasses, aspirin, cake-mixes, scouring powders, no-iron cottons and British cars. By 1959, membership reached 150,000 and a membership services office in Hertford.50 years of Which? supplement. Which? magazine, October 2007 In 1960, Which? helped to found the International Organisation of Consumer Unions, later Consumers International. In 1962, coverage expanded with the launch of the first quarterly Which? car supplement, which becomes Motoring Which? in 1965, followed by Money Which? in 1968. In 1970, Which? bought a set of buildings in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, to set up labs to test products including domestic appliances, DIY equipment, and consumer electronics. Previously, the work had been contracted out. The 1970s saw Which? taking a greater campaigning role, and it began to adopt a more aggressive stance on issues such as lead poisoning and aircraft noise. In 1971, for example, Which? published the first league table on the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. The organisation also dabbled in high street consumer advice centres during the 1970s. More than 120 such centres were operating in 1977-8, many of them funded by local councils. The centres closed as funding was withdrawn by the government in 1980. Which? continued campaigning on consumer safety issues, with its car safety test results strengthening calls to legislate car manufacturers to fit seat belts in all new cars, helping to make it compulsory to Clunk Click Every Trip in 1983. In 1992, Which? launched another satellite publication, this one aimed at youngsters aged 11–15, called Check It Out!, but it failed to take off and closed in June 1994. In 1995 testing facilities were moved to Milton Keynes where they remained until 2002, when the majority of the Which? testing activities were contracted out. Which? Online, the first incarnation of the Which? website, was launched in 1996 which incorporated its own ISP, email and content in addition to the Which Online Forum - an area accessible to members which offered unfettered access to members of the senior management within Which? including the Directors. The trading organisation was rebranded as Which? in 2004 and this is the brand promoted to the general public. However the charity the Consumers' Association continues to own Which? Ltd and retains its own name. Following the deregulation of the gas and electricity industry, Which? launched a free online energy comparison service called Switch with Which? in 2005, to compare energy tariffs. The service was awarded Energywatch Confidence Code accreditation in 2006. In the 2010 Superbrands index, Which? ranked fifth in the \\"Media — Newspapers and Magazines\\" category and 256th overall. Product testing Which? carries out systematic testing of consumer products and financial services, the results of which are published in reports in Which? magazine and on the Which? website. Tests are carried out on goods, services, and suppliers. Testing covers reliability, performance, safety, energy efficiency and value-for-money, as relevant in different cases. Top- rated products are awarded the Which? 'Best Buy' status logo, an accreditation recognised by industry and consumers. Which? first used the phrase in its second magazine edition in 1958, to describe Boots 365 talcum powder. Conversely, the worst-performing products are labelled 'Don't Buys'. Which? awards The Which? Awards is an annual event to 'celebrate the UK's best products and services, from cars and restaurants to supermarkets and financial services'. Award winners are selected by Which? staff, based on test findings and feedback from Which? members throughout the year. Unusual test subjects As well as the usual household products, Which? has tested things such as: * Bird seed for budgerigars in 1959 * Contraceptives in 1963 * Paper dresses in 1967 * Pets in 1977Which? magazine, August 1977 Publications Most Which? publications are supplied only to subscribers, and are not on general sale. Which? magazine, started in 1957, is the organisation’s principal publication. The magazine reports on consumer issues of the day, publishes product testing results and findings of original research and investigations. The magazine also discusses trading which it believes goes against the interests of consumers. Examples of such discussions include an exposé into solar panel heating installation companies,Which? magazine, May 2010 an undercover enquiry with the RNID revealing serious problems at shops selling hearing aidsWhich? magazine, October 2010 and an investigation into electronics shop staffs' knowledge of the products that they sell.Which? magazine, February 2011 Other publications include Which? Travel, Which? Car, Which? Money, Which? Computing and Which? Gardening. Finances Consumers' Association financial history five years to 30 June 2012Consumers' Association financial history. www.charitycommission.gov.uk, 2014. Retrieved 25 February 2014. The Consumer's Association experienced sharply increased income up to 2014, and since then has shown steady figures. Policy, consultation and parliamentary lobbying Which? regularly briefs and lobbies MPs, Peers, AMs, MLAs, MSPs and MEPs on national, European and international consumer issues. For example, Which? successfully lobbied to put an end to the '65-day rule' that allowed energy companies to wait 65 days before informing their customers of a price change. Following the creation of the Scottish parliament in 1999, in January 2002 Which? established an office in Edinburgh. Which? also works with the European Consumers' Association (BEUC)BEUC, the European Consumers´ Organisation. which brings together over forty consumer organisations from across Europe to represent common consumer interests within the EU institutions. Legal powers Super-complaints The Consumers' Association has the power under The Enterprise Act 2002 to take action on behalf of consumers, including the ability to bring a super-complaint to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Which? is one of eight organisations able to issue a super-complaint. The Consumers' Association was among the first groups granted these new powers. A super- complaint can be made about any market that is not working properly for consumers. As consumers are not in the position to overcome the issue themselves, Which? can issue a super-complaint on consumers' behalf. The OFT has 90 days in which to assess the complaint and decide what to do about it. It can reject the complaint in part or as a whole, it can launch a market investigation, take action under competition law or consumer law, or refer the market to the Competition and Markets Authority for further investigation. Which? made its first super complaint about private dentistry in 2001. It later made complaints about care homes, the Northern Ireland banking sector and credit card interest calculation methods. In March 2011 it made a super complaint about unfair debit and credit card payment surcharges made by retailers. The OFT upheld the super-complaint in June 2011. In September 2016 Which? filed a super complaint against banks that routinely refuse to reimburse victims who have been scammed into transferring money into fraudsters’ accounts. Which? said banks should “shoulder more responsibility” for such fraud, much as they already reimburse customers who lose money through scams involving fraudulent account activity, or debit or credit cards. According to official industry data, such scams increased by 53% in a year: from 660,308 cases in the first half of 2015 to 1,007,094 in the first half of 2016. Which? said: “Consumers can only protect themselves so far. People cannot be expected to detect complex scams pressuring them to transfer money immediately, or lookalike bills from their solicitor or builder” that are copied from genuine bills but have had the bank account number and sort code changed. In 2018 Which? was accused by members of its long-standing email service - which.net - of abandoning them by abruptly announcing cancellation of a service they'd used for 22 years. One member stated “Even if this were a commercial company the way it’s been done is appalling, but for it to be a charity that professes to protect consumers - it's a travesty and a betrayal of those members who trusted Which? in a way no one would trust a commercial entity.\\" Legal action against rogue traders In 2005 Which? was granted legal powers to bring rogue traders to account for their actions under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Unfair contract terms Which? has statutory powers under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. Which? can seek an injunction to restrain the use of an unfair contract term by a trader against consumers. Competition Appeals Tribunal Which? is one of the 'specified bodies' who, under the Enterprise and Competition Acts, may bring proceedings before the Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) on behalf of two or more consumers for damages. Which? was granted specified body status on 1 October 2005 by the Ministers of the Department of Trade and Industry. In April 2007 Which? launched its first representative action on behalf of consumers unlawfully overcharged for football shirts due to price fixing. Organisational structure The Consumers’ Association owns an operational company Which? Ltd who report to the Council of Trustees. The Board of Which? Ltd is made up primarily of co-opted members, members of Which? staff and some representative[s] from the Consumers' Association Council. The Consumers' Association is subject to both the Companies Act 2006 and to charity requirements. Since 2012 it is governed by a Council of nine elected and up-to six co-opted members who can serve a maximum of 9 years at any one time. Only Ordinary members of the Consumers' Association can stand for the Council. Any subscriber can become a member of the Consumers' Association by agreeing to guarantee the debts of the Association to a maximum of 50p. It also means they will receive Annual Accounts, AGM Minutes, and be able to vote on Resolutions that change the governing Articles. None of the Council, or Board members is paid [other than the employees], although they are entitled to claim reasonable expenses. Tim Gardam became Chairman on 18 November 2015, replacing Patrick Barwise who had held the role since 2010.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, together with further waves of Portuguese colonization, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Austrians, Levantine Arabs (Syrians and Lebanese), Armenians, Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Greeks, Poles, Helvetians, Ukrainians and Russians settled in Brazil, playing an important role in its culture as it started to shape a multicultural and multiethnic society. As consequence of three centuries of colonization by the Portuguese empire, the core of Brazilian culture is derived from the culture of Portugal. The numerous Portuguese inheritances include the language, cuisine items such as rice and beans and feijoada, the predominant religion and the colonial architectural styles. These aspects, however, were influenced by African and Indigenous American traditions, as well as those from other Western European countries. Some aspects of Brazilian culture are contributions of Italian, Spaniard, German, Japanese and other European immigrants. Amerindian people and Africans played a large role in the formation of Brazilian language, cuisine, music, dance and religion. This diverse cultural background has helped show off many celebrations and festivals that have become known around the world, such as the Brazilian Carnival and the Bumba Meu Boi. The colourful culture creates an environment that makes Brazil a popular destination for many tourists each year, around over 1 million. History Portuguese, German, Italian, Arab, and Japanese respectively. Second row: African, (, and , respectively) and Indigenous (Amerindian) Brazilians. Brazil was a colony of Portugal for over three centuries. About a million Portuguese settlers arrived during this period and brought their culture to the colony. The Indigenous inhabitants of Brazil had much contact with the colonists. Many became extinct, others mixed with the Portuguese. For that reason, Brasil also holds Amerindian influences in its culture, mainly in its food and language. Brazilian Portuguese has hundreds of words of Indigenous American origin, mainly from the Old Tupi language. Black Africans, who were brought as slaves to Brazil, also participated actively in the formation of Brazilian culture. Although the Portuguese colonists forced their slaves to convert to Catholicism and speak Portuguese their cultural influences were absorbed by the inhabitants of Brazil of all races and origins. Some regions of Brazil, especially Bahia, have particularly notable African inheritances in music, cuisine, dance and language. Immigrants from Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary and the Middle East played an important role in the areas they settled (mostly Southern and Southeastern Brazil). They organized communities that became important cities such as Joinville, Caxias do Sul, Blumenau, Curitiba and brought important contributions to the culture of Brazil. Modernism in Brazil started with the Modern Art Week held in São Paulo in 1922 and was characterized by experimentation and interest in Brazilian society and culture, as well as rebellion against influence from Europe and the United States and the orthodoxy of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Tarsila do Amaral and Oswald de Andrade were among the catalysts of the movement in Brazil, with works such as Manifesto Pau-Brasil, Abaporu, and Manifesto Antropófago. In the 1930s, sociologists such as Gilberto Freyre and Sérgio Buarque de Holanda published ideas about Brazilian culture, society, and identity, presenting concepts such as \\"racial democracy\\" and the \\".\\" Another important 20th century cultural movement was Tropicália or Tropicalismo, a movement against the repression of different forms of authorianism, including the Military dictatorship in Brazil and the Catholic Church. Part of the counterculture of the 1960s, Tropicalismo was led by figures such as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso and manifested itself primarily in music. Language Museum of the Portuguese Language in São Paulo The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. It is spoken by about 99% of the population, making it one of the strongest elements of national identity. There are only some Amerindian groups and small pockets of immigrants who do not speak Portuguese. Similarly to American English and Canadian French, Brazilian Portuguese is more phonetically conservative or archaic than the language of the colonizing metropolis, maintaining several features that European Portuguese had before the 19th century.Noll, Volker, \\"Das Brasilianische Portugiesisch\\", 1999. Also similarly to the American English, the Brazilian regional variation as well as the European one include a small number of words of Indigenous American and African origin, mainly restricted to place names and fauna and flora. Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. There are significant communities of German (mostly the Hunsrückisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian dialect, of Venetian origin) speakers in the south of the country, both of which are influenced by the Portuguese language. Not to mention the Slavic communities, Ukrainians and Poles which are also part of these minority languages. The Brazilian Sign Language (not signed Portuguese – it likely is descended from the French Sign Language), known by the acronym , is officially recognized by law, albeit using it alone would convey a very limited degree of accessibility, throughout the country. Religion About 2/3 of the population are Roman Catholics. Catholicism was introduced and spread largely by the Portuguese Jesuits, who arrived in 1549 during the colonization with the mission of converting the Indigenous people. The Society of Jesus played a large role in the formation of Brazilian religious identity until their expulsion of the country by the Marquis of Pombal in the 18th century. In recent decades Brazilian society has witnessed a rise in Protestantism. Between 1940 and 2010, the percentage of Roman Catholics fell from 95% to 64.6%, while the various Protestant denominations rose from 2.6% to 22.2%. Carnaval The world-famous Rio Carnival. The Brazilian Carnaval is an annual festival held forty-six days before Easter. Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the pagan festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to practice repentance and prepare for Christ's death and resurrection. Carnaval is the most famous holiday in Brazil and has become an event of huge proportions. For almost a week festivities are intense, day and night, mainly in coastal cities. The typical genres of music of Brazilian carnival are: samba-enredo and marchinha (in Rio de Janeiro and Southeast Region), frevo, maracatu and Axé music (in Pernambuco, Bahia and Northeast Region) Cuisine (Gastronomy) The national dish of Brazil, feijoada, contains black beans cooked with pork, and other meats. Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region. This diversity reflects the country's history and mix of indigenous and immigrant cultures. This has created a national cooking style, marked by the preservation of regional differences. Since the imperial period, \\"As origens da Feijoada: O mais brasileiro dos sabores \\", by João Luís de Almeida Machado. Visited on November 8, 2009. the feijoada, a Portuguese stew with origins in Ancient Rome, has been the country's national dish. Luís da Câmara Cascudo wrote that, having been revised and adapted in each region of the country, it is no longer just a dish, but has become a complete food.CASCUDO, Luís da Câmara. História da Alimentação no Brasil – 2 vols. 2ª ed. Itatitaia, Rio de Janeiro, 1983. Brigadeiro is a very popular candy in Brazilian birthday parties. Brazil has a variety of candies including brigadeiros and beijinhos. Other snack foods include coxinhas, churrasco, sfiha, empanadas, and pine nuts (in Festa Junina). Pão de queijo are typical in the state of Minas Gerais. Typical northern foods include pato no tucupi, tacacá, caruru, vatapá, and maniçoba. The Northeast is known for moqueca (a stew of seafood and palm oil), acarajé (a fritter made with white beans, onion and fried in palm oil (dendê), which is filled with dried shrimp and red pepper), caruru, and Quibebe. In the Southeast, it is common to eat Minas cheese, pizza, tutu, polenta, macaroni, lasagna, and gnocchi. Churrasco is the typical meal of Rio Grande do Sul. Cachaça is Brazil's native liquor, distilled from sugar cane, and it is the main ingredient in the national drink, the caipirinha. Brazil is the world leader in production of green coffee (café). In 2018, 28% of the coffee consumed globally came from Brazil. Because of Brazil's fertile soil, the country has been a major producer of coffee since the times of Brazilian slavery,\\"Sabor do Café/História do café \\".

When Brazil became a colony of Portugal, there was the \\"Jesuit Literature\\", whose main name was father António Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit who became one of the most celebrated Baroque writers of the Portuguese language. A few more explicitly literary examples survive from this period, José Basílio da Gama's epic poem celebrating the conquest of the Missions by the Portuguese, and the work of Gregório de Matos Guerra, who produced a sizable amount of satirical, religious, and secular poetry. Neoclassicism was widespread in Brazil during the mid-18th century, following the Italian style. Brazil produced significant works in Romanticism – novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and José de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated Indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels O Guarany, Iracema, Ubirajara.\\"Brazilian Literature: An Introduction \\". Embassy of Brasil – Ottawa.

The Baroque in Brazil flourished in Bahia and Pernambuco and Minas Gerais, generating valuable artists like Manuel da Costa Ataíde and especially the sculptor-architect Aleijadinho. In 1816, the French Artistic Mission in Brazil created the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and imposed a new concept of artistic education and was the basis for a revolution in Brazilian painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, and crafts.CONDURU, Roberto.

It must be said that in Brazil Romanticism in painting took a peculiar shape, not showing the overwhelming dramaticism, fantasy, violence, or interest in death and the bizarre commonly seen in the European version, and because of its academic and palatial nature all excesses were eschewed.BISCARDI, Afrânio & ROCHA, Frederico Almeida.

Important modern artists Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral were both early pioneers in modern art in the country, and are amongst the better known figures of the Anthropophagic Movement, whose goal was to \\"swallow\\" modernity from Europe and the US and \\"digest\\" it into a genuinely Brazilian modernity. Both participated of The Week of Modern Art festival, held in São Paulo in 1922, that renewed the artistic and cultural environment of the city and also presented artists such as Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Victor Brecheret. Based on Brazilian folklore, many artists have committed themselves to mix it with the proposals of the European Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. From Surrealism, arises Ismael Nery, concerned with metaphysical subjects where their pictures appear on imaginary scenarios and averse to any recognizable reference. \\"Ismael Nery: Critical Commentary \\".

In the next generation, the modernist ideas of the Week of Modern Art have affected a moderate modernism that could enjoy the freedom of the strict academic agenda, with more features conventional method, best exemplified by the artist Candido Portinari, which was the official artist of the government in mid-century. In recent years, names such as Oscar Araripe, Beatriz Milhazes and Romero Britto have been well acclaimed. Architecture The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge in Brasília, by Alexandre Chan and Mário Vila Verde Brazilian architecture in the colonial period was heavily influenced by the Portuguese Manueline style, albeit adapted for the tropical climate. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city of Ouro Preto in the state of Minas Gerais contains numerous well-preserved examples of this style by artists such as Aleijadinho. In later centuries, Brazilian architects were increasingly influenced by schools from other countries such as France and the United States, eventually developing a style of their own that has become known around the world. Architects such as Oscar Niemeyer have received much acclaim, with the Brazilian capital Brasília being the most notable example of modern Brazilian architecture. Niemeyer received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1988, and in 2006 the prize was awarded to Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. In recent decades, Brazilian landscape architecture has also attracted some attention, particularly in the person of Roberto Burle Marx. Some of this notable works are the Copacabana promenade in Rio de Janeiro and the Ibirapuera Park in São Paulo.

Cordel literature is a literary genre very popular in the Northeast of Brazil; according to the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade, it is one of the purest manifestations of the inventive spirit, the sense of humour and the critical capacity of Brazilians from the interior and of the humblest backgrounds. Cinema and theater  Cinema  Gramado Film Festival.

Acclaimed Brazilian filmmakers include Glauber Rocha, Fernando Meirelles, José Padilha, Anselmo Duarte, Walter Salles, Eduardo Coutinho and Alberto Cavalcanti.  Theater  Theater was introduced by the Jesuits during the colonization, particularly by Father Joseph of Anchieta, but did not attract much interest until the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808. Over the course of the 18th century, theatre evolved alongside the blossoming literature traditions with names such as Martins Pena and Gonçalves Dias. Pena introduced the comedy of manners, which would become a distinct mark of Brazilian theatre over the next decades. Theatre was not included in the 1922 Modern Art Week of São Paulo, which marked the beginning of Brazilian Modernism. Instead, in the following decade, Oswald de Andrade wrote O Rei da Vela, which would become the manifesto of the Tropicalismo movement in the 1960s, a time where many playwrights used theatre as a means of opposing the Brazilian military government such as Gianfrancesco Guarnieri, Augusto Boal, Dias Gomes, Oduvaldo Vianna Filho and Plínio Marcos. With the return of democracy and the end of censorship in the 1980s, theatre would again grow in themes and styles. Contemporary names include Gerald Thomas, Ulysses Cruz, Aderbal Freire-Filho, Eduardo Tolentinho de Araújo, Cacá Rosset, Gabriel Villela, Márcio Vianna, Moacyr Góes and Antônio Araújo. Music Singer and actress Carmen Miranda popularized samba worldwide. Music is one of the most instantly recognizable elements of Brazilian culture. Many different genres and styles have emerged in Brazil, such as samba, choro, bossa nova, MPB, frevo, forró, maracatu, sertanejo, brega and axé. Samba Samba is among the most popular music genres in Brazil and is widely regarded as the country's national musical style. It developed from the mixture of European and African music, brought by slaves in the colonial period and originated in the state of Bahia. In the early 20th century, modern samba emerged and was popularized in Rio de Janeiro behind composers such as Noel Rosa, Cartola and Nelson Cavaquinho among others. The movement later spread and gained notoriety in other regions, particularly in Bahia and São Paulo. Contemporary artists include Martinho da Vila, Zeca Pagodinho and Paulinho da Viola. Samba makes use of a distinct set of instruments, among the most notable are the cuíca, a friction drum that creates a high-pitched squeaky sound, the cavaquinho, a small instrument of the guitar family, and the pandeiro, a hand frame drum. Other instruments are the surdos, agogôs, chocalhos and tamborins. Choro Choro originated in the 19th century through interpretations of European genres such as polka and schottische by Brazilian artists who had already been influenced by African rhythms such as the batuque. It is a largely instrumental genre that shares a number of characteristics with samba. Choro gained popularity around the start of the 20th century (1880-1920) and was the genre of many of the first Brazilian records in the first decades of the 20th century. Notable Choro musicians of that era include Chiquinha Gonzaga, Pixinguinha and Joaquim Callado. The popularity of choro steadily waned after the popularization of samba but saw a revival in recent decades and remains appreciated by a large number of Brazilians. There are a number of acclaimed Choro artists nowadays such as Altamiro Carrilho, Yamandu Costa and Paulo Bellinati. Bossa nova and MPB Bossa nova is a style of Brazilian music that originated in the late 1950s. It has its roots on samba but features less percussion, employing instead a distinctive and percussive guitar pattern. Bossa nova gained mainstream popularity in Brazil in 1958 with the song Chega de Saudade, written by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes. Together with João Gilberto, Jobim and Moraes would become the driving force of the genre, which gained worldwide popularity with the song \\"Garota de Ipanema\\" as interpreted by Gilberto, his wife Astrud and Stan Getz on the album Getz/Gilberto. The bossa nova genre remains popular in Brazil, particularly among the upper classes and in the Southeast. Caetano Veloso, an icon of Tropicália and (MPB). MPB (acronym for Música popular brasileira, or Brazilian Popular Music) was a trend in Brazilian music that emerged after the bossa nova boom. It presents many variations and includes elements of styles that range from Samba to Rock music. In the 1960s some MPB artists founded the short-lived but highly influential tropicália movement, which attracted international attention. Among those were Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé, Nara Leão, Ney Matogrosso and Os Mutantes. Sertanejo Sertanejo is the most popular genre in Brazilian mainstream media since the 1990s. It evolved from música caipira over the course of the 20th century, a style of music that originated in Brazilian countryside and that made use of the viola caipira, although it presents nowadays a heavy influence from American country music but resembles in many ways including writing style with Pimba Music of Portugal. Beginning in the 1980s, Brazil saw an intense massification of the sertanejo genre in mainstream media and an increased interest by the phonographic industry. As a result, sertanejo is today the most popular music genre in Brazil in terms of radio play. Common instruments in contemporary sertanejo are the acoustic guitar, which often replaces the viola, the accordion and the harmonica, as well as electric guitar, bass and drums. Traditional acts include Chitãozinho & Xororó, Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano, Leonardo and Daniel. Newer artists such as Michel Teló, Luan Santana, Gusttavo Lima have also become very popular recently among younger audiences. Forró and frevo Forró and Frevo are two music and dance forms originated in the Brazilian Northeast. Forró, like Choro, originated from European folk genres such as the schottische in between the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remains a very popular music style, particularly in the Northeast region, and is danced in forrobodós (parties and balls) throughout the country. Frevo originated in Recife, Pernambuco during the Carnival, the period it is most often associated with. While the music presents elements of procession and martial marches, the frevo dance (known as \\"passo\\") has been notably influenced by capoeira. Frevo parades are a key tradition of the Pernambuco Carnival. Classical music The modernist composer Heitor Villa-Lobos with the soprano Bidu Sayão in 1945. Brazil has also a tradition in the classical music, since the 18th Century. The oldest composer with the full documented work is José Maurício Nunes Garcia, a Catholic priest who wrote numerous pieces, both sacred and secular, with a style resembling the classical viennese style from Mozart and Haydn. In the 19th Century, the composer Antonio Carlos Gomes wrote several operas with Brazilian indigenous themes, with librettos in Italian, some of which premiered in Milan; two of the works are the operas Il Guarany and Lo Schiavo (The Slave). In the 20th Century, Brazil had a strong modernist and nationalist movement, with the works of internationally renowned composers like Heitor Villa-Lobos, Camargo Guarnieri, César Guerra-Peixe and Cláudio Santoro, and more recently Marlos Nobre and Osvaldo Lacerda. Many famous performers are also from Brazil, such as the opera singer Bidu Sayão, the pianist Nelson Freire and the former pianist and now conductor João Carlos Martins. The city of São Paulo hosts the Sala São Paulo, home of the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra (OSESP), one of the most outstanding concert halls of the world. Also the city of Campos do Jordão hosts yearly in June the Classical Winter Festival, with performances of many instrumentists and singers from all the world. Other genres Many other genres have originated in Brazil, specially in recent years. Some of the most notable are: *The mangue beat movement, originated in Recife and founded by the late Chico Science and Nação Zumbi. The music fuses elements of maracatu, frevo, funk rock and hip hop. *Axé is a very popular genre, particularly in the state of Bahia. It is a fusion of Afro-Caribbean rhythms and is strongly associated with the Salvador Carnival. *Maracatu is another genre originated in the state of Pernambuco. It evolved from traditions passed by generations of African slaves and features large percussive groups and choirs. *Brega which literally means 'Tacky' is a hard to define music style from the state of Pará, usually characterized as influenced by Caribbean rhythms and containing simple rhymes, arrangements and a strong sentimental appeal. It has spawned subgenres such as tecno brega, which has attracted worldwide interest for achieving high popularity without significant support from the phonographic industry.

It was introduced in 1950 by Assis Chateaubriand and remains the country's most important element of mass media. Telenovelas are a marking feature in Brazilian television, usually being broadcast in prime time on most major television networks. Telenovelas are similar in concept to soap operas in English- speaking countries but differ from them in duration, telenovelas being significantly shorter (usually about 100 to 200 episodes). They are widely watched throughout the country, to the point that they have been described as a significant element in national identity and unity, and have been exported to over 120 countries. Folklore Brazilian folklore includes many stories, legends, dances, superstitions and religious rituals. Characters include the Boitatá, the Boto Cor-de-Rosa, the Saci and the Bumba Meu Boi, which has spawned the famous June festival in Northern and Northeastern Brazil.  Social Media  Social media in Brazil is the use of social networking applications in this South American nation. This is due to economic growth and the increasing availability of computers and smartphones. Brazil is the world's second-largest user of Twitter (at 41.2 million tweeters), and largest market for YouTube outside the United States.Joia, Luiz Antonio. \\"Social Media and the ‘20 Cents Movement’ in Brazil: What Lessons Can Be Learnt from This?\\" Information Technology for Development, vol. 22, no. 3, July 2016, pp. 422–435.

In 2013, Brazil ranked the second highest number of Facebook users globally at 65 million. During this period, social media users in Brazil spent on average 9.7 hours a month online. Sports Maracanã Stadium, at the Brazilian Championship, highest division of Brazilian football. Football is the most popular sport in Brazil. Many Brazilian players such as Pelé, Ronaldo, Kaká, Ronaldinho, and Neymar are among the most well known players in the sport. The Brazil national football team (Seleção) is currently among the best in the world, according to the FIFA World Rankings. They have been victorious in the FIFA World Cup a record 5 times, in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002. Basketball, volleyball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. Tennis, handball, swimming, and gymnastics have found a growing sporting number of enthusiasts over the last decade. Some sport variations have their origins in Brazil. Beach football, futsal (official version of indoor football), and footvolley emerged in the country as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians have developed capoeira, vale tudo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In auto racing, Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One World Championship 8 times: Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972 and 1974; Nelson Piquet in 1981, 1983, and 1987; and Ayrton Senna in 1988, 1990, and 1991. Brazil has undertaken the organization of large-scale sporting events: the country organized and hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup event. The circuit located in São Paulo, called Autódromo José Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil. São Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007. Brazil also tried for the 4th time to host the Summer Olympics with Rio de Janeiro candidature in 2016. On October 2, 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was the first held in South America.The Guardian, October 2, 2009, Olympics 2016: Tearful Pele and weeping Lula greet historic win for Rio Family and social class As a society with strong traditional values, the family in Brazil is usually represented by the couple and their children. Extended family is also an important aspect with strong ties being often maintained. Accompanying a world trend, the structure of the Brazilian family has seen major changes over the past few decades with the reduction of average size and increase in single-parent, dual-worker and remarried families. The family structure has become less patriarchal and women are more independent, although gender disparity is still evident in wage difference. Brazil inherited a highly traditional and stratified class structure from its colonial period with deep inequality. In recent decades, the emergence of a large middle class has contributed to increase social mobility and alleviate income disparity, but the situation remains grave. Brazil ranks 54th among world countries by Gini index. According to the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, \\"The body is a key aspect of sociability in Brazilian society because it communicates a person's social standing. Those with the resources and time to become beautiful will undoubtedly do so. Members of the upper-middle class use the phrase 'gente bonita' or 'beautiful people' as a euphemism for the people with whom they consider it appropriate to associate oneself with. An up-and-coming locale, for instance, is not valued by its price of admission or its fare, but rather by the amount of 'gente bonita' who frequent it. The imbrication of race and class in Brazil produces this upper-middle class as normatively white, excluding a majority of the Brazilian population from beauty. Afro-textured hair is portrayed as 'bad hair', and a nose considered wider and non-European is also described as a 'poor person's nose'. The physical features that are aesthetically undesirable mark certain bodies as inferior in the relatively rigid Brazilian social pyramid, undeserving of social recognition and full citizenship within the nation... Since the body is considered to be infinitely malleable, a person who climbs the social ladder is expected to transform their body to conform to upper-middle class standards. The working class is willing to spend on beauty not as a form of conspicuous consumption, but rather because it perceives beauty as an essential requirement for social inclusion.\\" Social Customs In Brazilian culture, living in a community is vital due to the fact Brazilians are very involved with one another. “Brazilians organize their lives around and about others, maintain a high level of social involvement, and consider personal relations of primary importance in all human interactions. In fact, being with others is so important that they are rarely alone and perceive the desire to be alone as a sign of depression or unhappiness.” Due to the fact Brazilians are highly involved with social life, many friends, family members, or business partners join together to associate. Although friend and family relationships have a large impact on Brazilian culture, business relationships are also crucial. “As Brazilians depend heavily on relationships with others, it is essential to spend time getting to know, both personally and professionally, your Brazilian counterparts. One of the most important elements in Brazilian business culture is personal relationships.” Brazilians maintain a comfortable business atmosphere by being respectful and using the correct greeting. Upon greeting, Brazilians often express themselves physically. Women usually kiss the other individual on both cheeks and men usually give a pat on the back. Friendly gestures are used to greet one another. It is common for them to refer to the individual's social standing and then their first name when engaging in conversation. When Brazilians speak with an individual older than them, they address them as “senhor” (Mister) or “senhora” (Miss), accompanied by the individual's first name. In Brazil, the general rule is to use a formal greeting when communicating with people who are unfamiliar or older. Beauty According to the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, \\"Beauty is constantly lived, breathed and incorporated as a social category in southeastern Brazil. The talk of beauty is pervasive in all kinds of media, from television to song lyrics, and it is a daily concern of people of all incomes and backgrounds. Remarking about a person's appearance is not only socially permissible, it is equivalent to inquiring about that person's health and showing concern for them. If a person does not look his or her best, then many Brazilians assume the person must be sick or going through emotional distress.\\" Vanity does not carry a negative connotation, as it does in many other places. The average weight of a Brazilian woman is 62 kilos (137 lbs), as opposed to 75 kilos (166 lbs) in the United States and 68 kilos (152 lbs) in the United Kingdom. Brazil has more plastic surgeons per capita than anywhere else in the world. In 2001, there were 350,000 cosmetic surgery operations in a population of 170 million. This is an impressive number for a nation where sixty percent of the working population earns less than 150 U.S. dollars per month. In 2007 alone, Brazilians spent US$22 billion on hygiene and cosmetic products making the country the third largest consumer of cosmetic products in the world. 95% of Brazilian women want to change their bodies and the majority will seriously consider going under the knife. The pursuit of beauty is so high on the agenda for Brazilian women that new research shows they spend 11 times more of their annual income on beauty products (compared to UK and US women). Brazil has recently emerged as one of the leading global destinations for medical tourism. Brazilians are no strangers to cosmetic surgery, undergoing hundreds of thousands of procedures a year, by all socio-economic levels as well. The general attitude in Brazil toward cosmetic surgery borders on reverence. Expressions such as \\"the power of the scalpels,\\" \\"the magic of cosmetic surgeries,\\" and the \\"march toward scientific progress\\" are seen and heard everywhere. Whereas cosmetic surgery in the U.S. or Europe is still seen as a private matter, and one that is slightly embarrassing or at least socially awkward, in Brazil surgeries are very public matters. To have plastic surgery is to show that you have the money to afford it. In Brazil, modifying one's body through surgery is about more than just becoming more beautiful and desirable. It is even about more than showing that you care about yourself, which is a phrase in the Brazilian mass media. Surgical transformations are naturalized as necessary enhancements. Instead, modifying your body in Brazil is fundamentally about displaying your wealth. But since much is associated with race, changing one's body is also about approximating whiteness. An April 2013 article in The Economist noted that \\"[looking white] still codes for health, wealth and status. Light-skinned women strut São Paulo's upmarket shopping malls in designer clothes; dark-skinned maids in uniform walk behind with the bags and babies. Black and mixed-race Brazilians earn three-fifths as much as white ones. They are twice as likely to be illiterate or in prison, and less than half as likely to go to university. ... The unthinking prejudice expressed in common phrases such as 'good appearance' (meaning pale-skinned) and 'good hair' (not frizzy) means many light-skinned Brazilians have long preferred to think of themselves as 'white', whatever their parentage.\\" There are marking differences between perceptions of beauty among working-class patients in public hospitals, and upper-middle class patients in private clinics. Plastic surgery is conceptualized by the upper-middle class mainly as an act of consumption that fosters distinction and reinforces the value of whiteness. In contrast, working-class patients describe plastic surgery as a basic necessity that provides the \\"good appearance\\" needed in the job market and \\"repairs\\" their bodies from the wear of their physical labor as workers and as mothers. Patients from different walks of life desire plastic surgery for different reasons. The idea that physical appearance can denote class, with the implication that modifications in one's physical appearance can be seen as markers of social status extends throughout Brazil. Put within a context of explicit social inequality, the link between the production of beauty and social class becomes quite evident. Brazilians place a heavy importance in beauty aesthetics; a study in 2007 revealed that 87% of all Brazilians seek to look stylish at all times, opposed to the global average of 47%. The body is understood in southeastern Brazil as having a crucial aesthetic value, a value that is never fixed but can be accrued through discipline and medical intervention. This 'investment' on the body is nearly always equated with health, because a person's well being is assumed to be visible on the surface of their body. One of the most common (and harshest) expressions about beauty in Brazil is \\"there are really no ugly people, there are only poor people.\\" Holidays {  ! Date !! English name !! Portuguese name !!

Biography Esenç was raised by his Ubykh-speaking grandparents for a time in the village of Hacı Osman in Turkey, and he served a term as the muhtar (mayor) of that village, before receiving a post in the civil service of Istanbul. There, he was able to do a great deal of work with the French linguist Georges Dumézil and his associate Georges Charachidzé to help record his language.Tevfik Esenç's page in Circassian World Not all the writings of Charachidzé (1930-2010) have been published. Others who met Esenç and produced work on Ubykh are: the Norwegian Hans Vogt (1911–92) (see his ‘Dictionnaire de la Langue Oubykh’, 1963, Universitetsvorlaget); the British George Hewitt, who in 1974 visited Hacı Osman Köyü and made recordings with Esenç in Istanbul (the recordings are available on the Net; his account of his meetings in 1974 has been published — ‘Encounterng Ubykh(s)’, in Arxeologija i ètnografija pontijsko-kavkazskogo regiona 5, 195-204, 2016: Krasnodar; see also his ‘The labialised sibilants of Ubykh (North West Caucasian)’, in Revue des Etudes Géorgiennes et Caucasiennes, 2, 1986, 21-30); the Abkhazian Viacheslav Chirikba, who has written on Ubykh settlements and Ubykh surnames; the Turkish A. Sumru Özsoy. Having an excellent memory and understanding quickly the goals of Dumézil and the other linguists who came to visit him, he was the primary source of not only the Ubykh language, but also of the mythology, culture and customs of the Ubykh people. He spoke not only Ubykh, but also the Hakuchi dialect of Adyghe, allowing some comparative work to be done between these two members of the Northwest Caucasian family. He was also a fluent speaker of Turkish. He was a purist, and his idiolect of Ubykh was considered by Dumézil as the closest thing to a standard \\"literary\\" Ubykh language that existed. He is perhaps single-handedly responsible for the world's current knowledge of Ubykh being much more extensive and detailed than it would otherwise be. Esenç died in 1992 at the age of 88. The inscription that he wanted on his gravestone read as follows: In 1994, A. Sumru Özsoy organized an international conference, namely Conference on Northwest Caucasian Linguistics, at Boğaziçi University in memory of Dumézil and Esenç.

The exact location of the battle is a matter of debate. Historians have long questioned some details of Tacitus's account of the fight, suggesting that he exaggerated Roman success.  Context  According to Tacitus, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, who was the Roman governor and Tacitus's father-in-law, had sent his fleet ahead to panic the Caledonians, and, with light infantry reinforced with British auxiliaries, reached the site, which he found occupied by the enemy. Even though the Romans were outnumbered in their campaign against the tribes of Britain, they often had difficulties in getting their foes to face them in open battle. The Caledonii were the last unconquered British tribe (and were never fully subdued). After many years of avoiding the fight, the Caledonians were forced to join battle when the Romans marched on the main granaries of the Caledonians, just as they had been filled from the harvest. The Caledonians had no choice but to fight, or starve over the next winter. Battle details According to Tacitus, 8,000 allied auxiliary infantry formed the center, while 3,000 cavalry were on the flanks, with the Roman legionaries as a reserve in front of their camp.Duncan B. Campbell, Mons Graupius AD 83, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2010 Estimates for the size of the Roman army range from 17,000 to 30,000;Edwards, Kevin J; Ian Ralston Scotland After the Ice Age Polygon 24 Jan 2003 p.204 A temporary camp at Durno (20m or 32km NW of Aberdeen) covered 144 acres (60ha) and could have held 24000 men. Roger J.A.Wilson \\"A Guide to the Roman Remains in Britain\\" 2002 Constable, London although Tacitus says that 11,000 auxiliaries were engaged, along with a further four squadrons of cavalry, the number of legionaries in reserve is uncertain. The Caledonian army, which Tacitus claims was led by Calgacus (Tacitus only mentions him as giving a speech, probably fictitious),Braund, David Ruling Roman Britain: Kings, Queens, Governors and Emperors from Julius Caesar to Agricola Routledge; 1 edition (5 Sep 1996) pp.8, 169Woolliscroft, D. J.; Hoffman, B. Rome's First Frontier; the Flavian Occupation of Northern Scotland Tempus (June 1, 2006) p.217 was said to be over 30,000 strong. It was stationed mostly on higher ground; its front ranks were on the level ground, but the other ranks rose in tiers, up the slope of the hill in a horseshoe formation. The Caledonian chariotry charged about on the level plain between the two armies. After a brief exchange of missiles, Agricola ordered auxiliaries to launch a frontal attack on the enemy. These were based around four cohorts of Batavians and two cohorts of Tungrian swordsmen. The Caledonians were cut down and trampled on the lower slopes of the hill. Those at the top attempted an outflanking movement, but were themselves outflanked by Roman cavalry. The Caledonians were then comprehensively routed and fled for the shelter of nearby woodland, but were relentlessly pursued by well- organised Roman units. It is said that the Roman Legions took no part in the battle, being held in reserve throughout. According to Tacitus, 10,000 Caledonian lives were lost at a cost of only 360 auxiliary troops. 20,000 Caledonians retreated into the woods, where they fared considerably better against pursuing forces. Roman scouts were unable to locate the remaining Caledonian forces the next morning. Criticisms of Tacitus's account The decisive victory reported by Tacitus was criticized by some historians, however, who believe an engagement of some description did not occur. One author has suggested that the emperor Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory.Henig, Martin (September 1998) \\"Togidubnus and the Roman liberation\\" British Archaeology 37. Retrieved 27 July 2008.Now refuted by Duncan B. Campbell, Mons Graupius AD 83, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2010. Despite these claims, Agricola was awarded triumphal honours and was offered another governorship in a different part of the empire, so it would seem unlikely Domitian doubted he had achieved substantial successes. Suggestions that he invented the entire episode and was thereafter shunned by the emperor do not seem likely, given that he was awarded honours on his return. Aftermath Following this final battle, it was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. Soon after Agricola was recalled to Rome, and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. It is likely that Rome intended to continue the conflict but that military requirements elsewhere in the empire necessitated a troop withdrawal and the opportunity was lost. Tacitus' statement on his account of the Roman history between 68 AD and 98 AD: Perdomita Britannia et statim missa (Britain was completely conquered and immediately let go), denotes his bitter disapproval of Domitian's failure to unify the whole island under Roman rule after Agricola's successful campaign.Sunderland Frere, Sheppard (1987). Britannia: a history of Roman Britain. Routledge, p. 102. Battle location Considerable debate and analysis has been conducted regarding the battle location, with the locus of most of these sites spanning Perthshire to north of the River Dee, all in the northeast of Scotland.On the battle's location, see Duncan B. Campbell, \\"Search for a lost battlefield\\", Ancient Warfare Vol. 8 issue 1 (2014), pp. 47-51. A number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the Grampian Mounth within sight of the North Sea. In particular, Roy,William Roy, The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain, 1793 Surenne,Gabriel Jacques Surenne, 1823 Correspondence to Sir Walter Scott Watt,Archibald Watt, Highways and byways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Soc., Scotland HoganC. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham. and others have advanced notions that the high ground of the battle may have been Kempstone Hill, Megray Hill or other knolls near the Raedykes Roman Camp. These sites in Aberdeenshire fit the historical descriptions of Tacitus and have also yielded archaeological finds related to Roman presence. In addition these points of high ground are proximate to the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres. Bennachie in Aberdeenshire, the Gask Ridge not far from Perth and Sutherland have also been suggested.Duncan B.

He served in the Cabinet from 2003 to 2010, under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and was Shadow Foreign Secretary from May 2015 to June 2016. In October 2016, he was elected as the inaugural Chairman of the new Exiting the European Union Select Committee. Born in Hammersmith, he is the second son of veteran Labour MP Tony Benn and educationalist Caroline Benn. He studied Russian and East European Studies at the University of Sussex and went on to work as a policy researcher for two trade unions, ASTMS and MSF. Benn was elected as a councillor on Ealing Borough Council in 1979 and was Deputy Leader of the Council from 1986 to 1990. He was also the unsuccessful Labour parliamentary candidate for the Ealing North constituency at both the 1983 and 1987 general elections. After the 1997 general election, Benn was appointed as a special adviser to David Blunkett before winning a by- election in Leeds Central in 1999. Benn served as a Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for International Development from 2001 to 2002 and for Prisons and Probations from 2002 to 2003. He returned to DFID as Minister of State in May 2003. In October 2003, he was appointed to Tony Blair's Cabinet as the Secretary of State for International Development. In 2007, Benn was a candidate for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, which he lost to Harriet Harman. Benn later served under Gordon Brown as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2007 to 2010. After Labour's defeat at the 2010 general election, Benn served in Ed Miliband's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Environment Secretary in 2010 and Shadow Leader of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2011. He then served as Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government from 2011 to 2015. After the 2015 general election, Benn was appointed as Shadow Foreign Secretary, retaining this role after Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour Leader. After criticising Corbyn's leadership and phoning other Labour MPs to seek to remove Corbyn as leader, he was dismissed from this position by Corbyn on 26 June 2016, precipitating a number of shadow cabinet resignations. Benn was later elected Chairman of the Brexit Select Committee. He sought to extend Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond the October 31st deadline through passing the Benn Act. He wished to have a second referendum in which he would have voted to remain; however, the Benn Act was nullified once Boris Johnson won a Conservative majority in the 2019 general election and the UK left the European Union. Early life and education Born in Hammersmith, London, he is the second son of former Labour Cabinet Minister Tony Benn and American-born educationalist Caroline Benn (née DeCamp). Benn is a fourth-generation MP – his father, his paternal grandfather Lord Stansgate, and his great-grandfathers Daniel Holmes and Sir John Benn were all Members of Parliament, mostly with factions of the Liberal Party. Benn attended Norland Place School, Westminster Under School, Holland Park School, and the University of Sussex where he graduated in Russian and East European Studies. Benn has an older brother, Stephen, a younger sister Melissa and younger brother, Joshua. Reflecting on his upbringing, he said: \\"I grew up in a household where we talked about the state of the world over breakfast, when we ate at night, and all points in between.\\" Early political career After graduation, Benn became a research officer with ASTMS and later became Head of Policy for Manufacturing Science and Finance. He reportedly applied to become head of Labour Party research under the leadership of John Smith, but was unsuccessful. During the 1975 referendum on British membership of the European Economic Community, he served on the research team for the National Referendum Campaign, which argued for a No vote.David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, The 1975 Referendum, (London: Macmillan, 1976, 1999 edn.), p. 102. In 1980, he was seconded to the Labour Party to act as a joint secretary to the finance panel of the Labour Party Commission of Inquiry. In 1979, he was elected to Ealing Borough Council where he served as deputy leader from 1986 to 1990. He was the Labour Party candidate for Ealing North at the 1983 and 1987 general elections. On both occasions he was defeated by the Conservative candidate Harry Greenway. Reflecting on the defeat at the 1983 general election, Benn said: \\"That was a formative experience for me because we went out on the doorstep and we didn't win the public's confidence. It made me very uncomfortable. Personally, that left a mark on me.\\" At the 1997 general election, Benn was on the shortlist for the seat of Pontefract and Castleford, but eventually lost to Yvette Cooper. Following the 1997 general election, Benn served as a special adviser to David Blunkett, then the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. Benn won the Leeds Central by-election on 10 June 1999 by just over 2,000 votes, following a turnout of 19.6%, the second-smallest turnout at a by-election since the Second World War; this was beaten in the 2012 Manchester Central by-election which had a mere 18.2% turnout. In response to the poor turnout, he said: \\"The turnout is very disappointing and in a democracy this is a concern for all of us.\\" Labour government (1999–2010) In 1999, Benn was selected as the Labour candidate for a by-election in Leeds Central following the untimely death of Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett at the age of 53 years old. During the by- election campaign, he described himself as \\"a Benn, but not a Bennite\\". He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday 23 June 1999. He was re-elected as MP for Leeds Central at the 2001, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections. Early ministerial career (2001–2003) Following the 2001 general election, Benn was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development. In 2002 reshuffle, he become the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation in the Home Office, serving as a deputy to Lord Falconer as Minister of State (Criminal Justice). At the Home Office, he led a task force investigating internet paedophilia, which subsequently recommended the introduction of the new offence of 'grooming'. In January 2003, he had responsibility for introducing the Sexual Offences Bill in the House of Commons. In May 2003, he was moved from the Home Office back to the Department for International Development, where he served as Minister of State. He also acted as the Department's Commons spokesperson, as then-Secretary of State for International Development, Baroness Amos, was a member of the House of Lords. Secretary of State for International Development (2003–2007) In 2003, Benn was promoted to the cabinet from his position as Minister of State to become Secretary of State for International Development, after Baroness Amos was appointed as Leader of the House of Lords. When he informed his family, his father Tony said that \\"the house rocked with delight\\". Following his first Department for International Development (DfID) question time, Benn was criticised by Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Tom Brake over his comments about opening Iraq up to foreign investors. The Guardian noted that one of Benn's main challenges as Secretary of State for International Development would be the \\"fraught reconstruction of Iraq\\". In February 2004, Benn said that restoring security in Iraq would be \\"absolutely fundamental\\" to a reconstruction effort. Benn oversaw the DfID response to the 2003 Bam earthquake, which included \\"helping to coordinate efforts on the ground, liaise with other international relief organisations and work with the Iranian government to ensure that the right equipment gets to where it is needed as quickly as possible.\\" He subsequently oversaw the UK's response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, to which he responded \\"with skill\\". In July 2004, Benn set out five stages to end the War in Darfur that had begun in February 2003. The stages were: \\"to get help to the people in the camps and elsewhere\\", \\"to get more people and more capacity on the ground to deliver this aid\\", \\"security – urgently\\", getting the \\"government of Sudan ... to disarm the militias and provide security to the people\\" and \\"Finally, this crisis needs a political solution\\". On 13 June 2005, he committed an additional £19,000,000 to the African Union security mission in Darfur, bringing the total UK contribution to £32,000,000. Benn led the UK negotiating team at the 2006 Darfur peace negotiations. Benn was also a critic of the United Nations at times. In December 2004, he called for reform of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNHCA), and also said that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was \\"supposed to coordinate but does not have the power of resources to do the job properly\\". Benn has also been credited with helping to found the Central Emergency Response Fund. Benn played an important role in increasing the UK's foreign aid budget and securing debt relief for the poorest countries at the 31st G8 summit. In 2007, the New Statesman noted that \\"Benn's work at DfID ... has often been at odds with the Bush administration\\". In particular, an example was Benn's opposition to the United States policy of increasing abstinence when it came to fighting AIDS in Africa, whereas Benn took a \\"harm reduction\\" approach. He was also dismissive of US policy, saying: \\"Abstinence-only programmes are fine if you want to abstain, but not everybody does.\\" Labour Party Deputy Leadership election, 2007 In late October 2006, Benn announced that he would be standing in the 2007 Labour Party Deputy Leadership election. One of his earliest backers was Dennis Skinner, and it was also announced that Ian McCartney would play an important role in his campaign. On 6 December, an open letter was published in The Guardian signed by six Labour parliamentarians that said Benn's election as Deputy Leader could rebuild a \\"coalition of trust\\" in the Labour Party. In 2007, Benn was the bookmakers' favourite for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party. Early polls in the deputy leadership contest showed him to be the grassroots' favourite – in a YouGov poll of party members, Benn was top with 27%, followed by Education Secretary Alan Johnson with 18%, Environment Secretary David Miliband with 17%, Justice Minister Harriet Harman with 10%, and Labour Party Chair Hazel Blears with 7%. The contest was launched on 14 May 2007 after the resignation of incumbent deputy leader John Prescott, Benn had some difficulties securing the necessary 45 nominations required to get on the ballot paper but he acquired the support needed to join five other candidates—Hazel Blears, Harriet Harman, Alan Johnson, Peter Hain and backbencher Jon Cruddas. Supporting nominations from constituency Labour parties showed Hilary Benn obtaining 25%, Jon Cruddas 22%, Harriet Harman 19%, Alan Johnson 14%, Hazel Blears 12% and Peter Hain 8% of the constituency parties that voted. The contest closed on Sunday 24 June 2007, with Harriet Harman winning. Benn was eliminated in the third round of voting, having reached 22.33% of the vote. Harman was elected in the fifth round with 50.43% of the vote. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2007–2010) In 2007, Benn was appointed as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, following the election of Gordon Brown as Party Leader, and the promotion of David Miliband to Foreign Secretary. As Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, it was his responsibility to respond to the threat to cattle from Mycobacterium bovis, colloquially referred to as bovine tuberculosis (TB). The recommended option from the Chief Scientific Advisor until 2007, Sir David King, was a badger cull. In April 2010, a badger cull was announced in Wales, after the high court in Cardiff rejected a legal challenge from The Badger Trust. During the parliamentary expenses scandal, Benn was picked out by several national newspapers as one of only three senior members of the Labour Party to have presented expenses beyond reproach. The Guardian stated: \\"When all Westminster MPs' total expenditures are ranked, Benn's bill is the fifteenth least expensive for the taxpayer\\". In opposition (2010–present) Benn served as Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010 during Harriet Harman's interim leadership of the Labour Party. In the Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband, announced on 8 October 2010, he was appointed Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. When Miliband reshuffled his cabinet on 7 October 2011, he was named Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Later, he supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. Shadow Foreign Secretary After the 2015 UK general election, in the Second Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman, Benn was named Shadow Foreign Secretary, after the incumbent, Douglas Alexander, lost his seat to Mhairi Black of the SNP. On 17 June, Benn deputised for Harriet Harman at Prime Minister's Questions, when David Cameron was overseas in Europe, and Benn was Harman's unofficial deputy. One of the questions he asked challenged George Osborne, who was deputising for Cameron, over whether HMS Bulwark was under active review as revealed in a report by The Guardian. Writing for the New Statesman, George Eaton commended Benn's performance, saying: \\"Benn smartly denied the Chancellor the chance to deploy his favourite attack lines by devoting his six questions to national security and the Mediterranean refugee crisis, rather than the economy.\\" In September 2015, both leadership and deputy leadership elections took place in the Labour Party. Benn supported Caroline Flint in the deputy leadership election, and Andy Burnham in the leadership election. Following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party in September, Benn retained the role of Shadow Foreign Secretary in Corbyn's shadow cabinet, and stressed that Labour would campaign to remain in the EU \\"under all circumstances\\". This was later affirmed by a joint statement released by both Benn and Corbyn, which said that \\"Labour will be campaigning in the referendum for the UK to stay in the European Union.\\" On 20 September, Benn signalled that Labour could back Prime Minister David Cameron's plans for airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria: \\"What we've said consistently is that the government, if it has got a proposal, should bring that to the House of Commons. In relation to airstrikes, we shall look at the objectives. At the moment we don't know what the proposal is ... We will judge that against the objective, the legal base ...\\" In November 2015, after the Paris attacks that had occurred a few days earlier, Benn initially agreed with Corbyn's position rejecting the proposal for Britain to launch airstrikes against ISIL in Syria and any intervention. However, Benn subsequently supported plans laid out by the Prime Minister, and said he would not resign over his disagreement with Corbyn because he was \\"doing [his] job as the Shadow Foreign Secretary\\". Benn had voted in favour of the Iraq War in 2003 and the 2011 military intervention in Libya, but voted against military intervention against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013. Benn and Jeremy Corbyn meet with President Barack Obama in April 2016. On 2 December 2015, Benn made the closing speech for the official opposition in the House of Commons debate on airstrikes against ISIL in Syria. The speech opposed the position espoused by Corbyn against the government's motion. The speech was applauded by some MPs on both sides of the house, a gesture not usually permitted in the Commons. Along with a minority of shadow cabinet colleagues, he voted for airstrikes in Syria and the motion passed by a higher-than-expected majority of 174 votes. The Conservative Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described Benn's oration as \\"one of the truly great speeches in Commons history\\". Speaking to the BBC the following day, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell compared Benn's speech to that given by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 ahead of the Iraq War. McDonnell described it as an \\"excellent\\" piece of oratory, but added: \\"The greatest oratory can lead us to the greatest mistakes.\\" According to Labour MP Jamie Reed, following his speech, in the eyes of Corbyn, Benn became \\"at best a rebel, at worst a traitor.\\" In January 2016, Benn criticised British involvement in Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen after a leaked UN report concluded there had been \\"widespread and systematic\\" attacks on civilian targets in violation of international humanitarian law.\\"Labour seeks details of UK role in Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen \\". The Guardian, 27 January 2016. On 25 June 2016, The Observer revealed that Benn \\"called fellow MPs over the weekend to suggest that he will ask Corbyn to stand down if there is significant support for a move against the leader. He has also asked shadow cabinet colleagues to join him in resigning if the Labour leader ignores that request.\\" During a phone call in the early hours of 26 June, Benn told Corbyn that Labour MPs and shadow cabinet members had \\"no confidence in our ability to win the election\\" under his leadership. Corbyn then dismissed Benn from his position as Shadow Foreign Secretary. In a statement issued at 03:30, Benn said: \\"It has now become clear that there is widespread concern among Labour MPs and in the shadow cabinet about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of our party. In particular, there is no confidence in our ability to win the next election, which may come much sooner than expected, if Jeremy continues as leader.\\" Later in the morning, Heidi Alexander, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health, also resigned. Throughout the day, a further eight members of the shadow cabinet resigned. Select committee chairman In September 2016, Benn announced his intention to stand for chairman of the new Exiting the European Union Select Committee, a House of Commons select committee. He stated that his intention was to \\"get the best deal for the British people\\". His bid was supported by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, as well as other senior Labour Party figures including Angela Eagle, Dan Jarvis, and Andy Burnham. His opponent in the bid was Kate Hoey, a fellow Labour MP and a Leave vote supporter. The result, announced on 19 October, was 330 votes to Benn, and 209 to Hoey, so Benn became the new chairman. In this position, he supported the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019 as proposed on a cross-party basis by Labour's Yvette Cooper and the Conservatives' Oliver Letwin to force the Government to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process. He sponsored the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, consequently also known as the Benn Act, which received Royal Assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension had no agreement been reached at the subsequent European Council meeting in October 2019. Political views  Defence policy  Benn supports the maintenance of a nuclear-armed strategic force by the United Kingdom.  Foreign policy  Benn supported the Remain campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and also supports the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum. Benn supported both the 2011 military intervention in Libya and the Iraq War, but opposed military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime.  Welfare policies  He supports Sure Start. Personal life In 1973, whilst at university, Benn married fellow student Rosalind Caroline Retey. She died of cancer, aged 26, in 1979. Benn subsequently married Sally Christina Clark in 1982, and the couple have four children. Like his father, who died in March 2014, he is a teetotaller and vegetarian. Awards Benn was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for his work on increasing aid at DfID, and remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who's Who publication. Benn has won the Channel 4 Political Awards Politicians’ Politician 2006, House Magazine Minister of the Year 2006 and 2007, Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year 2016 and the Political Studies Association Parliamentarian of the Year 2019.

Biography In the 1950s she provided lyrics, sketches, and occasionally acted in revues on London's West End. She was especially successful in her ventures providing lyrics for Madeleine Dring in Airs on a Shoestring (1953), Pay the Piper (1954), and Fresh Airs (1956), all productions of Laurier Lister. She was once (allegedly) the girlfriend of Peter Sellers, and appeared in The Goon Show episodes Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest (1954) as Maid Marian and Tales of Montmartre (1956) as Seagoon's love interest, Fifi. Charlotte Mitchell was married to the actor Philip Guard and was the mother of three children, actors Christopher Guard and Dominic Guard and animator and novelist Candy Guard. Charlotte lived in West London during the later part of her life and continued to be active as a poet. She appeared on BBC Radio with Ian Carmichael in The Small, Intricate Life of Gerald C. Potter. Carmichael played Gerald C. Potter, mystery writer, while she played Diana, his wife, who, under the pseudonym of Miss Magnolia Badminton, wrote romantic novels. She also played, on radio, the Dowager Duchess (Lord Peter Wimsey's mother) in the radio adaption of Strong Poison that starred Ian Carmichael as Peter Wimsey and the character of Kath Miller in the BBC Radio 2 daily serial Waggoners' Walk. She also featured as Maid Marion in The Goon Show's \\"Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest\\" in December 1958. On television, she played Amy Winthrop the housekeeper in The Adventures of Black Beauty (1972–74), and Monica Spencer in And Mother Makes Five. Her poetry was published in collections such as \\"Twelve Burnt Saucepans\\", \\"Looking Round Dangerously\\", \\"I Want to Go Home\\" and \\"Just in Case\\". These provided the basis of a series of popular programmes on BBC Radio 4 in which she read her own work. Her poetry is often requested and read on the BBC Radio 4's Poetry Please, and one of her poems was chosen by Judi Dench and Michael Williams in their joint BBC Radio 4 programme With Great Pleasure. Death She died in Chiswick, London, on 2 May 2012, aged 85 from pneumonia. She had previously battled breast cancer and myeloma.

He has been called \\"the father of secular humanism\\". He was Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, having previously also taught at Vassar, Trinity, and Union colleges, and the New School for Social Research. Kurtz founded the publishing house Prometheus Books in 1969. He was also the founder and past chairman of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, formerly the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, CSICOP), the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Center for Inquiry. He was editor in chief of Free Inquiry magazine, a publication of the Council for Secular Humanism. He was co-chair of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) from 1986 to 1994. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Humanist Laureate, president of the International Academy of Humanism and Honorary Associate of Rationalist International. As a member of the American Humanist Association, he contributed to the writing of Humanist Manifesto II. He was an editor of The Humanist, 1967–78. Kurtz published over 800 articles or reviews and authored and edited over 50 books. Many of his books have been translated into over 60 languages. Early years Kurtz was born in Newark, New Jersey, into a Jewish family,http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2012/10/23/paul-kurtz-leading- advocate-of-secular-humanism-dead-at-86/ the son of Sara Lasser and Martin Kurtz. Kurtz received his bachelor's degree from New York University, and the Master's degree and Doctor of Philosophy degree from Columbia University. Kurtz was left-wing in his youth, but has said that serving in the United States Army in World War II taught him the dangers of ideology. He saw the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps after they were liberated, and became disillusioned with Communism when he encountered Russian slave laborers who had been taken to Nazi Germany by force but refused to return to the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Kurtz addresses the Banquet at the 1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY Secular humanism Kurtz was largely responsible for the secularization of humanism. Before Kurtz embraced the term \\"secular humanism,\\" which had received wide publicity through fundamentalist Christians in the 1980s, humanism was more widely perceived as a religion (or a pseudoreligion) that did not include the supernatural. This can be seen in the first article of the original Humanist Manifesto which refers to \\"Religious Humanists\\" and by Charles and Clara Potter's influential 1930 book Humanism: A New Religion. Kurtz used the publicity generated by fundamentalist preachers to grow the membership of the Council for Secular Humanism, as well as strip the religious aspects found in the earlier humanist movement. He founded the Center for Inquiry in 1991. There are now some 40 Centers and Communities worldwide, including in Los Angeles, Washington, New York City, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Beijing, Hyderabad, Toronto, Dakar, Buenos Aires and Kathmandu. In 1999 Kurtz was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union. He had been a board member of IHEU between 1969 and 1994, and in a tribute by former colleague at both IHEU and the Council for Secular Humanism Matt Cherry, Kurtz was described as having \\"had a strong commitment to international humanism – a commitment to humanism beyond US borders never seen matched by another American. He did a lot to expand IHEU as a member of the IHEU Growth and Development Committee (with Levi Fragell and Rob Tielman) and then when he was co-chair, also with Rob and Levi. He always pushed IHEU to be bigger and bolder.\\" In 2000 he received the International Rationalist Award by Rationalist International. In 2001, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the nature of morality. October 24, 2001 at Franklin & Marshall College. Kurtz believed that the nonreligious members of the community should take a positive view on life. Religious skepticism, according to Paul Kurtz, is only one aspect of the secular humanistic outlook. In an interview with D.J. Grothe, he stated that a categorical imperative of secular humanism is \\"genuine concern for the well- being of other humans.\\" At the Council of Secular Humanism's Los Angeles conference (7–10 October 2010), tension over the future of humanism was on display as Kurtz urged a more accommodationist approach to religion while his successors argued for a more adversarial approach.See the LA Times article reviewing the exchange titled \\"Religious Skeptics Disagree on How Aggressively to Challenge the Devout\\". For the LA conference in question, see http://www.secularhumanism.org/laconference . On May 18, 2010, he resigned from all these positions.See his open letter of resignation on his personal website. Moreover, the Center for Inquiry accepted his resignation as chairman emeritus, board member, and as editor in chief of Free Inquiry as being the culmination of a years-long \\"leadership transition\\", thanking him \\"for his decades of service\\" while also alluding to \\"concerns about Dr. Kurtz's day-to- day management of the organization\\".Center for Inquiry. \\"CFI Board accepts Paul Kurtz's resignation.\\" Center for Inquiry. 18 May 2010. (accessed May 18, 2010). Kurtz renewed his efforts in organized humanism by founding The Institute for Science and Human Values and its journal The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective in June 2010. Critique of the paranormal Ray Hyman, Paul Kurtz, James Randi, and Ken Frazier at TAM8, July 2010, Las Vegas, after their session on the history of the modern skeptical movement Another aspect in Kurtz's legacy is his critique of the paranormal. In 1976, CSICOP started Skeptical Inquirer, its official journal. Like Martin Gardner, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, James Randi, Ray Hyman and others, Kurtz has popularized scientific skepticism and critical thinking about claims of the paranormal. Concerning the founding of the modern skeptical movement, Ray Hyman states that in 1972, he, along with James Randi and Martin Gardner, wanted to form a skeptical group called S.I.R. (Sanity In Research). The three of them felt they had no administration experience, saying \\"we just had good ideas\\", and were soon joined by Marcello Truzzi who provided structure for the group. Truzzi involved Paul Kurtz and they together formed CSICOP in 1976. Kurtz wrote: > [An] explanation for the persistence of the paranormal, I submit, is due to > the transcendental temptation. In my book by that name, I present the thesis > that paranormal and religious phenomena have similar functions in human > experience; they are expressions of a tendency to accept magical thinking. > This temptation has such profound roots within human experience and culture > that it constantly reasserts itself.Quarter Century of Skeptical Inquiry, > Paul Kurtz (Skeptical Inquirer July 2001) In The Transcendental Temptation, Kurtz analyzes how provable are the claims of Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, as well as the founders of religions on American soil such as Joseph Smith and Ellen White. He also evaluates the activities of the most famous modern psychics and what he believes are the fruitless researches of parapsychologists. The Transcendental Temptation is considered among Kurtz's most influential writings. He promoted what he called \\"Skepticism of the Third Kind,\\" in which skeptics actively investigate claims of the paranormal, rather than just question them. He saw this type of skepticism as distinct from the \\"first kind\\" of extreme philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility that anything can be known, as well as the \\"second kind\\" of skepticism, which accepts that knowledge of the real world is possible but is still largely a philosophical exercise. On 19 April 2007, Kurtz appeared on Penn & Teller's television show Bullshit! arguing that exorcism and Satanic cults are merely \\"hype and paranoia\\". The office of Paul Kurtz at Center for Inquiry Transnational, Amherst, NY Eupraxsophy Kurtz coined the term eupraxsophy (originally eupraxophy) to refer to philosophies or life stances such as secular humanism, Confucianism and Taoism that do not rely on belief in the transcendent or supernatural. A eupraxsophy is a nonreligious life stance or worldview emphasizing the importance of living an ethical and exuberant life, and relying on rational methods such as logic, observation and science (rather than faith, mysticism or revelation) toward that end. The word is based on the Greek words for \\"good\\", \\"practice\\", and \\"wisdom\\". Eupraxsophies, like religions, are cosmic in their outlook but eschew the supernatural component of religion, avoiding the \\"transcendental temptation,\\" as Kurtz puts it. Although critical of supernatural religion, he has attempted to develop affirmative ethical values of naturalistic humanism.Cooke, Bill. Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, & Humanism, Prometheus Books, 2006, page 175. \\"Eupraxsophy stands for 'a set of convictions and practices offering a cosmic outlook and an ethical guide to life'.\\" The Paul Kurtz Lecture Series In June 2010, the State University of New York at Buffalo announced the establishment of the Paul Kurtz Lecture Series. The series will bring notable speakers to the University's campus in Amherst, New York, to speak on topics relevant to the philosophy of humanism and philosophical naturalism. Kurtz had made the bequest and charitable gift annuity to the University, where he taught from 1965 to 1991, to help promote the development of critical intelligence in future generations of SUNY at Buffalo students. On November 5, 2010, the University announced that cognitive scientist Steven Pinker would inaugurate the new Paul Kurtz Lecture Series on December 2, 2010. Paul Kurtz Institute for Science and Human Values Paul Kurtz conceived of the Institute for Science and Human Values in 2009 as yet another branch of the umbrella group, the Center for Inquiry. Upon his resignation from the Center for Inquiry he launched the Institute for Science and Human Values as a separate entity. In ISHV's first press release Kurtz said ISHV hoped to \\"rehumanize secularism\\" and \\"find out how to better develop the common moral virtues that we share as human beings.\\" Kurtz was editor-in- chief of ISHV's journal, The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective. In 2019, the institute's board of directors renamed the organization as the Paul Kurtz Institute for Science and Human Values. Honors The asteroid 6629 Kurtz was named in his honor. At a meeting of the executive council of CSI in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Kurtz was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

Background In January 1865, the US Congress passed a law that effectively disbarred former members of the Confederate government by requiring a loyalty oath to be recited by any federal court officer that affirmed that the officer had never served in the Confederate government. Augustus Hill Garland, an attorney and a former Confederate Senator from Arkansas, subsequently received a pardon from US President Andrew Johnson. Garland then came before the court and pleaded that the act of Congress was a bill of attainder and an ex post facto law, which unfairly punished him for the crime for which he had been pardoned, and so was unconstitutional. Decision In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was a bill of attainder and an ex post facto law. The court also ruled that the president can exercise the pardon power at any time after the commission of the crime, and that Garland was beyond the reach of punishment of any kind because of his prior presidential pardon.On limitations of this presidential power, see Broughton Zachary J., I Beg Your Pardon: Ex Parte Garland Overruled; The Presidential Pardon Is No Longer Unlimited, Western New England Law Review, Vol. 41, Issue 1 (2019), pp. 183-218. The court also stated that counselors are officers of the court, not officers of the United States, and that their removal was an exercise of judicial power, not legislative power. The law was struck down as unconstitutional, which opened the way for former Confederate government officials to return to positions in the federal judiciary.

She is the wife of Archie Bunker, mother of Gloria Stivic, mother-in-law of Michael \\"Meathead\\" Stivic and after 1975, grandmother of Joey Stivic. Her cousin is Maude Findlay (Beatrice Arthur), one of Archie's nemeses. While Edith is typically a traditional and usually subservient wife, Jean Stapleton was a noted feminist. Series creator Norman Lear said on All Things Considered that the reason why Archie would always tell Edith to stifle herself was because his father told his mother to \\"stifle\\". Character and background Edith Bunker is an undereducated but kind, cheery and loving woman. She is less politically opinionated than the rest of the family. Her main role is the woman who keeps her family intact. A native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, she was born in January 1925. She later migrated to New York City, where she lived most of her life and died in her sleep of a stroke in September 1980, at age 55. She attended Millard Fillmore High School and was in the graduating class of 1943. Her high school had only one reunion and that was the 30th, in 1973, which she attended. At some point, she met Archie at the Puritan Maid Ice Cream Parlor. In the episode \\"Archie Goes Too Far\\" Edith reads her diary and reveals that she received letters in May 1943 from Archie while he was overseas serving in the Army Air Corps. Her character and accent change somewhat between the first and second seasons. In the earliest episodes, she is the \\"put-upon wife,\\" often bemoaning (though softly) her husband's behavior or comments: also during the first season, Jean Stapleton spoke more in her own range (albeit with a pronounced accent), rather than the nasal, high pitched voice for which Edith is generally remembered. By the second season, she becomes the character more familiar to viewers: kind, utterly non- judgmental and fully dedicated to her husband. In the 1st season 2nd episode \\"Writing the President\\" Edith remarks how before her marriage, in 1946 she got a job and started working for the \\"Hercules Plumbing Company\\". By the second season, her husband becomes \\"Awwchie.\\" In the third season episode \\"The Battle of the Month\\" and fourth season episode \\"Gloria Sings the Blues,\\" Edith reveals that her parents almost divorced after a nasty fight and that although they stayed married, things were never the same between them. This deeply affected her and her views on marriage, marital fighting and social conduct. In the fourth season episode \\"Archie the Gambler,\\" Edith reveals that her father was addicted to gambling and almost brought his family to ruin (an experience which led Edith to put her foot down twice regarding Archie's similar gambling problem - and once slap him). Edith is the voice of reason and rock of understanding, often contributing a unique perspective to a topic. She is decidedly less bigoted than Archie (e.g., she is good friends with her black neighbor Louise Jefferson, while Archie is always at odds with her and husband George). Though her opinions sometimes sharply differ from Archie's, she is intensely loyal to her husband, often sticks up for him and stands by him in his times of need. She is the most naïve family member and the happiest character on the show. For example, in a conversation with Gloria, Edith stated that she favored capital punishment, \\"as long as it ain't too severe.\\" In the episode \\"Cousin Liz\\" (in which the Bunkers learn that her recently deceased cousin Liz was a lesbian and that her \\"roommate\\", Veronica, had been, in fact, Liz's life partner), Edith is at first shocked at the revelation, but quickly throws her arms around Veronica and warmly accepts her as Liz's \\"true next-of-kin\\", giving her the tea-set Liz's spouse would have legally inherited. Edith was popular among audiences for her sweetness, unconditionally loving everyone she knew and staying optimistic during tragedy. Despite cooperating with Archie, Edith doesn't share much of her husband's prejudices. Examples of this are shown through her friendships with drag queen Beverly LaSalle and Louise Jefferson, both of whom Archie is less cooperative with, when the Jeffersons lived next door to the Bunkers. In contrast, in a memorable episode in the show's second season, Edith uncharacteristically snaps at Archie, repeatedly telling him (as he frequently did to her) to \\"stifle\\". Edith, who otherwise never cursed, also loudly instructs the family to \\"Leave me alone, dammit!\\" After a visit to the doctor, Gloria explains to Archie that he needs to be sensitive to the fact that Edith is going through menopause. Later on in the episode, a frustrated Archie yells at Edith \\"When I had the hernia I didn't make you wear the truss. Now if you're gonna have a change of life, you gotta do it right now. I'm gonna give you 30 seconds now come on, change!\\" In another episode, Edith, in a conversation with Gloria, wonders whether men go through \\"women-pause.\\" When All in the Family premiered in 1971, Edith was a housewife. In 1974 Edith got a part-time job as a caretaker at the Sunshine Home. She later was a partner in Archie's business, Archie's Place, the tavern he purchased in 1977. (In truth, she wasn't a legal official partner. She just made that claim after Archie forged her signature - Archie claimed he just \\"traced\\" it from a check - on an application to mortgage their house, in order to secure funds for the purchase of the pub.) Edith loses her job at the Sunshine Home in 1979 (for breaking a policy by allowing a terminally ill woman to die and failing to inform the staff), but in an early episode of Archie Bunker's Place, she finds a similar caretaker's job at a mental health facility. Edith is most known for her shrill voice (her trademark \\"Oh, Aaaaaaaaaah-chie!\\" became popular among viewers) and her flighty demeanor. The latter character trait causes Archie to call her \\"dingbat\\". However, Archie truly loves his wife and wants what is best for both of them. Frequently, he consults with her when something bothers him (such as the episode, \\"Archie and the KKK,\\" where a distressed Archie asks Edith for advice on how to prevent a cross burning). More than once, Edith sharply chastises Archie for casting judgment against other people, particularly when he mentions God. Two notable examples came in the episodes \\"Cousin Liz\\" (Archie went on a diatribe about how God hates gays) and \\"California, Here We Are\\" (where, upon learning that Gloria's near affair had almost destroyed the Stivics' marriage, berates the \\"Little Goil\\" and says that the matter is \\"God's business\\"). In both instances, Edith warned Archie to back off and says that God should be left to deal with those matters and the people involved. She also becomes close friends with a transvestite person/drag performer known as Beverly LaSalle (Lori Shannon) who comes into their lives when Archie saves his life with CPR, remaining friends with him, despite Archie's discomfort. Edith later has a crisis of faith after Beverly's death protecting Mike from muggers. Edith also serves as the voice of reason for Mike and on several occasions corrects him when, as she says, \\"He's been acting all stuck up.\\" She explains to Mike that Archie yells at him not because he hates Mike but because he is jealous of Mike's many opportunities in life. Edith also, on many occasions, helps Gloria to understand that Gloria's feminist views, while correct, do not mean other viewpoints are necessarily any less valid. Edith is described by Archie's father as being \\"too smart\\" for him because, while Edith appears to have less-than-average intelligence, she is very wise about life and the way the world works. Around the house, Edith usually runs, implicitly to please others without them having to wait. This included answering the doorbell or phone and running to the kitchen to get Archie a beer. In \\"The Saga of Cousin Oscar\\", Edith mentions she has two sisters, Helen and Gertrude. In \\"Lionel Steps Out,\\" she mentions a brother, Harry. The character suffers intermittently throughout the series. Edith goes through menopause in the second season (\\"Edith's Problem\\"), discovers a lump in her breast just before Christmas in the fourth season (\\"Edith's Christmas Story\\"), is nearly raped on her 50th birthday in the eighth season (\\"Edith's 50th Birthday\\") and in season nine briefly contracts laryngitis (\\"A Night at the PTA\\") and develops phlebitis in the show's final episode (\\"Too Good Edith\\"). The first episode of the second season of Archie Bunker's Place (\\"Archie Alone\\") reveals that Edith died as result of a stroke. Death Beneath his crusty, irascible exterior, Archie is intensely protective of Edith and becomes upset at the mere thought of losing her. In the episode \\"Too Good Edith,\\" the 209th and final episode of All in the Family, Edith becomes seriously ill while frantically helping Archie cook a large Irish dinner for a St. Patrick's Day party at the bar. She had been suffering from phlebitis and decided not to tell Archie, but when he finds out about it he scolds her for hiding it from him. In the sequel series Archie Bunker's Place, Archie's worst nightmare becomes a reality when Edith dies (off-camera) from a stroke. In the one-hour Season 2 premiere, \\"Archie Alone\\" (which first aired November 2, 1980) Archie is still in denial weeks after Edith's death and refuses to take Stephanie to visit her grave. Near the episode's end, after neighbors and friends had removed Edith's personal items to help him to cope, Archie, alone in the now-empty bedroom, finds one of her pink slippers left behind underneath the bed, and breaks down in tears as he recalls the morning he discovered Edith had died in her sleep during the night: Fearing being typecast in \\"submissive\\" roles, Jean Stapleton had wished to leave her role as a regular character, although she was open to guest appearances (in interviews, Stapleton has stated the role of Edith had reached its potential). Her appearances in the prior season sharply declined: she appeared in only four episodes of the 1979-1980 season. It was with great reluctance that producer Norman Lear agreed to have the character killed off. When Stapleton reminded him that Edith was a fictional character, Lear took a long pause, causing Stapleton to think she had hurt him. Finally, Lear said \\"To me, she isn't [fictional],\\" but ultimately made the decision to have Edith die.. Stapleton later appeared as a presenter on the 1981 Primetime Emmy Awards telecast (after the episode \\"Archie Alone\\" aired) and said to the viewing audience: \\"See! I'm still here!\\"  Cultural impact  Edith and Archie's chairs have been noted as famous pieces of history by their inclusion in the National Museum of American History.The NMAH, The Bunker's Chairs. In 2009, Edith Bunker was included in Yahoo!'s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the decade 1971–1979.

It is native to the tropical forests of North and South America, as well as the Caribbean. Description Genipa americana trees are up to 30 m tall and up to 60 cm dbh. Their bark is smooth with little fissures. The leaves are opposite, obovate, or obovate oblong, 10–35 cm long, 6–13 cm wide, and glossy dark green, with entire margin, acute or acuminate apex, and attenuated base. The inflorescences are cymes up to 10 cm long. The flowers are white to yellowish, slightly fragrant, calyx bell-shaped, corolla at 2–4.5 cm long, trumpet-shaped, and five- or six-lobed. The five short stamens are inserted on top of the corolla tube. The fruit is a thick-skinned edible greyish berry 10–12 cm long, 5–9 cm in diameter. Distribution and habitat Genipa americana is native to the tropical forests of the Americas, from tropical Florida south to Argentina. It is present from sea level up to 1200 m of elevation, although some argue the original native range as being northern South America. Vernacular names In English, the tree is known as the genip tree and the fruit as genipap .

Early life and career Roberts was born in Albany, New York and grew up in nearby Saratoga Springs, New York. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie Burdo, divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis by 1932 but worked as much as possible. Eventually, Roberts' grandfather, Joseph Burdo, with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance. Roberts' grandmother was killed in an automobile accident in 1936. The next year, her grandfather moved out of the house. By then Marie was partially incapacitated, and the Welfare Department began to furnish mother and daughter with occasional and often unreliable domestic help.The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 40. When Marie became a bedridden invalid, it was Jane's responsibility to take care of her. This included cooking, cleaning, bringing her the bedpan, and getting up in the middle of the night to refuel the stove. Her embittered mother would tell Jane she was going to turn on the gas jets in the middle of the night and kill them both. When her mother attempted suicide for about the fifth time, she took sleeping pills and was in the hospital. Jane wrote that she went to the welfare worker and said, 'I can't take it anymore. I've just got to leave.'\\" Over and over Marie told Jane she was no good, that the daughter's birth had caused the mother's illness, and that she was disowned and considered no longer her daughter. The persistent psychological abuse and mistreatment by her mother resulted in the young girl's deep fear of abandonment. Such situations increased Jane's sense of not being safe, yet also reinforced feelings of independence, for she did not have to feel as dependent upon Marie as she might otherwise. Well before she was 10 years old Jane had developed persistent symptoms of colitis. By her early teens, she had an overactive thyroid gland. Her vision was poor; she required very strong glasses (which she seldom wore). For most of 1940 and half of 1941, Jane was in a strictly-run Catholic orphanage in Troy, NY while her mother was hospitalized in another city for treatment of her arthritis. Priests came to the house regularly and support was offered to the fatherless family. Jane's initial bonding to the cultural beliefs of religion was very strong to make up for the lack of a loving, nurturing family. For a time she was left between belief systems. In the summer of 1945, when she was 16 years old, Jane began working at a variety store. It was her first job. That fall she continued on the job after school hours and on an occasional Saturday. After attending public schools she went to Skidmore College from 1947 to 1950 on a poetry scholarship. Roberts' grandfather died when she was age 19. It was a time of severe shock for her. She began to substitute scientific world view for religious belief.The 'Unknown' Reality, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 30. Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 75–77. Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 371, 421, 441, 442, 450, 452–53. At that time Jane was dating Walt Zeh, a long-time Saratoga Springs friend. Together they went to the west coast by motorcycle to see Jane's father who had also come from a broken home. Jane then married Walt and continued to write while taking a variety of other jobs, including society editor for the Saratoga newspaper, and as a supervisor in a radio factory. Walt and Jane lived together for three years. It was then in February 1954 while \\"cutting up, dancing, and raisin' hell at a party,\\" that Jane first met the former commercial artist Robert Fabian Butts, Jr. (June 20, 1919 - May 26, 2008). The fourth time they met at another party and Jane 'just looked at him and said, \\"Look, I'm leaving Walt, and I'm going to live by myself or I'm going to live with you, so just let me know.\\"'\\"Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg.16. Eventually the two left town together and Jane filed for divorce. Jane and Rob married on December 27, 1954 at the home of his parents in Sayre, PA.Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 524. Roberts wrote in a variety of genres: poetry, short stories, children's literature, nonfiction, science fiction, and fantasy, and novels. She was the only woman invited to the first science-fiction writer's conference in 1956 in Milford, PA. The couple moved to Elmira, NY, in 1960, to find steady part-time work – Rob in the local greeting card company, Jane in an art gallery. Now in her 30s, she and her husband began to record what she said were messages from a personality named \\"Seth,\\" and she wrote several books about the experience. Seth Material On a September evening in 1963, Roberts sat down at her table to work on poetry; Butts was in his back-room studio, painting. \\"It was very domestic, very normal, very unpsychedelic,\\" she would later remember. And then \\"Between one normal minute and the next, a fantastic avalanche of radical, new ideas burst into my head with tremendous force ... It was as if the physical world were really tissue-paper-thin, hiding infinite dimensions of reality, and I was flung through the tissue paper with a huge ripping sound.\\" When she \\"came to,\\" Roberts found herself scrawling the title of this odd batch of notes: The Physical Universe as Idea Construction. Before this, though her fiction typically dealt with such themes as clairvoyance and reincarnation, intellectually neither she nor Butts believed in extrasensory abilities. Yet soon after this episode, Roberts suddenly began recalling her dreams, including two that were precognitive. Their curiosity piqued, the couple decided to investigate further, and she managed to land a contract with a New York publisher for a do-it-yourself book on extra-sensory perception. In late 1963, Roberts and Butts started experimenting with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for the book.ESP Power, by Jane Roberts (2000) (introductory essay by Lynda Dahl). According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. The first seven sessions were entirely with the Ouija board. The three-hour session on the evening of Jan. 2, 1964 was the first where she began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board. For a while, she still opened her sessions with the board, but finally abandoned it after the 27th session on Feb. 19, 1964.Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 68, 166. Roberts described the process of writing the Seth books as entering a trance state. She said Seth would assume control of her body and speak through her, while her husband wrote down the words she spoke. They referred to such episodes as \\"readings\\" or \\"sessions.\\"Conversations With Seth, Book 2: 25th Anniversary Edition, by Susan M. Watkins (2006). The 26th session on Feb. 18, 1964, was the first held in the presence of another person—a friend.Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 157. On Jan. 17, 1964, Roberts channeled an allegedly recently deceased woman who told Butts that his and his wife's work with Seth was a life-time project, that they would publish his manuscripts, and help spread his ideas.Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 105-106. At the 27th session Seth also told the couple how to rearrange the furniture in their apartment which would better suit their energies. Despite feelings of disbelief toward both messages, the couple somewhat reluctantly agreed. Two days afterward they heard from a psychologist interested in reincarnation to whom they had written three weeks earlier with some session copies enclosed. The psychologist told them that the very fluency of the material suggested that it might come from Roberts' subconscious, though it was impossible to tell. He also cautioned that in some circumstances, amateur mediumship could lead to mental problems. The letter upset her but helped her deal with her doubts. She felt there were no \\"alarming changes\\" in her personality. \\"I was doing twice the creative work I had done earlier. I was satisfied with the quality of the Seth Material; it was far superior to anything I could do on my own. If nothing else, I thought the sessions presented a way of making deeply unconscious knowledge available on a consistent basis.\\"Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 170-171. \\"Because we were so innocent about psychic literature, we weren't hampered by superstitious fears about such [psychic] phenomena. I didn't believe in gods or demons, so I didn't fear them. I wanted to learn. Rob and I had discovered a whole new world together, and we were going to explore it.\\" Roberts assumed Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified because she did not believe in spirits or life after death. She monitored her personality characteristics and went to a psychologist. But she felt that \\"Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.\\"Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), p. 84. Roberts also purportedly channeled the world views of several other people, including the philosopher William James,Stanley Fisher and John Edminster, \\"William James.... Ghostwriter?\\", FATE #350, pp. 61–66 (1979) Rembrandt, and the Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, through a process she described as using a typewriter to write \\"automatically.\\"Session 718, The Unknown Reality, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1979). For 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held more than 1500 regular or private \\"ESP class\\" trance sessions in which she spoke on behalf of Seth.Roger Woolger, Other Lives, Other Selves: A Jungian Psychotherapist Discovers Past Lives, (1988). Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1986). Butts served as the stenographer, taking the messages down in shorthand he had made up, having others on occasion make recording of some sessions.Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 491. The messages from Seth channeled through Roberts consisted mostly of monologues on a wide variety of topics. They were published by Prentice-Hall under the collective title Seth Material. Over the years, hundreds of people witnessed Roberts channeling \\"Seth\\". Some went to the ESP classes Roberts held (Tuesday and some Thursday nights, Sept. 1967 – Feb. 1975)Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 202. for an evening, others attended for longer periods. (By this time Jane had given up her gallery work, and was teaching nursery school during part of this time.) Outside of the ESP class structure, Roberts gave many personal Seth sessions to various individuals who had written her, asking for help. She never charged for those sessions; however, at some point, she did charge $2.50 to $3.50 per ESP class of 5 to 40 people. When the books began to sell in sufficient numbers, she dropped that fee.Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 333. Book sessions were almost always private, held on Monday and Wednesday evenings without witnesses from 1967 through 1982 (except for Tues and Thurs from Aug. to Nov. 1981).The 'Unknown' Reality, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 7. Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 453, 499. The material through 1969 was published in summary form in The Seth Material, written by Roberts from the output of the channeling sessions. Beginning in January 1970, Roberts wrote books which she described as dictated by Seth. Roberts claimed no authorship of these books beyond her role as a medium. This series of \\"Seth books\\" totaled ten volumes. The last two books appear to be incomplete due to Roberts' illness. Butts contributed extensive footnotes, appendices, and other comments to all the Seth books, and thus was a co-author on all of them. These additions describe what was going on in Roberts' and his life at the time of the various sessions, annotated in light of contemporary beliefs and materials he and Roberts were reading, described excerpts from some fan mail and letters from professionals commenting on Seth's material about their fields, and, especially later, provided insight as to the many steps of production of multiple books with the publisher. By February 1982 they were still receiving \\"from 30 to 50 letters and packages a week\\" from readers of their various books.Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 536. Some of Roberts' earlier and later poetry was occasionally included to show how she had touched upon some of Seth's concepts.The 'Unknown' Reality, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pp. 62, 91, 121–122, . Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 301–04, 312–13, 336, 381, 487–88, 506–07, 524–25. Roberts also wrote The Oversoul Seven trilogy to explore via fiction some of Seth's teachings on the concepts of reincarnation and oversouls. According to Roberts, Seth described himself as an \\"energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter,\\" and was independent of Roberts' subconscious. Roberts initially expressed skepticism as to Seth's origins, wondering if he was a part of her own personality. While speaking as Seth, Roberts at times appeared stern, jovial, or professorial. \\"His\\" voice was deeper and more masculine sounding than Jane's and was possessed of a distinct, although not identifiable, accent.Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul, by Jane Roberts, notes by Robert F. Butts, p. 2 (1972, 1994). Unlike the psychic Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Later books continued to develop but did not contradict the material introduced in earlier works. Some \\"Practice Elements\\" were even included on how a few of the concepts could be practically experienced.The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pp. 103, 179–82, 185–87, 198–99, 219–20. The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 2, by Jane Roberts (1979), pp. 324–25, 335–35, 419–22, 443–46, 460–63, 480–82. A few contemporary world events were commented upon, such as the Jonestown Guyana deathsThe Individual and the Nature of Mass Events, by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 177–180. and the Three Mile Island accident.The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events, by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 191–204. Seth also provided an alternative creation myth to that of the Big Bang or Intelligent Design. Roberts' father died in November 1971 at the age of 68; her mother died six months later at the same age.The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 189. In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the hospital for severely underactive thyroid gland, protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight anemia, budding bedsores—and a hospital- caused staph infection.Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 18–19. She recovered to an extent, but died two and a half years later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis-like her mother—for the final year and a half of her life. Roberts had spent 504 consecutive days in a hospital in Elmira, N.Y. The immediate causes of her death were a combination of protein depletion, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infections. These conditions arose out of her long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.Seth, Dreams, and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 15. (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts' case, at least, the young girl's psychological conditioning was far more important—far more damaging, in those terms—than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 76. ) Roberts was cremated the next day, in a process, she and Butts had agreed upon several years earlier.Seth, Dreams and Projections of Consciousness, by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 16. After Roberts' death, recorded in The Way Toward Health (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including The Early Sessions, making sure all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes, and drawings would be given to the Yale Library. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel Lee Davies, supported his work during the more than 20 years they were together and helped answer mail and proofread manuscripts. Butts died of cancer on May 26, 2008. Jane Roberts Butts and Robert F. Butts Jr. are interred together in the Wayne County, NY Furnaceville cemetery; however, there is another gravestone with their names on it in the Sunnyside cemetery in Tunkhannock, PA. A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth, summarized sections of his teachings, issued copies of Seth sessions on audio tape, and further relayed the material via classes and conventions. Reception and influence Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of \\"The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,\\" republished in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: \\"Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.\\" Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material \\"launched an era of nationwide awareness\\" of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the \\"self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.\\" John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that for each individual: \\"you create your own reality.\\" (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions that trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually, those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.The Nature of the Psyche, by Jane Roberts (1979), pg. 49. ) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \\"Seth Material.\\" Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" related to concepts of reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\" Some writers noted, \\"Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East… and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\\"Kole, Andre; E. Calvin Beisner, Robert M Bowman Jr, Terry Holley Astrology and Psychic Phenomena Zondervan Publishing House, 1989 The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1, by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 12. New Age writer Michael Talbot wrote, \\"To my great surprise—and slight annoyance—I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.\\"Michael Talbot, Beyond the Quantum, Bantam Paperback, 1988 The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio, and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Yale University's collection entitled \\"Jane Roberts papers\\" occupies 164.08 linear feet of shelf space and is contained in 498 boxes. Criticism Roberts and the Seth Material have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet Charles Upton, in his collection of essays titled The System of Antichrist, posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death. His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions. Professor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology James E. Alcock opined, \\"In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production—at any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency.\\" Some religious groups have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others. John MacArthur, host of a syndicated Christian talk show, considers The Seth Material to be \\"a book entirely written by a demon.\\", while the New Age Urantia Foundation considers the book evidence for \\"Devil possession.\\" Videos such as Jane Roberts' Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books – Allowed By The Media claimed that Seth was \\"a demon from hell contacted through a ouija board.\\" Science writer Karen Stollznow has written that much of Roberts work was \\"criticized for being a rip-off of Christian and Eastern philosophy. It comes as no surprise that Seth influenced such authors as Deepak Chopra and Louise Hay.\\"Stollznow, Karen. (2014). Language Myths, Mysteries and Magic. Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 112-113. Since Roberts' death, others have claimed to channel Seth. In the introduction to Seth's first dictated book, Seth Speaks, \\"he\\" says, \\"communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material.\\" In The Seth Material, Jane Roberts wrote: \\"Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts.\\" At least one person has claimed more recently to channel Roberts.Jane Roberts' A View From The Other Side, Mary Maracek (1997).

Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for whalers. At present, they are among the most endangered whales in the world, and they are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act and Canada's Species at Risk Act. There are about 400 individuals in existence in the western North Atlantic Ocean—they migrate between feeding grounds in the Labrador Sea and their winter calving areas off Georgia and Florida, an ocean area with heavy shipping traffic. In the eastern North Atlantic, on the other hand—with a total population reaching into the low teens at most—scientists believe that they may already be functionally extinct. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fixed fishing gear, which together account for nearly half of all North Atlantic right whale mortality since 1970, are their two greatest threats to recovery.  Description  Museo di storia naturale e del territorio dell'Università di Pisa Like other right whales, the North Atlantic right whale, also known as the northern right whale or black right whale, is readily distinguished from other cetaceans by the absence of a dorsal fin on its broad back, short, paddle-like pectoral flippers and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its coloration is dark grey to black, with some individuals occasionally having white patches on their stomachs or throats. Other unique features include a large head, which makes up a quarter of its total body length, narrow tail stock in comparison to its wide fluke and v-shaped blowhole which produces a heart shaped blow. The most distinguishing feature for right whales is their callosities, rough, white patches of keratinized skin found on their heads. The right whale's callosities provide habitat for large colonies of cyamids or whale lice, which feed on the right whale's skin as these small crustaceans cannot survive in open water. The relationship between cyamids and right whales is symbiotic in nature but is poorly understood by scientists. Callosities are not caused by the external environment and are present on fetuses before birth. However, Cyamids near the blowhole have been linked to chronic entanglement and other injuries; their presence in this area has been used as measure of individual health in visual health assessments. Adult North Atlantic right whales average in length and weigh approximately , they are slightly smaller on average than the North Pacific species. The largest measured specimens have been longWhale and Dolphin Conservation, Species guide – North Atlantic right whale and . Females are larger than males. Up to forty five percent of a right whale's body weight is blubber. This high percentage causes their body to float after death due to the low density of blubber. There is little data on their lifespan, but it is believed to be at least 70 years age. However, individuals in species closely related to right whales have been found to live more than 100 years. Currently, female North Atlantic Right whales live on average 45 years and males 65 years. Age of right whales can be determined by examining their ear wax postmortem.  Behavior   Surface activities  Aside from mating activities performed by groups of single female and several males, so called SAG (Surface Active Group), North Atlantic right whales seem less active compared to subspecies in southern hemisphere. However, this could be due to intense difference in number of surviving individuals especially calves that tend to be more curious and playful than adults, and small amount of observations. They are also known to interact with other baleen whales especially with Humpback whalesProvincetown Center for Coastal Studies. 2007. May 2007 .

Clark (2013). Bioacoustic Signal Classification Based on Continuous Region Features, Grid Masking Features and Artificial Neural Network. International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).  Reproduction  North Atlantic right whales are promiscuous breeders. They first give birth at age nine or ten after a year-long gestation; the interval between births seems to have increased in recent years and now averages three to six years. Calves are long at birth and weigh approximately .  Feeding  Right whales feed mainly on copepods and other small invertebrates such as krill, pteropods, and larval barnacles, generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the ocean surface. Sei whales and basking sharks (sometimes minke whales as well) are in positions as food competitors and are known to feed in the same areas, swimming next to each other,O’Donnell E., 2012, Teacher at Sea – There’s a Lot of Food in the Ocean and One More Whale to Feed!, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Retrieved on May 13, 2014 but there have not been any conflicts observed between these species.  Taxonomy  North Atlantic right whale skeleton found on the Thames in 2010 at Bay Wharf, Greenwich The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Atlantic right whale and the other members of its family. Another so-called species of right whale, the \\"Swedenborg whale\\" as proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century, was by scientific consensus once thought to be the North Atlantic right whale. However, the 2013 results of DNA analysis of those fossil bones revealed that they were in fact those of the bowhead whale.  Whaling  Whaling in small wooden boats with hand harpoons was a hazardous enterprise, even when hunting the \\"right\\" whale. As the \\"right\\" whale continued to float long after being killed, it was possible to 'flense' or strip the whale of blubber without having to take it on board ship. Combined with the right whale's lack of speed through water, feeding habits, and coastal habitat, they were easy to catch, even for whalers equipped only with wooden boats and hand-held harpoons. Basques were the first to commercially hunt this species. They began whaling in the Bay of Biscay as early as the eleventh century. The whales were hunted initially for whale oil, but, as meat preservation technology improved, their value as food increased. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530. The last Basque whaling voyages were made prior to the commencement of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A few attempts were made to revive the trade, but they failed. Shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century. It had previously been assumed that Basque whaling in eastern Canada had been the primary cause for the depletion of the sub-population in the western North Atlantic, but later genetic studies disproved this.Rastogi, T., Brown, M. W., Mcleod, B. A., Frasier, T. R., Grenier, R., Cumbaa, S. L., Nadarajah, J. and White, B. N. (2004). Genetic analysis of 16th-century whale bones prompts a revision of the impact of Basque whaling on right and bowhead whales in the western North Atlantic.

Right Whales Past and Present as Revealed by their Genes in: Urban Whale: North Atlantic Right Whales at the Crossroads pp. 200-231, edited by Kraus, S. and Rolland, R. is) during a marine research expedition to the Norwegian Sea, Iceland and Jan Mayen in the 19th century (by Fridtjof Nansen) Setting out from Nantucket and New Bedford in Massachusetts and from Long Island, New York, Americans took up to one hundred right whales each year, with the records including one report of 29 whales killed in Cape Cod Bay in a single day during January 1700. By 1750, the North Atlantic right whale population was, for commercial purposes, depleted. Yankee whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The population was so low by the mid-19th century that the famous Whitby whaler Rev. William Scoresby, son of the successful British whaler William Scoresby senior (1760–1829), claimed to have never seen a right whale (although he mainly hunted bowhead whales off eastern Greenland, outside the normal range of right whales). Based on back calculations using the present population size and growth rate, the population may have numbered fewer than 100 individuals by 1935. As it became clear that hunting right whales was unsustainable, international protection for right whales came into effect, as the practice was banned globally in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1967. After the fall of the iron Curtain, it was discovered that from the 1950s to the 1970s the Soviet Whaling fleet had actually killed several thousands, with little regard to the IWC's regulations. The actual numbers that were killed was kept a close secret but the scandal came to light when Western Whale researchers asked their Russian counterparts for data on the species.  Threats  For the period 1970 to October 2006, humans have been responsible for 48% of the 73 documented deaths of the North Atlantic right whale. A 2001 forecast showed a declining population trend in the late 1990s, and indicated a high probability that North Atlantic right whales would go extinct within 200 years if the then- existing anthropogenic mortality rate was not curtailed. The combined factors of small population size and low annual reproductive rate of right whales mean that a single death represents a significant increase in mortality rate. Conversely, significant reduction in the mortality rate can be obtained by preventing just a few deaths. It was calculated that preventing the deaths of just two females per year would enable the population to stabilize. The data suggests, therefore, that human sources of mortality may have a greater effect relative to population growth rates of North Atlantic right whales than for other whales. The principal factors known to be retarding growth and recovery of the population are ship strikes and entanglement with fishing gear.  Ship strikes  Skeleton of \\"Stumpy\\", a North Atlantic right whale whose death by ship strike helped lead to laws that require slower cargo ship speeds in whale migration routes. The single greatest danger to this species is injury sustained from ship strikes. Between 1970 and October 2006, 37% of all recorded North Atlantic right whale deaths were attributed to collisions. During the years 1999–2003, incidents of mortality and serious injury attributed to ship strikes averaged 1 per year. For the years 2004–2006, that number increased to 2.6. Additionally, it is possible that the official figures actually underestimate the actual ship-strike mortality rates, since whales struck in offshore areas may never be sighted due to low search effort. In 2017, twelve North Atlantic right whales were found dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. In 2002, the International Maritime Organization shifted the location of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS, i.e. shipping lanes) in the Bay of Fundy (and approaches) from an area with the highest density of North Atlantic right whales to an area of lower density. This was the first time the IMO had changed a TSS to help protect marine mammals. In 2006, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established a set of recommended vessel routes to reduce ship strikes in four important eastern-US right whale habitats. In 2007, and again on June 1, 2009, NOAA changed the TSS servicing Boston to reduce vessel collisions with right whales and other whale species. NOAA estimated that implementing an \\"Area To Be Avoided\\" (ATBA) and narrowing the TSS by would reduce the relative risk of right whale ship strikes by 74% during April–July (63% from the ATBA and 11% from the narrowing of the TSS). In 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA enacted a series of vessel speed restrictions to reduce ship collisions with North Atlantic right whales for ships in certain areas along the East Coast of the United States in order to reduce the probability of fatal ship strikes.  Fishing gear entanglement  Disentanglement by NOAA staff off Jacksonville, Florida The next greatest source of human-induced mortality is entanglement in fixed fishing gear such as bottom-set groundfish gillnet gear, cod traps and lobster pots. Between 1970 and October 2006, there have been 8 instances where entanglements have been the direct cause of death of North Atlantic right whales. This represents 11% of all deaths documented during that period. From 1986 to 2005, there were a total of 61 confirmed reports of entanglements, including the aforementioned mortalities. It is likely that official figures underestimate the actual impacts of entanglement. It is believed that chronically entangled animals may in fact sink upon death, due to loss of buoyancy from depleted blubber reserves, and therefore escape detection. Beyond direct mortality, it is believed that a whale that survives an entanglement episode may suffer other negative effects that may weaken it, reduce fertility, or otherwise affect it so that it is more likely to become vulnerable to further injury. Because whales often free themselves of gear following an entanglement event, scarring may be a better indicator of fisheries interaction than entanglement sightings. A 2012 analysis of the scarification of right whales showed that through 2009, 82.9% of all North Atlantic right whales have experienced at least one fishing gear entanglement; 59.0% have had more than one such experience. In all, from 1980–2009, an average of 15.5% of the population are entangled in fishing gear annually. In 2007, so as to protect northern right whales from serious injury or mortality from entanglement in gillnet gear in their calving area in Atlantic Ocean waters off the southeast United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) revised regulations implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This plan expands the restricted area to include the waters off of South Carolina, Georgia, and Northern Florida. It also prohibits gillnet fishing or even gillnet possession in those waters for a period of five months, beginning on November 15 of each year, which coincides with the annual right whale calving season. When entanglement prevention efforts fail, disentanglement efforts occasionally succeed, despite the fact that such efforts are more frequently impossible or unsuccessful. Nevertheless, they do in fact make a significant difference because saving a few whales in a population of only 400 has a large positive effect against mortality rates. During the period 2004–2008 there were at least four documented cases of entanglements for which the intervention of disentanglement teams averted a likely death of a right whale. For the first time in 2009 and again in 2011, scientists successfully used chemical sedation of an entangled whale to reduce stress on the animal and to reduce the time spent working with it. After disentangling the whale, scientists attached a satellite tracking tag, administered a dose of antibiotics to treat entanglement wounds and then another drug to reverse the sedation. Despite concerns that the trauma might impair reproduction, researchers confirmed in January 2013 that three disentangled whales had given birth. Due to recently increased presences of right whales in Cape Breton to St. Lawrence regions, increases in entanglements and possible ship strikes have been confirmed as well including serious fatal cases involving three whales between June 24 and July 13, 2015.  Noise  A 2011 analysis of data collected in the Bay of Fundy has shown that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic physiological stress in North Atlantic right whales.  Naval training near calving grounds  The US Navy proposed plans to build a new undersea naval sonar training range immediately adjacent to northern right whale calving grounds in shallow waters off the Florida/Georgia border. In September 2012, legal challenges by 12 environmental groups were denied in federal court, allowing the Navy to proceed.  Climate change  Climate change poses a threat to the North Atlantic right whale as global temperatures increase and ocean processes change. Long migratory periods, gestations, and time gaps between calves results in slow-growing right whale populations. A brief change in food availability (in particular Calanus finmarchicus) can affect right whale populations for years after. Females must have access to plenty of food to successfully make it through pregnancy and produce enough milk to rear a calf. To illustrate the species’ sensitivity to food availability, in 1998 zooplankton populations dropped dramatically following a climate shift. Even though zooplankton abundance began to rise again in 1999, right whales have such a long reproduction and migratory cycle that the population was greatly affected by the minimal food availability from the year before. In 1999, only one right whale calf was born, compared to the 21 that were born in 1996, before the climate shift. In 2001, after the zooplankton populations greatly recovered, 30 calves were born. Zooplankton abundance has been found to be associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the most influential climate force in the Northern Hemisphere. Periodically, pressure anomalies in the system shift from positive to negative as determined by the NAO Index, affecting temperatures and wind patterns. Abundant zooplankton populations have been linked to a positive NAO Index. As global temperatures increase, the NAO is predicted to shift more often and to greater intensities (so called marine heatwaves). These shifts will likely greatly affect the abundance of zooplankton, posing a great risk for right whale populations that cannot rapidly adapt to a new food source.  Population and distribution  It is not known how many populations of North Atlantic right whales existed prior to whaling, but the majority of studies usually consider that there were historically two populations, one each in the eastern and western North Atlantic. There are however two other hypotheses which claim, respectively, one super-population among the entire North Atlantic (with mixing of eastern and western migratory routes occurring at locations in relatively high latitudes such as in the Denmark Strait), and three sub-populations of eastern, western, and central Atlantic right whales (with the central stock ranging from Greenland's Cape Farewell in summer to the Azores, Bermuda, and Bahamas in winter, although recent study indicates that the Azores had probably been a migratory corridor rather than a wintering ground). Recent studies revealed that modern counterparts of the eastern and western populations are genetically much closer to each other than previously thought. Right whales' habitat can be affected dramatically by climate changes along with Bowhead whales.  Western population  Continuous callosities are visible which are distinctive to the Atlantic species. In spring, summer and autumn, the western North Atlantic population feeds in a range stretching from Massachusetts to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy, the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. According to census of individual whales identified using photo-identification techniques, the latest available stock assessment data (August 2012) indicates that a minimum of 396 recognized individuals were known to be alive in the western North Atlantic in 2010, up from 361 in 2005. Distributions within other parts of Bay of Fundy is rather unknown, although whales are occasionally observed at various locations in northern parts such as in Baxters HarbourWhale sighting off Baxters' Harbour, Nova Scotia August 16, 2012 on YouTube.

December 21. 2014 Though their numbers are still scarce, some right whales migrate regularly into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, notably around the Gaspé Peninsula and in the Chaleur Bay, and up to Anticosti Island, Tadoussac and in the St. Lawrence River such as at Rouge Island. Until 1994, whales were regarded as rather vagrant migrants into St. Lawrence region, however annual concentrations of whales were discovered off Percé in 1995 and sightings in entire St. Lawrence regions have been shown gradual increases since in 1998. For example, in the survey conducted by the Canadian Whale Institute in 2006, three whales were detected off the peninsula.Canadian Whale Institute. RESEARCH, CONSERVATION & STEWARDSHIP PROJECTS . Retrieved on December 18. 2014 Some whales including cow and calf pairs also appear around Cape Breton Island with notable increasing regularities in recent years, notably since in 2014, and about 35 to 40 whales were confirmed around Prince Edward Island and Gaspe Peninsula in 2015. Further, the whales' regular range is known to reach up to off Newfoundland and the Labrador Sea, and several have been found in a former whaling ground east of Greenland's southern tip. Parts of the western group, especially for those seen regularly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, display different migratory or calving routines than other whales and these are so- called \\"Offshore Whales\\".

Retrieved on December 21. 2014 In early 2009, scientists recorded a record number of births among the western North Atlantic population. 39 new calves were recorded, born off the Atlantic coast of Florida and Georgia: In contrast, 2012 was the worst calving season since 2000, with only seven calves sighted – and one of those was believed to have died. This is significantly below the annual average of 20 calves per year over the last decade. As the gestation period for right whales is a year long, researchers believe that a lack of food in the whales' summer feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy during the summer of 2010 may be linked to the poor season in 2012. There were 411 of these animals left in 2019, when calves were born after a barren 2018.https://www.msn.com/en- us/news/technology/endangered-whale-experiencing-mini-baby-boom-off-new- england/ar-BBVU8m9?ocid=spartandhp The right whale was purported to have reached a population of 500 in the North Atlantic, which was assumed to have been achieved for the first time in centuries, when counted in 2013. The population of the whale has been increasing at about 2.5 percent per year, but this is below the optimal goal of 6 or 7 percent that researchers were hoping to attain. Sightings in recent years Aerial and shipboard surveys are conducted annually to locate and record seasonal distribution of North Atlantic right whales along the northeast and southeast United States coast. Researchers identify individual right whales, document whale behavior, monitor new calves, and respond to entangled whales.Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies, Population Monitoring The surveys have been used to produce seasonal maps showing the density of right whales (number of animals per square kilometer) throughout the U.S. east coast and Nova Scotia. NOAA Fisheries maintains an interactive map of recent right whale sightings.  Eastern population  In the eastern North Atlantic, the right whale population probably numbers in the low double digits at best, with little information known about their distribution and migration pattern. Scientists believe that this population may be functionally extinct.

Cintra Bay. and Bahia Gorrei, about 150 kilometers south of Villa Cisneros in the Western Sahara, the only known historical calving ground for this group, host no animals (or if any, then likely very few) nowadays, holding a situation similar to the Bay of Biscay area where many whales once congregated throughout years. Although there were several sightings in the late 20th century (see Bay of Biscay) and catch records indicate whales historically used the bay for both feeding and wintering, it is still unclear whether or not the Biscayne coasts were ever used as calving grounds. Other parts of coastlines or oceanic islands from Iberian Peninsula and Portugal to Morocco in north to south possibly reaching even Mauritania to Senegal. Locations such as Dakhla Peninsula and Bay of Arguin had been served potentially as wintering grounds similar to the Cintra and Gorrei Bays region.

Of all modern whaling grounds in European waters, Hebrides and the Shetland Islands were the center of whaling in the early 20th century, and any records afterwards these catches became scarce in eastern Atlantic where only two cow-calf pairs had been documented. Any calm waters in north such as Porth Neigwl, the Wadden Sea region,Lotze K.H., 2005. Radical changes in the Wadden Sea fauna and flora over the last2,000 years. Helgol Mar Res (2005) 59: pp.71–83.

Some might have reached to entrance of Baltic Sea and northern Scandinavian. Based on historical records, Scandinavian waters once had been a potential feeding area, and this idea corresponds with behaviors of the below mentioned vagrant individual \\"Porter\\" recorded in 1999 when he stayed in the fjord for several weeks, indicating the area provided to him a feasible condition for summering. Historical records suggest that summering grounds could have reached further north to northern coasts of Scandinavian Peninsula, and some might have turned up at the mouth of Hudson Bay. Predicted summering range models suggest that small numbers of right whales could have been present year-round in the Mediterranean Sea although it is unclear whether whales ever penetrated Turkish Straits to Marmara, Black, and Azov Seas (historical presences at northern Aegean Sea were considered in this study which didn't include the northernmost basins in study areas).  Sightings and confirmations in recent years  The last whale killed in Orio There have been a few sightings further east over the past few decades, with several sightings close to Iceland in 2003. There was speculation that these could be the remains of a virtually extinct Eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggest that they are more likely to be strays from further west. A few have been sighted in waters adjacent to Norway (two documented sightings in 1926 and 1999), Ireland, shelf waters west of Scotland,Species Information Sheet – Northern Right Whale in UK waters – Sea Watch Foundation Irish Sea, the Bay of Biscay in Spain, off the Iberian Peninsula, a cow-calf pair at Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, and continuous sightings of a single animal off the southwestern Tenerife in the Canary Islands in 1995. Subsequently, there have been two more sightings in Benderlau, La Gomera and some other observations were reported in Portugal and Galicia. A whale of unknown species, thought to be a right whale, was seen off Steenbanken, Schouwen-Duiveland (Netherlands) in July 2005 and was possibly the same animal previously seen off Texel in the West Frisian Islands. Another possible sighting was made along Lizard Point, Cornwall in May 2012. Few recent sightings have also been recorded from pelagic waters such as off Hebrides and on Rockall Basin as late as in 2000s. Right whales have also on rare occasion been observed in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the two records of a stranding (Italy) and a capture of one of a pair seen (Algeria) in early 20th century, one sighting recorded in Dutch sighting scheme possibly between 1954 and 1957, only one possible sighting have been confirmed. In May 1991, a petty officer of the Italian Navy happened to be in the water with his camera about off the small island of Sant' Antioco (southwestern Sardinia), when a right whale happened to swim by – his photos comprise the only confirmed sighting in the 20th century; on the other hand however, reliability of the record have been questioned due to failures to contact the photographers. Earlier known occurrences of right whales in the basin include the stranding of a juvenile near Taranto (southeastern Italy) in 1877 and the sighting of two (one of which was later captured) in the bay of Castiglione (Algiers) in 1888Marine Mammal Society Newsletter, Winter 1996 (Vol 4, No 4). and Portugal. The Norway sightings appear to be of vagrants, or strays from the western Atlantic stock. Catch records at Cape Verde Islands in spring-summer seasons are highly doubtful. Below is a list of some of recent records of right whales in eastern North Atlantic (not all of above-mentioned records and excluding vagrant records, according to the Spanish edition of this article).

This individual was later confirmed to be \\"Porter\\", an adult male in the catalog (No.1133). He was seen again back in Cape Cod in winter 2000, having traveled for over , making this the longest ever traveling record of right whales.Porter's Biography . New England Aquarium WebsiteHabitats-Migration Mystery. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium Website The area vicinity to Scandinavian Peninsula was once in the historical \\"North Cape Ground\\", one of the major whaling grounds for this species in the 17th century. In January 2009, one animal was sighted off Pico Island, Azores, the first confirmed appearance there since 1888. This animal was later identified as a female from the western Atlantic group, and nicknamed as \\"Pico\\" according to this event. Some individuals are known to show interesting patterns of movements which may possibly help researchers to deepen understandings of future re-colonization to eastern Atlantic, if possible.North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (1997) Are there right whales in the eastern North Atlantic? Right Whale News Volume 4.  Possible central population  As above mentioned, the existence of a possible third population, ranging from near Iceland or Greenland in the north to Bermudas or Bahamas in the south, has been mentioned by several biologists. Some right whales are now said to live primarily in Icelandic waters and occasionally join to the western population. In July 2003, during a search for the possibility of right whales inhabiting the historical Cape Farewell region carried out by the research team of the New England Aquarium with Jean Lemire and a Quebec film company, a female right whale – later named \\"Hidalgo\\" due to a scar mark on her head resembling a horse – was recorded in the Irminger Sea, southwest of the Iceland coast. In 2009, right whales appeared in waters around Greenland although their origin was not confirmed. Prior to this, no right whales had been killed or confirmed present off the coast of Greenland for around 200 years except for the sighting of \\"1718\\", a unique animal seen only twice (off Cape Farewell in July 1987 and at the Nova Scotian Shelf in June 1989). Several sightings in the area made in the 1970s may or may not be of right whales, as the critically endangered population of Bowhead whales are also present in the area. For southward migration, the sighting of two whales displaying courtship behaviors in the Bermuda was recorded by a team of researchers including Roger Payne in April, 1970.  Conservation status  Reconstruction of a North Atlantic right whale West Edmonton Mall's North Atlantic right whale bronze statue In the United States, this species is listed as “endangered” by the NMFS under the Endangered Species Act. It is also listed as \\"depleted\\" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. On a global level, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS, or the \\"Bonn Convention\\") is a multilateral treaty specializing in the conservation of migratory species, their habitats and migration routes. CMS has listed the North Atlantic right whale on Appendix I, which identifies it as a migratory species threatened with extinction. This obligates member nations to strive towards strict protection of these animals, habitat conservation or restoration, mitigation of obstacles to migration, and control of other factors that might endanger them. Additionally, CMS encourages concerted action among the range states of many Appendix I species. To that end, a small portion of the eastern Atlantic population's range is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The Atlantic area bounded on the west by a line running from Cape St. Vincent in southwest Portugal to Casablanca, Morocco, and on the east by the Straight of Gibraltar. Another multilateral treaty, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, (CITES, or the “Washington Convention”), also lists the North Atlantic right whale on its own Appendix I. Being so listed prohibits international trade (import or export) in specimens of this species or any derivative products (e.g. food or drug products, bones, trophies), except for scientific research and other exceptional cases with a permit specific to that specimen.  Whale watching  Curious whale lifting head, showing distinctive callosities to observers on boats Either land based or organized whale watching activities are available along east coasts from Canada in north to Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida to south. Stellwagen Bank Sanctuary has also been designated for watching this species. Onlookers lucky enough can spot them from shores time to time on whales' migration seasons especially for feeding (vicinity to Cape Cod such as at Race Point and Brier Island), and breeding/calving (off Georgia to Florida coasts) when whales strongly approach shores or enters rivers or estuaries such as at Outer Banks, Pamlico Sound, Indian River Inlet, Cape Lookout, Virginia Beach, Virginia, Golden Isles of Georgia, beaches on Florida (e.g. most notably at Flagler, Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra, Satellite, Crescent, and Cocoa, and any others like Ormond, New Smyrna, South Melbourne, Wrightsville, Vero), Boynton, and so on. There are some piers used for lookout points such as at Jacksonville and Wrightsville. With their low profile on the water, right whales can be difficult to spot, so all fishermen and boaters transiting through potential right whale habitat should keep a sharp lookout. Boaters should be advised that NOAA Fisheries has a \\"500-yard rule\\", prohibiting anyone from approaching within of a North Atlantic right whale.\\"Look Out for Right Whales\\", NOAA Fisheries. The regulations include all boaters, fishing vessels (except commercial fishing vessel retrieving gear), kayakers, surfers, and paddleboarders, and agencies such as the United States Coast Guard and the Massachusetts Environmental Police have been authorized to enforce it. Right whale sightings can be valuable to researchers, who recommend all sightings be reported. In Florida, the Marine Resources Council maintains a volunteer sighting network to receive sighting information from the public and verify sightings with trained volunteers.\\"North Atlantic Right Whale Program\\" , Marine Resources Council. Due to the species' status, as of 2014, there is no whale watching location in eastern and mid Atlantic, and oceanic islands feasible to observe right whales regularly. Among these, only off Iceland right whales have been encountered during watching tours (save for expeditions and land-based observations targeting for birds and other faunas), and several observations were made in Iceland during the 2000s.

Before commercial whaling in the North Pacific (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 right whales in the region. The taking of right whales in commercial whaling has been prohibited by one or more international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132 right whales in the Sea Okhotsk. plus an additional 104 North Pacific right whales from unspecified areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as \\"Endangered\\", and categorizes the Northeast Pacific population as \\"Critically Endangered\\". The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth.North Pacific right whale, Center for Biological Diversity.  Taxonomy  Since 2000, scientists have considered the right whales in the North Pacific and nearby seas to be a separate species, Eubalaena japonica, the North Pacific right whale. Genetic differences between E. japonica and E. australis are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.http://www.icrwhale.org/pdf/SC-F16-JR50.pdf Before 2000, right whales in the North Pacific were considered conspecific with right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere and all described as Eubalaena glacialis in the scientific literature. All these animals resemble each other in outward appearance very closely. The differences that separate them into separate species are genetic and discussed in the article on Balaenidae. The recognition of the different populations of Eubalaena whales as distinct species is supported by the Society for Marine Mammalogy, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the International Whaling Commission. The North Pacific, North Atlantic and Southern right whales are all members of the family Balaenidae. The bowhead whale found in the Arctic is also a balaenid whale, but sufficiently different to warrant its own genus Balaena. The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Pacific right whale and the other members of its family.  Description  North Pacific right whale by John Durban, NOAA E. japonica is a very large, thickset baleen whale. It very closely resembles the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis) the southern right whale (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales. E. japonica is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout. North Pacific right whales can reach in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale.

They are much larger than gray or humpback whales and also being very stout, particularly when compared to the other large baleen whales such as blue and fin whales. For 10 North Pacific right whales taken in the 1960s, their girth in front of the flippers was 0.73 of the total length of the whale. There have been claims that pectoral fins of pacific right whale are larger in portion than the other right whales and more pointed, and there may exist shape differences of tail by individuals or sex. Additionally, differences of coloration and shape (minor) of baleen plates between pacific and Atlantic have been noted. North Pacific right whale, Half Moon Bay, California, March 20, 1982, photo by Jim Scarff Right whales are also unique in that they all have callosities—roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids. The callosities appear in patches on its head immediately behind the blowholes, along the rostrum to the tip, which often has a large callosity, referred to by whalers as the \\"bonnet\\". The functional purpose of the callosities has not been determined. The closely related bowhead whale differs from the right whale by lacking any callosities, having a more arched jaw and longer baleen. The seasonal ranges of the two species do not overlap. The bowhead whale is found at the edge of the pack ice in more Arctic waters in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, and occurs in the Bering Sea only during winter. The bowhead whale is not found in the North Pacific. Although more than 15,000 right whales were killed by whalers in the North Pacific, there are remarkably few detailed descriptions of these whales. Most of our information about the anatomy and morphology of E. japonica comes from 13 whales killed by Japanese whalers in the 1960s and 10 whales killed by Russian whalers in the 1950s. Basic information about right whale lengths and sex are also available from coastal whaling operations in the early part of the 20th century.  Ecology and behavior   Feeding  Like right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods, mainly the species Calanus marshallae. They also have been reported off Japan and in the Gulf of Alaska, feeding on copepods of the genus Neocalanus with a small quantity of euphausiid larvae, Euphausia pacifica. Like other right whale species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming, in contrast to balaenopterid whales such as the blue and humpback whales which engulf prey in rapid lunges. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead they have very large heads and mouths that allows them to swim with their mouths open, the water with the copepods flowing in, then flowing sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. It takes millions of the tiny copepods to provide the energy a right whale needs. Thus, right whales must find copepods at very high concentrations, greater than 3,000 per cubic meter to feed efficiently. National Marine Fisheries Service researchers mapped the southeast Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska for areas with sufficient productivity to support such concentrations and analyzed the roles of bathymetry and various gyres in concentrating copepods to such densities.  Behavior  Breaching right whale, Half Moon Bay, California, March 20, 1982, photo by Jim Scarff There have been very few, short visual observations of right whale behavior in the North Pacific. The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation. By the time scientific interest in this species developed, very few whales remained and nowhere in the eastern North Pacific or Bering Sea could observers reliably find them. Based on limited observations in the 19th century, it was noted that the more extensively whaling was conducted, the more aggressive and harder to approach the whales became. These traits correspond with some of recent observations in which whales seemed to be very sensitive to vessels and easily swim away with by submerging longer to avoid ships enough for onlookers and observers to lose sights. Pre-World War I whaling logs from Japan also describe right whales as being among the most sensitive of targeted baleen or toothed species to the impacts of whaling, as they immediately fled from locations where whaling took place, possibly abandoning their habitat for good.Kondo I., 2001, 日本沿岸捕鯨の興亡, Sanyo-sha, original from University of Michigan As of 2006, scientists had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales. Observations total probably less than 50 hours over the last 50 years. What little is known about North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds.

Retrieved June 9, 2014  Vocalizations  Right whales in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic make a variety of vocalizations that have been researched extensively in the last decade. Because the numbers of right whales in the North Pacific are so small, and the whales are located in more remote areas, the study of North Pacific right whale vocalizations has had more challenges and there are fewer recordings. All of the sounds recorded for North Pacific right whales have been recorded on the northern portion of their range—in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. It is unknown whether they made additional or different vocalization on their wintering grounds or on the western part of their range. From these relatively few samples it appears that right whales in the North Pacific make calls similar to those of other right whale species (Eubalaena spp.), although the calls may differ in some details and in the relatively frequency of usage of different calls. These calls are all low frequency sounds that appear to have social communication functions, but what exactly those functions are is not yet known. There is no evidence that right whales' sounds are used for echolocation as is seen in dolphins and toothed whales. Spectrogram of a right whale \\"upcall\\" recorded in the SE Bering Sea, Sue Moore, NMFS National Marine Mammal Laboratory (help in interpreting spectrograms) Between 2000 and 2006 NOAA researchers deployed passive acoustic listening devices in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska and recorded at least 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls . Nearly all of these calls came from the shallow shelf waters at approximately of the southeastern Bering Sea in what is now designated Critical Habitat for this species. 80% were frequency-modulated \\"up-calls\\" at an average 90–150 Hz and 0.7 second duration. \\"Down-up\\" calls constituted about 5% of the calls, and swept down for 10–20 Hz before becoming a typical \\"up-call\\". Other call types, e.g. downsweeps and constant-tonal \\"moans\\" constituted less than 10% of total calls. The calls were clumped temporally—apparently involving some level of social interaction, as has been found in the calls of right whales in other oceans. The calls came more at night than during the day. The upcalls of right whales are sufficiently distinct from the calls of other whale species that they can be used to identify the presence of right whales in the area by the calls alone, if care is taken in the review of those calls. Humpback whales also occur in much of the range of the North Pacific right whale, including in the Bering Sea, and parts of the highly variable and complex humpback calls can be similar to right whale calls, similar enough that confirmation that a call is in fact from a right whale usually requires a human to review the entire context of the call rather than simply relying on an algorithm to identify the call as is possible for other species. Right whales in other oceans have been recorded making a percussive vocalization labeled a \\"gunshot call\\" or gunshot. The role and purpose of this call is uncertain. However, until 2017, it had never been proven than it was right whales in the North Pacific that were the whales making this type of call, so detection of gunshots was not considered a reliable indicator of the presence of right whales. Until recently it was thought that the most common call used by North Pacific right whales was the \\"upcall\\". This call is relatively stereotypic among all right whale individuals and populations. The next most common call has been labeled the \\"downcall\\" and this is also fairly stereotypic. Right whales also make a variety of other frequency-variable calls of different durations. However, these are so varied, they have not been categorized by researchers. Until recently it was not proven that North Pacific right whales made a percussive call made by right whales in other oceans called a \\"gunshot\\"—that sounds like a shotgun being fired. Gunshot calls appear to be made by males and may be associated with some aspect of mating. Here is a link to audio recordings of these types of calls from a North Atlantic right whale. In 2017, sophisticated and painstaking research by NOAA scientist Jessica L. Crance and other NOAA scientists was able to definitively attribute gunshots to North Pacific right whales, and found that among the animals sampled gunshots were heard ~50 times more frequently than upcalls. Because gunshots to be used much more and are less likely to be mistaken for a humpback call, this should improve the detectability of right whales in the North Pacific using passive acoustic monitoring, and improve the ability to locate individual whales from ships as well.  Habitat preferences  Right whales' habitat preferences vary depending on the time of year. In spring, summer and fall, the right whales are seeking concentrations of food. In winter, in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, pregnant females and their calves generally seek out shallow, protected bays in which to give birth and raise their calves. In the North Pacific, the pattern of right whales seeking out areas of high food is the same, but female right whales and calves in the North Pacific do not show the clear pattern of concentrating in nearshore aggregations. The distribution of North Pacific right whales in winter remains a major mystery. Since there are so few right whales to observe in the North Pacific, and they are generally feeding far from shore, alternative analyses of habitat preferences are required. Gregr used maps of historic whaling catches and added oceanographic data from other sources to identify preferred habitats. His analysis suggest that on the scale of ocean basins, North Pacific right whales seek out regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurred predictably from year to year). However, and a more localized regional scale these correlations weakened. In winter, North Pacific right whales can occur from the Bering Sea as far south as the Bonin Islands. It is the whales that go south that are frequently seen close to shore. Right whales have historically been found closer to shore in very shallow than other large baleen whales, but they are by no means limited to near-shore habitats. There is a record of a female North Atlantic right whale to give a birth at 63 km from shores of Jacksonville, Florida. Many of the very near shore sightings of North Pacific right whales have occurred in Russia, Japan, and South Korea.Kim, H.W., K.J. Park, H. Sohn, Y.-R. An, D.-H. An, 2015, Entanglement of North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) off Korean waters., SC/66a/HIM/15., Report to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee Annual Meeting, San Diego, California. They have been seen to enter into ports, staying just next to piers or wharfs, and there have been regular records of whales being entangled in set nets along Japanese and South Korean coasts in recent years. There has been a record of rather aggressive interspecies interactions between a right whale and a pod of grey whales off California, making it the only record of possible interspecies aggression among baleen whales, but there have been an observation of social behaviors between the two species on Sakhalin. Furthermore, there is no decent population of grey whales existing outside of North Pacific as of 2014, therefore extents of interspecies competitions, if ever happened, or peaceful habitat sharing between these coastal species, before whaling, are unknown. A theory of humpback whales to invade and become a dominant species over Hawaiian islands, former wintering ground for right whales, in the past few centuries, corresponding with the timing of right whale hunts across the Pacific Ocean, had been claimed as well. Summering congregations were known to occur among various areas based on whaling records.

Historic and current population   Historic population  Before the arrival of the pelagic whaling fleet after 1835 into the range of the North Pacific right whale, the whale's population size, at least in the eastern part of its range, was probably at its original population size—in the range of 20,000–30,000 whales. The part of the whale population in the west around Japan may have been reduced from its original size as a result of the historic net whaling. There was essentially no aboriginal hunting for right whales along the west coast of North America by Native Americans in the 19th century or before. There was a small hunt for whales in the Aleutian Island by Aleuts but this was almost certainly so small that it did not reduce the original whale population size. Accordingly, one can consider 1835 as a good year to use as a baseline for the historic population, at least in the eastern North Pacific, and the northern parts of the western North Pacific. There were no attempts to objectively estimate the population in the 1800s, so deriving a population estimate from the number of animals caught in the whale fishery is the only way attempted to date to determine the historic population size. In the single decade of 1840–49, between 21,000 and 30,000 right whales were killed in the North Pacific, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. To support this level of take by whalers in a decade, the population of this slow reproducing species of Okhotsk and nearby waters would have had to be in the range of 20,000–30,000 animals at a minimum. For comparison, a population of 20,000 or more animals is comparable to the current and presumably early 19th century population of Gray whales in the North Pacific On the west side of the North Pacific, the situation was different because the Japanese had a tradition of hunting right whales from shore in Japan with the use of nets which had started centuries before the arrival of American whalers. In Japanese shore-based net whaling, right whales were the prime target, and the whale fisheries were devastating to the stocks as catch quantities declined greatly in relatively short periods, and the effect of the industries were more notable on the whale populations than the later American whaling,末田智樹, 2009, 近世日本における捕鯨漁場の地域的集中の形成過程-西海捕鯨業地域の特殊性の分析-, 岡山大学経済学会雑誌40(4).

Among this, it has been revealed that Japanese people have been trying to shift responsibility of whale declines to the later American whalers to control public opinions since at the end of the Edo period.熊野太地浦捕鯨史編纂委員会, 1990, 「鯨に挑む町―熊野の太地」. Retrieved November 30, 2014  Current population  The current population of North Pacific right whales is estimated at approximately 30–35 whales in the eastern North Pacific and 300+ whales in the western portion of its range. Even if one considers the combined population size estimate of both apparent stocks of this species, this is the smallest known population of any whale species, and probably only 2 percent of its population in 1835 when pelagic whaling first reached the North Pacific. Accordingly, the species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and the eastern population is categorized as Extremely Endangered. The International Whaling Commission and the United States National Marine Fisheries Service consider North Pacific right whales found in these two areas to exist as two somewhat discrete populations and manage them as separate stocks. The extent of independence of these two apparent populations of whales both geographically and genetically is very poorly understood due to lack of data, but discussing them separately is convenient for describing recent sightings and population estimates.  Bering Sea and North East Pacific  Most recent sightings and acoustic records of right whales in the eastern part of their range have come from a relatively small area in the southeastern Bering Sea. Most of these records are within, or near, the U.S. designated Critical Habitat for the North Pacific Right whale. A much smaller number of sightings has come from the Gulf of Alaska and the coasts of British Columbia and further south. The very small number of North Pacific right whale calls detected during the NMFS acoustic research—hundreds per year contrast with the vastly greater number (hundreds of thousands) of bowhead whale calls during migration in the western Arctic and blue whale calls off California—further reinforces the conclusion that the population size of North Pacific right whales in the Bering Sea is very small. A 2015 review of the status of all the baleen whales concluded that genetic and photo-ID mark-recapture analyses each suggest there are only about 30 animals left in the eastern subpopulation, mainly observed in the southeastern Bering Sea and with a male bias to the population. The 2015 reviewers had found no new information that increased the population estimate above that made in 2010 when National Marine Fisheries Service scientists estimated that the population of North Pacific right whales that summer in the southeastern Bering Sea was about 30 animals. Prior estimates of larger current right whale population numbers in the eastern North Pacific were highly speculative. A comprehensive review of sighting data and population estimates in 2001 concluded that \\"none of the published estimates of abundance relating to North Pacific right whales can be regarded as reliable ... [most] estimates appear to be little more than conjecture ... [and] no quantitative data exist to confirm any of these estimates.\\"National Marine Fisheries Service: Review of the Status of the Right Whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans (2006). (PDF). Retrieved September 15, 2011. The 2010 article was the first to present an objective quantitative rationale for its low estimates. The scientists' mark-recapture photographic studies suggested a population of 31 whales (95% confidence level = 23–54); and their genotyping study suggested a population of 28 whales (95% confidence level = 24–42). The scientists estimated the population contains eight females (95% confidence level = 7–18) and 20 males (95% confidence level = 17–37). They concluded that \\"Although these estimates may relate to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger. In 2004, at least two calves were seen. In the Gulf of Alaska, there have been opportunistic sightings (1998, 2004) and acoustic records (2000) of individual right whales near Kodiak Island. Additionally, there have been two sightings of individual right whales off British Columbia in 2013. A third sighting was recorded in 2018.  Sea of Okhotsk and Western North Pacific  The 2015 review of whale status concluded that there are more right whales in the western North Pacific than in the eastern region, but even estimates of that population still places it among the world's smallest populations of marine mammal. In the west, most recent sightings of right whales occur along the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Kurile Islands, in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Commander Islands, along the coasts of Japan. A map of this area includes Russian territorial waters (12 miles from shore), Russian Exclusive Economic Zone out to 200 miles from shore, Japanese territorial and EEZ waters, and some international waters, even in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk. As a result, surveys for whales and fisheries have generally not been able to comprehensively survey the region, particularly close to shore, as has been possible to do in the eastern North Pacific. = The Sea of Okhotsk = In the late 1980s and early 1990s, observers on Japanese research vessels reported 28 sightings of right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. From this sample, the Japanese scientists estimated a population of 900 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk, albeit with wide confidence intervals (90% CI = 400–2,100).Miyashita T, and Kato H. 2001. Recent data on the status of right whales in the NW Pacific Ocean. Report of the International Whaling Commission. SC/M98/RW11. Data obtained during Japanese sighting surveys for minke whales in 1989, 1990, and 1992 led Japanese scientists to estimate a population of 922 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk (95% CI: 404–2,108) (Miyashita and Kato 1998, IWC 2001:26). However, the reviewers who prepared the IUCN Red List documentation concluded that given the very wide confidence intervals surrounding the Japanese estimate and the lack of clear evidence of any recent increase in numbers, the lower end of the range of that abundance estimate (i.e., about 400) should be used for assessment (Reilly et al. 2008k). Other scientists also wrote that the Japanese estimate was based on faulty methodology and the population was likely to be only half as large or smaller. After a gap of 14 years, Japanese researchers were able to resurvey this area in 2005 and apparently saw similar numbers of right whales in the same area. = Kuril Islands = A team of National Geographic and tourism companies encountered three whales at Paramushir and Shumshu, succeeded in swimming and taken underwater images, and aerial footage using a drone in 2017.Myakisheva A.. 2017\\\\. . instapu.com.

Another 10 sightings of right whales in five groups were reported in 2012 surveys southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula and off the Kuril Islands (Sekiguchi et al. 2014) and(Ovsyanikova et al. 2015). The 2015 reviewers concluded that all data collected since 1992 in the western North Pacific, especially the Sea of Okhotsk, need to be analyzed for a new abundance estimate so that an assessment can be completed for this subpopulation.  Historic and current distribution   Historic distribution  Before 1840, the range of the North Pacific right whale was extensive and had probably remained the same for at least hundreds of years. It could be found from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the coast of Canada. Our knowledge of the historic distribution of this whale comes almost entirely from the logbooks of the pelagic whalers (and the records of the shore-based whaling in Japan.) The first such effort were a series of charts known subsequently as the Maury \\"Whale Charts\\". In the late 1830s, the U.S. Navy sought wind and current information for areas of the oceans outside the trade routes regularly traveled by merchant ships. The principal mariners who ventured away from the main trade routes were whalers. One of the U.S.'s first oceanographers, Naval Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, entered into an agreement with deal with the American pelagic whalers. If they provided him with their logbooks, from which he could extract wind and current information, he would in return prepare maps for them showing where whales were most concentrated. Between 1840 and 1843, Maury and his staff processed over 2,000 whaling logbooks and produced not only the famous Wind and Current Charts used by mariners for over a century, but also a series of Whale Charts. The most detailed showed by month and 5° of latitude and longitude: (a) the number of days on which whaling ships were in that sector; (b) the number of days on which they saw right whales; and (c) the number of days on which the saw sperm whales. In the North Pacific, these charts summarize more than 8,000 days on which the whalers encountered right whales and the searching effort by month and sector. The maps thus provide a crude measure of the relative abundance of right whales by geographic sector and month, controlled for the very non- random searching effort of the whalers. In 1935, Charles Townsend from the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society) reviewed an overlapping set 2,000 whaling logbooks and mapped the locations of whale taken by species. His Chart CTownsend Charts. Chart C. wcs.org shows catch locations around the world, including the location by month of most of the 2,118 right whales taken in the North Pacific between 1839 and 1909, using data copied from 249 logbooks. His charts do not adjust for the nonrandom distribution of whalers. Chart C shows three main concentrations of right whales—one in the Gulf of Alaska; one along Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk; and another in the Sea of Japan. Maury's detailed whale charts in this series languished largely forgotten in a few libraries until the 1980s. when they began to be studied more rigorously. The Maury charts have an advantage over the Townsend chart in that the number of whales seen/killed in a given area could be adjusted for the amount of searching effort that had occurred, giving a more accurate indication of the species abundance in that area in that month. The Maury charts also quantify the searching effort by region and month, whereas in the Townsend charts searching effort is dealt with only qualitatively. North Pacific whalers hunted mainly in the summer, and that is reflected in the Maury Whale Charts. There were almost no winter sightings and very few south of 20°N. The densest concentrations occurred along both coasts of Kamchatka and in the Gulf of Alaska. These initial studies of the historic records were reviewed more rigorously and combined with more recent information in 2004. The Maury charts were based on tables transcribed by two assistants. More recent examination of the logbooks directly revealed that one of the assistants made numerous errors in the transcription of the logbooks. Recently, the data from the data sheets behind the Maury and Townsend charts and other logbook data has been combined rigorously to provide the best maps yet of distribution of North Pacific right whales in the 19th century. Of particular interest are the questions of how many \\"stocks\\" of right whales exist in the North Pacific. Was there just a single population across the North Pacific? Was there an eastern population that summered in the Gulf of Alaska and a second population in the western North Pacific? Was the population in the Sea of Okhotsk a third population distinct from the whales found in the Pacific east of Kamchatka? Recently, researchers reanalyzed this early whaling data, along with more recent, but much sparser, sighting data. They conclude that there are probably at least two stocks of right whales in the western and eastern North Pacific, but that it is still unclear whether the Okhotsk population is a separate stock. Though the North Pacific right whale's distribution is usually more temperate than that of the more polar Bowhead whale, there are several records of the two species inhabiting the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk at the same time.Shepherdess, of Mystic, June 25, 1849, Nicholson Whaling Collection (NWC); Julian, of New Bedford, June 25, July 6, 1849, NWC; Good Return, of New Bedford, Aug. 25, 1849, Old Dartmouth Historical Society (ODHS); Corinthian, of New Bedford, June 26, 1852, ODHS; Governor Troup, of New Bedford, Sept. 9, 1852, NWC; Coral, of New Bedford, Sept. 13, 1852, NWC. E. japonica summer distribution extends north into the southeastern part of the Bering Sea. In summer, the Bowhead migrates north through the Bering Straits and is in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. In winter, the ice-loving Bowhead moves south into the Bering Sea, but the right whales have migrated further south of the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific. Catch records suggest that historical ranges were much broader than that of current status, and was strongly overlapping with ranges of bowhead whales. In Bering Sea, feeding/summering grounds could have reached further north up to the Kusilvak Census Area such as at Kokechik and Scammon Bays in east, north of St. Matthew Island and Nunivak Island to south of the St. Lawrence Island in the central, in Litke Strait and the Karaginsky Island and Karaginsky Gulf in the west.

On August 10, 2004, a group of two were seen in the Bering Sea. Another sighting of 17 including two calves was noted in September, and one in the Gulf of Alaska. In 2005, 12 right whales were seen in October just north of Unimak Pass. In August 2015, NOAA Fisheries conducted a three-week dedicated ship survey for North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska southeast of Kodiak Island covering 2,500 nautical miles with both visual observers and acoustic detection devices (sonobuoys). On March 10 and March 16 they heard calls from a single right whale in the area of Barnabas Trough southeast of Kodiak Island in the general area of the designated Critical Habitat. Despite intensive searching, they were unable to spot the animals visually. Review of more than 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls detected by passive listening devices between 2000 and 2006 strongly suggests that the whales migrate into the southeast Bering Sea in late spring and remain until late fall. The earliest were in late May and the latest in December. The peak calling period was July through October. Most were detected from shallow shelf sites within the designated Critical Habitat area. From October through December 2005, several calls were detected at the northwestern middle-shelf and the deeper shelf sites, suggesting that they may appear at different seasons and during migration.

Marine Mammal COUNCIL. This area's remoteness makes observation very difficult and expensive. Based on survey records from \\"JARPN\\" and \\"JARPN II\\" conducted by Institute of Cetacean Research, the 40 right whales seen were distributed mainly in offshore waters from 1994 to 2007. Pelagic whalers in the 19th century hunted large numbers of right whales along the coasts of Kamchatka and in the Sea of Okhotsk. The latter area is a large sea, ice covered most of the year, entirely in Russian waters. Due to Russian restrictions on access, little was known about whales in this sea. Soviet scientists indicated that historically two groups of right whales existed within western North Pacific that migrate along different side of Japanese Archipelago and each group had unique characteristics in distribution patterns due to geographical factors; the Okhotsk group which was distributed in more coastal waters with higher densities of congregations, and the Pacific group which have been distributed on far broader ranges and more was more oceanic (offshore). Of these, the Okhotsk group were regarded to be wiped out much earlier than the Pacific group because of geographical and distribution characteristics that eased whalers to hunt the targets, and this indication corresponds with the extreme rarity or virtual extinction of right whales in Sea of Japan or East China and South China Sea today. Survey records from \\"JARPN\\" and \\"JARPN II\\" conducted from 1994 to 2007 by the Institute of Cetacean Research detected 28 groups of right whales totaling 40 individuals with 6 cow-calf pairs distributed mainly in offshore waters.SC/J09/JR35 Matsuoka, Koji; Kiwada, Hiroshi; Fujise, Yoshihiro and Miyashita, Tomio.

Pelagic waters off southeastern Kamchatka Peninsula is the location possibly with the highest sighting frequency in recent years even though this area is far offshore and it is unclear where these whales migrate southward.  Migration  Past thinking about North Pacific right whale migration presumed a paradigm of migratory behavior similar to that of other baleen whales in the North Pacific. Perhaps the extreme example of North Pacific whale migration is that of Gray whale. Nearly all the Gray whales that summer in the Bering Sea migrate to wintering grounds off Baja California. In summer and winter, nearly all the gray whales are either at the northern or southern ends of their range. Initially scientists assumed that North Pacific right whales had similar migratory pattern. Analysis of 19th century pelagic whaling suggest that North Pacific right whales do migrate south in winter, but the whaling data did not indicate any specific migratory routes as seen in gray whales. The 19th century whalers travelled north in spring and south in fall. To some extent the apparent North Pacific right whale migration shown in the whaling data is an artifact of bias in the whaling effort. More recent studies of right whales in North Atlantic and the North Pacific suggest a migratory pattern that is quite different than the gray whale example. In the North Atlantic, many right whales remain in the northern part of their range throughout winter. It appears that while some right whales migrate far south to warmer waters, a substantial percentage of the population either does not migrate as far south or may not migrate at all. The collection of acoustic records of North Pacific right whales has revealed that portions of the North Pacific right whale population remains in the Bering Sea at least as late as December and as early as January. The acoustic research done in the Unimak Pass has shown right whales passing through this pass. No coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales. Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown. Off the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries, and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent.\\"Records of North Pacific Right Whales along the Coasts of California, Baja, Oregon and Washington\\". sfcelticmusic.com.

(with smaller areas scattered among southern Korean and Japanese waters). In Asia, southernmost of areas with higher catch densities were the pelagic waters between continental China (latitudes equal to Shanghai and Zhoushan Islands) and west of Kyushu in south to southern coasts of Korean Peninsula during the summer. Some whales were caught off Hainan Island and this area is possibly the southernmost location of known range for the western population. The whales are also known to occur around the northern Mariana Islands. A map had been academically created which forecasts potential wintering habitats for right whales in north Pacific according to environmental factors corresponding to that of north Atlantic species, including further south to Hainan, Leizhou Peninsula, and northern Gulf of Tonkin.

The population (s) historically migrated through the Sea of Japan to the Yellow and Bohai Seas was likely driven to functional extinction. No right whales have been recorded in China and in South Korea since the catches in October 1974 for Korea and 1977 for China, and there have been only two confirmed records of a stranded and a by-caught individuals since in 1901 in Japanese waters of the Sea of Japan.

What factors caused sudden rise in sighting trends in the 2010s and disappearance in the 2000s in many of former range especially for mid-lower latitudes are unknown. The Bonin Islands are the only location where sighting interval of constance was confirmed and succeed underwater filming in modern times. Off Japan, sudden rises in number were confirmed in 2003, 2006, 2008, and in 2011 where an exceptionally large number was recorded in 2011; at least 3 or more sightings, 1 entanglement, 1 stranding of 18 m animal. Fragments of a lower jaw, measuring 4.6 m in length and likely to be artificially sliced off, was discovered on a beach in Akkeshi in June 2014.  Western North Pacific  = Japan = The occurrence of North Pacific right whales in Japanese waters appears to show several patterns. Historic and modern sightings appear to occur more frequently in three areas: (1) the north, particularly north of Hokkaido, (2) along the coasts of central Japan, and (3) among Japan's southern islands, particularly the Bonin Islands. The waters around and north of Hokkaido historically where regions where 19th century pelagic whalers hunted for right whales during summer and fall. This region and north through the Kuril Islands, the southern Sea of Okhotsk and Kamchatka were feeding grounds for the right whales. Some of the recent sightings of right whales off Japan are consistent with this pattern. Right whales were formerly abundant off the coast of northeastern Japan where there have been a few sightings in recent years including observations from ICR research surveys (single animals confirmed off Kushiro, Hokkaido, in September 2002Kishiro, T. et al.

A right whale, most likely the same individual, was seen in the area for the following two weeks until a pod of local killer whales came back to Shari coasts. The observer noted many of local tour-operating boats cruising at high speeds did not seem to detect the whale resting on water surface and forced the right whale to submerge quickly to avoid collisions. In 2018 and 2019, additional sightings have been made from the west coast of the peninsula. 2018 sighting and one of two sightings in 2019 have been made by the same tour operator, Doutou Kanko Kaihatsu (Corporation) (:jp:道東観光開発). The occurrence of right whales along the coasts of central Japan appears to reflect the migration of right whales past these points. There are some locations along the Pacific side of Honshu where sightings are particularly more common; from south of Tokyo Bay to all around the Izu Peninsula, from the Izu Islands to the Bonin Islands, the Kii Peninsula, Cape Muroto and adjacent waters. In the first area, there was one entanglement freed alive in April 2000 off Tateyama, and two strandings at Izu Ōshima in 2002 and 2005. Some right whales still migrate south along Japan's coasts particularly the Pacific side of the archipelago, but what portion of the southward migration passes Japan is unknown. The occurrence of right whales among the southern Japanese islands suggest that a wintering ground may occur around there.

Wintering/calving grounds  No coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales. Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown. Most recent sightings of E. japonica occurred near the coasts; however, as of 2014, none of studies to detect the wintering/calving grounds for E. japonica have been successful though there is an ongoing project by North Pacific Research Board to locate those areas with a hypothetical situation that E. japonica historically preferred coastal waters along east coasts of North American continent.The North Pacific Research Board.

These areas are known to be feasible for feeding/summering; hence, it is possible that it is not always necessarily for right whales in North Pacific to migrate to warmer waters for wintering/calving, and historical wintering ranges could have been much broader than previously considered. Large portions of southern rights also wintered in pelagic waters in the past, from sub-polar to nearby Equator regions.Carroll L. E. (2011).

Retrieved November 7. 2014 In winter, the whales' distribution is particularly mysterious. There have been a few sightings close to shores in California and even Baja, particularly in the 1990s along locations like La Jolla, Point Sur, Big Sur coasts, Piedras Blancas, San Simeon, Point Montara, and in Santa Barbara Channel.Woodhouse D. Jr., Strickley J., 1982, Sighting of Northern Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Santa Barbara Channel They have been rare, of short duration and none since 1998. Largest numbers of whales sighted at one times in eastern Pacific outside of SE Bering Sea since after the late 20th century were of 8 animals off Destruction Island in 1959, sightings off Cape Flattery of 3 whales in and 1967 and 6 or 7 whales in 1973, 4 whales at the mouth of Yakutat Bay in March 1979, a pod of 2 or 3 whales at Three Arch Rocks in Oregon in 1994, and likely a pair seen off southwest of San Miguel Island in February 2015. In the western Pacific, the latest of recent records were of a close encounter by a yachter with a cow-calf pair off Sajima Island in Sagami Bay in the early 2000s and a pod appeared close to the pier on Mikura Island in 2008.  Eastern North Pacific  A right whale off Anacapa Island in May 2017. Off the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries, and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent. Until recently, most researchers thought that right whales in the eastern North Pacific wintered off the west coast of North America, particularly along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California. There have been few winter sightings in all these areas, particularly in California. A more detailed study argues that these single individuals were merely stragglers. Notwithstanding 7 days/week whale-watching operations in several parts of this range, there have been only 17 sightings between Baja and Washington state. The absence of calves from historic California stranding data suggests that this area was never an important calving or wintering ground. When a right whale was observed along the coast of La Jolla in 2017, the animal was initially misidentified as a gray whale.  Western North Pacific  Modern observation of right whales in southern Japan and in Izu and Bonin Islands, and in Amami Ōshima, didn't show any signs of whales spending long periods there (although being relaxed, resorting activities have been confirmed) and mostly whales left in a few days, thus where these individuals spent most time in those winters are largely unclear. Only record of longer staying was of Shiretoko sighting in 2013 as possibly the same individual stayed along western coasts of the peninsula for two weeks, and this case was in summer. It is unclear whether the two sightings from the same area on June 25 and July 19, 2019 belong to the same individual (see above). There are remote (hence less pressures from impacts of human activities) and unstudied areas still possessing less – damaged environments where right whales were historically distributed, scattering among North Pacific and adjacent waters. These include northern proportions of Sea of Japan within Russian, North Korean, and Japanese EEZ such as along Primorsky Krai like Rudnaya bay and Peter the Great Bay, northern Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands such as at East Korea Bay, Ulleungdo, Oki Islands, pacific islands, atolls, seamounts, and guyots in lower latitude such as Ladd Seamount, north of Northern Mariana Islands, north of Babuyan Islands, small, outer islands and atolls of Taiwan and those in South China Sea such as Pengjia Islet, Green Island, Lanyu, adjacent to Kenting and Dapeng Bay like Xiaoliuqiu, Dongsha Atoll, and vicinity to Marshall Islands, and Midway Islands. According to other Eubalaena species' seasonal distribution, some proportions of Pacific right whales could winter in colder waters, and congregation areas could also be restricted into particular harbors or straits of particular oceanic islands. It could be also said that wintering distributions of E. japonica could have extended further south to regions near the Equator line, according to the historical distributions of right whales in South Pacific that a population existed to winter on pelagic waters on lower latitude which is comparable to latitudes of Diego Garcia, Egmont Islands, and Great Chagos Bank, or even crossing the line on occasions where E. australis have been known to reach Kiribati, Gabon, and E. glacialis likely migrated south to Mauritania to Senegal in the past.

Threats  In adopting a Recovery Plan for the North Pacific right whale, the United States government (NOAA) described its evaluation of the various threats to the continued survival of the species.  Unsustainably small population  When populations of wild animals get very small, the population becomes much more vulnerable to certain risks than larger populations. One of these risks is inbreeding depression. A second risk of very small populations is their vulnerability to adverse events. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS stated E. japonica low reproductive rates, delayed sexual maturity, and reliance on high juvenile survivorship combined with its specialized feeding requirements of dense schools of copepods \\"make it extremely vulnerable to environmental variation and demographic stochasticity at such low numbers\\". For example, a localized food shortage for one or more years may reduce the population below a minimum size. As the NMFS Status Review notes: \\"Zooplankton abundance and density in the Bering Sea has been shown to be highly variable, affected by climate, weather, and ocean processes and in particular ice extent.\\" A third risk is an inability to find mating partners. With so few whales in such a large area, simply finding a mate is difficult. Right whales generally travel alone or in very small groups. In other oceans, breeding females attract mates by calling. The success of this strategy depends upon having males within hearing range. As expanding shipping traffic increases the ocean's background noise, the audible range for such mating calls has decreased.  Oil exploration, extraction, transport and spills  Oil and gas exploration and production in the right whale's range could threaten the species' survival as a result of oil spills, other pollution, ship collisions and noise. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS notes that the development of the Russian oil fields off the Sakhalin Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk \\"is occurring within the habitat\\" of the western population of North Pacific right whales. There have been recent oil spills in the Bering Sea. In 2005, the wreck of the M/V Selendang Ayu near Unalaska released approximately of fuel oil and of diesel into the Bering Sea. The exploration phase of oil development is characterized by numerous ships engaged in seismic testing to map undersea geological formations. Testing involves blasts of noise which echo off the undersea rock formations. These explosions have been banned in the Beaufort Sea during the time of year that bowheads are present. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS concludes: \\"In general, the impact of noise from shipping or industrial activities on the communication, behavior and distribution of right whales remains unknown.\\" On April 8, 2008, a NMFS review found that there had been no recent Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities in or adjacent to the areas designated as critical habitat for E. japonica. On the same day, the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) published a notice of a proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 for in the North Aleutian Basin. In January 2009, the MMS reported in a Scoping Report for the Environmental Impact Statement for the Lease Sale that \\"Many commentators expressed concern about impacts resulting from industrial activity and noise to the North Pacific right whales.\\" More than half of the proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 in the Bering Sea is within the designated critical habitat of the North Pacific right whale.map.

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). Department of the Interior (DOI) Right whales were not mentioned specifically in the reasons for this withdrawal.  Environmental changes  The habitat of E. japonica is changing in ways that threaten its survival. Two environmental effects of particular concern are global warming and pollution. The high densities of copepods that right whales require for normal feeding are the result of high phytoplankton productivity and currents which aggregate the copepods. Satellite studies of right whales show them traveling considerable distances to find these localized copepod concentrations. Global warming can affect both copepod population levels and the oceanographic conditions which concentrate them. This ecological relationship has been studied intensively in the western North Atlantic.  Hybridization with bowhead whales  Recently, scientists have begun to notice that the warming Arctic Ocean and land is resulting in changed distribution of species with the result of breaking down climate barriers that have prevented hybridization between closely related species. The most reported examples have been the three confirmed grizzly–polar bear hybrids. In 2010, a team led by National Marine Mammal Laboratory ecologist Brendan Kelly counted 34 possible hybridizations between distinct populations or species of Arctic marine mammals, many of which are endangered or threatened. These observed hybridizations included in 2009, a cross between a bowhead whale and a North Pacific right whale in the Bering Sea. Kelly stated that \\"The breedings between the North Pacific right whale, whose numbers have fallen below 200, and the more numerous bowhead whale, could push the former to extinction. (Over time, the hybrids would begin to outnumber the sparse right whales.)\\" Co-author Andrew Whitely wrote: \\"Breedings between these marine mammals near the North Pole are likely to result in fertile offspring, because many of these animals have the same number of chromosomes...[and] Over the short term the hybrid offspring from these Arctic animal matings will likely be strong and healthy, because unlike inbreeding, which magnifies deleterious genes, so- called outbreeding can mask these genes ... But over time, as the hybrids mate randomly, those harmful genes will come out of hiding and make the offspring less fit and less capable of surviving.\\"Retrieved July 29, 2011.

Entanglement in fishing gear and interaction with marine debris  In its 2013 evaluation of the threats to survival of the North Pacific right whale, NOAA examined the possible impacts of entanglement in fishing gear and ingestion of marine debris. Entanglement in fishing gear is a major threat to the survival of the North Atlantic right whale. Marine debris includes, among other items, abandoned or lost fishing gear and small plastic items that could be ingested. There is year around commercial fishing in the range of the North Pacific right whale in both the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. and also in the western part of its range around Kamchatka, the sea of Okhotsk, and the Japan. Entanglement in fishing gear can both result in the death of the whale relatively quickly, or result in long-term stress that reduces the whale's health leading to less reproduction or death. As more attention has been paid to the issue of whale entanglement with fishing gear, more records of entanglements are discovered. Here is a list of entanglements of North Pacific right whales in fishing gear: * February 2015 – a young right whale became entangled in the ropes of a musselaquaculture operation in Korea.

Both summer feeding ranges and winter calving grounds are located in busy shipping channels. E. japonica does not frequent shipping channels. In the North Pacific, this threat is probably smaller, but it still exists. All larger cetaceans passing through under threats of being struck by vessels on various sea-lanes in Asian nations, especially in the Tsushima Strait. Japanese Coast Guard has started to collect sighting records of large whales in the area, but majorities of species identities of each records are unspecified in their log, hence it is unknown if any right whales have ever been actually sighted.  Ship noise  In its 2013 Recovery Plan, NOAA reviewed the scientific evidence on the effects of ship noise on right whales at length. No studies have been done on North Pacific right whales due to the difficulty of even finding them. Several studies have been done on North Atlantic right whales which are reviewed. Ship noise in the oceans has increased dramatically due to both the amount of shipping and the exploration for oil and gas. The increased noise may make right whales more vulnerable to being struck by ships. It may also impose a sublethal level of stress on them that might impact their health. (citation). NOAA concluded that \\"the severity of ship noise to North Pacific right whales is unknown and uncertainty of the threat is high. Therefore the relative impact to recovery is ranked as unknown.\\"  Predation  The 2013 U.S. Recovery Plan noted that there is \\"currently no evidence\\" of predation on North Pacific right whale by killer whales, and that none of the photos of North Pacific right whales showed no images of tooth rake marks typical of killer whale attacks, but \\"this is not to suggest ... this predation does not occur, only that it has not been observed\\". There are records of sharks attacking North Atlantic right whales on their calving grounds. In the Canadian Arctic 17 Inuit reported having seen killer whales attack bowhead whales. The U.S. Recovery Plan concludes that any predation would likely have a larger impact on calf and subadult age classes, and that the relative impact to recovery from predation is ranked as low severity and medium uncertainty.  Whaling  Historic whaling is the reason North Pacific right whales are so endangered today. The two critical periods of whaling were 1839 to 1849 (pelagic whaling, 90% American ships) and 1963 to 1968 (illegal Soviet whaling). The illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s killed 514 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska to plus 136 right whales in the Sea Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands. Although whaling was the principal threat to North Pacific right whales, there is no record of whalers targeting this species since the 1980s. Accordingly, this threat appears minor at this time.  Lack of funding for management, research and conservation  Trying to research and manage human interactions with whale populations that are spread out geographically in remote areas and hard to locate is expensive. With governments around the North Pacific facing reductions in budgets, funding for such efforts are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Most of the research on the right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska was funded as part of proposed leases for oil and gas exploration that recently have been deferred and that funding ended. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reports \\"currently there is no funding at all for North Pacific right whale research despite the critically endangered nature of this population.\\" In Japan, the only system of collecting reports of large whales along the Japanese coast is the ICR Strandings Record – this applies only to stranded individuals, hence the limited knowledge about the biology of free-swimming right whales in Japan. There were more unpublished or unreported sightings of right whales confirmed by locals in recent years in which some important observations such as a cow-calf pairs observation close to shore are included (personal contact). For example, a sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.  Conservation   The challenge of finding right whales  Distinctive V-shaped blow of a right whale in the Bristol Bay feeding ground Alaska (Identification of a whale as a right whale requires more than just a photo of the blow shape because some gray whales can also produce V-shaped blows.) A threshold problem for conserving this species is locating them. Other right whale species can reliably be found on their feeding grounds (North Atlantic right whale), or on their wintering grounds (both North Atlantic and Southern right whale). In contrast, there are no reliable places where researchers can find North Pacific right whales. In the eastern portion of their range, there are so few whales that researchers have described it looking for a needle in a haystack. In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal. Until recently nearly all the records of North Pacific right whales have been visual observations from ships or from shore. However, on their summer grounds in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, the sea conditions are frequently so rough, windy and/or foggy that detection of right whales known to be present is problematic. In 2015, a NOAA research cruise in the Bering Sea off Kodiak focused on finding right whales detected acoustic signals on two occasions from a right whale, but in neither case were the researchers able to visually locate the whales. Previous NOAA dedicated ship surveys in the southeast Bering Sea also have had only sporadic success in visibly locating right whales. A month-long NOAA dedicated research cruises in August 2007 in the southeast Bering Sea sighted no right whales. More recently, scientists have increasingly been using a new technology to acoustically detect right whales. As described above, right whales make calls that can be distinguished from the calls of other species so that researchers have concluded they such detections constitute reliable records based solely on the acoustic recordings. The technology is able to detect submerged animals, independent of water clarity. Acoustic searching for North Pacific right whales has been done with two types of listening devices. Directional and ranging sonobuoy are floating devices that are deployed from ships are monitored for short periods of time (hours) from ships. Alternate listening devices are permanently moored acoustic recorders that acoustically sample over long periods (months) until the acoustic is retrieved by a ship. Acoustic detection and visual searches are often used in conjunction. Right whales are detected acoustically then are located visually by shipboard observers. In August 2004, NOAA listening devices in the southeastern Bering Sea detected right whale vocalizations. The researchers then deployed directional and ranging sonobuoys to locate the calling whales. This information allowed researchers to find visually the whales and photograph, biopsy dart (to collect genetic samples) and tag two whales. Researchers have also developed increasingly sophisticated and durable satellite tags that can be attached to whales, including right whales. These tags can collect information for months about the long-distance travels of whales, and have produced information on movements of right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. (citations needed) satellite-monitored radio tags. These are non-lethal, and applied with a crossbow, can beam the whales' location, movements, dives and other information to researchers. However, the only occasion on which researchers have visually detected a right whale and been able to attach a satellite tag was on the 2006 NOAA research in the Bering Sea. However, of the ___ tags deployed, ___ failed within __ days. Only one tag worked, and it failed after 40 days, just as the whale was expected to start its southern migration. During that period the whale moved throughout a large part of the shelf, including areas of the outer shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades. and 1997–2004. There may be locations in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore in the southern part of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated with oil and gas exploration near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.  International law  After World War I, the major whaling nations of the time (Norway, Great Britain, United States) became increasingly concerned the depletion of blue whales and other whale species, and entered into first international whaling treaty in 1931, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which became effective in 1935 after ratification by the member nations. The treaty banned the hunting of all right whales. However, Japan and the Soviet Union did not ratify the treay, and thus were not bound by it. Attempts to bring the other major whaling nations under an international regime stalled until after World War II. In 1946 the major whaling countries signed the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which established the International Whaling Commission (IWC) whose regulations first took effect in 1949. Since its inception, the IWC has banned the commercial hunting of right whales. Currently, the IWC classifies E. japonica a \\"Protection Stock\\" which bars commercial whaling.International Whaling Commission, Schedule, paras. 10(c), 11 and Table 1 . Iwcoffice.org. Retrieved September 15, 2011. However, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling explicitly allows member countries to issue permits to their own citizens kills whales for scientific research, even if that species is otherwise protected from commercial hunts.International Whaling Commission, Scientific Permit Whaling . Iwcoffice.org. Retrieved September 15, 2011. In 1955, the Soviet Union granted it whalers permits to kill 10 North Pacific right whales, and in 1956 and 1958 the Japanese granted permits to its whalers to kill 13 North Pacific right whales. The member nation issuing the scientific permit must report these permits to the International Whaling Commission. The 23 North Pacific right whales taken pursuant to these permits provide much of published morphology and reproductive biology data for this species. No further scientific whaling permits have been issued by any country to take North Pacific right whales. During the 1960s, the IWC did not place observers on whaling ships. Whaling nations were expected to monitor their own whalers. The Soviet Union abused this process, directing its whalers to capture thousands of protected blue whales, humpback whales and right whales around the world. The Soviet Union's massive illegal whaling of North Pacific right whales is described in the discussion on historic whaling. The IWC did not require the Soviet Union (and other member nations) to have foreign observers on their ships until 1972, at which time the Soviet Union entered into agreement with Japan for Japanese observers on Soviet whaling ships.International Whaling Commission 23rd Report 10 (1973); International Whaling Commission 24th Report 27 (1974) Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) all right whales (Eubalaena spp.) are listed in Appendix IAppendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) the North Pacific right whale is listed on Appendix I\\"Appendix I and Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: March 5, 2009. (CMS) as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them.  United States laws and regulations  Actions involving the North Pacific right whale are subject to three separate laws. First, the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 authorizes the federal government to adopt regulations that mirror the regulations (the \\"Schedule\\") adopted by the International Whaling Commission, including the IWC's ban on the commercial take of any right whales. Second, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) gives jurisdiction for management of all whale species to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce. NOAA determined that the North Pacific right whale is currently \\"depleted\\" as that term is used in the act in 1973. Such classification affords the species various protections under the MMPA. Third, under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA has listed the North Pacific right whale as \\"endangered\\". This law provides the species with additional protections which overlap those of the MMPA, but generally are more protective.  Critical habitat  Critical habitat for E. japonica The Endangered Species Act directs the managing agencies, in this case NOAA, to designate portions of oceans as \\"Critical Habitat\\" which triggers specific protective measures. On October 4, 2000, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) petitioned NMFS to designate the southeast Bering Sea shelf from 55 to 60°N as critical habitat for E. japonica. On February 20, 2002, NMFS declined (67 FR 7660) at that time, arguing that available information was insufficient for such a finding. CBD challenged NMFS in court, and in June 2005, a federal judge directed the agency to make a designation. In 2006, NMFS complied, designating one in the Gulf of Alaska south of Kodiak Island and one in the southeast Bering Sea (71 FR 38277, July 6, 2006). Later, NMFS split the \\"northern right whale\\" into E. glacialis and E. japonica, and reissued its rule.Angliss, R. P., and R. B. Outlaw. North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica): Eastern North Pacific Stock, NOAA-TM-AFSC-168, (revised 1/3/06). (PDF). Retrieved September 15, 2011. Critical habitats must contain one or more \\"primary constituent elements\\" (PCEs) that are essential to the conservation of the species. NMFS identified as PCEs: species of large zooplankton in right whale feeding areas, in particular the copepods Calanus marshallae, Neocalanus cristatus, and Thysanoessa raschii whose high lipid content and occurrence make them preferred prey items., and physical concentrating mechanisms, physical and biological features that aggregate prey into densities high enough to support efficient feeding. NMFS simply used repeated right whale sightings in the same small area in spring and summer as a proxy for the presumed PCEs. These areas support extensive and multi-species commercial fisheries for pollock, flatfish, cod, various crabs and other resources (but not salmon). NMFS ruled that these fisheries do not threaten PCE availability. NMFS also ruled that the zooplankton PCE was vulnerable to oil spills and discharges, which may require measures such as conditioning federal permits or authorizations with special operational constraints. Once a critical habitat has been designated, federal agencies must consult with NOAA to ensure that any action they authorize, fund or carry out is unlikely to destroy or adversely modify it.  Recovery Plan  In June 2013, NOAA issued a formal \\"Recovery Plan for the North Pacific Right Whale\\" pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The Recovery Plan describes the current state of scientific knowledge of the species and the threats to its continued survival. The Plan also contains proposed conservation measures, which mainly consist of various research proposals including passive acoustic monitoring, satellite tagging, and review of historic whaling logbooks.  Canadian regulation  In Canada, some right whales had been caught in the early 20th century from whaling stations off northern Vancouver Island.

In 1675, Yoriharu Wada invented a new method of whaling, entangling the animals in nets before harpooning them. Initially the nets were made of straw, later replaced by the stronger hemp. A hunting group consisted of 15–20 Seko-bune or \\"beater\\" boats, 6 Ami-bune or netting boats and 4 Mosso-bune or tug boats, for a total of 30–35 boats with crews totaling about 400. In addition to right whales, they took gray whales and humpback whales. Miyamoto Musashi plunges his sword into a giant whale, from a 19th- century print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. Its markings clearly identify it as a North Pacific right whale. Hunts took place in two regions: the south coast (modern Mie, Wakayama and Kōchi Prefectures) on the east coasts, and the waters north of the prefectures from Kyoto to Yamaguchi and to the west of Kyūshū which hunted in the Sea of Japan. Off the south coast of Japan, hunting lasted from winter to spring. Catches in Kōchi Prefecture between 1800 and 1835 totaled 259 whales. Catches at Ine on the Sea of Japan during the period 1700–1850 averaged less than 1 per year. Catches at Kawaijiri also on the Sea of Japan averaged 2 per year from 1699 to 1818. A few Native American tribes hunted in the North Pacific. Their catches were much lower than the Japanese. The Inuit along the western and northwestern coasts of Alaska have hunted whales for centuries. They prefer the bowhead whale, and occasionally the gray whale. They hunted at or beyond the northern limits of the right whale's range. Aleuts hunted E. japonica and Gray whales along the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska peninsula, using poisoned harpoons. The catch was not recorded, but is unlikely to have been more than a few per year. The Nootka, Makah, Quilleute and Auinault tribes of Vancouver Island and the coast of Washington were also skilled whalers of the gray and humpback whales. Right whales were rare in their catches. The North Pacific was the furthest whaling ground from New England and Europe markets. During the open-boat whaling era, the mainly American ships hunted in the nearest ranges first. As the fleet grew, boats spread to the eastern North Atlantic and, by the 1770s, the South Atlantic. Following the lead of the British, American vessels first sailed the South Pacific in 1791, and by the end of the decade had reached the eastern North Pacific. By the 1820s, the whalers had started to use Lahaina, Hawaii, as a base for hunting sperm whales.  Pelagic: 1835–1850  Whalers retrieving the baleen (\\"whalebone\\") from a right whale (NOAA photo library) In 1835, the French whaleship Gange ventured north of 50°N and became the first pelagic whaling ship to catch a North Pacific right whale. News of this find spread quickly. Whaleships north of 50° increased from 2 in 1839 to 108 in 1843 and to 292 in 1846. Approximately 90% of the whaleships were American, the remainder primarily French. The focus of the North Pacific whaling fleet on right whales ended soon after 1848, when a whaler ventured through the Bering Straits and discovered unexploited populations of bowhead whales. Being more abundant, easier to capture, and yielding far more baleen, the majority of whalers rapidly switched to hunting bowheads. Since bowheads range further north than right whales, hunting pressure on right whales declined rapidly. The estimated total catch in the fishery in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk was 26,500–37,000 right whales between 1839 and 1909. Eighty percent of this catch was concentrated in the single decade of 1840–49.  Industrial: 1850–1930s  In the decade between 1850 and 1859, the catch dropped to 3,000–4,000 animals, one-sixth the previous level. Between 1860 and 1870, it dropped to 1,000 animals. By the end of the 19th century, pelagic whalers averaged less than 10 right whales per year. In the late 19th century, steam propulsion and the explosive harpoon opened up new whaling opportunities. Species previously too swift to hunt commercially could now be caught—blue and fin whales. Small coastal whaling operations opened in California, Oregon, and Washington, British Columbia, and in the Aleutian Islands and in southeast Alaska, and in the Kuril Islands in the west. Whalers hunted by day, towing their catch to shore for flensing, operating in a fairly small area around the whaling stations. Although they weren't the primary targets, a few right whales were recorded in catches from these stations. A close-up photo of a North Pacific right whale taken at the Kyuquot whaling station, British Columbia in 1918 can be seen here.Whaling. Wild Whales. Retrieved September 15, 2011.  After the official protection  The later \\"factory ships\\" that processed carcasses while at sea further transformed pelagic whaling. Right whales continued to be taken, although uncommonly due to their rarity. Japan continued hunting right whales through the beginning of World War II. Afterward, General Douglas MacArthur, head of Allied occupation forces, encouraged the Japanese to resume whaling to feed their hungry population. Japan then joined the International Whaling Commission which barred the hunting of right whales. Except for 13 killed under \\"scientific permits\\", in accordance with IWC rules, Japanese whalers have honored this prohibition. Skeleton of the Kumomi specimen Possibly, several hundred whales (mostly unreported or unrecorded) were taken by Japanese until the late-1970s, including mass captures off southeastern Hokkaido and off Akkeshi. In 1977, one of a pair firstly sighted at beaches in Numadu was driven into port of Kumomi next day and was killed (although majority of medias even the museum itself claim that people tried their best to save the whale who stranded him/herself). A local museum (雲見くじら館) was later built specially for displaying the animal's carcass. In the late 1970s, at least two cow-calf pairs were confirmed during cetacean surveys by Institute of Cetacean Research in very nearby area of Suruga Bay and off Bentenjima Island in Enshunada Sea, and another whale was observed in exactly the same area (Kumomi) in 1996 as well.

World's last catch records of the species were claimed to be two catches by Japanese whalers in the Yellow Sea in 1994.  Illegal Soviet whaling: 1962–1968  Historically, compliance with fisheries regulations regarding species caught and amount of the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity by the time the whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port. At the time, the only way to monitor compliance was by having whaling \\"inspectors\\" on the factory ships themselves to record the species and size of whales caught. When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946, monitoring of compliance with and enforcement of the IWC's regulations was the responsibility of each member nation with respect to its nationals' whaling operations. Each nation employed its own whaling inspectors at whaling stations and aboard whaling factory ships. Each member nation of the IWC was required to report to the IWC annually on compliance, describing the specifics of any infractions (e.g. number of illegal whales caught of which species), and what actions the member nation had taken regarding these infractions. The IWC itself has no legal authority to monitor whaling operations or impose sanctions on whaling operations for infractions. This policing of the whaling fleets by their own governments persisted until 1972 when the IWC established a system of international observers on whaling ships. In the 1960s, Soviet whalers had no international observers on board, and no conservation groups following them at sea. By 1962, humpback, blue and fin whales were getting harder to find in the North Pacific, and the Soviet whalers, under great pressure from their own government to meet production targets, deliberately chose to hunt right whales, apparently killing every right whale they could over the next eight years, in the North Pacific and also the southern oceans. The Soviet government then filed fraudulent reports with the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics and the International Whaling Commission, admitting killing during this period only one right whale, by accident. These Soviet infractions remained a state secret for four decades. In many instances, the Russian biologists who had been on the whaling ships were prohibited from examining the carcasses or taking any biological measurements of these whales. Nevertheless, several biologists kept their own records of what the whalers caught, then kept these records secret. After the collapse of the Soviet government, the new Russian government released at least part of the data on the true catch data. In 2006, former Soviet whale biologist Nikolai Doroshenko published records of 372 right whales caught by the Soviet whaling fleets Vladivostok and Dalnij Vostok in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific between 1963 and 1968. He also documented an additional 126 right whales killed in the Sea of Okhotsk between 1963 and 1968 and another 10 in the Kuril Islands in 1971. Doroshenko did not have information regarding catches by a third Soviet whaling fleet, the Sovetskaya Rossiya, operating in the Gulf of Alaska in 1962–1963 that caught 142 right whales that were additional to the 372 previously revealed. Of the whales killed by the Sovetskaya Rossiya fleet, 112 were killed in June 1963 in the central and northern Gulf of Alaska. In 2012, newly discovered documents revealed that the total illegal catch was even larger. The accounting based on that information showed that the Soviet whaling fleets caught 529 right whales from 1962 to 1968 in the eastern North Pacific, plus 152 more right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1967 and 1968, for a total of 661 right whales. Catches were distributed in the Bering Sea (115), eastern Aleutian Islands (28), Gulf of Alaska (366), Sea of Okhotsk (132), and other areas (20). Detailed information on catches of 112 right whales taken in May/June 1963 shows a broad distribution in offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, consistent with 19th century historical whaling records. Other major areas in which right whales were caught include south of Kodiak Island, western Bristol Bay (southeastern Bering Sea), and the central Sea of Okhotsk off eastern Sakhalin Island. The catches primarily involved large mature animals, thus greatly inhibiting recovery of right whales in these regions. Since that 2012 accounting for illegally caught whales was published, the principle analyst for that study has increased her estimate of the total North Pacific right whales caught by the Soviet whalers in the North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk from 661 whales to a new total of 765 whales, but details of the distribution of those additional whales is not yet published. It was also revealed that Japan was in fact 'helping' this destructive hunts in terms of neglecting and disregarding monitoring obligations, and there were agreements between Japan and Soviet to keep their illegal mass whaling activities in foreign/international protected waters in confidentiality.

From 1435 to 1561 it was a member of the Livonian Confederation. History The order was formed from the remnants of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword after their defeat by Samogitians in 1236 at the Battle of Schaulen (Saule). They were incorporated into the Teutonic Knights and became known as the Livonian Order in 1237. In the summer of that year, the Master of Prussia Hermann Balk rode into Riga to install his men as castle commanders and administrators of Livonia. In 1238, the Teutonic Knights of Livonia signed the Treaty of Stensby with the Kingdom of Denmark. Under this agreement, Denmark would support the expansion ambitions of the order in exchange for northern maritime Estonia. In 1242, the Livonian Order tried to take the city of Novgorod. However, they were defeated by Alexander Nevsky in the Battle on the Ice. Fortresses as Paide in land ceded by Denmark in the Treaty of Stensby allowed the order to contain the threat of Russian troops. For that reason, the order focused on its southern borders and Semigallia. Semigallia was a strategic territory for the Livonian Order. Lithuanians passed through Semigallia to raid settlements in Livonia, and they took advantage of the winter ice pack in the Gulf of Riga to reach Oesel Island. Also, this territory kept the Livonian Branch of the Teutonic Order separated from the Prussian Branch. Between 1237 and 1290, the Livonian Order conquered all of Courland, Livonia, and Semigallia. In 1298, Lithuanians took Karkus Castle north of Riga, and defeated the order in the Battle of Turaida, killing Livonian Land Master Bruno and 22 knights. In 1346, the order bought the Duchy of Estonia from King Valdemar IV of Denmark. Life within the order's territory is described in the Chronicle of Balthasar Russow (Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt). The Teutonic Order fell into decline following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and the secularization of its Prussian territories by Albert of Brandenburg in 1525, while the Livonian Order managed to maintain an independent existence. The Livonian Order's defeat in the Battle of Swienta (Pabaiskas) on September 1, 1435, which claimed the lives of the master and several high-ranking knights, brought the order closer to its neighbors in Livonia. The Livonian Confederation agreement (eiine fruntliche eyntracht) was signed in Walk on December 4, 1435, by the Archbishop of Riga, the bishops of Courland, Dorpat, Ösel-Wiek and Reval; the representatives of the Livonian Order and vassals, and the deputies of Riga, Reval and Dorpat city municipal councils. During the Livonian War, however, the order suffered a decisive defeat by troops of Muscovite Russia in the Battle of Ergeme in 1560. The Livonian Order then sought protection from Sigismund II Augustus, the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who had intervened in a war between Bishop William of Riga and the Brothers in 1557. After coming to an agreement with Sigismund II, Augustus and his representatives (especially Mikołaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwiłł), the last Livonian Master, Gotthard Kettler, secularized the order and converted to Lutheranism. In the southern part of the Brothers' lands he created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia for his family. Most of the remaining lands were seized by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The north of Estonia was taken back by Denmark and Sweden. From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Middle Low German as spoken in the towns of the Hanseatic League was the established language, but was subsequently succeeded by High German as official language in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. Masters of the Livonian Order The Livonian Master, like the grandmaster of the Teutonic Order, was elected by his fellow knights for a life term. The grandmaster exercised supervisory powers and his advice was considered equal to a command. The grandmaster of Teutonic knights did not limit local autonomy, he rarely visited Livonia or sent ambassadors for oversight.

Vine, The Story of Old Attercliffe (pt. 2) Historically a part of the parish of Sheffield, Attercliffe Chapel was built in 1629 as the first place of worship in the settlement. The Town School was built in 1779, and Christ Church was built in 1826 but destroyed during the Second World War. In 1686, Richard Frankland set up a dissenting academy at Attercliffe Hall. Three years later, it was taken over by the nonconformist minister Timothy Jollie, who educated students including John Bowes, Nicholas Saunderson and Thomas Secker.\\"Jollie, Timothy\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was frustrated by Jollie's poor teaching, famously remarking that he lost his knowledge of languages and that 'only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of many of the young Men were bad. I spent my time there idly & ill'.Manuscript autobiography In the early 19th century, Attercliffe remained a rural community known for its orchards, windmill, and large houses including the Old Hall, New Hall and Carlton House. New Hall was later converted into pleasure gardens, with a cricket ground, racecourse, bowling green, maze, lake and depictions of famous cities. It was known for its concerts and firework displays. Small-scale manufacture of pen knife and pocket knife developed in the early 19th century, The suburb became more accessible with the construction of first a turnpike from Sheffield to the terminus of the River Don Navigation at Tinsley, then the opening of the Sheffield Canal, running to the south of the village. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a frequent proposal to widen this to form a Sheffield Ship Canal, to terminate in a basin at Attercliffe.G. R. Vine, The Story of Old Attercliffe (pt. 3) Attercliffe railway station opened in August 1871 and closed on 26 September 1927. The former John Banner department store Attercliffe has long been an industrial area, but by the early 20th century, there was also a large residential population and high class shops, John Banner's department store (Banner's) in particular. The area declined post Second World War as Victorian housing was cleared which was not replaced, causing the local schools to close, followed by most of the local shops, while some of the local industries closed or moved to larger sites further out of Sheffield.  Adelphi Cinema  The former Adelphi Cinema The Adelphi was a cinema on Vicarage Road in Attercliffe, Sheffield. It was built in 1920 by architect William C. Fenton. The cinema closed in 1967, and the building was then used as a bingo hall under the name \\"Adelphi Bingo Club\\" and a nightclub. It is currently disused. Attractions Its location on the Sheffield Supertram route, the completion of the Five Weirs Walk and construction of the Don Valley Stadium and Motorpoint Arena Sheffield in the 1990s brought some life back to the area. As part of the area's regeneration, new house building started in 2002. Don Valley Stadium was demolished in 2013.

Hallamshire (or Hallam) is the historical name for an area of South Yorkshire, England, in the current city of Sheffield. The origin of the name is uncertain. The English Place-Name Society describe \\"Hallam\\" originating from a formation meaning \\"on the rocks\\". Alternative theories are that it is derived from halgh meaning an area of land at a border,David Hey, Historic Hallamshire Old Norse hallr meaning a slope or hill, or Old English heall meaning a hall or mansion. The exact boundaries of this historic district are unknown, but it is thought to have covered the parishes of Sheffield, Ecclesfield, and Bradfield--an area roughly equivalent to those parts of the present-day borough of the City of Sheffield that lie to the west of the rivers Don and Sheaf that are within the boundaries of the ancient county of Yorkshire (later descriptions also include Brightside and the parish of Handsworth).See chapter I of Hunter (1819) for a discussion of the boundaries of Hallamshire. History Pre-conquest Hallamshire In Anglo-Saxon times, Hallamshire was the most southerly of the \\"small shires\\" or regiones of the Kingdom of Northumbria. Its southern border with Mercia was already fixed and may have Celtic origins. The mother church of Hallamshire lay five miles north of Sheffield at Ecclesfield, whose placename includes the Common Brittonic or primitive Welsh root *eglẽs meaning \\"church\\", suggesting that Hallamshire has even earlier roots and must have existed as a territorial unit at the time of the area's first conversion to Christianity during the Romano-British period. On the basis of three separate extracts from the Domesday Survey it can be shown that the manors of Hallam, Attercliffe, and Sheffield were three distinct and separate entities at the time of the Survey and beyond. The Domesday Book states that the manor of Hallam (\\"Hallun\\") included sixteen hamlets or settlements and had existed before the 1066 Norman conquest of England as part of the lands owned by Waltheof, the Earl of Huntingdon, who had an aula or hall located in the manor of Hallam. From the Domesday text it is clear that the village of Hallam and Waltheof’s aula could only have been located in the manor of Hallam, and not the manors of Sheffield or Attercliffe.Hallam, R.L. (2015). The Village of Hallam and Waltheof's Aula. https://docs.com/robert-hallam/8554/the-village-of-hallam-and-waltheofs-aula However, the possibility that Waltheof's aula and the surrounding settlement was located in the manor of Sheffield still persists since the manor of Sheffield had once been demesne or inland of the manor of Hallam-- a term which in this case implies \\"contained within\\". This has led to the suggestion that the Sheffield of the Domesday book somehow encompassed the area that later became known as Sheffield Park, the historic town and castle being in Hallam. Indeed, an early 20th-century excavation at the site of Sheffield Castle found evidence of an Anglo-Saxon building on the site.Accounts of the 1927-1930 (and more recent) archaeological investigations of Sheffield Castle can be found on the Sheffield Markets website and at the Sheffield Galleries & Museums Trust archaeology website (both accessed 13 August 2005). However, alternative sites have been suggested in and around the Rivelin valley.A discussion of possible locations of the aula can be found in chapter II of Hunter (1819) Local historian T. Walter Hall (in 1931), following Sidney Addy (1893),Addy, The Hall of Waltheof, Chapter XXIII. \\"Ibi Habuit Wallef Comes Aulam\\" suggested that the district's original settlement was at Hallam Head, above the River Rivelin, and that it had been destroyed during the Harrying of the North. As evidence, he noted that the location lies by the ancient Long Causeway route and that the name of the neighbouring Burnt Stones Common referenced its destruction. A compilation of early maps of the area surrounding Hallam Head assembled by Hallam (2015)Hallam, R.L. (2015). The Village of Hallam and Waltheof's Aula. https://docs.com/robert- hallam/8554/the-village-of-hallam-and-waltheofs-aula from a number of sources provides compelling evidence that a pre-Conquest nucleated settlement, almost assuredly the Domesday village of Hallam, was located immediately south of the old Roman road (Redmires Road) approximately 4.5 km west of Sheffield. The geographic centre coincides with the junction of Tom Lane and Carsick Hill Road; two ancient byways found mentioned in medieval charters from the 13th century. Hallam provides corroborating charter evidence that leads to the identification of the location Hallam Head, the site for the village of Hallam identified by T. Walter Hall in 1931, being situated near the upper end, or head of the village. A series of three communal fields designated Hallam fields (Hallam Field, Great Hallam Field and Common Fields of Hallam) are mentioned frequently in surrenders from 1550 onward in the context of common pasture. The apparent pattern of a nucleated settlement and associated three- field system would be analogous to ‘town planning’ without a town, had the village of Hallam not existed. The arguments presented by T. Walter Hall and Hallam are rejected by David Hey, who notes that there is no evidence of any settlement larger than a hamlet ever having existed at the site, and that evidence suggests that the Harrying of the North did not affect the Sheffield area. The simple fact that the village of Hallam and Waltheof's aula had been destroyed and no longer existed, and that the taxable value of the manors in the area had been significantly devalued by the time of the Domesday Survey would contradict Hay's position. Addy himself preferred a location just outside the village of Stannington, where there is evidence of a large manor house surrounded by a moat.Addy, The Hall of Waltheof, Chapter XXXV. The Stannington Diploma—The Stone Villa—The Hall After the Norman Conquest Waltheof initially submitted to William I and was allowed to keep his lands. He took part in a failed uprising to support the 1069 invasion by Sweyn II of Denmark and Edgar Ætheling (including an attack on York), but then once again submitted to William and was married to Judith of Lens, the King's niece. However, after taking part in a conspiracy against William in 1075 Waltheof was executed. Initially, Judith retained his lands (including Hallamshire), but after Judith refused a second marriage to the Norman knight Simon Saint Liz, William confiscated much of her lands and handed them to her eldest daughter Maud, who then married Saint Liz in Judith's stead. After the death of Saint Liz, Maud married David, the heir to the crown of Scotland, and Waltheof's lands and Earldom were passed to him. It is possible that Hallamshire was exempted from this transfer and remained in Judith's hands. The Domesday book states that the manor of Hallam was held by Roger de Busli \\"of the Countess Judith\\". The exact nature of the arrangement between Judith and de Busli is unknown, however there is evidence that such an arrangement continued for a number of centuries--an inquisition following the death of Thomas de Furnival in 1332 found that his ancestors had held the manor of Sheffield \\"of the King of Scotland\\", paying a yearly service of two white greyhounds. The earliest known use of the term Hallamshire—\\"Halumsire\\"—is found in a deed of the house of Saint Wandrille in Ecclesfield dating from 1161.Transcribed in Hunter, Hallamshire, p. 28. Historically, the term shire would simply mean the district appropriated to some city, town, or castle, and did not necessarily refer to a county. Hallamshire could therefore be assumed to be the district associated with a town (\\"vill\\") called \\"Hallam\\", although there is no known record of such a town's existence.Hunter, Hallamshire, chapter 1 During this early period, the name Hallamshire was retained for the Norman lordship. It was administered from Sheffield Castle, at the confluence of the River Don and the River Sheaf. A smaller castle was built at High Bradfield. During the 12th century, William de Lovetot acquired most of the land within the Sheffield area including the old manors of Hallam, Sheffield, and Attercliffe. He constructed a more substantial castle in Sheffield, establishing the town as the dominant settlement within Hallamshire. Sheffield gained a sizeable parish, split from the large parish of Ecclesfield, and a larger manor which encompassed most of Hallamshire. A charter of 1268 describes Hallamshire as containing just three manors: Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Bradfield. However, confusion arose later, as Sheffield acquired other manors outside historic Hallamshire, such as that of Handsworth. Hallamshire was included in official lists of the counties of England under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The territorial division of Hallamshire survived into the 19th century as a liberty, recorded in 1822 as including the parishes of Sheffield, Treeton, Whiston, Rotherham, Handsworth, and Ecclesfield, and with the Duke of Norfolk as Chief Bailiff. Modern Hallam Hallam has come to mean, broadly speaking, that area of Yorkshire in the foothills of the Peak District and southwest of the River Don. The region includes much of western Sheffield, and the parish of Bradfield. Suburbs and villages within this area include Bradfield, Broomhill, Crookes, Fulwood, Hillsborough, Loxley, Stannington, Strines, and Walkley. A number of institutions, companies, and public houses use the \\"Hallam/shire\\" name to reflect their association with the Sheffield area : *The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire is a trade guild of steelworkers, founded in 1624 and based in Sheffield. *Sheffield Hallam is a Parliamentary constituency in western Sheffield, demographically one of the wealthiest such constituencies in Britain. *Hallamshire was a Parliamentary constituency from 1885 to 1918 *The Diocese of Hallam is a Roman Catholic diocese in England, covering South Yorkshire, northern Derbyshire and northern Nottinghamshire.

Connection to the Robin Hood legend The small village of Loxley, now a suburb of western Sheffield, lies within Hallamshire. A 1637 survey by John Harrison of the estates in or near Sheffield belonging to the Earl of Arundel states that a place called little Haggas croft in Loxley Firth contained \\"\\".Quoted in Addy, A Glossary of Words Used in the Neighbourhood of Sheffield, p. lxxiii. Note that Addy believed this statement to be \\"a piece of popular fiction\\". Antiquarian Joseph Hunter—writing in 1819—reaffirmed this local tradition, stating that Loxley Chase has \\"the fairest pretensions to be the Locksley of our old ballads, where was born that redoubtable hero Robin Hood.\\"Hunter, Hallamshire, chapter 1, p. 3 In many legends Robin Hood is said to have been a displaced son of the lord of Hallamshire, who at this period in history resided at his manor at Loxley. This also ties in with the traditional idea of Robin Hood being related to Scottish nobility, if not distantly, because the lords of Hallamshire were descendants of the early medieval kings of Scotland through the Earl of Huntingdon.

The city encompasses Santa Catarina Island and surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland. It has a population of 477,798, according to the 2016 IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) population estimate, the second most populous city in the state (after Joinville), and the 47th in Brazil. The metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,111,702, the 21st largest in the country. The city is known for having the country's third highest Human Development Index score among all Brazilian cities (0.847). The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism and services. The city has 60 beaches and is a center of surfing activity. Lagoa da Conceição is the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature and radical sports. The New York Times reported that \\"Florianopolis is the Party Destination of the Year in 2009.\\" Newsweek placed Florianópolis in the \\"Ten most dynamic cities of the world\\" list in 2006. Veja, a Brazilian publication, named the city as \\"the best place to live in Brazil.\\" As a result of this exposure, Florianópolis is growing as a second home destination for many Paulistas, Argentines, North Americans, and Europeans. Most of the population lives on the mainland and on the island's central and northern parts. The southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island. The fishing boats, the lacemakers, the folklore, the cuisine and the colonial architecture contribute to the growing tourism and attracts resources that compensate for the lack of any large industry. Villages immersed in tradition and history, such as Santo Antônio de Lisboa and Ribeirão da Ilha still resist the advances of modernity. The Hercílio Luz International Airport serves the city. Florianópolis is home to the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Federal University of Santa Catarina). There are also the Santa Catarina Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology (Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina), and two campuses of the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (State University of Santa Catarina), among other institutions of higher and professional education.  Etymology  The name Florianópolis was meant to be a tribute to Marshal Floriano Peixoto, the second President (1891–1894) of the Republic of the United States of Brazil and from Greek term polis, meaning \\"city\\". Until 1893, the city was called Nossa Senhora do Desterro (Our Lady of Banishment) or simply \\"Desterro\\". Geography Vegetation Florianópolis has a native Atlantic Forest-type vegetation. This vegetation has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The main ecoregion is the coastal Atlantic forest, the narrow strip of about 50–100 kilometers (31–62 miles) along the coast which covers about 20 percent of the region. This forests extend as far as 500–600 kilometers (310–372 miles) inland and its range is as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. Altitude determines at least three vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest: the lowland forest of the coastal plain, montane forests, and the high-altitude grassland or \\"campo rupestre\\". The municipality contains part of the offshore Marinha do Arvoredo Biological Reserve, a fully protected conservation unit established in 1990. It also contains part of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, a mountainous area covered in lush forests. The park protects the sources of the Vargem do Braço, Cubatão and Una rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region. The municipality contains the Rio Vermelho State Park in the northeast of Santa Catarina Island, created in 2007. Precipitation There is significant precipitation which is well distributed throughout the year. The annual normal precipitation for the period of 1961 through 1990 was . There is no dry season, and summer generally is the rainiest season. Increased rainfall occurs from January to March, with a median of per month, and from April to December there is somewhat less precipitation, averaging per month. The driest months are from June to August. Climate Florianópolis experiences a warm humid subtropical climate (Koppen: Cfa), falling just short of a true tropical climate. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic weather for autumn and spring. Due to the proximity of the sea, the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 80% on average. The maximum temperatures of the hottest month varies from to and the minimum temperatures are from to . The lowest temperature ever recorded was in September 1980 while the highest temperature ever recorded was in February 1973. History The city in 1847 São José fortress Colonial house Historic Center of Florianópolis Carijós Indians, a Tupi people, were the first inhabitants of Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified through archaeological sites and sambaquis dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or \\"mountain along the channel\\". Around 1514 the Portuguese landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina (Saint Catherine's Island). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin. The official settlement of the island began in 1673 with the arrival of bandeirante Francisco Dias Velho's agricultural company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a chapel consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a villa began to take form, slowly becoming a colonial settlement. To guarantee its domain the Portuguese Crown elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of town. From this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, possibly two of the largest seaside cities of South America at that time. For this reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of Southern Brazil started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul fortresses. With the coming of the Captaincy the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of Azores and from Madeira Island. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation. In 1823, during the monarchy which ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and also intense political organization. Regional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the Revolta Federalista (Federalist Revolt) at the beginning of the Brazilian Republic. The movement that started in Rio Grande do Sul spread to Santa Catarina and turned Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, Marechal Floriano Peixoto, known as Iron Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the Anhatomirim Island Fortress. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state capital's name: from Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano. Demographics Beira Mar Avenue in Florianopolis According to the IBGE of 2007, there were 406,564 people residing in the city (in 2010 IBGE reports a population of 421,203). The population density was . The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 366,000 White people (90.0%), 37,000 Brown (Multiracial) people (9.0%), 4,000 Black people (1.0%), 400 Asian or Amerindian people (0.1%). Florianópolis has a population mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. The numbers of immigrants started to increase in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. The population of Florianópolis was composed mainly of Portuguese/Azoreans, Germans, and Italians. Further south, some neighborhoods preserve their rural village identity. The cultural heritage left by their Azorean ancestors is noticeable in their dialect, in handicrafts, and traditional festivities. The small village of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) is an example of colonial period architecture and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the capital, the inhabitants speak in an accent closer to the Azorean dialect of the first settlers. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial architecture. On the other side, the city has taken on a cosmopolitan air with the arrival of Brazilians from other states and foreigners who chose to live there. The island, which at the beginning of the colonization period, was an important whale hunting centre, is today a technological pole of the IT industry. A State Capital of interest to tourism, Florianópolis is currently inhabited by about 400,000 people. The metro area has about 980,000 people. Religion According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, most of the population (63.68%) is Roman Catholic, other religious groups include Protestants or evangelicals (12.81%), Spiritists (7.48%), Nones 11.76%, and people with other religions (4.05). Economy Beach in Florianópolis South bay in the city Joaquina Beach According to 2002 Sefaz statistics, agricultural activities represented 0.05%, manufacturing represented 3.41% and the sector of the commerce and service 96.54%.Economy of Florianópolis – City Hall Website Tourism is one of the staples of Florianópolis' economy, and relates to Floripa's Azorean culture, observed in the buildings, workmanship, folklore, culinary and religious traditions of the area. Its environmental restrictions on building and commercial development have been more or less strictly enforced, helping it to keep its original character. To meet the demands of its academic crowd, the city invested heavily in everything from roads to schools, and now Florianópolis ranks high on every development measure, from literacy (97 percent) to electrification (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were flocking to the island, or emerging from a technology \\"incubator\\" at the federal university. (Among the innovations it hatched: the computerized voting machines that have made Brazilian elections fraud-free and efficient). Local officials now say their aim is to be the Silicon Valley of Brazil, with beaches. In addition to its white sand beaches, Florianópolis offers many historical attractions, including the sites of the original Azorean colonists, the Lagoa da Conceição lagoon, and Santo Antônio de Lisboa. Tourism in Florianópolis has grown significantly over the past 10 years, with increasing numbers of visitors coming from other large cities in Brazil (particularly Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) as well as other South American countries (particularly Argentina, with direct flights offered daily from Buenos Aires).Brazilians and Argentines in Floripa – City Hall Website During the past decade technology and software development firms also experienced strong growth, and today Information Technology services are one of the top revenue generators in Florianópolis.Information Technology in Floripa – City Hall Website Several technology centers are spread around Florianópolis, making the city an important pole in this economic sector. The GDP for the city was R$6,259,393,000 (2005). The per capita income for the city was R$15,776 (2005).

Tourism and lifestyle Beachfront Castaway Lagoa do Peri Hercilio Luz Bridge Beira-Mar Avenue Palace Cruz and Sousa Whale watching at Morro das Pedras Florianópolis is one of the most visited places in Brazil as it is an island with 42 beaches, lagoons and waterfalls. Lagoa da Conceição (Lagoon of Conceição) is the largest lagoon on the island of Florianopolis ( and one of the most visited area of the island by foreign travelers and backpackers. The area has the highest concentration of restaurants, bars, organic markets and shops. Many expats and Brazilian people from other cities choose to live by the lagoon because of its views, safety, nature and quality of life. The lagoon is surrounded by mountains and has a canal linking to the ocean. The history of the region around the lagoon is a plus with all the folklore, netting tradition, old Portuguese architecture, graffiti, and an 18th-century church on the top of the hill. See panoramic view below. The Holy Spirit Feast (Festa do Divino) is a festival that takes place 40 days after Easter. The celebration dates to the colonial era and includes a parade, music, and street food. Praia Mole (Mole Beach) One of the most famous beaches is Praia Mole, close to the Lagoon of Conceição and noted for its rolling green hills and rock formations on either side. The beach is mostly known for surfing, eco- friendly lounges and LGBTQ scene during the summer. The beach is one of the locations for the ASP World Tour of the Association of Surfing Professionals, which classifies 50 competitors, among professionals and amateurs. The state of Santa Caterina is the only location in South America for this surfing event.. Santa Catarina Art Museum is located in the city. Joaquina Beach (Praia da Joaquina) Became internationally famous in the 1970s, when surfers from around the world discovered its waves. Joaquina Beach is accessible from the Lagoon of Conceição. Many surf cups began to emerge, and great Catarinense surfing personalities. It is one of the beaches that offers the best tourist facilities, receiving a large number of tourists from around Brazil and the world on the warm days in spring and summer. The rock complex situated to the left of the beach, the night lighting and the public showers are some of the trademarks at Joaquina. There is a big paid parking lot, toilets, tourist coach parking lot, lifeguards, police station, handicraft shop, bars, restaurant and hotels. Sand boards can be rented on the spot. Barra da Lagoa Barra da Lagoa is a quaint fisherman's village but the physical characteristics of the beach make it the perfect place to learn to surf. It is a cove on the Eastern part of the island and stretches into Moçambique beach for . It is in a natural setting as there are no huge hotels on the beach and the Southern headquarters of Projeto TAMAR (Save the Turtles) is located here. Penguins swim into the canal and near the beach of Barra da Lagoa during the colder winter months of June, July and August. The canal at Barra da Lagoa connects the Lagoa da Conceição with the open sea. It is not uncommon to see fishermen during the night tossing their nets in the lagoa to catch shrimp they sell to the fresh fish restaurants in this community. Ingleses Beach (Praia dos Ingleses) Even though it is a beach preferred by tourists, Ingleses still keeps to the traditions of the Azorian colonizers. In the summer, it is one of the top beach destinations of Argentine tourists, second only to Canasveiras. In the winter, mullet fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are demonstrations of the local culture. The dunes separating the Ingleses Beach (English Beach) from the Santinho Beach are natural attractions not to be missed. The practice of sand board is quite common there, a sport created in Florianópolis, which consists of sliding down the dunes on a board, engaging or not in radical manoeuvres. To practice it, one must have a lot of balance and rent a board. Those looking for a different outing can go on a trek of over the dunes. Armação Beach (Praia da Armação) The Sant'Anna Church, built by the Armação fishing company, is part of the beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the beach to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction. Campeche Beach (Praia do Campeche) With of white sands and a turbulent waters, Campeche is considered the Jeffreys Bay of the Santa Catarina Island for the quality of its waves. For those who are not interested in surfing, the beach offers other attractions. At night, Campeche is also an attraction. The huge reflector that illuminates part of the large sand strip in front of the bars only contributes to the partying that extends far into the night. The illumination favours both those who enjoy the merrymaking as well as the fishermen, who use the time to drag their nets in from the sea. Santinho Beach (Praia do Santinho) is mainly sought by tourists who look for nature, and the location's tranquility. Surfers are the main visitors and consider Santinho to be the best beach in the North of the Santa Catarina Island. It is in the left hand corner, where bathers do not venture, that surfers practice their sport, sharing the space with fishermen. away from the centre of Florianópolis, another attraction of this beach are the primitive inscriptions made by hunters, fishermen and collectors inhabiting the Island five thousand years ago. The name Santinho comes from a human figure engraved on an isolated block of rock. Outdoor sports, including diving, hang gliding, rowing, paragliding, and mountain biking, as well as surfing, are common on the island. The island is connected to the Continent by three bridges. The Hercílio Luz Bridge that was built in 1926, this bridge is 11 years older than Golden Gate Bridge, but is now closed to traffic; it is a symbol of the island and often appears on postcard images. The Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge are the ones open to traffic. Santo Amaro da Imperatriz was the first thermal water facility in Brazil. Hotels with thermal bath facilities are located in the district of Caldas da Imperatriz and in the city of Águas Mornas. The Fonte Caldas da Imperatriz city baths are an additional source of thermal waters, which can reach the temperature of , where there are immersion baths and hydromassage. It is located on the Estrada Geral Highway, km 4, Caldas da Imperatriz district. Areas of the city Public Market The centre of Florianópolis, with its alleys, rows of typical houses, churches and museums, contains many examples of colonial architecture. Among these are the former government palace, nowadays the Cruz e Souza Museum (which took its name from the famous poet from Santa Catarina who formed the symbolist movement) and the Public Market built in 1898 which sells food and local handicrafts under the shade of a one- hundred-year-old fig tree. Close to the centre is the house where Victor Meirelles was born, one of the authors who devised the first mass spoken in Brazil. The building is registered by the Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage and houses the Victor Meirelles Museum. Roughly saying, the island can be divided in two sectors: in the north is the most visited side by tourists and because of that, the busiest and with the best services infrastructure. In some quarters notice a strong influence in the population architecture and customs. The most ancient livers of Florianópolis still have in the way they speak, in the craftwork activities and in the popular parties, the heritage left by immigrants from Portuguese islands from Azores. The south of the island preserved intensely Azorean customs that arrived there from the 18th century. The Carijós Ecological Station was established by decree of 20 July 1987, covering an area of in the municipality. It preserves a significant area of mangroves on the Ilha de Santa Catarina. The Pirajubaé Marine Extractive Reserve in the south bay of the Ilha de Santa Catarina protects people engaged in traditional harvesting of marine resources, mainly shellfish, from the sandbanks of the bay. Transportation A Pluna Bombardier CRJ-900 at Hercílio Luz International Airport (FLN). The airline ceased operations in 2012. Florianópolis' Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge International airport Florianópolis is served by Hercílio Luz International Airport for both domestic and international flights. It is one of the leading airports in Brazil for charter flights, especially during the summer months and from destinations such as Santiago, Montevideo, Buenos Aires and Córdoba, besides domestic routes. The traffic has grown significantly at the airport and therefore the city plans to upgrade and expand the airport so that 2.7 million passengers can be accommodated annually. The architectural design of the expansion was chosen by a public competition held by Infraero in partnership with the Brazilian Architects Institute (IAB). Among the over 150 original entries, the proposal of São Paulo architect Mário Bizelli was chosen. Normally the projects for expansion and modernization of the 66 airports administered by Infraero are done by public tender based on the needs, criteria and conditions presented by the company's engineering area. On days when one of the two the local football (soccer) teams plays at home in a stadium near the airport, traffic comes to a complete standstill, often preventing vehicles from departing the airport itself. People with departing flights are advised to check the local football schedule to ensure they arrive at the airport on time.

ISO 13490 has several improvements over its predecessor. It fully addresses the filename, POSIX attribute, and multibyte character issues that were not handled by ISO 9660. It is also a more efficient format, permits incremental recording, and permits both the ISO 9660 format and ISO/IEC 13490 format to co-exist on the same media. It also specifies how to use multisession properly. It is derived from the Frankfurt Group (formed in 1990 by many CD-ROM and CD-WO hardware and media manufacturers, CD-ROM data publishers, users of CD-ROMs, and major computer companies) proposal and fully supports orange book media. Multiple session overview ISO 13490 define a rule for operating systems as to how to read a multiple-session ISO 9660 volume from a CD-R. Instead of looking for the volume descriptor at offset 32,768 (sector number 16 on a CD) from the start of the disc (which would be the default behavior in ISO 9660), programs accessing the disc should start reading from the 16th sector in the first track of the latest session. Sector numbers form a contiguous sequence starting at the first session, and continue over added sessions and their gaps. Hence, if a CD mastering program wants to add a single file to a CD-R that has an ISO 9660 volume, it has to append a session containing at least an updated copy of the entire directory tree, plus the new file. The duplicated directory entries can still reference the data files in the previous session(s). In a similar way, file data can be updated or even removed. Removal is, however, only virtual: the removed content does not appear any more in the directory shown to the user, but it is still physically present on the disc. It can therefore be recovered, and it takes up space (such that the CD will become full even though appearing to still have unused space). Support Though it was originally intended for multisession support only to apply to Mode 2 Form 1 formatted discs, some CD writing software supported multisession writing to Mode 1 format discs. Since only some of the early disc drives supported multisession Mode 1 discs, in many cases the second and following sessions would become unreachable in some drives. Some older CD writing software, such as Nero Burning ROM, would not import previous session data from an inserted disc. It could thus only write a subsequent session to a disc on the same computer that had written all the previous sessions, and then only if the previous session data was saved before the writing software was closed down.

It lies north-east of Sheffield city centre and from Rotherham town centre. It is the largest shopping centre in Yorkshire and currently the eleventh-largest in the United Kingdom; plans for an extension are currently under consideration, for completion in the 2020s, which would make Meadowhall the fourth-largest shopping centre in the United Kingdom. Architecturally, the original construction of Meadowhall in the early 1990s was inspired by the Place d'Orléans shopping centre in Ottawa, Canada. The Meadowhall Retail Park is a separate development, owned by British Land, lying almost to the south of Meadowhall shopping centre in the Carbrook area of the city. History Meadowhall Meadowhall Shopping Centre at Night in 2015. Meadowhall's High Street in September 2007 The shopping centre was built by Bovis on the site previously occupied by Hadfields' East Hecla steelworks, and before that by the 19th-century Meadow Hall Iron Works, owned by John Crowley and Co. The centre was opened on 4 September 1990. With a floor area of , it is the eleventh-largest (second-largest when first opened) shopping centre in the UK. It is similar in concept to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, which was completed just before Meadowhall. With over 280 stores, Meadowhall has been widely blamed for the closure of shops in Sheffield City Centre and in Rotherham. Meadowhall is owned by British Land, a property developer. The centre attracted 19.8 million visitors in its first year of opening, and now attracts about 30 million visitors a year. Scenes from the music video of the Sheffield-based duo Moloko's first single \\"Fun For Me\\" were shot in the Oasis area of the shopping centre. One of Meadowhall's largest stores of the past, Sainsbury's (formerly located on Market Street), closed in July 2005 and was replaced by new Next and Primark stores in the summer of 2007. The large Sainsbury's store relocated to Crystal Peaks. There was a Namco Station arcade which closed in September 2007 after more than 15 years at the shopping centre. December 2005 saw Meadowhall become home to the fifth Apple Store in the UK, and in late 2007 it gained the third Puma Store in the UK, after London and Glasgow. The centre was also home to the only McCafé in Yorkshire, which has been replaced with a franchise called \\"Love Coffee\\". The centre's Burger King (formerly located on Market Street) was replaced by a small franchise called \\"Burger Knight\\" when it re-opened after the 2007 floods. The franchise later closed in May 2008. In October 2012, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) announced that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global had bought 50 percent of the UK shopping centre Meadowhall for £348 million, or approximately 3.2 billion Norwegian kroner. In 2014, the mall \\"Park Lane\\" was refurbished in the style of a \\"boutique arcade\\". The \\"Park Lane\\" area is now seen as the most upmarket area of Meadowhall, with stores such as Pretty Green, House of Fraser, Hugo Boss, White Stuff, Yo! Sushi and Debenhams. 2015–2017 refurbishment Meadowhall celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2015, and announced in the same year a £60 million interior refurbishment to make it fit with newer centres opened since 1990. The refurbishment has allowed some retailers to install double-height shop fronts. The first phase was completed in April 2017 and the second phase was completed in November 2017 with most of the work being done when after hours so as not to disrupt shopping, each area of Meadowhall has been themed to fit a certain style. After the BHS store closed in August 2016, it was announced that Primark would be expanding its store into half of the vacant store, with Sports Direct taking up the other half, and that Wilko would be moving into the store already taken up by Sports Direct; this was completed in March 2018. The House of Fraser store has also been refurbished along with the centre, as well as Apple, AllSaints, Yo! Sushi, Hollister, Schuh, JD Sports and the opening of new stores such as Tag Heuer, Flannels, Joe Browns, Skinny Dip and River Island Children making the centre being perceived as more \\"upmarket\\". Restaurants such as Handmade Burger Co and Pizza Express in the Oasis Dining quarter have also been refurbished with a new Gourmet Burger Kitchen, however this has since closed. Extension In May 2012, British Land announced that planning permission had been sought to provide a 52,000 sq.ft. (4831 m²) retail extension to Meadowhall on adjacent land, the plans however were not approved. In December 2014, a new Next home store and a Costa Coffee drive-thru was opened on the land next to Meadowhall where the extension was to be built. The Next home store came after IKEA had originally had plans to build a store close to Meadowhall however Next won the bid to build on the land instead. A new IKEA store however began being built on land next to Meadowhall retail park in August 2016. The store opened on 28 September 2017. In October 2016, it was announced plans had been put forward for a £300 million leisure extension to be built with a new cinema to replace the Vue in the Oasis, a bowling arcade, trampoline park, new restaurants, shops and a garden terrace along with a new multi-storey car park to replace the old one the extension would be built upon. In June 2017, the plan was scaled down by reducing the size of the new cinema and removing a food store. Sheffield city council gave planning permission to the development in September 2017. The extension was scheduled to be completed by 2021/2022, however in November 2018 construction had not yet began and it was announced that the plans for the extension were to be revised with a new plan hoped to be drawn up in the second quarter of 2019.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- england-south-yorkshire-31939692 In May 2020 British Land said the extension was unlikely to go ahead due to the uncertain times caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  2007 floods  Meadowhall was inundated by the River Don during the June 2007 floods, with water peaking at . The worst affected areas were between Market Street and The Arcade. Meadowhall itself reopened six days later, and trading recommenced. However, most shops on the ground floor were closed for between two and three months so that they could be refitted. Meadowhall has since installed flood gates, to prevent this from happening in the future. Meadowhall was also affected by the November 2019 floods on the same night as the Christmas Light Switch-on. Although the event was cancelled many people had already began to travel for the performances and once people had arrived public transport began to be cancelled affecting people all over South Yorkshire meaning that many people couldn't get home or had to wait for hours to be picked up. As the flooding was getting worse and worse across the area many shops and businesses began to close. People who were going to be stuck there over night went to clothes shops like Primark and bought comfy pj clothes to wear. Shops Meadowhall has over 280 stores, most of which are major high street stores, including Boots, Debenhams, House of Fraser, Primark, Zara, Topshop/Topman, Next, O2 (UK) and Apple Store. The Lanes is an area next to the Oasis Dining Quarter which includes small independent shops. Oasis Dining Quarter and cinema The Oasis food court before it was refurbished The Oasis Dining Quarter is Meadowhall's food court which has food outlets and seating on both floors. The ground floor contains mostly fast food outlets including McDonald's, KFC, Subway, Pizza Hut, Five Guys and Barburrito but includes restaurants Nando's, Harvester and a Wetherspoons. The upper floor consists mostly of restaurants including Tapas Revolution, Frankie & Benny's, Coal Grill And Bar, PizzaExpress, Wagamama, Handmade Burger Co, Zizzi and T.G.I. Fridays. In July 2011 following the opening of T.G.I. Fridays, the food court underwent a £7 million redevelopment which saw it re-branded from 'Oasis Food Court', to 'Oasis Dining Quarter'. Restaurants such as Las Iguanas, ChaoBaby and Giraffe were added as part of the redevelopment. Vue cinema The dining quarter includes an eleven screen Vue multiplex cinema. It opened as a Warner Bros Theatre in 1993, before becoming a Warner Village Cinema and was rebranded Vue as part of their takeover of the chain. The cinema was refurbished after the 2007 flooding. Transport connections Meadowhall has a public transport interchange, Meadowhall Interchange, making it the only shopping centre in the UK that combines a bus, rail and tram interchange as well as making the centre accessible to both the local region and the rest of the country. Motorway The centre is located at junction 34 of the M1 motorway. Sheffield Supertram Meadowhall is served by two stops on the Sheffield Supertram network; the Yellow Line terminus at Meadowhall Interchange is located to the north of the shopping centre, while Tinsley / Meadowhall South tram stop is located to the south of the shopping centre and is served by the Yellow Line and tram-train services to Rotherham Parkgate. Meadowhall Interchange tram stop is located 15 minutes from the city centre and Meadowhall is used as a park and ride. The Yellow Line from Meadowhall passes the Sheffield Arena, Ice Sheffield, the Institute Of Sport and the Valley Centertainment entertainment complex. Bus The interchange has a large bus station with routes covering most of South Yorkshire, but especially the local Sheffield and Rotherham area. Train There is a multi-platform railway station at Meadowhall which has frequent links to and from , , and Manchester.  Awards  The Centre has won awards, including two awards for innovative events at the ICSC maxi awards 2006, held in Chicago and two awards for its Retail Bonding Programme (in best Retail Partnership category) and also for its commercialisation, (adding value to the customer shopping experience) at the BCSC Purple Apple Awards in London.  Environmental policy  The centre recycles 97% of waste from retailers and customers, with the remaining three percent going to incineration with energy recovery; no waste goes to landfill. Meadowhall was the first UK shopping centre to develop an on-site recycling facility. The Resource Recovery Centre, which opened in 2006, operates a conveyor belt system to separate out types of waste, from paper to plastic, cardboard to cans. Meadowhall began to harvest rainwater in 2006. Four water storage tanks collect rainwater and condensation from air conditioning. This is then used throughout the Shopping Centre for cleaning, flushing toilets and watering the external landscaped areas. The tanks are nearly 7 metres high and hold some of water each. In 2008 Meadowhall installed a bore hole. This is a narrow shaft drilled into the ground that collects water from beneath the earth. Water from the bore hole is collected into a master tank. The storage tanks are connected onto a \\"network\\", which will ensure 90-95% of all water used by customers and retailers for flushing toilets is derived from rainwater harvesting or bore hole water.  Facial recognition trial  In 2018 Meadowhall was the site of a month-long police trial of facial recognition software by South Yorkshire Police, without the public's knowledge. In August 2019 a spokeswoman for British Land, Meadowhall's, owner said, \\"Over a year ago we conducted a short trial at Meadowhall, in conjunction with the police, and all data was deleted immediately after the trial\\". Big Brother Watch's chief executive Silkie Carlo was reported by the BBC as saying, \\"There is an epidemic of facial recognition in the UK. The collusion between police and private companies in building these surveillance nets around popular spaces is deeply disturbing\\".

Strategic situation   Union situation  In early 1862, Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis had successfully invaded northwest Arkansas and defeated Confederate forces at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Soon after, most Confederate forces in Arkansas were withdrawn across the Mississippi River, leaving the state almost defenseless. Curtis intended to press his invasion with the hope of reaching the capital city of Little Rock and knocking the state out of the war.  Confederate situation  The Confederate outlook in the spring of 1862 was grim. Most of its armed forces had been withdrawn from Arkansas and no commander with field experience remained. General John Selden Roane was put in charge of the remaining Arkansas forces.  Maneuvering to battle   Union movements  General Curtis began his movement from northwest Arkansas in early April. He moved his 17,000-man army back into Missouri to take advantage of better transportation routes and headed east. He established his base of supply at Rolla, Missouri. Curtis reached West Plains, Missouri on April 29 and turned southwards into Arkansas. In addition to his large force, Curtis was assigned an additional 5,000 men under Brigadier General Frederick Steele. During the first part of May, Curtis and Steele encountered numerous logistical difficulties. Poor weather, difficult terrain, and lack of consistent resupply slowed their progress. But by May 9, Curtis' large, but ill-supplied, force had emerged from the Ozark foothills onto flat ground at Searcy. It was poised to strike deep into central Arkansas and seize Little Rock itself as soon as supplies were gathered. While encamped at Searcy, Curtis and overall commander Major General Henry W. Halleck began to correspond about the upcoming Federal administration of Little Rock.  Confederate movements  Confederate General Roane set to work immediately in cobbling together a defense to meet the approaching Union Army. Roane stopped elements of the 12th Texas Cavalry that were bound for the eastern theaters and ordered troops who had made it as far as Memphis, Tennessee to turn around. Some attempts at recruiting local volunteers were made, but with little success. On May 10, Roane sent Texas cavalry as scouts to determine the federal position. The scouts encountered numerous refugees fleeing the Union Army. The refugees reported that the Union forces numbered about 30,000, mostly German immigrants. Roane had approximately 1,200 Texas horsemen to confront this force. He ordered cotton stores near Searcy destroyed, and Governor Henry Massey Rector prepared government offices for evacuation. Meanwhile, small advance parties from the Union Army clashed with the Texas scouts between Searcy and Little Rock, and a few Union casualties resulted. By May 19, several companies of the Texas cavalry had reached Searcy Landing and awaited an opportunity to strike the overwhelming opponent.  Battle  Union General Curtis continued to worry about logistical problems, as his supply line was unable to provide the necessities for his army. He ordered Colonel Peter J. Osterhaus to send a strong foraging party to nearby farms. It consisted of seven companies of mixed infantry and cavalry from the 17th Missouri Infantry and the 4th Missouri Cavalry. The forage party crossed the Little Red River and proceeded to two farms along Whitney's Lane. Scouting parties reported the movement of these companies to Colonel Emory Rogers, commander of approximately 150 Texas cavalrymen and local volunteers. About 300 additional Confederate troops were on the way, but Rogers decided to attack even though he was outnumbered. He divided his forces into two groups of Texans and one of Arkansans and ordered a mounted charge down the lane. The initial charge overran Company H of the 17th Missouri, which dissolved under fire and fled toward Company F, which was attempting to set up a defensive position in a treeline. The combined companies fought bravely for a few minutes, as more Confederates came up to press them. The untrained and undisciplined Texans and local volunteers attacked furiously, and in some cases apparently ignored Union soldiers' attempts to surrender. Within a short time, Company F had been routed as well. Meanwhile, Company G of the 17th and some Union cavalry moved forward and traded volleys with the Confederate horsemen. Major Eugen Kielmansegge of the 4th Missouri Cavalry ordered the rest of the available Union troopers to charge the Confederates. Company C of the 4th Missouri Cavalry plowed into the attackers and managed to drive them back into the woods between the foraging detail and the rest of the Federal army. Other Federal cavalry continued to arrive at the position. Kielmansegge, having concentrated his forces, set up a defensive position and continued to exchange fire with the Confederates as they prepared for another attack. Meanwhile, other companies of the 17th Missouri had heard firing from the base camp across the Little Red River and marched out to relieve the forage party. Confederate Major Rogers ordered his men to retreat to the southwest and most did, though the Arkansans and some Texans remained on the field and attacked the relief column before withdrawing. The 300 expected Confederate reinforcements arrived on the field just after the retreat had been sounded and joined in the withdrawal.  Aftermath  The battle at Whitney's Lane had lasted one hour and resulted in 51 Union men killed or wounded and approximately 10 Confederate casualties. The 17th Missouri Infantry lost only 68 men during the entire war; nearly one third of those were at Whitney's Lane. The battle was little more than a skirmish, but the psychological and strategic effects of the conflict were far more than was reflected by the number of casualties. For both Confederate soldiers and civilians in Arkansas, the battle provided a huge psychological lift at a critical time. Arkansas newspapers trumpeted the battle and praised its participants. These articles lifted the despair that had gripped the state and provided the Confederates with a new sense of optimism and hope. Even though their losses were small compared to the size of their force, the results of the battle proved disheartening for the Union. Union troops were suffering from lack of supplies and some soldiers reportedly lost confidence in their officers. Within a few days, Confederate cavalry was harassing the Union supply line from the rear, making Union logistics problems even worse. Confederate theater commander Hindman also launched a clever disinformation campaign aimed at convincing the Union forces that new units were pouring into Little Rock from Texas. By May 31, Curtis began to rethink his position in the face of the Confederate activity. On June 2, Curtis held a council of war, and the Federal commanders agreed to a retreat toward the Ozark foothills. By the end of June, Curtis had abandoned his campaign against Little Rock entirely and moved to Helena, Arkansas to establish a new supply line at the Mississippi River.

The road is part of the unsigned Euroroutes E20 (Shannon to Saint Petersburg) and E22 (Holyhead to Ishim). The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and conceived as two separate routes, was opened in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing at that time in Tarbock on the outskirts of Liverpool. The motorway absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960. Adjusted for inflation to 2007, its construction cost approximately £765 million. The motorway has an average daily traffic flow of 144,000 vehicles in West Yorkshire, and has several sections prone to gridlock, in particular, between Leeds and Huddersfield and the M60 section around Eccles. The M62 coach bombing of 1974 and the Great Heck rail crash of 2001 are the largest incidents to have occurred on the motorway. Stott Hall Farm, situated between the carriageways on the Pennine section, has become one of the best-known sights on the motorway. The M62 has no junctions numbered 1, 2 or 3, or even an officially numbered 4, because it was intended to start in Liverpool proper, not in its outskirts. Between Liverpool and Manchester, and east of Leeds, the terrain along which the road passes is relatively flat. Between Manchester and Leeds it traverses the Pennines and its foothills, rising to above sea level slightly east of junction 22 in Calderdale, not far from the boundary between Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. Planning The motorway's origins are found in the 1930s, when the need for a route between Lancashire and Yorkshire had been agreed after discussion by their county highway authorities. At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was needed to connect the ports to industrial Yorkshire. After the Second World War, the Minister of Transport appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the A580 road (East Lancashire Road) in Swinton and the A1 road near Selby. The 1949 Road Plan for South Lancashire identified the need to upgrade the A580 to dual carriageway with grade separation and provide bypasses at Huyton and Cadishead. In 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, the Lancashire–Yorkshire Motorway, was laid down, with Ferrybridge at the eastern terminus rather than Selby. By the 1960s, the proposed A580 upgrade to dual carriageway was considered inadequate, and there was an urgent need to link Liverpool to the motorway network. The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire. When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience of the Interstate Highway System led him to conclude that the Merseyside Expressway, planned to run between Liverpool and the M6, would need to be extended to the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and beyond, to create a continuous motorway between Liverpool and Ferrybridge (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964). Initially the plans were unpopular and not supported by the Ministry of Transport, but the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963. Construction Liverpool to Worsley It was the intention to build an urban motorway in Liverpool. The M62 was intended to terminate at Liverpool's Inner Motorway, which was not built. The proposed route would have followed the railway into Liverpool as far as Edge Hill, with junctions at Rathbone Road and Durning Road where it would drop to two lanes before terminating at the Islington Radial. Difficulties arose building the Liverpool urban motorway resulting in delays, with the section between Tarbock and Liverpool the last to be completed in 1976. In total, two viaducts, ten bridges and seven underpasses were constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential areas. The motorway was constructed only as far as the Queens Drive inner ring road, which is junction 4. The section west of Manchester was intended to be a separate motorway, the M52 to link Liverpool and Salford, but a continuous motorway between Leeds and Liverpool was deemed more feasible, Construction between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the M57 and M6 motorways. Simultaneously, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was underway, which required land drainage and the removal of unsuitable earth. This section was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between Ferrybridge and Tarbock. In Greater Manchester Construction starting in Milnrow, 1968 Two motorways were planned, the M52 from Liverpool to Salford and the M62 to link Pole Moor with the Stretford–Eccles Bypass. The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford–Eccles Bypass, which is now the section between Junctions 7 to 13 of the M60. Construction started in 1957, and the motorway opened in 1960. It was originally built as a 2-lane motorway only. It was later re-numbered M63. The section between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford is now occupied by the M602 motorway. The Eccles–Pole Moor section opened in 1971. Between Eccles and Pole Moor, 67 motorway crossings were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions. Much of the Worsley Braided Interchange was built on undeveloped mossland where deep peat deposits had been covered with waste. Between Worsley and Milnrow, some underlying coal seams were still actively worked when the motorway was constructed and allowances had to be made to counteract possible future subsidence. The motorway crosses the Irwell Valley and the Pendleton Fault on a single-span bridge above the river. Milnrow to Outlane M62 Summit sign Surveying for the Pennine section began in November 1961 and its route was determined in July 1963. Construction between Windy Hill and Pole Moor was difficult through inhospitable hilly terrain, peat bogs, and in undesirable weather conditions. The motorway's highest point, above sea level at Windy Hill near Denshaw () is the highest point of any motorway in England. A notable structure between junctions 21 and 22 on the uphill section towards Windy Hill is the Rakewood Viaduct which carries the road over the Longden End Brook. The first section of the motorway in Yorkshire was completed between the county boundary at Windy Hill and Outlane in 1970. To build this section, of material was moved, of which was solid rock and of peat which had to be cut from the rock strata and deposited on adjacent hillsides. The geology of the moors resulted in the engineers splitting the carriageways for in the middle of this section, sparing Stott Hall Farm from demolition. The motorway crosses Scammonden Dam on an embankment between junctions 22 and 23. Preparatory work in the Deanhead Valley began in August 1964 and the dam in 1966. The motorway's opening on 20 December 1970 was dependent on completion of the dam. Two other notable constructions on the Pennine section are the pedestrian bridge carrying the Pennine Way, which is curved downwards with long cantilevers, and Scammonden Bridge, the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in the world when it was built. It carries a B road above the motorway. The section between Pole Moor and Outlane suffered fewer problems as the summer weather was satisfactory. Outlane to Lofthouse Stationary traffic at Lofthouse Interchange The section of the motorway between Gildersome and Lofthouse was built at the same time, resulting in the demolition of a significant proportion of the village of Tingley to build the eponymous interchange. Lofthouse Interchange was built between 1965 and 1967. Owen Williams and the Babtie Group were the engineers. Located where the M62 crosses above the M1 motorway, it is a complex three- level junction with eight bridges including a roundabout supported by four long curved bridges on 12-metre piers above both motorways. The roundabout's north and south bridges have spans of 28 metres and the east and west have spans of 21 metres. The M62 overbridge has a reinforced concrete multi- cellular deck of four spans. Two other pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges carry slip roads over Longthorpe Lane, the B6135. Another bridge with no motorway access carries Longthorpe Lane over the M1. Two skew tunnels were constructed beneath the original junction between 1996 and 1999. The tunnels, constructed using the cut-and-cover method, are for traffic travelling between the M1 south-bound and the M62 west. The tunnel under the M62 is 147 metres in length. East of Lofthouse Ouse Bridge, from the floodplain adjacent to the river Two contracts were awarded for the section between Lofthouse and Ferrybridge in 1972, and both were completed in 1974. On the first contract, care was needed at the River Calder crossing due to the alluvial bedrock. On the second contract precautions were taken as the length was built on old coal mine workings. The section between Ferrybridge and North Cave was the last to be planned and built. The Ouse Bridge, across the River Ouse west of Goole, commenced in January 1973 and is nearly long and rises to above ground level. Completion of the bridge was delayed due to \\"steel supplies [being] a chronic headache\\" and a partial collapse of the framework caused by bolts joining a cross-beam to a trestle shearing. Problems with the bridge delayed the opening of the section east of Goole to May 1976. Development Junction 32a during construction in September 2005 In 1987, the Department of Transport proposed a parallel relief road to combat congestion around Manchester. It would have been restricted to long distance traffic, and the current route, part of the Manchester Outer Ring Road (later the M60), used for local traffic. The proposal suggested the closure of junction 13\\\\. The proposal was designated a \\"long term\\" improvement in 1994, and cancelled on 23 November 1995. In 2000, the section between Eccles Interchange and Simister Interchange (junctions 12 to 18) was designated the M60. Since then, two junctions were opened—in December 2002, the missing junction 8 was opened to allow access to the A574 and the Omega Development Site, while in January 2006, junction 32a was opened to link to the upgraded A1(M). The UK's first motorway high-occupancy vehicle lane was opened at junction 26 in 2008 for eastbound traffic from the M606 with more than one occupant. Smart motorway Pre-2009 proposals to widen the motorway between junctions 25 and 28 to four lanes were withdrawn in January 2009 and replaced by a project to install hard shoulder running and a smart motorway system between junctions 25 and 30. Work started in 2014 to install the system around the M62 – M60 section. Traffic 1999–2006 traffic flow graph The section between junctions 18 (with the M60) and 29 (with the M1) through Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire has been identified as one of the most congested roads in Britain. The motorway provides a direct link between three of the five largest metro areas in England, and is the most practical route for HGVs and other commercial traffic between Manchester and Leeds. There are a significant amount of warehouses in these urban areas, which require commercial delivery to the ports at Merseyside and around the Humber, all of which are transported via the M62. Annual average daily traffic flows of 100,000 cars were recorded east of the Pennines (junction 22) in 2006 and 78,000 cars west of the Pennines. The figures were increases from 90,000 and 70,000 respectively in 1999. By way of comparison, the UK's busiest motorway, the M25 carried 144,000 cars between junctions 7 and 23 in 2006. Stott Hall Farm Stott Hall Farm, viewed from moorland above westbound carriageway Stott Hall Farm, () the only farm in the UK situated in the middle of a motorway, was built in the 18th century on Moss Moor. It lies south of Booth Wood Reservoir where the carriageways are separated between junctions 22 and 23. The road divides for much of its length between the Windy Hill and Deanhead cuttings because of the surrounding geography but a myth persists that it was split because the owners Ken and Beth Wild refused to sell. Sally Boazman, BBC Radio 2's traffic reporter and CB radio users nicknamed it the Little House on the Prairie. It is separated from the motorway by crash barriers and a fence to keep livestock in and prevent out-of-control vehicles crashing onto the property. It is one of the ten best-known sights on the motorway network. It was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary, a Yorkshire Television documentary and a short film. Major incidents On 4 February 1974, a bomb was detonated on a coach travelling between Chain Bar (junction 26) and Gildersome (junction 27). The coach was transporting off-duty army personnel and their family members. Twelve people were killed and 38 were injured. Hartshead Moor services was used as a makeshift hospital and base for investigations. The Provisional Irish Republican Army was deemed responsible. A memorial to the victims was erected at Hartshead Moor services in 2009. The Great Heck rail crash happened on 28 February 2001, at 06:13 after Gary Hart, a sleep-deprived driver, swerved off the M62 onto the East Coast Main Line near Selby. While he was calling the emergency services, a GNER southbound train collided with his Land Rover and derailed into the path of an oncoming goods train. Ten people were killed, including the drivers of both trains, and 82 others were injured. On 1 March 2018, a multi-vehicle crash in severe weather conditions (the beast from the East) caused up to 3,500 vehicles to become trapped on the eastbound Pennine section between Junctions 20 and 24. Up to 200 people, including a baby, spent the night in their vehicles. The military, mountain rescue, fire services and Highways Agency worked alongside the police through the night to ensure people's safety. A barrier between the carriageways was removed to facilitate moving most of the vehicles. The road remained closed the next day due to the weather conditions. A motorway with this number was featured in the video game Forza Horizon 4, although the in- game road does not share any resemblance to the route of the real road. Route The M62's route in relation to the four major cities it serves: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull In addition to passing Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield, the towns of Huyton, St Helens, Widnes, Bury, Rochdale, Oldham, Dewsbury, Pontefract, Selby and Goole are designated primary destinations along the road. The M62 is a terminus to two motorways: the M57 near Prescot and the M18 near Rawcliffe; and has four spur routes: the M602, which serves Manchester, the A627(M), which serves Oldham and Rochdale, the M606, which serves Bradford, and the M621, which serves Leeds. Despite Hull being listed as a primary destination, the motorway downgrades near North Cave, to the west. The motorway starts at Queen's Drive, on Liverpool's middle ring road from where it runs eastward to the outer ring road, the M57. The route has four exits for Warrington: junction 7, an interchange with the A57 road, junction 8, which also houses IKEA, junction 9, which interchanges with the A49 road, which was intended to be a motorway, and junction 11. Between these is junction 10, which is a cloverstack interchange with the M6. The M62 crosses Chat Moss before interchanging with the M60 motorway. Owing to the original plan to extend this section of the motorway into Manchester, motorists must turn off to stay on (a TOTSO) the route into Yorkshire. In Greater Manchester, the motorway shares seven junctions, 12 to 18, with the M60 motorway. Junction 13, signposted Swinton, is situated from junction 12, leaving exiting motorists the hazard of crossing the still-merging M62 traffic. Worsley Braided Interchange serves Junctions 14 and 15 and Junctions 1 to 3 of the M61 which terminates to Preston. M62 passes Scammonden Water in West Yorkshire Between junction 21 and junction 22, the motorway has four lanes eastbound to climb Windy Hill, before crossing the border into Yorkshire and interchanging with the rural A672 road, reaching the highest point of any motorway in England . There is then a travel through the Pennines to the next junction, passing Scammonden Reservoir and Stott Hall Farm. The next junction is 23, which is accessible only for westbound traffic. After this, the road dips through a valley to junction 24 and drops slowly before interchanging with the A644 road at junction 25. Between junctions 22 and 25, the road is used as a border between the metropolitan boroughs of Calderdale and Kirklees. At junction 26, Chain Bar, the motorway interchanges with several roads: the M606, a spur into Bradford, the A58 road, which runs between Prescot and Wetherby, and the A638 road, which runs to Doncaster, then follows the old route of the A1 through Bawtry and Retford, to Markham Moor where it rejoins the A1. The next junction also serves a spur route: the M621 motorway, before bypassing Leeds to the south to the interchange with the M1 motorway, Lofthouse Interchange, at junction 29. East of Leeds, the motorway serves Wakefield at junction 30 and crosses by the River Calder. At junction 32a, the road is crossed by the A1(M) motorway, which also runs parallel to it for a short distance. The next junction 33 serves the A162 and A1 roads, and Ferrybridge service station. After Ferrybridge, the motorway becomes relatively flat, except for a bridge that crosses the River Ouse. For approximately after this, the road runs towards Hull, serving Howden and North Cave, before downgrading to the A63 road.

Lauder addressing the 14th Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress in Budapest, 7 May 2013 The World Jewish Congress (WJC) was founded in Geneva, Switzerland in August 1936 as an international federation of Jewish communities and organizations. According to its mission statement, the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as \\"the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people.\\" Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in New York City, US, and the organization maintains international offices in Brussels, Belgium; Jerusalem, Israel; Paris, France; Moscow, Russia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Geneva, Switzerland. The WJC has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  Organization and related bodies  The WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC North America, the Latin American Jewish Congress, the European Jewish Congress, the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress. Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (Executive Committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent. A special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention. The WJC also maintains a Research Institute based in Jerusalem, Israel. It is involved in research and analysis of a variety of issues of importance to contemporary Jewry, and its findings are published in the form of policy dispatches. Israel's President Shimon Peres addresses a Governing Board meeting of the WJC in Jerusalem, August 2010Operating under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress in Israel, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations has since its inception in 1989 hosted heads of state, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other distinguished visitors to Israel and has issued several publications on Israeli foreign policy and international affairs, including its tri-annual foreign policy journal, the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs. The WJC's current policy priorities include combating anti-Semitism, especially the rise of neo-Nazi parties in Europe, providing political support for Israel, opposing the \\"Iranian threat\\", and dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust, notably with respect to property restitution, reparation and compensation for Holocaust survivors, as well as with Holocaust remembrance. One of the WJC's major programs is concerned with the plight of Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. The WJC is also involved in inter-faith dialogue with Christian and Muslim groups. Current leadership At the 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem in January 2009, Ronald S. Lauder was formally and unanimously elected as WJC president, having previously served as acting president. Lauder was confirmed in his post by the 14th Plenary Assembly, which took place in Budapest in May 2013, and for a third term by the 15th Plenary Assembly in New York, in April 2017. French banker Baron David René de Rothschild serves as chairman of the WJC Governing Board, and Lebanese-born Chella Safra from Brazil is the treasurer of the organization. Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, the president of the European Jewish Congress was named as chairman of the WJC Policy Council. Although the WJC Executive Committee comprises almost 50 members,Our leadership – Executive Committee – WJC website including the heads of the 12 largest Jewish communities in the world outside Israel, a smaller Steering Committee is running the day-to-day activities of the organization. It is composed of the president, the chairman of the WJC Governing Board, the treasurer, the chairmen of the five regional affiliates, the chairmen of the Policy Council, and other members. History The World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, Switzerland in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti- Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were \\"to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught\\", to \\"fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe\\", to support the establishment of a \\"Jewish National Home in Palestine\\" and to create \\"a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern\\".George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936–1976, Geneva 1976 Precursor organizations (1917–1936) The WJC's precursor organizations were the American Jewish Congress and the Comité des Délégations Juives (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the Paris Peace Conference, and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist Leo Motzkin, the Comité des Délégations Juives was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the World Zionist Organization.Unity in Dispersion: A History of the World Jewish Congress, World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, pp. 26–28. However, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the American Jewish Congress. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the \\"convening of a World Jewish Congress\\", \\"as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations\\" in Europe.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 22 In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, \\"pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights.\\"World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 28 Conferences co- organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders Julian Mack and Stephen Wise took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the American Jewish Committee, declined the invitation to attend.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 29 The First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist Nahum Goldmann, who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body.Garai, pg. 10 and 20 Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows: > It is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the > fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it > is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which > will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations > and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.World Jewish > Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New > York 1948, p. 33 The conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany. In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: \\"The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them.\\" The new organization would be based on the \\"concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life.\\"World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 34 In the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his NSDAP in Germany, American Jewish Congress President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress \\"to prove the sincerity of their stand\\" in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany. Foundation (1936) After two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 46 The World Jewish Congress's expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence in order to assure the survival of the Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state. 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, Stephen S. Wise assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: \\"I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it.\\" Nahum Goldmann, co-founder and president of the World Jewish Congress from 1949 to 1977 Although the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress Julian Mack as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus de facto leader of the congress. Nahum Goldmann was named as chair of the Administrative Committee. The new WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration asking the British government not to halt immigration into Palestine and presented it to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland. The WJC chose Paris as its headquarters and also opened a liaison office to the League of Nations in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor Paul Guggenheim and later by Gerhart Riegner, who initially served as Guggenheim's secretary.Gerhart Riegner – Never Despair: Sixty Years in the Service of the Jewish People and of Human Rights, published by Ivan R. Dee, 2006 In its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly the lobbying of the League of Nations and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given the weakness of the League of Nations vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, pp. 83–110 Following the November 1938 pogroms against Jews in Germany called Kristallnacht in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: \\"Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime.\\" With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the WJC headquarters moved from Paris to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under Nazi occupation, the World Jewish Congress's headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, pp. 122–123 Some of the personnel who worked in the WJC's European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina. WJC efforts during the Holocaust and its aftermath The WJC's initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries. Left to right: Nahum Goldmann, Stephen Wise, and French lawyer Henry Torrès (speaking) at a World Jewish Congress conference in New York City, 7 June 1942 Under the auspices of the WJC, 18 committees were set up in the United States composed of exiled representatives of the different European Jewish communities under Nazi rule. The committees were modeled on the governments-in-exile, and their task was to provide moral and material support for Jews in the respective countries, and to prepare a program of Jewish postwar demands. All representative committees together formed the Advisory Council on European Jewish Affairs, which came into being at a conference in New York City in June 1942.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, pp. 128–129 The WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the Vichy regime against the Jews would be repudiated upon France's liberation.Garai, p. 14 In late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, Ignacy Schwarzbart, one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans. Riegner Telegram On 8 August 1942, the WJC's Geneva representative Gerhart Riegner sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis planned Final Solution to exterminate all Jews in the German- occupied territories.U.S. State Department receives information from Switzerland regarding the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe: The American Experience Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist Eduard Schulte. His telegram read as follows: > Received alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in Führer > headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled > countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and > concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop > campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic > acid stop Louise Waterman Wise, Jewish activist and wife of WJC President Stephen S. Wise, addressing the World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference in Atlantic City, November 1944 It was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President Stephen S. Wise received Riegner's alarming message.Rafael Medoff, \\"How America First Learnede of the Holocaust\\" The Algemeiner (June 11, 2012). Retrieved June 26, 2012. The telegram was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it \\"a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties\\", while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 159 On 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC- organized \\"Stop Hitler Now\\" demonstration at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, Chaim Weizmann, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and others.World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 162 However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau stated in front of President Roosevelt that \\"certain officials in our State Department\\" had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to \\"prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe\\". Rescue efforts Throughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces.Garai, p. 16 Despite the US State Department's opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the US Treasury Department, headed by Henry Morgenthau, to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.Garai, p. 18 However, at the Bermuda Refugee Conference in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: \\"The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf.\\"World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 165 Only in January 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the setting up of the War Refugee Board, whose purpose was to \\"rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death\\".World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 166 The World Jewish Congress also tried – mostly in vain – to convince the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was \\"in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments\\", and that the success of its work \\"depended on discreet and friendly successions.\\"World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, pp. 168–169 The Holocaust era president of WJC, Stephen Wise, opposed the Bergson Group's rescue activism.The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941–1945 (Pantheon Books, 1984) The Deafening Silence: American Jewish Leaders and the Holocaust (New York: Shapolsky Publishers, 1987) Later president Nachum Goldman told the State Department (per department protocol) that Hillel Kook (aka Peter Bergson) is an adventurer and does not represent \\"organized Jewry\\". He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activismA Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust, with David S. Wyman (The New Press, 2002) Letter to State Department Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki On 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC's Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the Auschwitz death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki: > After a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed > only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success > of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any > case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our > resources. In November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in Atlantic City, USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, Stephen S. Wise was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following: > The closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending > that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be > charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life > of Jews in liberated countries.

Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, Folke Bernadotte, the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.Frank Fox, 'A Jew Talks to Himmler' See also: Hilel Storch Post-war efforts At the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.Garai, pp. 20–22 Stephen Wise addresses World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in Montreux, Switzerland, August 1948 On 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering. On 21 September 1945, Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the \\"great losses\\" suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help \\"our persecuted people.\\" Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. \\"We will consider it,\\" Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: \\"certainly, most favorably, with all our love.\\" The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.Michael R. Marrus, \\"The missing: the Holocaust, the Church & Jewish orphans\\"Garai, p. 22 The WJC also supported the foundation of the United Nations Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at Luna Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina. WJC and the creation of the State of Israel Although its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the Diaspora, the WJC always actively supported the aims of Zionism, i.e. creation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. The Yishuv, the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution \\"the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each.\\"World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion – A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 67 In 1946, in a memorandum to the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that \\"the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self- governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine.\\"Garai, p. 27 WJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel's proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged \\"world Jewry's solidarity\\" with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.Garai, pp. 26–28 Negotiations with Germany on reparations and compensation In 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established Federal Republic of Germany to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a \\"listening post\\" on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, Nahum Goldmann, at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference).Garai, p. 28 The same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer recognized Germany's duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. \\"Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering,\\" Adenauer said.History of the Claims Conference Retrieved June 21, 2012. On 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head Nahum Goldmann and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the State of Israel. Subsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims. In 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor Leopold Figl subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.Garai, p. 34 At the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), Nahum Goldmann was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president. WJC efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry Although the Soviet Union initially supported the creation of the State of Israel, during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership. During the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names. Third Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, Geneva, Switzerland, 4–11 August 1953 In 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called Doctors' plot, and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.Garai In 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.Garai, p. 36 In 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.Garai, pp. 36–52 At the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the Declaration of Helsinki on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and \\"recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland.\\" Under the motto, 'Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union's policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one's own language, culture and heritage. \\"You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry,\\" US President Ronald Reagan told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the latter's first state visit to the US in 1987. In 1983, Edgar Bronfman suggested that \\"American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind.\\" After [Mikhail Gorbachev]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel. In a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, \\"There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved.\\" Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, \\"Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration.\\" On 25 March 1987, WJC leaders Edgar M. Bronfman, Israel Singer, Sol Kanee and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Morris B. Abram, arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow. Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.Gad Nahson, EDGAR M.

In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: \\"Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the greatest danger of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity.\\" The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings. World Jewish Congress conference on the situation of Jews in North Africa, Algiers, 1952The WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action. The memorandum in particular mentioned an Arab League document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor. During the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule. The WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration.Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A.

However, both King Mohammed V and his successor, Hassan II of Morocco continued to emphasize that Jews enjoyed equal rights in their country. 1950s–1980s Delegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959. In 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936–1976, p. 40 In 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, Eugen Gerstenmaier, delivered an address titled, 'Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved' to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC. Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest. In 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization's constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide.Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936–1976, p. 42 In 1974, the Board of Deputies of British Jews affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved. To emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the World Zionist Organization.Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936–1976, pp. 56–58 Opposition to UN resolution condemning Zionism as racism The World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which was adopted on November 10, 1975 and held \\"that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination\\".Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism, Gil Troy, Oxford University Press, 2012, The WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an \\"attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, ... amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred.\\" All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution.Activities of the World Jewish Congress, February 1975-October 1977, Report of the Secretary-General to the General Council of the World Jewish Congress at its meeting in Washington, October 30 – November 3, 1977, Geneva, October 1977, p. 6 Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686. During the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel.\\"WJC Committee on Arab Boycott Will Focus on International Pacts\\", JTA, 14 October 1975 Leadership changes At the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader Nahum Goldmann (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the Herut movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, opposed Goldmann's re-election for his criticism of Israel's policies, notably with respect to the peace process.

Seated on the right: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak RabinTwo years later, in 1977, the American real estate developer and erstwhile president of B'nai B'rith International Philip Klutznick succeeded Goldmann as WJC president. In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President Jimmy Carter, the Canadian- American businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr. took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.\\"Bronfman Heads Jewish Congress\\", New York Times, 1 February 2012 =Edgar M. Bronfman= Under the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General Israel Singer (who took over from Gerhart Riegner in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: \\"For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish.\\"\\"Elan Steinberg advocated for Holocaust survivors around the world\\", Jewish Ledger, 10 April 2012 Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization, as they broadened the organization's base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s. On 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.\\"WJC to Be the Only Jewish NGO to Address UN Assembly’s Special Session on Disarmament\\", JTA, 24 May 1982 Controversy over Catholic convent's presence at Auschwitz In 1985, Carmelite nuns opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner, also called for the removal. A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years. However, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent's presence and said Pope John Paul II should \\"exercise his authority\\" to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff's action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: \\"It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed.\\" A few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action, although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.

In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR's responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime.Holocauste: L'Est avoue – Libération, 9 February 1990, p. 17 In a statement, Modrow said: > The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do > everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, > so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German > soil, but only peace and understanding among people. A few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the Volkskammer, passed a resolution which recognized the GDR's responsibility for the Holocaust and asked \\"Jews around the world for forgiveness\\". The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the German reunification treaty and continues to be part of German law. In 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its Executive Committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.\\"A JEWISH PARLEY IN BUDAPEST\\", New York Times, 7 May 1987 Waldheim affair In 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate Kurt Waldheim, a former secretary general of the United Nations, had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party \\"Sturmabteilung\\" (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943. Waldheim called the allegations \\"pure lies and malicious acts\\". In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been \\"deliberately misinterpreted.\\" Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: \\"Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed.\\" He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had \\"remained confined to a desk\\". Former Austrian Jewish chancellor Bruno Kreisky called the World Jewish Congress's actions an \\"extraordinary infamy\\" adding that in election, Austrians \\"won't allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President.\\"\\"EX-CHANCELLOR VOICES CRITICISM OF WALDHEIM\\", New York Times, 4 April 1986 In view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.Simon Wiesenthal \\"The Waldheim Case\\" in Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria edited by Dagmar Lorenz. pp 81-95, University of Nebraska press Throughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed \\"personae non gratae\\" by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the Vatican City.\\"Waldheim, ex-UN leader and Nazi, buried in Austria\\" Reuters, 23 June 2007 In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians' report on his military past in the Wehrmacht. On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was \\"part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine\\". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor. Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments In 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the Jewish Agency for Israel. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the Claims Conference). According to its website, the WRJO's mission is to consult and negotiate \\"with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people\\", to conduct \\"research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate \\"funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary.\\" Current World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder is chairman of the WRJO. Swiss bank settlement In the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims \\"that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis\\". In total, the WJC, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, Swiss banks, Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion. http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/838311.html Edgar M. Bronfman In 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of Switzerland over so-called dormant World War II-era bank accounts of Holocaust victims. The WJC entered a class-action lawsuit in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, \\"damages\\" to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that \\"hundreds of millions of dollars\\" of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President Bill Clinton, Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues.Hearings before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs , May 15, 1997. The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Special Envoy of the Department of State on Property Restitution in Central and Eastern Europe,\\"U.S. and Allied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany During World War II\\" Audits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US$32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were \\"probably\\" related to victims of Nazi persecution.\\"Report on Dormant Accounts of Victims of Nazi Persecution in Swiss Banks\\", Annex 4; and Part I paragraph 41 The commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland. On 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts. Nazi gold In 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US$8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US$2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks. Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations.\\"Swiss Reject Finding Of $3 Billion Gold Debt\\", New York Times, 8 October 1997 In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US Federal Reserve Bank admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries.\\"U.S. admits to melting gold of Nazi victims\\", New York Jewish Week, 5 December 1997 In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.\\"Sweden to Investigate Assertions of Nazi Gold\\", New York Times, 21 December 1996 Agreements with other European countries on Holocaust-era property restitution and compensation During the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during World War II. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.WJC anniversary video In 1997, French Prime Minister Alain Juppé created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.\\"A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany\\" PBS Frontline In 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.\\"NS-Zwangsarbeiter: Erste Zahlungen ab Juni\\", Spiegel Online, 23 May 2001 Restitution of looted art In 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis' massive looting of art.

In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.\\"Canada probes Nazi loot\\", BBC News, 8 December 2000 Relations with Poland The WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of Polish Jewry. In December 1936, for example, Nahum Goldmann visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Beck, but this demarche did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic effects of the ban on kosher slaughter (Shechita), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted.Unity in Dispersion, p. 94 The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland. After the war, when a wave of anti-Jewish violence swept the country, the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of Gen. Spychalski.Devorah Hakohen, Immigrants in turmoil: mass immigration to Israel and its repercussions... Syracuse University Press, 2003 – 325 pages. Page 70. A World Jewish Congress delegation meets with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, June 2008As the Jewish community dwindled, over successive waves of emigration (the last in 1968), the WJC saw Poland as an important repository of Jewish history as well as the custodians of the killing grounds in which much of European Jewry fell victim to the German Final Solution.Laurence Weinbaum, The Jewish communities in the diaspora and antisemitism in Poland Moreshet: Journal for the Study of the Holocaust and Antisemitism. VI, Spring 2009 In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide.Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz: Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 4 The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi David Rosen of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: \\"To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did.\\"Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz:P Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 6 The WJC has consistently lobbied the Polish government to enact legislation that would ensure the restitution of private property seized during the Nazi occupation and later during the Communist regime. In April 1996, during a discussion about the restitution of Jewish communal property that had been seized during the Holocaust, WJC Secretary General Israel Singer, allegedly stated that \\"More than three million Jews died in Poland, and the Polish people are not going to be the heirs of the Polish Jews. We are never going to allow this. ... They're gonna hear from us until Poland freezes over again.\\" If Poland did not satisfy Jewish claims it would be \\"publicly attacked and humiliated\\" in the international forum, Singer said according to a Reuters report.Jewish group threatens Poland over restitution, Reuters, 19 April 1996 In April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was \\"telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them\\". In pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive Polish Jewry and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history.Policy Study No. 14 \\"Polish Jews: A Postscript to the 'Final Chapter'?\\" (Jerusalem, 1998) and Policy Study No. 22 \\"The Struggle for Memory in Poland: Auschwitz, Jedwabne and Beyond\\" (Jerusalem, 2001) Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re- establishment of relations between the two countries was marked. Key policies and activities of the World Jewish Congress Support for Israel International Quartet for the Middle East envoy Tony Blair briefs delegates at the World Jewish Congress Governing Board in Jerusalem on the peace process, June 2011 The mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks \\"to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel.\\" Fighting the delegitimization of Israel The WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the delegitimization of Israel. The WJC lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments \\"apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries.\\" The WJC states on its website that \\"Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law\\" and that \\"Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in United Nations bodies such as the UN Human Rights Council.\\" In early 2009, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder wrote to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Navi Pillay, ahead of the Durban Review Conference, asking that the clauses stigmatizing Israel in the 2001 Durban Declaration and Program of Action be repealed. Lauder also denounced the United Nations Human Rights Council for issuing what he called a \\"profoundly unbalanced and biased report\\" into Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla in May 2010. \\"We note that [the council] has lost its moral compass, where terrorism is deemed activism, and self-defense is called disproportionate violence. If the UNHRC wants to regain the integrity of its original purpose, it cannot submit to being manipulated into justifying and covering up terrorism,\\" the WJC president declared. In December 2010, the World Jewish Congress, together with several Israeli government ministries, convened a consultation entitled 'Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel's Legitimacy' in Jerusalem. It was attended by over 100 professional Jewish leaders from 60 different organizations. The conference identified the need for a collaborative effort on behalf of world Jewry and the State of Israel to advance the protection of Israel's rights and \\"halt the political and economic assault\\" against it. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Minister for Strategic Affairs, Moshe Yaalon, Jewish Agency for Israel Chairman Natan Sharansky, former Canadian Justice Minister and current member of Parliament Irwin Cotler, Italian lawmaker Fiamma Nirenstein and international Jewish leaders participated in the consultation, which led to the establishment of the 'Global Coalition for Israel' and the formation of task forces to implement the conclusions reached.Strategic Consultation – \\"Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel’s Legitimacy\\" – WJC website Together with the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the WJC in September 2011 published a policy book entitled 'The Rights of Israel as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy'. The book features academic articles by international legal and political experts across the political spectrum, including Alan Dershowitz, Ruth Lapidoth, Stanley Urman, Shlomo Avineri, Martin Gilbert, Dan Diker and others. The authors outline Israel's historical and legal rights, the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and argue against many of the major claims made against Israel by local and international actors. In April 2017, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state \\"must be treated like any other member state.\\" He also stressed that Israel had an \\"undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors,\\" and that \\"the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel.\\" Support for peace process and opposition to Palestinian unilateralism The World Jewish Congress has endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is opposed to unilateral actions by either side. It states on its website that \\"a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution is the only legitimate and just way to provide for a lasting peace. The nascent Palestinian state should respect the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. A Palestinian state can only be founded if it respects Israel's right to exist in security. Initiatives that help to enable the Palestinians to advance economically and socially should also be supported as a means of stabilizing the peace process.\\" In the run-up to the 2011 UN Security Council vote that would have resulted in the success of the Palestinian unilateral bid for statehood, the WJC worked to underscore what it perceived as a dangerous move for Israel, for the sustainability of a future Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East. In September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians, assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority's unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia. Ronald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper Die Welt, called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: \\"Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,\\" the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how \\"unpredictable\\" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership \\"would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel\\", Lauder argued.Call for Israel to join NATO – Jewish Chronicle, 8 February 2011 In May 2012, Lauder reacted \\"with dismay\\" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were \\"illegal\\" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians \\"impossible\\". Lauder said: \\"Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas.\\" He added that \\"the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied.\\" In June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University, Lauder published a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to return to the negotiating table. \\"Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace,\\" Lauder wrote. Holocaust legacy issues The World Jewish Congress continues to focus on Holocaust legacy issues, including the restitution of Jewish assets seized during and after World War II. Holocaust remembrance Preserving the memory of the Shoah is a key issue in the WJC's public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President Christian Wulff and a number of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz. Lauder declared: > Auschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where > the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It > is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a > million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS Doctor Josef Mengele > conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where > thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of > war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of > them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today's anti-Semites and > hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only > refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it. On January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President Donald Trump on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to Anti-Defamation League director Jonathan Greenblatt's criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as \\"manufactured controversies.\\" Since September 2019 the World Jewish Congress receives Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servants from the Gedenkdienst program, founded in 1992 by Dr. Andreas Maislinger, from the Austrian Service Abroad. Restitution of Jewish assets Since the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries. See above: Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments In its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are \\"conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union.\\" The organization emphasizes that \\"the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements.\\" WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation. Fighting Holocaust denial, revisionism and glorification of the Nazis On repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology. Bernie Ecclestone In July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced calls from WJC President Ronald S. Lauder to resign as Formula One chief after he had praised Adolf Hitler in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler \\"got things done.\\" Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that \\"I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things.\\" Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: \\"It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out\\" and \\"They have a lot of influence everywhere.\\" After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had \\"been an idiot.\\" The WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling 'I love Hitler' T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website. In February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-President Charlotte Knobloch called the verdict \\"quirky\\" and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany's law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime \\"through the backdoor\\". Following an interview with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel \\"an artificial state\\" that had been built on the \\"lie of the Holocaust\\", Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader's statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically. Standing alone amongst all major Jewish organizations, World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder backed Donald Trump's decision to omit any mention of Jews in his 2017 Holocaust commemoration statement. Lauder contended that other Jewish groups were \\"play[ing] politics\\" and engaging in \\"manufactured outrages\\" that distracted from \\"real\\" instances of anti-Semitic threats. The WJC also publicly backed David M. Friedman as President Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, in spite of critics who accused Friedman of trivializing the gravity of the Holocaust by comparing Jewish members of the liberal pro-Israel group J Street to \\"kapos\\", or Nazi collaborators. Prosecution of Nazi war criminals The World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: \\"There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age\\". The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the \\"few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands\\" before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions. In 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk's trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: \\"Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict.\\" In December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite Peter Egner to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews. Egner died in January 2011. Fighting anti-Semitism Eduardo Elsztain and Ronald S. Lauder with Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Buenos Aires, June 2008One of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight anti-Semitism in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: \\"Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of neo-Nazism, xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities.\\" In an opinion article entitled \\"Sweden's Shame\\", in 2010, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for \\"fanning the flames\\" of hatred against Jews. In May 2012, Lauder condemned as \\"despicable\\" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung who had \\"revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media\\" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 \\"massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik\\" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: \\"There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments.\\" In August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. \\"Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves,\\" Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: \\"This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews.\\" In 2013, Budapest, Hungary was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was \\"a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti- Semitism in recent years\\". In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as \\"cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals\\" that are \\"unfit to live among people\\" and \\"shouldn't be allowed to exist.\\" Lauder said \\"such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history\\" and concluded that \\"Hungary's international reputation has suffered in recent years\\" not because it was being \\"smeared by the foreign press\\" but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. \\"Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud,\\" Lauder said. On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against \\"Zionists who had subjugated the indigenous people of Hungary.\\" In his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that \\"threatens even us Christians\\" and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. \\"We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe,\\" a WJC spokesman said afterwards. Hatred on the internet The World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that \\"More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds\\", which WJC CEO R. Robert Singer said revealed \\"how alarming the situation really is.\\" Previously, the organization had urged the German branch of YouTube of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany. In an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times, Singer also accused the internet retailer Amazon.com of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers \\"can buy a plethora of Holocaust- denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon's guidelines, not to mention common decency.\\" Dialogue with other religions The WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate \\"to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values.\\" Jewish-Christian dialogue Inter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the International Council of Christians and Jews in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council and the Declaration Nostra aetate in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict. World Jewish Congress leader Gerhart M. Riegner (center) witnesses formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the Holy See, represented by Monsignor Claudio Maria Celli (left), and the State of Israel, represented by Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, December 1993 Since 1945, WJC leaders have been received by Catholic pontiffs a number of times. Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General A. Leon Kubowitzki in private audience in 1945. Pope Paul VI met WJC President Nahum Goldmann in 1969 and WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner in 1975. In 1979, Philip Klutznick met with Pope John Paul II, and Klutznick's successor Edgar Bronfman, Sr. was received by John Paul II in 1992 and 2003. Bronfman led a delegation of Jewish leaders for a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in June 2005, and his successor Ronald S. Lauder was received by Benedict XVI in October 2007,WJC Delegation meets Pope Benedict, Rome, October 2007 – WJC website December 2010 and May 2012. Pope Francis received a delegation of the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations, including several members of the WJC, in June 2013. On his election as new Catholic pontiff, Ronald Lauder called Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio \\"an experienced man, someone who is known for his open- mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths\\". The organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s. During the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz. :See also: Controversy over Catholic convent's presence at Auschwitz The role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The beatification and possible canonization of Pope Pius XII was criticized by WJC President Ronald S. Lauder, who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. \\"There are strong concerns about Pope Pius XII's political role during World War II which should not be ignored,\\" Lauder declared in a statement. :See also: Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican's decision to revoke the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson, a senior member of the dissident Catholic group Society of St. Pius X. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: \\"The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite.\\" Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. \\"The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair,\\" the WJC president was quoted as saying. In 2010, Ronald S. Lauder was also critical of the continued use of the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the WJC president wrote: \\"When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt.\\" Dialogue with Islam Bosnia's Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceric, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, WJC Vice-President Rabbi Marc Schneier, and British Imam Abdujalil Sajid in Brussels, December 2010 The World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate Islam as \\"one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous,\\" according to the WJC website. In 2008, WJC leaders met with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder also called on the Saudi monarch in New York. In December 2011, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama. The World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials. On that occasion, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier declared: \\"We have hopefully kick- started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don't gain the upper hand.\\" In a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: \\"This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it. Coming from the leading center of Islamic thinking in the world, it will be enormously helpful for all moderate forces within Islam. [ ... ] Leaders from both sides should now seize the opportunity and take Jewish-Muslim relations to the next level. Both communities have a lot more in common, and to give to the other side, than many people think.\\" Pluralistic Israel In August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on \\"Israel's government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage\\" and uphold the country's democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called 'a radical minority'.Israel, This Is Not Who We Are, New York Times, opinion by WJC President Ronald S. Lauder, 13 Aug 2018 Iran Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, and in particular following the terrorist attacks against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992 and the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994, in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran's leadership was accused of having masterminded, the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the \\"Iranian threat\\". In 1995, then WJC President Edgar Bronfman, Sr. was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the DuPont-owned US oil firm Conoco with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants.Clinton Kills Pending Iran-Conoco Oil Deal : Policy: Order will bar development in Mideast nation and reassert hard- line stance taken since '79 hostage crisis – Los Angeles Times, 15 March 1995 Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President Bill Clinton to impose a trade embargo on Iran. \\"We applaud President Clinton's decisive blow against terrorism,\\" declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg. In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and other members of his government in connection with the AMIA bombing, Bronfman said that \\"Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism\\", adding that \\"the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions.\\" The WJC lobbied for the issuing of Red Notices by Interpol against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007. On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: \\"The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places.\\"Iran has 'blood on its hands' over 1994 Argentina blast – Jewish Chronicle, 17 July 2012 In a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved \\"to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC.\\" In 2006, the WJC launched the Iran Update, \\"a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide.\\" The publication focused on exposing Iran's ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation. Further to the WJC's and other international organizations' calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in September 2009. The WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad \\"the world's foremost hatemonger\\". In 2008, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: \\"Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons.\\" Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by Siemens CEO Peter Löscher that his company would not seek new business in Iran. The WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials. Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar addressing a meeting of the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, September 2010 In July 2011, Olympic news outlet Around the Rings reported that World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes' refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. \\"It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year's Olympic Games in London\\", Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics. Ahmadinejad has \\"no business\\" attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the Jewish Chronicle quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying. Jewish refugees from Arab countries The issue of Jewish refugees from Arab lands continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that \\"The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected.\\" The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations. In September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the United Nations headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. \\"Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts – both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed.\\" Lauder said that \\"only addressing the historical facts\\" could help to bring about peace. At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums. Palestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a \\"manipulative strategy\\". It was \\"part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical\\", PLO Executive member Hanan Ashrawi told the newspaper USA Today. Following the conferences, Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians. According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said. Other issues In August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez Frias. The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world because of Chávez' public support for Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community. Following the exclusion of Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer from an ATP tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the \\"suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted.\\" The response of the women's and men's tours to the exclusion of Peer had been \\"faint-hearted,\\" and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency Bloomberg as saying. Ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, for not agreeing to hold one minute's silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. Ronald Lauder said Rogge's stance was \\"unfeeling\\" and \\"completely out of touch.\\" He added: \\"Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history – when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists – it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to 'politicize' the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed – or refused – to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act.\\" In January 2019 WJC President Lauder, the Albanian Ambassador to the UN Besiana Kadare, and the United Nations Department of Global Communications co- hosted an event discussing the actions of Albanians who protected Jews during the Holocaust in Albania. Fundraising and finances The WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States. Controversies, internal conflicts and allegations of financial irregularities (2004–2007) A series of allegations about the organization's accounting practices and \\"unusual\\" money transfers, was raised in 2004 by Isi Leibler, then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress. A comprehensive audit of the WJC's accounts in Switzerland from 1995–2004, conducted by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, reportedly found that \\"over the years $3.8 million 'disappeared' from the bank accounts\\" and that there were \\"significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds.\\" In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC.Stephanie Strom, \\"World Jewish Congress Dismisses Leader\\", The New York Times, March 16, 2007. Retrieved June 24, 2012. Furthermore, the report of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management. Spitzer's office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct \\"did not compromise the core mission\\" of the organization or result in \\"identifiable losses of charitable assets.\\" The report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including \\"the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation).\\"Ami Eden and Nathanial Popper, \\"NY Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement,\\" The Jewish Daily Forward, February 3, 2006. Retrieved June 24, 2012. Despite vigorously defending Israel Singer during the Attorney General's inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of \\"'help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash.\\" However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer's position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman's son Matthew to the presidency of the WJC. In May 2007, Bronfman stood down as the president of the WJC, having served in the post for 28 years.Stephanie Strom. President of Jewish Congress Resigns After 3 Years' Turmoil. New York Times.

She made her Broadway debut in the musical Jekyll & Hyde, originating the role of Lucy Harris, for which she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award. Eder has performed in concert halls across the country including Carnegie Hall and Radio City Musical Hall. She has released her 18th solo album in 2018. Biography Eder was born in Tucson, Arizona, on February 3, 1961, and raised in Brainerd, Minnesota. Her parents, Georg (from Austria) and Laila (from Norway), exposed her to music at an early age. She cites Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and Eileen Farrell as her childhood inspiration. Eder cites Garland, specifically, as her greatest influence. Her first musical theater credit was as the Mother Abbess in a high school production The Sound of Music. Eder was 4th runner up in the 1980 Miss Minnesota Pageant. Before her work on Broadway, Eder sang in clubs in Minneapolis and performed at Harrah's Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988 she won the talent show Star Search, where her performance caught the notice of Frank Wildhorn. She signed with RCA Records and starred in two 1991 stagings of Wildhorn's musical Svengali (the 1990 world premiere and 1995–96 national tour), the 1997 Broadway production of his Jekyll & Hyde, and the 2003 World Premiere of Camille Claudel. During those years, Eder recorded several CDs on Angel Records and Atlantic Records. Wildhorn and Eder married in 1998 and divorced in 2004; they have one son, Jake. Eder won the Theater World Award (1996–97) for Best Broadway Debut in Jekyll & Hyde. After her first solo concert at New York's famous Carnegie Hall she caught the attention of two talk show hosts who were in the audience that night: Rosie O'Donnell and Kathie Lee Gifford. She subsequently appeared on The Rosie O'Donnell Show and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee and the Late Show with David Letterman. She was invited to Gifford's final performance on Live... and sang the song \\"Anything Can Happen\\", which was written for the musical Wonderland: Alice's New Musical Adventure, Broadway Eder's major theatrical career began in 1987, when she auditioned in Florida in front of musical theater composer Frank Wildhorn for the leading role of Lucy in Jekyll & Hyde. Very impressed with her vocal skills, she was immediately cast, although no production was planned at that time. Linda has also performed holiday concerts on Broadway at The Palace and Gershwin theaters. Jekyll & Hyde In 1990, the Alley Theatre in Houston agreed to host the world premiere of Jekyll & Hyde, the first musical ever performed there. The show was extended several times, and Eder received raves for her performance. Following this triumph, Wildhorn debuted the musical Svengali, starring his two leading performers from Jekyll: Linda and Chuck Wagner. The musical also eventually played at the Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida in 1991. She then performed with several workshops for The Scarlet Pimpernel, as the leading lady Marguerite St. Just, as well as appearing on the concept recording. In 1995, after several workshops with Jekyll & Hyde, she was once again Lucy; Robert Cuccioli and Christiane Noll starred opposite her. The show remounted at the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston, before moving to Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre. Following these two successful runs, Eder's headlining stint as Lucy traveled across the nation from Fall 1995 until Spring 1996, with a hopeful Broadway mounting in Spring 1996. However, the show was delayed. Finally beginning previews the following March 1997, new creative team members joined. Along with the transfer came the dismissal of Lucy's first big number, \\"Bring on the Men\\". Although several rumors have circulated as to why it was cut, Eder has said that it was director/choreographer/scenic designer Robin Phillips who cut the song, which was not only one of her favorite songs, but a fan favorite as well. She has, however, given some praise to him, mostly due to the acting coaching he gave to her. In 1997, she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award and won the Theatre World Award for her debut performance. Television personalities such as Regis Philbin and Rosie O'Donnell considered Eder robbed of a Tony Award nomination, both of whom had featured her (and Frank Wildhorn and his other musicals) on their respective shows several times. Eder was married to Wildhorn whilst performing on Broadway, and officially left on August 30, 1998. Luba Mason replaced her. Eder left Jekyll to start a family but agreed to be cast in the limited run of the world premiere of Wildhorn's musical tapestry, The Civil War for its Houston premiere. Eder performed for several workshops and demo recordings for Wildhorn. Most importantly, she did several tracks for his Wonderland: Alice's New Musical Adventure (previously called Alice), which had its world premiere ten years after the first single (\\"Anything Can Happen\\") was released, Havana (for which she has released the title song and several others), Bonnie & Clyde: A New Musical (which was to recently star Brandi Burkhardt, but now Laura Osnes, having its world premiere in 2009), Dracula, the Musical as Mina, Cyrano de Bergerac - The musical as Roxanne (opposite Douglas Sills in the title role), and finally Camille Claudel, which was written for her, and she was able to perform at two runs. Eder's next musical outing was in Camille Claudel in 2003. She performed the role at the Goodspeed Opera House. Although the show, presented in an entire chamber-style form, received mixed reviews, Eder gained much attention again. In 2004, it was performed at the New York Musical Theatre Festival. However, the show has yet to be produced on a major scale, although several European productions were planned and an eventual Japanese premiere in 2011. The Other Side of Me Released on September 30, 2008, her CD The Other Side of Me has a pop/country feel. This is a departure from the style she is known for which is standards and ballads. Her official website has a posting where Eder says \\"It took a year and a half to make my new CD, the other side of me, but in reality, it has been a lifetime in the making.\\" She goes on to say: Now At a \\"Frank Wildhorn & Friends\\" concert in Vienna in 2010, Eder appeared with Wildhorn, and European musical theatre superstars Pia Douwes and Thomas Borchert to celebrate the music of Wildhorn. The two shared a song, \\"Living in the Shadows.\\" Eder performed several numbers including \\"Vienna\\", a fitting ending to the concert. A live audio recording was released of the concert, but a planned DVD release was put on hold. In 2011, Eder reunited with former record producer and musical arranger Jeremy Roberts and Wildhorn to work on two pieces. First, on the musical Tears of Heaven, which was produced in South Korea. Also in 2011, Eder debuted her first Wildhorn-composed solo album since 2003, entitled Now. The recording received much acclaim and featured the single \\"Now\\" as well as a blend of pop songs and musical selections, such as \\"The Mad Hatter\\" (from Wonderland), \\"What's Never Been Done Before\\" (Camille Claudel), and \\"Living in the Shadows\\" (Victor/Victoria), which was originally written for Julie Andrews in the Broadway production of that musical. In 2013 Eder recorded her 15th solo CD, a holiday themed album called Christmas Where You Are, which features a duet with her son Jake, now 14 years old. She adapted the lyrics to make it a personal and humorous mother and son duet. She is becoming increasingly sought after for her successful Master Classes and vocal lessons. Her concert schedule continues to take her across the country. In 2013 she performed a series of concerts entitled Memory Lane, incorporating key songs from her earliest performing days to the present. Linda Live - The Live Concert Recording On June 21, 2014, Eder performed a concert at the Arthur Zankel Music Center on the campus of Skidmore College. This performance was recorded and will become Eder's 15th solo album. The concert was performed to a crowd of nearly 500 people and contained Eder's signature songs which include, \\"Someone Like You\\" from Jekyll & Hyde, \\"Vienna\\" and \\"Man of La Mancha.\\" Other songs performed that evening were all songs Eder said she performed throughout her career, including \\"I'm Not Lisa,\\" \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables, \\"Fernando\\" (by ABBA), \\"Don’t Cry for Me Argentina\\" from Evita and \\"Climb Ev’ry Mountain\\" from the only musical Eder said she performed in high school, The Sound of Music. Linda Live was released on September 9, 2014 and is sold exclusively on Eder's website.

It is named for its inventor, John Solomon Rarey (1827-1866) of Groveport, Ohio, USA, who became famous for taming violent horses with it, and later for teaching it in various countries around the world. The technique Illustrations from The Complete Horse Tamer by John Rarey, (1860) right right Rarey began by tying one of the traumatized horse's legs with a strap so that the horse could not stand on it. This gave him control over the horse and quickly tired the animal out. Then, Rarey would gently but firmly cause the horse to lie down on a comfortable surface. Once the horse was lying on its side, Rarey could use his weight, concentrated at a strategic point, to keep the horse from rising. While the horse was thus unable to protect itself, Rarey showed it that it was still entirely safe with him by touching and stroking it on all parts of its body. The result was that the horse learned that it could be entirely safe in Rarey's company, and from that beginning it was relatively easy to demonstrate to the horse that it did not need to protect itself from most other humans.

Tisha B'Av is regarded as the saddest day in the Jewish calendar and it is thus believed to be a day which is destined for tragedy. Tisha B'Av falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar. The observance of the day includes five prohibitions, most notable of which is a 25-hour fast. The Book of Lamentations, which mourns the destruction of Jerusalem is read in the synagogue, followed by the recitation of kinnot, liturgical dirges that lament the loss of the Temples and Jerusalem. As the day has become associated with remembrance of other major calamities which have befallen the Jewish people, some kinnot also recall events such as the murder of the Ten Martyrs by the Romans, massacres in numerous medieval Jewish communities during the Crusades, and the Holocaust. History Five calamities Excavated stones from the Western Wall of the Temple Mount (Jerusalem, Israel), knocked onto the street below by Roman battering rams in 70 AD According to the Mishnah (Taanit 4:6), five specific events occurred on the ninth of Av that warrant fasting: # The Twelve Spies sent by Moses to observe the land of Canaan returned from their mission. Only two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, brought a positive report, while the others spoke disparagingly about the land. The majority report caused the Children of Israel to cry, panic and despair of ever entering the \\"Promised Land\\". For this, they were punished by God that their generation would not enter the land.See ; . The midrash quotes God as saying about this event, \\"You cried before me pointlessly, I will fix for you [this day as a day of] crying for the generations\\",Numbers Rabbah 16:20 alluding to the future misfortunes which occurred on the same date. # The First Temple built by King Solomon was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BCE, and the population of the Kingdom of Judah was sent into the Babylonian exile. According to the Bible, the First Temple's destruction began on the 7th of Av (2 Kings 25:8) and continued until the 10th (Jeremiah 52:12). According to the Talmud,Ta'anit 29a the actual destruction of the Temple began on the Ninth of Av, and it continued to burn throughout the Tenth of Av. # The Second Temple built by Ezra and Nehemiah was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE,Secular chronology gives the year as 70 CE. Some versions of rabbinic chronology give the year as 68 CE. See Missing years (Jewish calendar)#Two-year difference within the Hebrew calendar for elaboration. scattering the people of Judea and commencing the Jewish exile from the Holy Land. # The Romans subsequently crushed Bar Kokhba's revolt and destroyed the city of Betar, killing over 500,000 Jewish civilians (approximately 580,000) on August 4, 135 CE. # Following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Roman commander Turnus Rufus plowed the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and the surrounding area, in 135 CE. Other calamities Over time, Tisha B'Av has come to be a Jewish day of mourning, not only for these events, but also for later tragedies which occurred on or near the 9th of Av. References to some of these events appear in liturgy composed for Tisha B'Av (see below). *The First Crusade officially commenced on August 15, 1096 (Av 24, AM 4856), killing 10,000 Jews in its first month and destroying Jewish communities in France and the Rhineland. *The Jews were expelled from England on July 18, 1290 (Av 9, AM 5050). *The Jews were expelled from France on July 22, 1306 (Av 10, AM 5066). *The Jews were expelled from Spain on July 31, 1492 (Av 7, AM 5252).. Note that July 31 is the Julian calendar date; corrected for the Gregorian calendar it would be August 10. *Germany entered World War I on August 1–2, 1914 (Av 9–10, AM 5674), which caused massive upheaval in European Jewry and whose aftermath led to the Holocaust. * On August 2, 1941 (Av 9, AM 5701), SS commander Heinrich Himmler formally received approval from the Nazi Party for \\"The Final Solution.\\" As a result, the Holocaust began during which almost one third of the world's Jewish population perished. *On July 23, 1942 (Av 9, AM 5702), began the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, en route to Treblinka. *The AMIA bombing, of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killed 85 and injured 300 on July 18, 1994 (10 Av, AM 5754). * The Israeli disengagement from Gaza began in the Gaza Strip, expelling 8000 Jews who lived in Gush Katif; August 15, 2005; 10 Av, 5765. While the Holocaust spanned a number of years, most religious communities use Tisha B'Av to mourn its 6,000,000 Jewish victims, in addition to or instead of the secular Holocaust Memorial Days. On Tisha B'Av, communities which otherwise do not modify the traditional prayer liturgy have added the recitation of special kinnot related to the Holocaust. Related observances In connection with the fall of Jerusalem, three other fast-days were established at the same time as the Ninth Day of Av: these were the Tenth of Tevet, when the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians began; the Seventeenth of Tammuz, when the first breach was made in the wall by the Romans; and the Third of Tishrei, known as the Fast of Gedaliah, the day when Gedaliah was assassinated in the time of the Babylonians following the destruction of the First Temple. The three weeks leading up to Tisha B'Av are known as The Three Weeks, while the nine days leading up to Tisha B'Av are known as The Nine Days. Laws and customs Tisha B'Av falls in July or August in the Gregorian calendar. When Tisha B'Av falls on Shabbat (Saturday), it then is known as a (\\"delayed\\") in Hebrew and the observance of Tisha B'Av then takes place on the following day (that is, Sunday). This last occurred in 2019, and it will next occur in 2022. No outward signs of mourning intrude upon the normal Sabbath, although normal Sabbath eating and drinking end just before sunset Saturday evening, rather than nightfall. The fast lasts about 25 hours, beginning just before sunset on the preceding evening lasting until nightfall the next day. In addition to fasting, other pleasurable activities are also forbidden. Main prohibitions Tisha B'Av bears a similar stringent nature to that of Yom Kippur. In addition to the length of the fast which lasts about 25 hours, beginning just before sunset on the eve of Tisha B'Av and ends at nightfall the following day, Tisha B'Av also shares the following five prohibitions:Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 650:2 #No eating or drinking; #No washing or bathing; #No application of creams or oils; #No wearing of (leather) shoes; #No marital (sexual) relations. These restrictions are waived in the case of health issues but a competent posek, a rabbi who decides Jewish Law, must be consulted. For example, those who are seriously ill will be allowed to eat and drink. On other fast days almost any medical condition may justify breaking the fast; in practice, since many cases differ, consultation with a rabbi is often necessary. Ritual washing up to the knuckles is permitted. Washing to cleanse dirt or mud from one's body is also permitted. Additional customs Reading kinnot at the Western Wall Study of the Tanakh is forbidden on Tisha B'Av (as it is considered a spiritually enjoyable activity), except for the study of distressing texts such as the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Job, portions of Jeremiah and chapters of the Talmud that discuss the laws of mourning and those that discuss the destruction of the Temple. In synagogue, prior to the commencement of the evening services, the parochet (which normally covers and adorns the Torah Ark) is removed or drawn aside, lasting until the Mincha prayer service. According to the Rema it is customary to sit on low stools or on the floor, as is done during shiva, from the meal immediately before the fast (the seudah hamafseket) until midday (chatzot hayom) of the fast itself. It is customary to eat a hard boiled egg dipped in ashes, and a piece of bread dipped into ashes, during this pre-fast meal. The Beit Yosef rules that the custom to sit low to the ground extends past mid-day, until one prays Mincha (the afternoon prayer). If possible, work is avoided during this period. Electric lighting may be turned off or dimmed, and kinnot recited by candlelight. Some sleep on the floor or modify their normal sleeping routine, by sleeping without a pillow (or with one fewer pillow than usual), for instance. People refrain from greeting each other or sending gifts on this day. Old prayer-books and Torah scrolls are often buried on this day. The custom is to not put on tefillin for morning services (Shacharit) of Tisha b'Av, and not a talit, rather only wear the personal talit kattan without a blessing. At Mincha services tzitzit and tefilin are worn, with proper blessings prior to donning them. End of fast Although the fast ends at nightfall, according to tradition the First Temple continued burning throughout the night and for most of the following day, the tenth of Av. It is therefore customary to maintain all restrictions of the nine days through midday (chatzos) of the following day.Shulchan Aruch w/Mishnah Brurah 558:1 When Tisha B'Av falls on a Saturday, and is therefore observed on Sunday, the 10th of Av, it is not necessary to wait until midday Monday to end restrictions of the nine days. However, one refrains from involvement in activity that would be considered \\"joyous\\", such as eating meat, drinking wine, listening to music, and saying the \\"shehecheyonu\\" blessing, until Monday morning. One can wash laundry and shave immediately after the end of a delayed tisha b'av. When Tisha B'Av begins on Saturday night, the Havdalah ritual is postponed by 24 hours, as one could not drink the accompanying wine. One says Attah Chonantanu in the Saturday night Shemoneh Esrei prayer, and/or says Baruch Hamavdil, thus ending Shabbat. A blessing is made on the candle Saturday night. After Tisha B'Av ends on Sunday evening, the Havdalah ceremony is performed with wine (without candle or spices).Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 125:6 The laws of Tisha B'Av are recorded in the Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 552–557. Prayer service Scriptural readings The scroll of Eicha (Lamentations) is read in synagogue during the evening services. In many Sephardic congregations the Book of Job is read on the morning of Tisha B'Av.https://www.yutorah.org/download.cfm?materialID=507764 Those called to the Torah reading on Tisha B'Av are not given the usual congratulations for this honor.Israel Abrahams, Festival Studies (1906, London, Macmillan & Co.) page 81. There is also a tradition that those who were called to read from the Torah or Haftarah in the Tisha B'Av morning service are also called to read in the afternoon service, because the morning readings are filled with calamity and the afternoon readings contain words of consolation.Shmuel Pinchas Gelbard, Rite and Reason; 1050 Jewish Customs and Their Sources (1998, NY, Feldheim) pages 554–555. Kinnot In addition, most of the morning is spent chanting or reading Kinnot, most bewailing the loss of the Temples and the subsequent persecutions, but many others referring to post-exile disasters. These later kinnot were composed by various poets (often prominent rabbis) who had either suffered in the events mentioned or relate received reports. Important kinnot were composed by Elazar ha-Kalir and Rabbi Judah ha- Levi. After the Holocaust, kinnot were composed by the German-born Rabbi Shimon Schwab (in 1959, at the request of Rabbi Joseph Breuer) and by Rabbi Solomon Halberstam, leader of the Bobov Hasidim (in 1984). Since Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza, some segments of the Religious Zionist community have begun to recite kinnot to commemorate the expulsion of Jewish settlers from Gush Katif and the northern West Bank on the day after Tisha B'Av, in 2005. Nachem A paragraph that begins Nahem (\\"Console...\\") is added to the conclusion of the blessing Boneh Yerushalayim (\\"Who builds Jerusalem\\") recited during the Amidah (for Ashkenazim, only at the Mincha service). The prayer elaborates the mournful state of the Temple and city of Jerusalem. The concluding signature of the blessing is also extended to say \\"Blessed are You, O Lord, Who consoles Zion and builds Jerusalem.\\" Various Modern Orthodox and Conservative rabbis have proposed amending Nachem, as its wording no longer reflects the existence of a rebuilt Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty. Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren, for example, issued a revised wording of the prayer and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi proposed putting the prayer's verbs relating to the Temple's destruction into the past tense. However, such proposals have not been widely adopted. History of the observance Lamenting in the synagogue, 1887 In the long period which is reflected in Talmudic literature the observance of Tisha B'Av assumed a character of constantly growing sadness and asceticism. By the end of the 2nd century or at the beginning of the 3rd, the observance of the day had lost much of its gloom. Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi was in favor of abolishing it altogether or, according to another version, of cancelling it when the fast had been postponed from Saturday to Sunday.Talmud, Megillah 5b The growing strictness in the observance of mourning customs in connection with Tisha B'Av became pronounced in post-Talmudic times, and particularly in one of the darkest periods of Jewish history, from the 15th century to the 18th. Maimonides (12th century) says that the restrictions as to the eating of meat and the drinking of wine refer only to the last meal before fasting on the Eighth Day of Av, if taken after noon, but before noon anything may be eaten.Mishneh Torah Hilchoth Ta'anith 5:8 Rabbi Moses of Coucy (13th century) wrote that it is the universal custom to refrain from meat and wine during the whole day preceding the Ninth of Av.Sefer Mitzvoth ha-Gadol, Venice ed, Laws of Tishah B'Av, 249b Rabbi Joseph Caro (16th century) says some are accustomed to abstain from meat and wine from the beginning of the week in which the Ninth Day of Av falls; and still others abstain throughout the three weeks from the Seventeenth of Tammuz.Shulkhan Arukh, Orach Chayim 551 A gradual extension of prohibitions can be traced in the abstention from marrying at this season and in other signs of mourning. So Rabbi Moses of Coucy says that some do not use the tefillin (\\"phylacteries\\") in the morning of the Ninth Day of Av, a custom which later was universally observed (it is now postponed until the afternoon). In this manner many customs originally designated as marks of unusual piety finally became the rule for all. Contemporary observance In Israel Jews pray in a synagogue on Tisha B'av. Painted by Maurycy Trębacz and published in 1903. From the collection of the National Library of Israel A 2010 poll in Israel revealed that some 22% of Israeli Jews fast on Tisha B'Av, and 52% said they forego recreational activity on this day even though they do not fast. Another 18% of Israeli Jews responded that were recreational spots permissible to be open they would go out on the eve of the fast day, and labeled the current legal status \\"religious coercion\\". The last 8% declined to answer. In Israel, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed on the eve of Tisha B'Av and the following day by law. Establishments that break the law are subject to fines. Outside of Israel, the day is not observed by most secular Jews, as opposed to Yom Kippur, on which many secular Jews fast and go to synagogue. According to halakha, combat soldiers are absolved of fasting on Tisha B'Av on the basis that it can endanger their lives. The latest example of such a ruling was issued during Operation Protective Edge by Israel's Chief Rabbis: Rabbis David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef. When Menachem Begin became Prime Minister, he wanted to unite all the memorial days and days of mourning on Tisha B'Av, so that Holocaust Remembrance Day and Memorial Day would also fall on this day but it was not accepted.Dreaming of the Third Temple in a conflicted Land of Israel, Haaretz, July 20, 2010. In relation to the creation of the State of Israel As the main focus of the day recalls the destruction of the two Temples in Jerusalem and the subsequent Jewish diaspora, the modern day re-establishment of a Jewish state in the Holy Land has raised various attitudes within Judaism about the appropriateness of fasting and other mourning customs associated with the day. Some observant Jews outside of Orthodoxy curtail some of the mourning customs in recognition of the miracle of the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty after nearly two thousand years. Following the Six-Day War, the national religious community viewed Israel's territorial conquests with almost messianic overtones. The conquest of geographical areas with immense religious significance, including Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the Temple Mount, was seen as portentous; however, only the full rebuilding of the Temple would engender enough reason to cease observing the day as one of mourning and transform it into a day of joy instead. Other traditions Classical Jewish sourcesJerusalem Talmud, Berachos 2:4; maintain that the Jewish Messiah will be born on Tisha B'Av, though many explain this idea metaphorically, as the hope for the Jewish Messiah was born on Tisha B'Av with the destruction of the Temple.

Omori portrays the title character, a psychologically damaged man who is manipulated into assaulting or killing rival faction members of feuding yakuza gangs while being pursued by a sadomasochistic enforcer (Asano). The film has garnered controversy due to its graphic depictions of violence and cruelty, and has been banned in several countries.  Plot  In a flashback, Ichi masturbates on an apartment balcony while watching a pimp assault a prostitute within. Off-camera, sadistic Yakuza boss Anjo is brutally murdered. An expert cleaning crew run by Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) immediately removes any trace of Anjo's remains, and credits Ichi for the kill. Later, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), Anjo's sadomasochistic enforcer, and other crime lords visit the spotless apartment, concluding that Anjo fled town with the prostitute and ¥3 million of the gang's money. Kakihara visits an underworld night club with other gang members. He tells Anjo's girlfriend, an English-speaking Chinese prostitute named Karen (Alien Sun) that Anjo must still be alive, though perhaps kidnapped by a rival gang. He also greets Jijii and the cleaning crew at another table, unaware they were in town, and asking them to contact him if they learn anything of Anjo's status. Jijii feeds Kakihara rumors suggesting that Suzuki (Susumu Terajima), a member of the rival Funaki clan, has kidnapped Anjo. Kakihara captures Suzuki and tortures him with suspension and piercing, but when Suzuki turns out to be innocent, Kakihara slices off the end of his own tongue and offers it to Suzuki's boss (Jun Kunimura) as penance. Kakihara and gang members raid a hotel room and capture Kano, a drug- addled member of the cleaning crew. Kano has had facial plastic surgery since Kakihara last saw him, but he admits his identity and his past acquaintance with Kakihara when he believes he will be killed. He reveals that although he helped clean up the murder scene, it was Ichi who killed Anjo, and Kakihara has now been targeted. Returning to the opening flashback, Ichi is stepping in from the balcony to kill the pimp brutalizing Sailor, a prostitute whom Ichi patronizes. Afterwards, he tells her that he will be the one beating her up now. When Sailor assaults him, Ichi reflexively kills her as well. At Suzuki's prompting, Kakihara is kicked out of the syndicate, but the entire Anjo gang defects with him. Suzuki then promises Jijii a million yen to 'squash' Kakihara. Jijii, it is revealed, is secretly orchestrating events in order to pit yakuza clans against one another, with the help of Ichi. Though a normally unassuming and cowardly young man, Ichi becomes homicidal and sexually aroused when enraged. Jijii is able to manipulate Ichi's weak personality by implanting several false memories -- a high school rape in particular -- and uses the unstable Ichi as an assassin. While bicycling in the evening, Ichi assaults one of three boys bullying a fourth named Takeshi. Takeshi is the son of Kaneko, one of Kakihara's henchmen. Jijii incites Ichi to enter an apartment containing several criminals of the old Anjo gang, and slaughter them all. Afterward Ichi sees Takeshi, who thanks him for the earlier protection. Kaneko finds a brothel-keeper assaulting Ichi in an alley and, remembering his own long-ago rescue by a member of the Anjo gang, helps Ichi out. Kakihara enlists the help of corrupt twin police detectives, Jirō and Saburō (Suzuki Matsuo), to find Myu-Myu, a prostitute connected with Ryu Long, a member of Jijii's gang. When Jirō fails to get information from her through torture, Saburō sniffs her body to get Long's scent and tracks him down. Though Long outruns the brothers, Kakihara captures him and with the twins tortures him for leads to Jijii. To turn Ichi into a complete killer, Jijii has Karen, Anjo's woman and Jijii's friend, seduce Ichi by pretending to be the woman in his false memory. When Ichi becomes confused by Karen's claims that she desired for him to rape her, he kills her. Jijii calls Kakihara to let him know Ichi is coming to kill him but is spotted by one of Kakihara's men, Jijii is caught and held at gunpoint but Jijii disarms him and grotesquely breaks his body. Kaneko, Kakihara and Ichi chase each other to a rooftop. Due to Jijii's psychological manipulation, Ichi believes that Kaneko is his brother and confronts him. Kaneko shoots the side of Ichi's leg, causing Ichi to slit Kaneko's throat in front of Takeshi. Takeshi attacks Ichi as he lies on the roof begging for forgiveness. Kakihara realizes Ichi cannot hurt him and inserts skewers into his ears to drown out Ichi's cries. Suddenly he sees that Ichi has chopped off Takeshi's head. Ichi charges Kakihara, embedding one of his razor-bladed boots in the center of his head. Kakihara falls from the roof to his death. However, when Jijii finds him, Kakihara has no wound in his head; he hallucinated both Takeshi's murder and Ichi's attack as he jumped to his death while Ichi cried. Years later, Jijii's corpse hangs from a tree in a park. A young man resembling an older Takeshi leaves the park with a group of schoolchildren. Cast Production The soundtrack was written and produced by Karera Musication, a side project of the Japanese band Boredoms, under the direction of ex-guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and percussionist/band leader Yoshimi P-We. Themes Tom Mes has suggested that the film is in fact a very sophisticated assessment of violence and its relation to the media and implicating the audience. He writes that \\"It's a paradox, but Ichi the Killer, a film that sets new boundaries in the portrayal of violence and bloodshed, takes a strongly critical stance towards the portrayal and the consumption of the violent image. However, it does so without ever taking a moral stance towards either the portrayal or the consumption, thus circumventing any accusations of hypocrisy on the part of the director. Miike does not moralise or chastise, but provokes the audience into questioning their own attitudes towards viewing images of violence. He steers them into a direction but leaves it up to them to draw their own conclusion\\". Mes is also very critical of the edits made to the film. He argues that \\"The film as a whole is a completely cohesive unity, in that all of its parts are absolutely crucial to the functioning of the whole. Any attempt at censorship or toning down the violence will have the opposite effect and will in fact make the film more exploitative and thereby undermine its critical stance. Excising scenes of violence, particularly the 'painful' scenes, will harm the symbiosis between the 'playful' and the 'painful' violence, which forms the basis for Miike's critical approach\\".Mes, p. 367 Release The film had its world premiere in the Midnight Madness section at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2001. It was released in Japan on 22 December 2001. The film has been banned in Malaysia since the movie's release. It later caused controversy in Germany and the film was banned for distribution there too. Private possession of the film remains legal. In 2018, a digital restoration of the film was made by L'Immagine Ritrovata, the first public screening was at the 42 HKIFF. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 39 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 6.21/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Ichi The Killer is a thoroughly shocking gorefest that will surely entertain those with strong stomachs and a penchant for brutal violence.\\" Metacritic reports a score of 55 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Some critics praised Miike's stylish and narrative approach. Tanner Tafelski of The Village Voice noted, \\"Miike layers a blood- stained commentary on a toxic world in which men offer protection to men but really end up dooming them to exist within a spasmodic, shambolic, and hypermasculine sphere of violence.\\" Other critics were more critical of the films extreme violence and found the film inconsistent. Dennis Harvey said for Variety, \\"Even hardy gonzo-cinema auds will likely find the hectic pace overstimulating to the point of numbed-out tedium.\\" Prequel The film was followed by a prequel, 1-Ichi. Nao Omori reprises his role in the prequel, playing a younger version of Ichi.

In 1815William Prout (1815). On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. Annals of Philosophy, 6: 321-330\\\\. Online reprint and 1816,William Prout (1816). Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. Annals of Philosophy, 7: 111-13\\\\. Online reprint the English chemist William Prout published two papers in which he observed that the atomic weights that had been measured for the elements known at that time appeared to be whole multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. He then hypothesized that the hydrogen atom was the only truly fundamental object, which he called protyle, and that the atoms of other elements were actually groupings of various numbers of hydrogen atoms. Prout's hypothesis was an influence on Ernest Rutherford when he succeeded in \\"knocking\\" hydrogen nuclei out of nitrogen atoms with alpha particles in 1917, and thus concluded that perhaps the nuclei of all elements were made of such particles (the hydrogen nucleus), which in 1920 he suggested be named protons, from the suffix for particles, added to the stem of Prout's word \\"protyle\\". The assumption as discussed by Rutherford was of a nucleus consisting of Z+N=A protons plus N electrons somehow trapped within thereby reducing the positive charge to +Z as observed and vaguely explaining beta decay radioactivity. Such a nuclear constitution was known to be inconsistent with dynamics either classical or early quantum but seemed inevitable until the neutron hypothesis by Rutherford and discovery by Chadwick. The discrepancy between Prout's hypothesis and the known variation of some atomic weights to values far from integral multiples of hydrogen, was explained between 1913 and 1932 by the discovery of isotopes and the neutron. According to the whole number rule of Francis Aston, Prout's hypothesis is correct for atomic masses of individual isotopes, with an error of at most 1%. Influence Prout's hypothesis remained influential in chemistry throughout the 1820s. However, more careful measurements of the atomic weights, such as those compiled by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1828 or Edward Turner in 1832, disproved the hypothesis. In particular, the atomic weight of chlorine, which is 35.45 times that of hydrogen, could not at the time be explained in terms of Prout's hypothesis. Some came up with the ad hoc claim that the basic unit was one-half of a hydrogen atom, but further discrepancies surfaced. This resulted in the hypothesis that one-quarter of a hydrogen atom was the common unit. Although they turned out to be wrong, these conjectures catalyzed further measurement of atomic weights. The discrepancy in the atomic weights was by 1919 suspected to be the result of the natural occurrence of multiple isotopes of the same element. F. W. Aston discovered multiple stable isotopes for numerous elements using a mass spectrograph. In 1919 Aston studied neon with sufficient resolution to show that the two isotopic masses are very close to the integers 20 and 22, and that neither is equal to the known molar mass (20.2) of neon gas.Mass spectra and isotopes Francis W. Aston, Nobel prize lecture 1922 By 1925, the problematic chlorine was found to be composed of the isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl, in proportions such that the average weight of natural chlorine was about 35.45 times that of hydrogen. For all elements, each individual isotope (nuclide) of mass number A was eventually found to have a mass very close to A times the mass of a hydrogen atom, with an error always less than 1%. This is a near miss to Prout's law being correct. Nevertheless, the rule was not found to predict isotope masses better than this for all isotopes, due mostly to mass-defects resulting from release of binding energy in atomic nuclei, when they are formed. Although all elements are the product of nuclear fusion of hydrogen into higher elements, it is now understood that atoms consist of both protons (hydrogen nuclei) and neutrons. The modern version of Prout's rule is that the atomic mass of an isotope of proton number (atomic number) Z and neutron number N is equal to sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the mass of the nuclear binding energy, the mass defect. According to the whole number rule proposed by Francis Aston, the mass of an isotope is roughly, but not exactly, its mass number A (Z + N) times an atomic mass unit (u), plus or minus binding energy discrepancy – atomic mass unit being the modern approximation for \\"mass of a proton, neutron, or hydrogen atom\\". For example iron-56 atoms (which have among the highest binding- energies) weigh only about 99.1% as much as 56 hydrogen atoms. The missing 0.9% of mass represents the energy lost when the nucleus of iron was made from hydrogen inside a star. (See stellar nucleosynthesis). Literary allusions In his 1891 novel The Doings of Raffles Haw, Arthur Conan Doyle talks about turning elements into other elements of decreasing atomic number, until a gray matter is reached. In his 1959 novel Life and Fate, Vasily Grossman's principal character, the physicist Viktor Shtrum, reflects on Prout's hypothesis about hydrogen being the origin of other elements (and the felicitous fact that Prout's incorrect data led to an essentially correct conclusion), as he worries about his inability to formulate his own thesis.

Berzelius, perspective from Temple Street Classically symmetrical front approach.Detail of entryway ornamentation. Berzelius Society symbol depicted within shield. Berzelius is a secret society at Yale University named for the Swedish scientist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, considered one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry. Founded in 1848, 'BZ', as the society is called often, is the third oldest society at Yale and the oldest of those of the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School, the institution which from 1854-1956 was the sciences and engineering college of Yale University. Berzelius became a senior society in the tradition of Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head in 1933 when the Sheffield Scientific School was integrated into Yale University. Book and Snake and St. Elmo, also societies from Sheffield, followed suit. Skull and Bones, founded in 1832, Scroll and Key, founded in 1841, and Wolf's Head, founded in 1883, catered to students in the Academic Department, or liberal arts college.

Biography  John Lucas was educated at Winchester College and then, as a pupil of R.M. Hare, among others, at Balliol College, Oxford. He studied first mathematics, then Greats (Greek, Latin, Philosophy and Ancient History), obtaining first class honours in both. He sat for Finals in 1951, and took his MA in 1954. He spent the 1957–58 academic year at Princeton University, studying mathematics and logic. For 36 years, until his 1996 retirement, he was a Fellow and Tutor of Merton College, Oxford, and he remained an emeritus member of the University Faculty of Philosophy. He was a Fellow of the British Academy. Lucas is perhaps best known for his paper \\"Minds, Machines and Gödel,\\" arguing that an automaton cannot represent a human mathematician, attempting to refute computationalism. An author with diverse teaching and research interests, Lucas wrote on the philosophy of mathematics, especially the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, the philosophy of mind, free will and determinism, the philosophy of science including two books on physics co-authored with Peter E. Hodgson, causality, political philosophy, ethics and business ethics, and the philosophy of religion. The son of a Church of England clergyman, and an Anglican himself, Lucas described himself as \\"a dyed-in-the-wool traditional Englishman.\\" He had four children (Edward Lucas, Helen Lucas, Richard Lucas and Deborah Lucas) with Morar Portal, among them Edward Lucas, a former journalist at The Economist. In addition to his philosophical career, Lucas had a practical interest in business ethics. He helped found the Oxford Consumers' Group,Oxford Consumers' Group and was its first chairman in 1961-3, serving again in 1965. Philosophical contributions Free will Lucas (1961) began a lengthy and heated debate over the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorems for the anthropic mechanism thesis, by arguing that:J.R. Lucas, \\"The Gödelian Argument\\" # Determinism ↔ For any human h there exists at least one (deterministic) logical system L(h) which reliably predicts h's actions in all circumstances. # For any logical system L a sufficiently skilled mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements T(L) which are true but unprovable in L. (This follows from Gödel's first theorem.) # If a human m is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if m is given L(m), he or she can construct T(L(m)) and determine that they are true—which L(m) cannot do. # Hence L(m) does not reliably predict m's actions in all circumstances. # Hence m has free will. # It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not. His argument was strengthened by the discovery by Hava Siegelmann in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are equivalent to Turing Machines.H.T. Siegelmann, \\"Computation Beyond the Turing Limit,\\" Science, 238(28), April 1995: 632–637 Space, time and causality Lucas wrote several books on the philosophy of science and space-time (see below). In A treatise on time and space he introduced a transcendental derivation of the Lorenz Transformations based on Red and Blue exchanging messages (in Russian and Greek respectively) from their respective frames of reference which demonstrates how these can be derived from a minimal set of philosophical assumptions. In The Future Lucas gives a detailed analysis of tenses and time, arguing that \\"the Block universe gives a deeply inadequate view of time. It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past\\"The Future (1989), p. 8. and in favour of a tree structure in which there is only one past or present (at any given point in spacetime) but a large number of possible futures. \\"We are by our own decisions in the face of other men's actions and chance circumstances weaving the web of history on the loom of natural necessity\\"The Future (1989), p. 4.

In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory. For simplicity, main memory is called \\"RAM\\" (an acronym of \\"random-access memory\\") and secondary storage is called \\"disk\\" (a shorthand for \\"hard disk drive, drum memory or solid-state drive\\"), but the concepts do not depend on whether these terms apply literally to a specific computer system. History Ferranti introduced paging on the Atlas, but the first mass-market memory pages were concepts in computer architecture, regardless of whether a page moved between RAM and disk. For example, on the PDP-8, 7 of the instruction bits comprised a memory address that selected one of 128 (2) words. This zone of memory was called a page. This use of the term is now rare. In the 1960s, swapping was an early virtual memory technique. An entire program would be \\"swapped out\\" (or \\"rolled out\\") from RAM to disk, and another one would be swapped in (or rolled in). A swapped-out program would be current but its execution would be suspended while its RAM was in use by another program. A program might include multiple overlays that occupy the same memory at different times. Overlays are not a method of paging RAM to disk but merely of minimizing the program's RAM use. Subsequent architectures used memory segmentation, and individual program segments became the units exchanged between disk and RAM. A segment was the program's entire code segment or data segment, or sometimes other large data structures. These segments had to be contiguous when resident in RAM, requiring additional computation and movement to remedy fragmentation. The invention of the page table let the processor operate on arbitrary pages anywhere in RAM as a seemingly contiguous logical address space. These pages became the units exchanged between disk and RAM. Page faults When a process tries to reference a page not currently present in RAM, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system. The operating system must: # Determine the location of the data on disk. # Obtain an empty page frame in RAM to use as a container for the data. # Load the requested data into the available page frame. # Update the page table to refer to the new page frame. # Return control to the program, transparently retrying the instruction that caused the page fault. When all page frames are in use, the operating system must select a page frame to reuse for the page the program now needs. If the evicted page frame was dynamically allocated by a program to hold data, or if a program modified it since it was read into RAM (in other words, if it has become \\"dirty\\"), it must be written out to disk before being freed. If a program later references the evicted page, another page fault occurs and the page must be read back into RAM. The method the operating system uses to select the page frame to reuse, which is its page replacement algorithm, is important to efficiency. The operating system predicts the page frame least likely to be needed soon, often through the least recently used (LRU) algorithm or an algorithm based on the program's working set. To further increase responsiveness, paging systems may predict which pages will be needed soon, preemptively loading them into RAM before a program references them.  Page replacement techniques  ; Demand paging : When pure demand paging is used, pages are loaded only when they are referenced. A program from a memory mapped file begins execution with none of its pages in RAM. As the program commits page faults, the operating system copies the needed pages from a file, e.g., memory-mapped file, paging file, or a swap partition containing the page data into RAM. ; Anticipatory paging : This technique, sometimes also called swap prefetch, predicts which pages will be referenced soon, to minimize future page faults. For example, after reading a page to service a page fault, the operating system may also read the next few pages even though they are not yet needed (a prediction using locality of reference). If a program ends, the operating system may delay freeing its pages, in case the user runs the same program again. ; Free page queue, stealing, and reclamation : The free page queue is a list of page frames that are available for assignment. Preventing this queue from being empty minimizes the computing necessary to service a page fault. Some operating systems periodically look for pages that have not been recently referenced and then free the page frame and add it to the free page queue, a process known as \\"page stealing\\". Some operating systems support page reclamation; if a program commits a page fault by referencing a page that was stolen, the operating system detects this and restores the page frame without having to read the contents back into RAM. ; Pre-cleaning : The operating system may periodically pre-clean dirty pages: write modified pages back to disk even though they might be further modified. This minimizes the amount of cleaning needed to obtain new page frames at the moment a new program starts or a new data file is opened, and improves responsiveness. (Unix operating systems periodically use sync to pre-clean all dirty pages; Windows operating systems use \\"modified page writer\\" threads.) Thrashing After completing initialization, most programs operate on a small number of code and data pages compared to the total memory the program requires. The pages most frequently accessed are called the working set. When the working set is a small percentage of the system's total number of pages, virtual memory systems work most efficiently and an insignificant amount of computing is spent resolving page faults. As the working set grows, resolving page faults remains manageable until the growth reaches a critical point. Then faults go up dramatically and the time spent resolving them overwhelms time spent on the computing the program was written to do. This condition is referred to as thrashing. Thrashing occurs on a program that works with huge data structures, as its large working set causes continual page faults that drastically slow down the system. Satisfying page faults may require freeing pages that will soon have to be re-read from disk. \\"Thrashing\\" is also used in contexts other than virtual memory systems; for example, to describe cache issues in computing or silly window syndrome in networking. A worst case might occur on VAX processors. A single MOVL crossing a page boundary could have a source operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and a destination operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and the source and destination could both cross page boundaries. This single instruction references ten pages; if not all are in RAM, each will cause a page fault. As each fault occurs the operating system needs to go through the extensive memory management routines perhaps causing multiple I/Os which might including writing other process pages to disk and reading pages of the active process from disk. If the operating system could not allocate ten pages to this program, then remedying the page fault would discard another page the instruction needs, and any restart of the instruction would fault again. To decrease excessive paging and resolve thrashing problems, a user can increase the number of pages available per program, either by running fewer programs concurrently or increasing the amount of RAM in the computer. Sharing In multi-programming or in a multi-user environment, many users may execute the same program, written so that its code and data are in separate pages. To minimize RAM use, all users share a single copy of the program. Each process's page table is set up so that the pages that address code point to the single shared copy, while the pages that address data point to different physical pages for each process. Different programs might also use the same libraries. To save space, only one copy of the shared library is loaded into physical memory. Programs which use the same library have virtual addresses that map to the same pages (which contain the library's code and data). When programs want to modify the library's code, they use copy-on-write, so memory is only allocated when needed. Shared memory is an efficient way of communication between programs. Programs can share pages in memory, and then write and read to exchange data. Implementations Ferranti Atlas The first computer to support paging was the supercomputer Atlas, jointly developed by Ferranti, the University of Manchester and Plessey in 1963. The machine had an associative (content-addressable) memory with one entry for each 512 word page. The Supervisor handled non-equivalence interruptions and managed the transfer of pages between core and drum in order to provide a one-level store to programs. Microsoft Windows Windows 3.x and Windows 9x Paging has been a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.0 in 1990. Windows 3.x creates a hidden file named \`386SPART.PAR\` or \`WIN386.SWP\` for use as a swap file. It is generally found in the root directory, but it may appear elsewhere (typically in the WINDOWS directory). Its size depends on how much swap space the system has (a setting selected by the user under Control Panel → Enhanced under \\"Virtual Memory\\"). If the user moves or deletes this file, a blue screen will appear the next time Windows is started, with the error message \\"The permanent swap file is corrupt\\". The user will be prompted to choose whether or not to delete the file (whether or not it exists). Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me use a similar file, and the settings for it are located under Control Panel → System → Performance tab → Virtual Memory. Windows automatically sets the size of the page file to start at 1.5× the size of physical memory, and expand up to 3× physical memory if necessary. If a user runs memory-intensive applications on a system with low physical memory, it is preferable to manually set these sizes to a value higher than default. Windows NT The file used for paging in the Windows NT family is \`pagefile.sys\`. The default location of the page file is in the root directory of the partition where Windows is installed. Windows can be configured to use free space on any available drives for pagefiles. It is required, however, for the boot partition (i.e., the drive containing the Windows directory) to have a pagefile on it if the system is configured to write either kernel or full memory dumps after a Blue Screen of Death. Windows uses the paging file as temporary storage for the memory dump. When the system is rebooted, Windows copies the memory dump from the pagefile to a separate file and frees the space that was used in the pagefile. Fragmentation In the default configuration of Windows, the pagefile is allowed to expand beyond its initial allocation when necessary. If this happens gradually, it can become heavily fragmented which can potentially cause performance problems. The common advice given to avoid this is to set a single \\"locked\\" pagefile size so that Windows will not expand it. However, the pagefile only expands when it has been filled, which, in its default configuration, is 150% the total amount of physical memory. Thus the total demand for pagefile-backed virtual memory must exceed 250% of the computer's physical memory before the pagefile will expand. The fragmentation of the pagefile that occurs when it expands is temporary. As soon as the expanded regions are no longer in use (at the next reboot, if not sooner) the additional disk space allocations are freed and the pagefile is back to its original state. Locking a pagefile size can be problematic if a Windows application requests more memory than the total size of physical memory and the pagefile, leading to failed requests to allocate memory that may cause applications and system processes to fail. Also, the pagefile is rarely read or written in sequential order, so the performance advantage of having a completely sequential page file is minimal. However, a large pagefile generally allows use of memory-heavy applications, with no penalties beside using more disk space. While a fragmented pagefile may not be an issue by itself, fragmentation of a variable size page file will over time create a number of fragmented blocks on the drive, causing other files to become fragmented. For this reason, a fixed-size contiguous pagefile is better, providing that the size allocated is large enough to accommodate the needs of all applications. The required disk space may be easily allocated on systems with more recent specifications (i.e. a system with 3 GB of memory having a 6 GB fixed-size pagefile on a 750 GB disk drive, or a system with 6 GB of memory and a 16 GB fixed-size pagefile and 2 TB of disk space). In both examples the system is using about 0.8% of the disk space with the pagefile pre-extended to its maximum. Defragmenting the page file is also occasionally recommended to improve performance when a Windows system is chronically using much more memory than its total physical memory. This view ignores the fact that, aside from the temporary results of expansion, the pagefile does not become fragmented over time. In general, performance concerns related to pagefile access are much more effectively dealt with by adding more physical memory. Unix and Unix-like systems Unix systems, and other Unix-like operating systems, use the term \\"swap\\" to describe both the act of moving memory pages between RAM and disk, and the region of a disk the pages are stored on. In some of those systems, it is common to dedicate an entire partition of a hard disk to swapping. These partitions are called swap partitions. Many systems have an entire hard drive dedicated to swapping, separate from the data drive(s), containing only a swap partition. A hard drive dedicated to swapping is called a \\"swap drive\\" or a \\"scratch drive\\" or a \\"scratch disk\\". Some of those systems only support swapping to a swap partition; others also support swapping to files.  Linux  The Linux kernel supports a virtually unlimited number of swap backends (devices or files), and also supports assignment of backend priorities. When the kernel swap pages out of physical memory, it uses the highest-priority backend with available free space. If multiple swap backends are assigned the same priority, they are used in a round-robin fashion (which is somewhat similar to RAID 0 storage layouts), providing improved performance as long as the underlying devices can be efficiently accessed in parallel. = Swap files and partitions = From the end-user perspective, swap files in versions 2.6.x and later of the Linux kernel are virtually as fast as swap partitions; the limitation is that swap files should be contiguously allocated on their underlying file systems. To increase performance of swap files, the kernel keeps a map of where they are placed on underlying devices and accesses them directly, thus bypassing the cache and avoiding filesystem overhead. Regardless, Red Hat recommends swap partitions to be used.Chapter 7. Swap Space - Red Hat Customer Portal \\"Swap space can be a dedicated swap partition (recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and swap files.\\" When residing on HDDs, which are rotational magnetic media devices, one benefit of using swap partitions is the ability to place them on contiguous HDD areas that provide higher data throughput or faster seek time. However, the administrative flexibility of swap files can outweigh certain advantages of swap partitions. For example, a swap file can be placed on any mounted file system, can be set to any desired size, and can be added or changed as needed. Swap partitions are not as flexible; they cannot be enlarged without using partitioning or volume management tools, which introduce various complexities and potential downtimes. = Swappiness = Swappiness is a Linux kernel parameter that controls the relative weight given to swapping out of runtime memory, as opposed to dropping pages from the system page cache, whenever a memory allocation request cannot be met from free memory. Swappiness can be set to values between 0 and 100 (inclusive). A low value causes the kernel to prefer to evict pages from the page cache while a higher value causes the kernel to prefer to swap out \\"cold\\" memory pages. The default value is \`60\`; setting it higher can cause high latency if cold pages need to be swapped back in (when interacting with a program that had been idle for example), while setting it lower (even 0) may cause high latency when files that had been evicted from the cache need to be read again, but more responsive programs. Swapping can also slow down HDDs further because it involves a lot of random writes, while SSDs do not have this problem. Certainly the default values work well in most workloads, but desktops and interactive systems for any expected task may want to lower the setting while batch processing and less interactive systems may want to increase it. = Swap death = When the system memory is highly insufficient for the current tasks and a large portion of memory activity goes through a slow swap, the system can become practically unable to execute any task, even if the CPU is idle. When every process is waiting on the swap, the system is considered to be in swap death. Swap death can happen due to incorrectly configured memory overcommitment. The original description of the \\"swapping to death\\" problem relates to the X server. If code or data used by the X server to respond to a keystroke is not in main memory, then if the user enters a keystroke, the server will take one or more page faults, requiring those pages to read from swap before the keystroke can be processed, slowing the response to it. If those pages don't remain in memory, they will have to be faulted in again to handle the next keystroke, making the system practically unresponsive even if it's actually executing other tasks normally. macOS macOS uses multiple swap files. The default (and Apple- recommended) installation places them on the root partition, though it is possible to place them instead on a separate partition or device. AmigaOS 4 AmigaOS 4.0 introduced a new system for allocating RAM and defragmenting physical memory. It still uses flat shared address space that cannot be defragmented. It is based on slab allocation method and paging memory that allows swapping. Paging was implemented in AmigaOS 4.1 but may lock up system if all physical memory is used up. Swap memory could be activated and deactivated any moment allowing the user to choose to use only physical RAM. Performance The backing store for a virtual memory operating system is typically many orders of magnitude slower than RAM. Additionally, using mechanical storage devices introduces delay, several milliseconds for a hard disk. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce or eliminate swapping, where practical. Some operating systems offer settings to influence the kernel's decisions. * Linux offers the \`/proc/sys/vm/swappiness\` parameter, which changes the balance between swapping out runtime memory, as opposed to dropping pages from the system page cache. * Windows 2000, XP, and Vista offer the \`DisablePagingExecutive\` registry setting, which controls whether kernel- mode code and data can be eligible for paging out. * Mainframe computers frequently used head-per-track disk drives or drums for page and swap storage to eliminate seek time, and several technologiesE.g., Rotational Position Sensing on a Block Multiplexor channel to have multiple concurrent requests to the same device in order to reduce rotational latency. * Flash memory has a finite number of erase-write cycles (see limitations of flash memory), and the smallest amount of data that can be erased at once might be very large (128 KiB for an Intel X25-M SSD ), seldom coinciding with pagesize. Therefore, flash memory may wear out quickly if used as swap space under tight memory conditions. On the attractive side, flash memory is practically delayless compared to hard disks, and not volatile as RAM chips. Schemes like ReadyBoost and Intel Turbo Memory are made to exploit these characteristics. Many Unix- like operating systems (for example AIX, Linux, and Solaris) allow using multiple storage devices for swap space in parallel, to increase performance.  Swap space size  In some older virtual memory operating systems, space in swap backing store is reserved when programs allocate memory for runtime data. Operating system vendors typically issue guidelines about how much swap space should be allocated.  Addressing limits on 32-bit hardware  Paging is one way of allowing the size of the addresses used by a process, which is the process's \\"virtual address space\\" or \\"logical address space\\", to be different from the amount of main memory actually installed on a particular computer, which is the physical address space.  Main memory smaller than virtual memory  In most systems, the size of a process's virtual address space is much larger than the available main memory. For example: * The address bus that connects the CPU to main memory may be limited. The i386SX CPU's 32-bit internal addresses can address 4 GB, but it has only 24 pins connected to the address bus, limiting installed physical memory to 16 MB. There may be other hardware restrictions on the maximum amount of RAM that can be installed. * The maximum memory might not be installed because of cost, because the model's standard configuration omits it, or because the buyer did not believe it would be advantageous. * Sometimes not all internal addresses can be used for memory anyway, because the hardware architecture may reserve large regions for I/O or other features.  Main memory the same size as virtual memory  A computer with true n-bit addressing may have 2 addressable units of RAM installed. An example is a 32-bit x86 processor with 4 GB and without Physical Address Extension (PAE). In this case, the processor is able to address all the RAM installed and no more. However, even in this case, paging can be used to create a virtual memory of over 4 GB. For instance, many programs may be running concurrently. Together, they may require more than 4 GB, but not all of it will have to be in RAM at once. A paging system makes efficient decisions on which memory to relegate to secondary storage, leading to the best use of the installed RAM. Although the processor in this example cannot address RAM beyond 4 GB, the operating system may provide services to programs that envision a larger memory, such as files that can grow beyond the limit of installed RAM. The operating system lets a program manipulate data in the file arbitrarily, using paging to bring parts of the file into RAM when necessary.  Main memory larger than virtual address space  A few computers have a main memory larger than the virtual address space of a process, such as the Magic-1, some PDP-11 machines, and some systems using 32-bit x86 processors with Physical Address Extension. This nullifies a significant advantage of paging, since a single process cannot use more main memory than the amount of its virtual address space. Such systems often use paging techniques to obtain secondary benefits: * The \\"extra memory\\" can be used in the page cache to cache frequently used files and metadata, such as directory information, from secondary storage. * If the processor and operating system support multiple virtual address spaces, the \\"extra memory\\" can be used to run more processes. Paging allows the cumulative total of virtual address spaces to exceed physical main memory. * A process can store data in memory-mapped files on memory-backed file systems, such as the tmpfs file system or file systems on a RAM drive, and map files into and out of the address space as needed. * A set of processes may still depend upon the enhanced security features page-based isolation may bring to a multitasking environment. The size of the cumulative total of virtual address spaces is still limited by the amount of secondary storage available.

His books consisted primarily of Western novels (though he called his work \\"frontier stories\\"); however, he also wrote historical fiction (The Walking Drum), science fiction (Haunted Mesa), non-fiction (Frontier), as well as poetry and short-story collections. Many of his stories were made into films. L'Amour's books remain popular and most have gone through multiple printings. At the time of his death almost all of his 105 existing works (89 novels, 14 short- story collections, and two full-length works of nonfiction) were still in print, and he was \\"one of the world's most popular writers\\".  Life and career  Louis Dearborn L'Amour was born in Jamestown, North Dakota, in 1908, the seventh child of Dr. Louis Charles L'Amour and Emily Dearborn L'Amour. He was of French-Canadianhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/author/louis-lamour/ ancestry through his father and Irish through his mother. Dr. L'Amour was a large-animal veterinarian, local politician and farm-equipment broker who had arrived in Dakota Territory in 1882. Although the area around Jamestown was mostly farm land, cowboys and livestock often traveled through Jamestown on their way to or from ranches in Montana and the markets to the east. L'Amour played \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" in the family barn, which served as his father's veterinary hospital, and spent much of his free time at the local library, the Alfred E. Dickey Free Library, reading, particularly G. A. Henty, a British author of historical boys' novels during the late nineteenth century. L'Amour once said, \\"[Henty's works] enabled me to go into school with a great deal of knowledge that even my teachers didn't have about wars and politics.\\" After a series of bank failures devastated the economy of the upper Midwest, Dr. L'Amour and Emily took to the road. Removing Louis and his adopted brother John from school, they headed south in the winter of 1923. Over the next seven or eight years, they skinned cattle in west Texas, baled hay in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico, worked in the mines of Arizona, California and Nevada, and in the sawmills and lumber camps of the Pacific Northwest. It was in colorful places like these that Louis met a wide variety of people, upon whom he later modeled the characters in his novels, many of them actual Old West personalities who had survived into the nineteen-twenties and -thirties. Making his way as a mine assessment worker, professional boxer and merchant seaman, Louis traveled the country and the world, sometimes with his family, sometimes not. He visited all of the western states plus England, Japan, China, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Egypt, and Panama, finally moving with his parents to Choctaw, Oklahoma in the early 1930s. There, he changed his name to Louis L'Amour and settled down to try to make something of himself as a writer.  Early works  He had success with poetry, articles on boxing and writing and editing sections of the WPA Guide Book to Oklahoma, but the dozens of short stories he was churning out met with little acceptance. Finally, L'Amour placed a story, Death Westbound, in \\"10 Story Book\\", a magazine that featured what was supposed to be quality writing (Jack Woodford, author of several books on writing, is published in the same edition as L'Amour) alongside scantily attired, or completely naked young women. Several years later, L'Amour placed his first story for pay, Anything for a Pal, published in True Gang Life. Two lean disappointing years passed after that, and then, in 1938, his stories began appearing in pulp magazines fairly regularly. Along with other adventure and crime stories, L'Amour created the character of mercenary sea captain Jim Mayo. Starting with East of Gorontalo, the series ran through nine episodes from 1940 until 1943. L'Amour wrote only one story in the western genre prior to World War II, 1940's The Town No Guns Could Tame.  World War II service and post-war  L'Amour continued as an itinerant worker, traveling the world as a merchant seaman until the start of World War II. During World War II, he served in the United States Army as a lieutenant with the 362nd Quartermaster Truck Company. In the two years before L'Amour was shipped off to Europe, L'Amour wrote stories for Standard Magazine. After World War II, L'Amour continued to write stories for magazines; his first after being discharged in 1946 was Law of the Desert Born in Dime Western Magazine (April 1946). L'Amour's contact with Leo Margulies led to L'Amour agreeing to write many stories for the Western pulp magazines published by Standard Magazines, a substantial portion of which appeared under the name \\"Jim Mayo\\". The suggestion of L'Amour writing Hopalong Cassidy novels also was made by Margulies who planned on launching Hopalong Cassidy's Western Magazine at a time when the William Boyd films and new television series were becoming popular with a new generation. L'Amour read the original Hopalong Cassidy novels, written by Clarence E. Mulford, and wrote his novels based on the original character under the name \\"Tex Burns\\". Only two issues of the Hopalong Cassidy Western Magazine were published, and the novels as written by L'Amour were extensively edited to meet Doubleday's thoughts of how the character should be portrayed in print. Strongly disagreeing—L'Amour preferred Mulford's original, much rougher characterization of Cassidy—for the rest of his life he denied authoring the novels. In the 1950s, L'Amour began to sell novels. L'Amour's first novel, published under his own name, was Westward The Tide, published by World's Work in 1951. The short story, The Gift of Cochise was printed in Colliers (5 July 1952) and seen by John Wayne and Robert Fellows, who purchased the screen rights from L'Amour for $4,000. James Edward Grant was hired to write a screenplay based on this story changing the main character's name from Ches Lane to Hondo Lane. L'Amour retained the right to novelize the screenplay and did so, even though the screenplay differed substantially from the original story. This was published as Hondo in 1953 and released on the same day the film opened with a blurb from John Wayne stating that \\"Hondo was the finest Western Wayne had ever read\\". During the remainder of the decade L'Amour produced a great number of novels, both under his own name as well as others (e. g. Jim Mayo). Also during this time he rewrote and expanded many of his earlier short story and pulp fiction stories to book length for various publishers.  Bantam Books  Many publishers in the 1950s and '60s refused to publish more than one or two books a year by the same author. Louis's editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up to three or four but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis's sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal. L'Amour's career flourished throughout the 1960s and he began work on a series of novels about the fictional Sackett family. The Daybreakers, published in 1960 and the first, was actually not in the chronological order of the series of novels.Sackett#List of Sackett stories by L'Amour Initially he wrote five books about William Tell Sackett and his close relatives; however, in later years the series spread to include other families and four centuries of North American history. It was an ambitious project and several stories intended to close the gaps in the family's time line were left untold at the time of L'Amour's death. L'Amour also branched out into historical fiction with The Walking Drum, set in the 11th century, a contemporary thriller, Last of the Breed, and science fiction with The Haunted Mesa. L'Amour eventually wrote 100 novels, over 250 short stories, and (as of 2010) sold more than 320 million copies of his work. By the 1970s his writings were translated into over 10 languages. Every one of his works is still in print. L'Amour appears under the name of \\"Lew\\" as a minor character in the 2006 novel The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril by Paul Malmont. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. Audio book publishing Many of the L'Amour titles have been produced in the \\"single voice\\" style. In the early days, however, when the fledgling Bantam Audio Publishing (now Random House Audio) came to L'Amour about converting some of his old short stories into audio, he insisted that they do something to offer the audience more value than just having an actor read a bunch of old pulp stories. Together he and Bantam executive Jenny Frost created the concept of a series of \\"Radio Drama\\" style productions that would combine a large cast of actors, sound effects and music to produce a modern audio drama of each story. The team of David Rapkin (Producer) and Charles Potter (Director) was employed to produce a prototype show and L'Amour's son Beau came into the program as Supervising Producer. Between 1986 and 2004 the team had completed over sixty- five dramatized audio productions. Several different styles of show were produced over the years. The first several shows were \\"transcriptions\\", literal breakdowns of the exact L'Amour short story into lines for the different characters and narrator. Later productions used more liberally interpreted adaptations written by screenwriters, playwrights and a few film and theater students, who were taught the process by Beau L'Amour and the more prolific writers from earlier adaptations. The majority of productions were done in New York City. In the early years the pace of production was six shows a year but in the mid-1990s it slowed to four. At this time the running time for all the programs was roughly sixty minutes. The cast members were veterans of the New York stage, film and advertising worlds and came together for a rehearsal and then a day of recording the show. Sound effects were created by effects man Arthur Miller in the studio as the lines were being recorded and narration was done. Although many of the programs were written and produced in a modified \\"Old Time Radio\\" style, attempts were also made to modernize the approach. Whenever the story material supported it a more contemporary style was used in the writing and more and more high tech solutions to the effects and mix found their way into the productions. While hiring and supervising the writers, mostly out of Los Angeles, Beau L'Amour created a few programs on his own. The techniques used by him and producer/editor Paul O'Dell were more in line with motion picture production, simply taping the voices of the actors in the studio and then recording the majority of sound effects in the field. This called for a great deal more editing, both in cutting the actor's performances and the sound effects, but it allowed for a great deal more control. In the mid-1990s a series of the L'Amour Audio Dramas was recut for radio. Louis L'Amour Theater played on over two hundred stations for a number of years. Several of the scripts from the L'Amour series have been produced as live theater pieces, including The One for the Mojave Kid and Merrano of the Dry Country. The L'Amour program of Audio Dramas is still ongoing but the pace of production has slowed considerably. Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell released Son of a Wanted Man, the first L'Amour Drama in half a decade in 2004. Son of a Wanted Man is also the first Louis L'Amour novel to be turned into a drama. Considerably more complex than earlier shows it had a cast of over twenty mid- level Hollywood actors, a music score recorded specifically for the production and sound effects completely recorded in the field in many locations across the west. Produced as sort of a \\"profitable hobby\\" Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell created the production while working around their day-to-day jobs. Since this allowed them no more than nine or ten weeks a year, the show took four years to complete. Shalako During the 1960s, L'Amour intended to build a working town typical of those of the 19th century Western frontier, with buildings with false fronts situated in rows on either side of an unpaved main street and flanked by wide boardwalks before which, at various intervals, were watering troughs and hitching posts. The town, to be named Shalako after the protagonist of one of L'Amour's novels, was to have featured shops and other businesses that were typical of such towns: a barber shop, a hotel, a dry goods store, one or more saloons, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, etc. It would have offered itself as a filming location for Hollywood motion pictures concerning the Wild West. However, funding for the project fell through, and Shalako was never built. Literary assessment When interviewed not long before his death, he was asked which among his books he liked best. His reply: > I like them all. There's bits and pieces of books that I think are good. I > never rework a book. I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, and > make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and > I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.Review The critic Jon Tuska, surveying Western literature, writes: > I have no argument that L'Amour's total sales have probably surpassed every > other author of Western fiction in the history of the genre. Indeed, at the > time of his death his sales had topped 200,000,000. What I would question is > the degree and extent of his effect \\"upon the American Imagination\\". His > Western fiction is strictly formulary and frequently, although not always, > features the ranch romance plot where the hero and the heroine are to marry > at the end once the villains have been defeated. Not only is there nothing > really new in the basic structure of his stories, even L'Amour's social > Darwinism, which came to characterize his later fiction, was scarcely > original and was never dramatized in other media the way it was in works > based on Zane Grey's fiction. But Tuska also notes \\"At his best, L'Amour was a master of spectacular action and stories with a vivid, propulsive forward motion.\\"Jon Tuska, Foreword to L'Amour's story collection The Sixth Shotgun, Leisure Books, 2005 Awards In May 1972 he was awarded an Honorary PhD by Jamestown College, as a testament to his literary and social contributions. Bendigo Shafter (1979) won the U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Western. \\"National Book Awards – 1980\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 8 March 2012. (With essay by John Gallaher from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) In 1982 he received the Congressional Gold Medal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan awarded L'Amour the Presidential Medal of Freedom. L'Amour is also a recipient of North Dakota's Roughrider Award and the MPTF Golden Boot Award. Death L'Amour's grave L'Amour died from lung cancer on 10 June 1988, at his home in Los Angeles, and was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near the Great Mausoleum in the Mausoleum Slope, Distinguished Memorial, Space 59 in Glendale, California. His autobiography detailing his years as an itinerant worker in the west, Education of a Wandering Man, was published posthumously in 1989.

Louis L'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy books in the spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday's Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. The reason given to his young son for doing this was, \\"I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn't go on them. So now, when people ask me if they were mine, I say 'no.'\\" When his son asked if this would be a lie, he said, \\"I just wrote them for hire.

He has been active in the genres of action, drama, fantasy, and science fiction. Some of his best-known films include Flashdance, Top Gun, The Rock, Crimson Tide, Con Air, Armageddon, Enemy of the State, Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, and the Beverly Hills Cop, Bad Boys, Pirates of the Caribbean, and National Treasure franchises. He also serves as a Director at ZeniMax Media. Many of his films have been produced by Disney and Paramount, while many of his television series have been co-produced by Warner Bros. and CBS Television Studios. In July 2003, Bruckheimer was honored by Variety as the first producer in Hollywood history to produce the top two highest-grossing films of a single weekend, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Bad Boys II. His best known television series are CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, CSI: Cyber, Without a Trace, Cold Case, and the American version of The Amazing Race. At one point, three of his TV series ranked among the top 10 in the U.S. ratings—a unique feat in television.Galloway, Stephen. \\"Jerry Bruckheimer, producer\\". The Hollywood Reporter, November 17, 2003. Accessed August 27, 2009. He is also the co-founder and co-majority owner (along with David Bonderman) of the new Seattle Kraken expansion team of the National Hockey League.  Biography   Early life  Bruckheimer was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of German Jewish immigrants. He graduated from Mumford High School in 1961 in Detroit, at age 17, before moving to Arizona for college. Bruckheimer was also an active member of the Stamp Collecting Club. He graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Arizona. He was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. A film buff at an early age with an interest in photography, Bruckheimer would take snapshots when he had the opportunity. After college Bruckheimer worked in advertising in Detroit (creative producer) and New York City. At the Detroit agency, he worked on a 1-minute ad spot for the new Pontiac GTO. Early in his career, Bruckheimer produced television commercials, including one for Pepsi.  1970s & 80s: from advertising to film production  Bruckheimer started producing films in the 1970s, after leaving his job in advertising, with director Dick Richards. They had worked together on the films The Culpepper Cattle Company, Farewell, My Lovely, and March or Die. Bruckheimer then worked with Paul Schrader on two films, American Gigolo and Cat People, which began to give him notice in Hollywood. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a co-producer with Don Simpson of a string of highly successful Hollywood films for Paramount Pictures. He first met Simpson at a screening of 1973's The Harder They Come at Warner Brothers. The two worked together and created Bruckheimer's first big hit, 1983's Flashdance, which brought in US$95 million. He had a number of other hits during that time period, including the Beverly Hills Cop films, Top Gun and Days of Thunder. Top Gun marked his first collaboration with English director Tony Scott, who directed six films for Bruckheimer. The first Beverly Hills Cop movie, which was supposed to star Sylvester Stallone, launched Eddie Murphy's career and became Paramount's highest grossing winter release in the company's history in just five days. While working with Simpson, Bruckheimer became known as \\"Mr. Outside\\" because of his experience with film-making, while Simpson became known as \\"Mr. Inside\\" because of his film industry contacts. The Rock was the last film in which Bruckheimer collaborated with Simpson. After Simpson's death in 1996, Bruckheimer stipulated that The Rock be dedicated to the memory of Simpson.  1990s: Big-budget films  In 1990, Bruckenheimer and Simpson struck a $500-million deal with Paramount to produce 5 movies of their entire choice. However, his 1990 production Days of Thunder starring Tom Cruise did not perform well, a step backwards in the Bruckheimer-Simpson's success story. The duo made a come-back in 1994 with the low-budget film ($12 million) The Ref. Despite Simpson's untimely death, Bruckheimer has continued to produce a large number of action films often working with director Michael Bay for several hits including Armageddon. His other hit films produced include Remember the Titans, Black Hawk Down and the Pirates of the Caribbean series. He has also acquired the rights to produce a film based on the popular role playing game by Palladium Books, Rifts. In the late 1990s, he started out Technical Black Films to produce non-action films, with Remember the Titans being the only film produced.  2000s: Franchises, TV, video games  Since 1996 he has branched out into television, creating a number of police dramas of which CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has been the most successful. He has also produced the reality game show The Amazing Race. In May 2008 CBS announced it had picked up Bruckheimer's newest series, Eleventh Hour, for the 2008–2009 broadcast television season. The science fiction drama follows a government agent and a professor as they investigate strange scientific and medical activity.Adalian, Josef. \\"CBS Picks Up 4 New Dramas, 2 Comedies\\". TV Week, May 2008. Accessed August 27, 2009. From 2004 (beginning of CSI: NY) to 2009 (end of Without a Trace), Bruckheimer had six hit television shows on the air: CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Cold Case, Without a Trace and The Amazing Race. At one point, three of his TV series ranked among the top 10 in the ratings. In December 2007 Bruckheimer announced plans to partner with MTV to create a new game studio. The same year Bruckheimer joined the ZeniMax Media board of directors and has since showed up at several launch parties for Bethesda Softworks titles including Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In 2009, Bruckheimer unveiled Jerry Bruckheimer Games headed by former Microsoft Studios Publishing Executive Producer Jim Veevaert as president of production and Jay Cohen, previously Ubisoft's vice president of U.S. publishing, as president of development. It was announced on September 10, 2009 that NBC had picked up an action procedural from Jerry Bruckheimer. The show, titled Chase, \\"tells the stories of a team charged with making sure fugitive criminals don't evade justice,\\" reports The Hollywood Reporter. It was canceled in May 2011. Bruckheimer's most notable flop was Skin, which was cancelled after three episodes in 2003. In 2011 it was rumored that Jerry Bruckheimer Games was working on three titles, but nothing came out of it ever since. In March 2013 Jerry Bruckheimer Games was closed. Although Jerry Bruckheimer Games is closed, Bruckheimer still remains a ZeniMax board member to this day, mostly due to being a close associate of ZeniMax President Ernest Del.  2010s: Independent producer, sports  In 2014, after the disappointment of The Sorcerer's Apprentice and The Lone Ranger, Jerry Bruckheimer and the Disney Studios split up by not renewing their first-look deal that expired that year. He signed a new first-look deal with the Paramount that same year, and mentioned a new Beverly Hills Cop and a Top Gun 2 as potential production ventures with his new partner. In June 2016, Jerry Bruckheimer Television became an Independent outfit, ending a 15-year run exclusive pact with Warner Bros Television. The next year, the production company signed a deal with CBS Television Studios. Bruckheimer was named as one of the investors of a proposed sports arena in Las Vegas, and had been rumored to be the leading choice by the National Hockey League (NHL) to own an expansion hockey team that would play in the arena. Bruckheimer was also named as one of the investors of a proposed Seattle-based NHL expansion team whose application was submitted in early 2018. The NHL Board of Governors voted to approve the team, named the Seattle Kraken, on December 4, 2018, which will start play in the 2021–22 season. Jerry Bruckheimer was part of an investment group that also included Tim Leiweke (Oak View Group) and David Bonderman (minority owner NBA's Boston Celtics).  Impact on the film industry  Bruckheimer with Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise in June 2013.  High-profit productions  The movie Top Gun was produced in collaboration with the Pentagon to rebrand the US Navy's image post-Vietnam war, and attract new Navy recruits. Top Gun was the first full-blown collaboration between Hollywood and the US Navy. The model developed by Jerry Bruckheimer around the production of Top Gun launched a new trend of war movies in the nineties and onward. In July 2003, Bruckheimer was honored by Variety as the first producer in Hollywood history to produce the top two highest-grossing films of a single weekend, the buddy-cop Bad Boys II and the Disney theme-park spin-off, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. According to Variety, the \\"Bruckheimer touch\\" is characterized by a \\"consistently edgy, high-octane visual dynamic and equally distinctive storytelling driven by the triumphalism so popular with Madison Avenue\\". The Pirates of the Caribbean film series, produced through Walt Disney Pictures, was enormously profitable, and demonstrated Bruckheimer's ability to create lucrative projects. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the first film in the franchise, was released on July 9, 2003. A popular box office hit, it was well received by critics and filmgoers alike. After the unexpected success of the first film, Walt Disney Pictures revealed that a trilogy was in the works. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was released on July 7, 2006. The sequel proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide the day of its premiere. In the end it acquired a total of $1,066,179,725 at the worldwide box office, becoming the third and fastest film to reach this amount. The third film in the series, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, was released worldwide on May 25, 2007. Two more films, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, were released, in 2011 and 2017, respectively. Altogether, the film franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide.  Personal views  When asked about his favorite films, Bruckheimer named The Godfather (1972), The French Connection (1971), Good Will Hunting (1997), and The 400 Blows (1959). When asked on what the film industry's obligation to an audience was, he responded, \\"We are in the transportation business. We transport audiences from one place to another.\\" When asked why he makes films, he stated, \\"If I made films for the critics, or for someone else, I'd probably be living in some small Hollywood studio apartment.\\" In a 1984 interview with the Los Angeles Times, he said \\"We (he and Don Simpson) put together all the elements. We decide what aesthetic is right for a picture. We are as much a part of the process as the director.\\" In May 2006, he was honored with a doctor of fine arts degree (DFA) from the University of Arizona's College of Fine Arts.  Other commitments  Bruckheimer at the 2014 WonderCon.  Philanthropic activities  Bruckheimer's philanthropic activities have included publicly supporting the fight against multiple sclerosis via his work with The Nancy Davis Foundation for MS. He has additionally pledged to help various causes by establishing the Jerry Bruckheimer Foundation. However, according to The Smoking Gun, the last time the Jerry Bruckheimer Foundation made a contribution was in 1995, when it gave $9,350 to Van Nuys prep school. Bruckheimer has aided in the repair and restoration of the historic clipper ship Cutty Sark. A collection of photos taken by Bruckheimer went on display in London in November 2007 to help raise money for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project. The exhibition featured more than thirty pictures taken on set during the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.  Political contributions  Bruckheimer has donated more than $50,000 to Republican campaigns and committees. Bruckheimer donated funds to John McCain's 2008 presidential election campaign. He gave $5,000 to a joint fundraising committee on John McCain's behalf. Bruckheimer donated $25,000 to the 2012 Mitt Romney Victory Fund.

It extends the earlier SSE instruction set, and is intended to fully replace MMX. Intel extended SSE2 to create SSE3 in 2004. SSE2 added 144 new instructions to SSE, which has 70 instructions. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003. Features Most of the SSE2 instructions implement the integer vector operations also found in MMX. Instead of the MMX registers they use the XMM registers, which are wider and allow for significant performance improvements in specialized applications. Another advantage of replacing MMX with SSE2 is avoiding the mode switching penalty for issuing x87 instructions present in MMX because it is sharing register space with the x87 FPU. The SSE2 also complements the floating-point vector operations of the SSE instruction set by adding support for the double precision data type. Other SSE2 extensions include a set of cache control instructions intended primarily to minimize cache pollution when processing infinite streams of information, and a sophisticated complement of numeric format conversion instructions. AMD's implementation of SSE2 on the AMD64 (x86-64) platform includes an additional eight registers, doubling the total number to 16 (XMM0 through XMM15). These additional registers are only visible when running in 64-bit mode. Intel adopted these additional registers as part of their support for x86-64 architecture (or in Intel's parlance, \\"Intel 64\\") in 2004. Differences between x87 FPU and SSE2 FPU (x87) instructions provide higher precision by calculating intermediate results with 80 bits of precision, by default, to minimise roundoff error in numerically unstable algorithms (see IEEE 754 design rationale and references therein). However, the x87 FPU is a scalar unit only whereas SSE2 can process a small vector of operands in parallel. If codes designed for x87 are ported to the lower precision double precision SSE2 floating point, certain combinations of math operations or input datasets can result in measurable numerical deviation, which can be an issue in reproducible scientific computations, e.g. if the calculation results must be compared against results generated from a different machine architecture. A related issue is that, historically, language standards and compilers had been inconsistent in their handling of the x87 80-bit registers implementing double extended precision variables, compared with the double and single precision formats implemented in SSE2: the rounding of extended precision intermediate values to double precision variables was not fully defined and was dependent on implementation details such as when registers were spilled to memory. Differences between MMX and SSE2 SSE2 extends MMX instructions to operate on XMM registers. Therefore, it is possible to convert all existing MMX code to an SSE2 equivalent. Since an SSE2 register is twice as long as an MMX register, loop counters and memory access may need to be changed to accommodate this. However, 8 byte loads and stores to XMM are available, so this is not strictly required. Although one SSE2 instruction can operate on twice as much data as an MMX instruction, performance might not increase significantly. Two major reasons are: accessing SSE2 data in memory not aligned to a 16-byte boundary can incur significant penalty, and the throughput of SSE2 instructions in older x86 implementations was half that for MMX instructions. Intel addressed the first problem by adding an instruction in SSE3 to reduce the overhead of accessing unaligned data and improving the overall performance of misaligned loads, and the last problem by widening the execution engine in their Core microarchitecture in Core 2 Duo and later products. Since MMX and x87 register files alias one another, using MMX will prevent x87 instructions from working as desired. Once MMX has been used, the programmer must use the emms instruction (C: _mm_empty()) to restore operation to the x87 register file. On some operating systems, x87 is not used very much, but may still be used in some critical areas like pow() where the extra precision is needed. In such cases, the corrupt floating-point state caused by failure to emit emms may go undetected for millions of instructions before ultimately causing the floating-point routine to fail, returning NaN. Since the problem is not locally apparent in the MMX code, finding and correcting the bug can be very time consuming. As SSE2 does not have this problem, usually provides much better throughput and provides more registers in 64-bit code, it should be preferred for nearly all vectorization work. Compiler usage When first introduced in 2000, SSE2 was not supported by software development tools. For example, to use SSE2 in a Microsoft Visual Studio project, the programmer had to either manually write inline-assembly or import object-code from an external source. Later the Visual C++ Processor Pack added SSE2 support to Visual C++ and MASM. The Intel C++ Compiler can automatically generate SSE4, SSSE3, SSE3, SSE2, and SSE code without the use of hand-coded assembly. Since GCC 3, GCC can automatically generate SSE/SSE2 scalar code when the target supports those instructions. Automatic vectorization for SSE/SSE2 has been added since GCC 4. The Sun Studio Compiler Suite can also generate SSE2 instructions when the compiler flag -xvector=simd is used. Since Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, the compiler option to generate SSE2 instructions is turned on by default. CPU support SSE2 is an extension of the IA-32 architecture, based on the x86 instruction set. Therefore, only x86 processors can include SSE2. The AMD64 architecture supports the IA-32 as a compatibility mode and includes the SSE2 in its specification. It also doubles the number of XMM registers, allowing for better performance. SSE2 is also a requirement for installing Windows 8 (and later) or Microsoft Office 2013 (and later) \\"to enhance the reliability of third-party apps and drivers running in Windows 8\\". The following IA-32 CPUs support SSE2: * Intel NetBurst-based CPUs (Pentium 4, Xeon, Celeron, Pentium D, Celeron D) * Intel Pentium M and Celeron M * Intel Atom * AMD Athlon 64 * Transmeta Efficeon * VIA C7 The following IA-32 CPUs were released after SSE2 was developed, but did not implement it: * AMD CPUs prior to Athlon 64, such as Athlon XP * VIA C3 * Transmeta Crusoe * Intel Quark See also * SSE2 instructions References Category:X86 instructions Category:SIMD computing ","title":"SSE2"},{"id":"311205","text":"Beginning in May 1968, a period of civil unrest occurred throughout France, lasting some seven weeks and punctuated by demonstrations, general strikes, as well as the occupation of universities and factories. At the height of events, which have since become known as May 68, the economy of France came to a halt. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution; the national government briefly ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to Germany at one point. The protests spurred movements worldwide, with songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions. Heavy police repression of the protesters led France's trade union confederations to call for sympathy strikes, which spread far more quickly than expected to involve 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total population of France at the time. The movement was characterized by spontaneous and decentralized wildcat disposition; this created a contrast and at times even conflict internally amongst the trade unions and the parties of the left. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike. The student occupations and general strikes initiated across France were met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police. The de Gaulle administration's attempts to quell those strikes by police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the Latin Quarter, Paris. However, by late May, the flow of events changed. The Grenelle accords concluded on 27 May, between the government, trade unions and employers, won significant wage gains for workers. A counter-demonstration organised by the Gaullist party on 29 May in central Paris gave De Gaulle the confidence to dissolve the National Assembly and call for parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968. Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, and when the elections were held in June, the Gaullists emerged stronger than before. The events of May 1968 continue to influence French society. The period is considered a cultural, social and moral turning point in the history of the country. —one of the leaders of the time—later stated that the movement had succeeded \\"as a social revolution, not as a political one.\\" Background Political climate In February 1968, the French Communists and French Socialists formed an electoral alliance. Communists had long supported Socialist candidates in elections, but in the \\"February Declaration\\" the two parties agreed to attempt to form a joint government to replace President Charles de Gaulle and his Gaullist Party. University demonstration On 22 March far-left groups, a small number of prominent poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied an administration building at Paris University at Nanterre and held a meeting in the university council room dealing with class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university's funding. The university's administration called the police, who surrounded the university. After the publication of their wishes, the students left the building without any trouble. After this first record some leaders of what was named the \\"Movement of 22 March\\" were called together by the disciplinary committee of the university. Events of May Student protests the Sorbonne, in the Latin Quarter of Paris Following months of conflicts between students and authorities at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris (now Paris Nanterre University), the administration shut down the university on 2 May 1968.Rotman, pp. 10–11; Damamme, Gobille, Matonti & Pudal, ed., p. 190. Students at the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris (today Sorbonne University) in Paris met on 3 May to protest against the closure and the threatened expulsion of several students at Nanterre.Damamme, Gobille, Matonti & Pudal, ed., p. 190. On Monday, 6 May, the national student union, the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF)—still the largest student union in France today—and the union of university teachers called a march to protest against the police invasion of Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers and supporters marched towards the Sorbonne, still sealed off by the police, who charged, wielding their batons, as soon as the marchers approached. While the crowd dispersed, some began to create barricades out of whatever was at hand, while others threw paving stones, forcing the police to retreat for a time. The police then responded with tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds more students were arrested. High school student unions spoke in support of the riots on 6 May. The next day, they joined the students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers who gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that: # All criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, # the police leave the university, and # the authorities reopen Nanterre and Sorbonne. Escalating conflict Negotiations broke down, and students returned to their campuses after a false report that the government had agreed to reopen them, only to discover the police still occupying the schools. This led to a near revolutionary fervor among the students. On Friday, 10 May, another huge crowd congregated on the Rive Gauche. When the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité again blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again threw up barricades, which the police then attacked at 2:15 in the morning after negotiations once again floundered. The confrontation, which produced hundreds of arrests and injuries, lasted until dawn of the following day. The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. Allegations were made that the police had participated in the riots, through agents provocateurs, by burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails. The government's heavy-handed reaction brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Many of the nation's more mainstream singers and poets joined after the police brutality came to light. American artists also began voicing support of the strikers. The major left union federations, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO), called a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. Well over a million people marched through Paris on that day; the police stayed largely out of sight. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne. However, the surge of strikes did not recede. Instead, the protesters became even more active. When the Sorbonne reopened, students occupied it and declared it an autonomous \\"people's university\\". Public opinion at first supported the students, but quickly turned against them after their leaders, invited to appear on national television, \\"behaved like irresponsible utopianists who wanted to destroy the 'consumer society.'\\" Nonetheless, in the weeks that followed, approximately 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and elsewhere to take up grievances against the government and French society, including the Sorbonne Occupation Committee. Worker strikes Strikers in Southern France with a sign reading \\"Factory Occupied by the Workers.\\" Behind them is a list of demands, June 1968. By the middle of May, demonstrations extended to factories, though its workers' demands significantly varied from that of the students. A union-led general strike on 13 May included 200,000 in a march. The strikes spread to all sectors of the French economy, including state-owned jobs, manufacturing and service industries, management, and administration. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on strike. These strikes were not led by the union movement; on the contrary, the CGT tried to contain this spontaneous outbreak of militancy by channeling it into a struggle for higher wages and other economic demands. Workers put forward a broader, more political and more radical agenda, demanding the ousting of the government and President de Gaulle and attempting, in some cases, to run their factories. When the trade union leadership negotiated a 35% increase in the minimum wage, a 7% wage increase for other workers, and half normal pay for the time on strike with the major employers' associations, the workers occupying their factories refused to return to work and jeered their union leaders. In fact, in the May 68 movement there was a lot of \\"anti-unionist euphoria,\\"Derrida, Jacques (1991) \\"A 'Madness' Must Watch Over Thinking\\", interview with Francois Ewald for Le Magazine Litteraire, March 1991, republished in Points...: Interviews, 1974-1994 (1995).pp.347–9 against the mainstream unions, the CGT, FO and CFDT, that were more willing to compromise with the powers that be than enact the will of the base. On 24 May two people died at the hands of the out of control rioters. In Lyon, Police Inspector Rene Lacroix died when he was crushed by a driverless truck sent careering into police lines by rioters. In Paris, Phillipe Metherion, 26, was stabbed to death during an argument among demonstrators. As the upheaval reached its apogee in late May, major trade unions met with employers' organizations and the French government to produce the Grenelle agreements, which would increase the minimum wage 35% and all salaries 10%, and granted employee protections and a shortened working day. The unions were forced to reject the agreement, based on opposition from their members, underscoring a disconnect in organizations that claimed to reflect working class interests. The UNEF student union and CFDT trade union held a rally in the Charléty stadium with about 22,000 attendees. Its range of speakers reflected the divide between student and Communist factions. While the rally was held in the stadium partly for security, the insurrectionary messages of the speakers was dissonant with the relative amenities of the sports venue. Calls for new government The Socialists saw an opportunity to act as a compromise between de Gaulle and the Communists. On 28 May, François Mitterrand of the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left declared that \\"there is no more state\\" and stated that he was ready to form a new government. He had received a surprisingly high 45% of the vote in the 1965 presidential election. On 29 May, Pierre Mendès France also stated that he was ready to form a new government; unlike Mitterrand he was willing to include the Communists. Although the Socialists did not have the Communists' ability to form large street demonstrations, they had more than 20% of the country's support. De Gaulle flees On the morning of 29 May, de Gaulle postponed the meeting of the Council of Ministers scheduled for that day and secretly removed his personal papers from Élysée Palace. He told his son-in- law Alain de Boissieu, \\"I do not want to give them a chance to attack the Élysée. It would be regrettable if blood were shed in my personal defense. I have decided to leave: nobody attacks an empty palace.\\" De Gaulle refused Pompidou's request that he dissolve the National Assembly as he believed that their party, the Gaullists, would lose the resulting election. At 11:00 am, he told Pompidou, \\"I am the past; you are the future; I embrace you.\\" The government announced that de Gaulle was going to his country home in Colombey- les-Deux-Églises before returning the next day, and rumors spread that he would prepare his resignation speech there. The presidential helicopter did not arrive in Colombey, however, and de Gaulle had told no one in the government where he was going. For more than six hours the world did not know where the French president was. The canceling of the ministerial meeting, and the president's mysterious disappearance, stunned the French, including Pompidou, who shouted, \\"He has fled the country!\\"  Government collapse  With de Gaulle's closest advisors stating that they did not know what the president intended, Pompidou scheduled a tentative appearance on television at 8 p.m. The national government had effectively ceased to function. Édouard Balladur later wrote that as prime minister, Pompidou \\"by himself was the whole government\\" as most officials were \\"an incoherent group of confabulators\\" who believed that revolution would soon occur. A friend of the prime minister offered him a weapon, saying, \\"You will need it\\"; Pompidou advised him to go home. One official reportedly began burning documents, while another asked an aide how far they could flee by automobile should revolutionaries seize fuel supplies. Withdrawing money from banks became difficult, gasoline for private automobiles was unavailable, and some people tried to obtain private planes or fake national identity cards. Pompidou unsuccessfully requested that military radar be used to follow de Gaulle's two helicopters, but soon learned that he had gone to the headquarters of the French military in Germany, in Baden-Baden, to meet General Jacques Massu. Massu persuaded the discouraged de Gaulle to return to France; now knowing that he had the military's support, de Gaulle rescheduled the meeting of the Council of Ministers for the next day, 30 May, and returned to Colombey by 6:00 pm His wife Yvonne gave the family jewels to their son and daughter-in- law—who stayed in Baden for a few more days—for safekeeping, however, indicating that the de Gaulles still considered Germany a possible refuge. Massu kept as a state secret de Gaulle's loss of confidence until others disclosed it in 1982; until then most observers believed that his disappearance was intended to remind the French people of what they might lose. Although the disappearance was real and not intended as motivation, it indeed had such an effect on France. Revolution prevented Pierre Messmer On 30 May, 400,000 to 500,000 protesters (many more than the 50,000 the police were expecting) led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting: \\"Adieu, de Gaulle!\\" (\\"Farewell, de Gaulle!\\"). Maurice Grimaud, head of the Paris police, played a key role in avoiding revolution by both speaking to and spying on the revolutionaries, and by carefully avoiding the use of force. While Communist leaders later denied that they had planned an armed uprising, and extreme militants only comprised 2% of the populace, they had overestimated de Gaulle's strength as shown by his escape to Germany. (One scholar, otherwise skeptical of the French Communists' willingness to maintain democracy after forming a government, has claimed that the \\"moderate, nonviolent and essentially antirevolutionary\\" Communists opposed revolution because they sincerely believed that the party must come to power through legal elections, not armed conflict that might provoke harsh repression from political opponents.) Not knowing that the Communists did not intend to seize power, officials prepared to position police forces at the Élysée with orders to shoot if necessary. That it did not also guard Paris City Hall despite reports of that being the Communists' target was evidence of governmental chaos. The Communist movement was largely centered around the Paris metropolitan area, and not elsewhere. Had the rebellion occupied key public buildings in Paris, the government would have had to use force to retake them. The resulting casualties could have incited a revolution, with the military moving from the provinces to retake Paris as in 1871. Minister of Defence Pierre Messmer and Chief of the Defence Staff Michel Fourquet prepared for such an action, and Pompidou had ordered tanks to Issy-les-Moulineaux. While the military was free of revolutionary sentiment, using an army mostly of conscripts the same age as the revolutionaries would have been very dangerous for the government. A survey taken immediately after the crisis found that 20% of Frenchmen would have supported a revolution, 23% would have opposed it, and 57% would have avoided physical participation in the conflict. 33% would have fought a military intervention, while only 5% would have supported it and a majority of the country would have avoided any action. Election called At 2:30 p.m. on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded de Gaulle to dissolve the National Assembly and call a new election by threatening to resign. At 4:30 pm, de Gaulle broadcast his own refusal to resign. He announced an election, scheduled for 23 June, and ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The government had leaked to the media that the army was outside Paris. Immediately after the speech, about 800,000 supporters marched through the Champs-Élysées waving the national flag; the Gaullists had planned the rally for several days, which attracted a crowd of diverse ages, occupations, and politics. The Communists agreed to the election, and the threat of revolution was over. Aftermath Protest suppression and elections From that point, the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of leftist organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. Contrary to de Gaulle's fears, his party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history in the legislative election held in June, taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57. The February Declaration and its promise to include Communists in government likely hurt the Socialists in the election. Their opponents cited the example of the Czechoslovak National Front government of 1945, which led to a Communist takeover of the country in 1948. Socialist voters were divided; in a February 1968 survey a majority had favored allying with the Communists, but 44% believed that Communists would attempt to seize power once in government. (30% of Communist voters agreed.) On Bastille Day, there were resurgent street demonstrations in the Latin Quarter, led by socialist students, leftists and communists wearing red arm- bands and anarchists wearing black arm-bands. The Paris police and the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité harshly responded starting around 10 pm and continuing through the night, on the streets, in police vans, at police stations, and in hospitals where many wounded were taken. There was, as a result, much bloodshed among students and tourists there for the evening's festivities. No charges were filed against police or demonstrators, but the governments of Britain and West Germany filed formal protests, including for the indecent assault of two English schoolgirls by police in a police station. National feelings Despite the size of de Gaulle's triumph, it was not a personal one. The post-crisis survey showed that a majority of the country saw de Gaulle as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too anti-American. As the April 1969 referendum would show, the country was ready for \\"Gaullism without de Gaulle\\". Legacy May 1968 is an important reference point in French politics, representing for some the possibility of liberation and for others the dangers of anarchy. For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called new social movements.Staricco, Juan Ignacio (2012) https://www.scribd.com/doc/112409042/The-French-May-and- the-Roots-of-Postmodern-Politics Someone who took part in or supported this period of unrest is referred to as soixante-huitard (literally a \\"68-er\\") — a term, derived from the French for \\"68\\", which has also entered the English language.

The word stems from the French verb which means literally to carry something back; and, in the sense of how people relate to each other means that what one person sends out the other sends back. For example, they may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music or sports. This may also mean that the participants engage in reciprocal behaviors such as posture mirroring or in increased coordination in their verbal and nonverbal interactions. There are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport such as: matching your body language (i.e., posture, gesture, etc.); indicating attentiveness through maintaining eye contact;and matching tempo, terminology and breathing rhythm . In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive \\"face management\\"), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, \\"self-disclosure\\"), and by referring to shared interests or experiences. Rapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine, negotiation, and education, among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a \\"working alliance\\".  Building  To achieve the benefits of interpersonal rapport in domains like education, medicine, or even sales, several methods have been shown to build rapport between people. These methods include coordination, showing your attentiveness to the other, building commonality, and managing the other's self-perception (also called \\"face\\" management).  Methods   Coordination  Coordination, also called \\"mirroring\\" means getting into rhythm with another person, or coordinating one's verbal or nonverbal behaviors. * Emotional mirroring – Empathizing with someone's emotional state by being on 'their side'. You must apply the skill of being a good listener in this situation so as you can listen for key words and problems that arise when speaking with the person. This is so you can talk about these issues and question them to better your understanding of what they are saying and show your empathy towards them (Arnold, E and Boggs, josh. 2007). * Posture mirroring – Matching the tone of a person's body language not through direct imitation, as this can appear as mockery, but through mirroring the general message of their posture and energy. * Tone and tempo mirroring – Matching the tone, tempo, inflection, and volume of a person's voice.  Mutual attentiveness  Another way of building rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other. This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person, nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers' \\"immediacy\\" behaviors in the classroom. This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one's knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.  Commonality  Commonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust. This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences. By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.  Face management  Another way of building rapport is through what is often referred to as \\"positive face management\\", but may also simply be called positivity. According to some psychologists, we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our \\"face\\". By managing each other's \\"face\\", boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we are able to build rapport with others. Benefits There have been a number of proposed benefits from building interpersonal rapport, which all revolve around smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes, though the specifics differ by the domain. In the health domain, provider-patient rapport is often called the \\"Therapeutic Alliance\\" or “Therapeutic Relationship”, and is a measure of the collaboration quality between provider and patient, often used as a predictor of therapy outcomes or patients' treatment adherence. In education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students' participation in the course, their course retention, likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes. Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro- social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety. Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher's ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions. In negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes, as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, others have found that interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically. Studying To better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants, third-party observations from a naive observer, and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning. Self-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of the interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale. Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants' reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly. To address these issues, others have used a third-party observer to give a rating of the rapport to a particular segment of the interaction, often called a \\"slice\\". Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.

Quintilis is Latin for \\"fifth\\": it was the fifth month (quintilis mensis) in the earliest calendar attributed to Romulus, which began with Martius (\\"Mars' month,\\" March) and had 10 months. After the calendar reform that produced a 12-month year, Quintilis became the seventh month, but retained its name. In 45 BC, Julius Caesar instituted a new calendar (the Julian calendar) that corrected astronomical discrepancies in the old. After his death in 44 BC, the month of Quintilis, his birth month, was renamed Julius in his honor, hence July.\\"Los Cielos de Agosto\\" (Spanish: \\"The Skies of August\\"), Jorge R. Ianiszewski, Circulo Astronomico, 2006, webpage: CirA- Agosto. Quintilis was under the guardianship (tutela) of the Romans' supreme deity Jupiter, with sacrifices made particularly to Neptune and Apollo. Agricultural festivals directed at the harvest gradually lost their importance, and the month became dominated in urban Imperial Rome by the Ludi Apollinares, games (ludi) in honor of Apollo.Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic, p. 158. Ten days of games were celebrated in honor of Julius Caesar at the end of the month. Dates Like the modern month of July, this was one of the \\"long\\" months that had 31 days. The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (Nonae, 5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (Idūs, 13th or 15th), and the Kalends (Kalendae, 1st) of the following month. Thus the last day of Quintilis was the pridie Kalendas Sextilis,The month name is construed as an adjective modifying Kalendae, Nonae or Idũs; as accusative plural, Sextilĩs might also be written as Sextilēs. \\"day before the Kalends of Sextilis\\" (August). Roman counting was inclusive; July 5 was ante diem III Nonas Quintilis, \\"the 3rd day before the Nones (7th) of Quintilis,\\" usually abbreviated a.d. III Non. Quint. (or with the a.d. omitted altogether); July 23 was X. Kal. Sext., \\"the 10th day before the Kalends of Sextilis.\\" Drawing of the fragmentary Fasti Antiates, a pre-Julian calendar showing Quintilis (abbreviated QUIN) at the top of the seventh column Each day was marked with a letter such as F for dies fasti, days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law; C, for dies comitalis, a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies (comitia), elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings; N for dies nefasti, when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited; or NP, the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked feriae, public holidays.Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies, pp. 44–45. Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of A B C D E F G H, to mark the \\"market week\\"Jörg Rüpke, The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti, translated by David M.B. Richardson (Blackwell, 2011, originally published 1995 in German), p. 6. A dies natalis was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the \\"birthday\\" of a deity. On a dies religiosus, individuals were not to undertake any new activity, nor do anything other than tend to the most basic necessities. During the Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the Feriale Duranum, sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals. After the latter 1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games (ludi) held in honor of various deities in the venue called a \\"circus\\" (ludi circenses).Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), p. 118ff. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with letters (F, N, C and so on) to show their religious status, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius.Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 17.

After the calendar reform that produced a twelve-month year, Sextilis became the eighth month, but retained its name. It was renamed Augustus (August) in 8 BC in honor of the first Roman emperor, Augustus. Sextilis followed Quinctilis, which was renamed Julius (July) after Julius Caesar, and preceded September (from septem, \\"seven\\"), which was originally the seventh month. The month Augustus Julius (July) was renamed from Quintilis (\\"fifth\\" month) in honor of Julius Caesar, who had adopted his grand-nephew Octavian, the future Augustus, and made him his heir. It has sometimes been thought that the month has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days in his month as in his predecessor's, but Sextilis in fact had 31 days since the reform during Caesar's dictatorship that created the Julian calendar. The decree of the Senate (senatus consultum) renaming Sextilis reads in part: Illustration taken from the 4th-century Calendar of Filocalus > Whereas the emperor Augustus Caesar, in the month of Sextilis, was first > admitted to the consulate, and thrice entered the city in triumph, and in > the same month the legions, from the Janiculum, placed themselves under his > auspices, and in the same month Egypt was brought under the authority of the > Roman people, and in the same month an end was put to the civil wars; and > whereas for these reasons the said month is, and has been, most fortunate to > this empire, it is hereby decreed by the senate that the said month shall be > called Augustus.Preserved by Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.35; entry on > calendarium, in William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities > (John Murray, London, 1875), at LacusCurtius. Iconography of the month The Calendar of Filocalus illustrated the month of August with a seasonal representation of summer's heat. A peacock fan overhangs a nude male who drinks from a large bowl, with his cast-off garment in the top right corner. The amphora beside him is sealed with a flower and in one extant copy is inscribed ZLS, probably a mistaken transcription for the Greek exhortation zeses, \\"to your health\\". Three mature gourds or melons are another seasonal motif.Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), p. 94. Dates Roof tile with a Latin inscription reading XVI KALENDAS SEPTEMBRES ISAURICUS: XVI Kal. Sept. is 17 August on the Julian calendar The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (13th or 15th), and the Kalends (1st) of the following month. The Nones of August was the 5th, and the Ides the 13th. The last day of August was the pridie Kalendas Septembris,The month name is construed as an adjective modifying Kalendae, Nonae or Idūs (all plural nouns of feminine gender). \\"day before the Kalends of September\\". Roman counting was inclusive; 9 August was ante diem V Idūs Sextilīs (ante diem V Idūs Augustas), \\"the 5th day before the Ides of August,\\" usually abbreviated a.d. V Id. Sext. (a.d. V Id. Aug.), or with the a.d. omitted altogether. The Julian calendar reform added two days to Sextilis; thus on the pre-reform calendar, 23 August was VIII Kal. Sept., \\"the 8th day before the Kalends of September,\\" but on the Julian calendar X Kal. Sept., \\"the 10th day before the Kalends of September\\". On the calendar of the Roman Republic and early Principate, each day was marked with a letter to denote its religiously lawful status. In August, these were: * F for dies fasti, days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law; * C, for dies comitalis, a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies (comitia), elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings; * N for dies nefasti, when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited; * NP, the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked feriae, public holidays; * EN for endotercissus, an archaic form of intercissus, \\"cut in half,\\" meaning days that were nefasti in the morning, when sacrifices were being prepared, and in the evening, while sacrifices were being offered, but were fasti in the middle of the day.Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies, pp. 44–45. Drawing of the fragmentary Fasti Antiates, a pre-Julian calendar showing Sextilis (abbreviated SEX) at the top of the eighth column Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of A B C D E F G H, to mark the \\"market week\\"Jörg Rüpke, The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti, translated by David M.B. Richardson (Blackwell, 2011, originally published 1995 in German), p. 6. (these are omitted in the table below). A dies natalis was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the \\"birthday\\" of a deity. During the Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the Feriale Duranum, sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals. After the mid-1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games (circenses) held in honor of various deities in the venue called a \\"circus\\".Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 118ff. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with letters (F, N, C and so on) to show their religious status, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius.Salzman, On Roman Time, pp. 17, 122. Festivals marked in large letters on extant fasti, represented by festival names in all capital letters on the table, are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC.Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic, p. 41. Unless otherwise noted, the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 169–182.

History of the office his First Cabinet, 1910. The position of Prime Minister was established in 1910, when the Union of South Africa was formed. He was appointed by the head of state—the governor-general until 1961 and the state president after South Africa became a republic in 1961. In practice, he was the leader of the majority party or coalition in the House of Assembly. With few exceptions, the governor- general/state president was bound by convention to act on the prime minister's advice. Thus, the prime minister was the country's leading political figure and de facto chief executive, with powers similar to those of his British counterpart. The first prime minister was Louis Botha, a former Boer general and war hero during the Second Boer War. The position of Prime Minister was abolished in 1984, when the state president was given executive powers after a new constitution was adopted — effectively merging the powers of the prime minister with those of the state president. The last prime minister, P. W. Botha, became the first executive state president after the constitutional reform in 1984 after Marais Viljoen's retirement. In post-Apartheid South Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party has called for a return to a Westminster- style split executive with a prime minister as the actual head of government, as part of its overarching goal of avoiding a single party South African state.IFP: Statement by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha Freedom Party Leader, welcomes Constitutional Court judgment on regulation of introduction of bills, 12 October 2012 List of prime ministers of South Africa ;Parties {  style=\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" width=100px Portrait ! rowspan=\\"2\\" width=25% Name ! colspan=\\"3\\" Term of office ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Elected ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Political party ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Government - !

It combines the classic characteristics of early Pinter – a paucity of information and an atmosphere of menace, working-class small-talk in a claustrophobic setting – with an oblique but palpable political edge and, in so doing, can be seen as containing the germ of Pinter's entire dramatic oeuvre\\".Derbyshire, Harry. \\"Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter (review)\\", Modern Drama, vol 53, no 2 (2010), pp266-268. \\"The Dumb Waiter is Pinter distilled – the very essence of a writer who tapped into our desire to seek out meaning, confront injustice and assert our individuality.\\"Glover, Jamie. \\"The Dumb Waiter\\" (programme notes). The Print Room, 2013. Plot Two hit-men, Ben and Gus, are waiting in a basement room for their assignment. As the play begins, Ben, the senior member of the team, is reading a newspaper, and Gus, the junior member, is tying his shoes. Gus asks Ben many questions as he gets ready for their job and tries to make tea. They argue over the semantics of \\"light the kettle\\" and \\"put on the kettle\\". Ben continues reading his paper for most of the time, occasionally reading excerpts of it to Gus. Ben gets increasingly animated, and Gus's questions become more pointed, at times nearly nonsensical. In the back of the room is a dumbwaiter, which delivers occasional food orders. This is mysterious and both characters seem to be puzzled why these orders keep coming; the basement is clearly not outfitted as a restaurant kitchen. At one point they send up some snack food that Gus had brought along. Ben has to explain to the people above via the dumbwaiter's \\"speaking tube\\" that there is no food. Gus leaves the room to get a drink of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's speaking tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and is on his way to the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain falls. Title The dumb waiter of the title refers to the serving hatch and food lift that delivers orders to the gunmen. It could also refer to Gus, who fails to realise that he is waiting to be the victim, or even to Ben, whose obedience to a higher authority eventually forces him to eliminate his partner.Billington, Michael. Harold Pinter. Faber & Faber, 2nd edition, 2007, p89 et seq. Setting The windowless basement is characteristic of Pinter's sets. \\"Pinter's rooms are stuffy, non-specific cubes, whose atmosphere grows steadily more stale and more tense. At the opening curtain these rooms look naturalistic, meaning no more than the eye can contain. But, by the end of each play, they become sealed containers, virtual coffins.\\"Cohn, Ruby. \\"The World of Harold Pinter\\", Tulaine Drama Review, 6 (March 1962), pp55-7. Style Pinter's writing in The Dumb Waiter combines \\"the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller\\". The dialogue between Ben and Gus, while seemingly concerned only with trivial newspaper stories, football matches and cups of tea, reveals their characters. In Pinter's early plays, \\"it is language that betrays the villains – more pat, more cliché-ridden, with more brute power than that of their victims\\". In the theatre, the emotional power of the play is more readily felt than understood. Pinter \\"created his own theatrical grammar – he didn't merely write characters that had an emotional response to something... But instead, through his characters' interactions and phrasings, Pinter seemed to conjure the very visceral emotion itself\\". Interpretation Although the play is realistic in many ways, particularly the dialogue between Ben and Gus, there are also elements that are unexplained and seemingly absurd, particularly the messages delivered by the dumb waiter itself, and the delivery of an envelope containing twelve matchsticks. Pinter leaves the plays open to interpretation, \\"wanting his audience to complete his plays, to resolve in their own ways these irresolvable matters\\".Lawford, Cindy. Pinter stated that \\"between my lack of biographical data about [the characters] and the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of exploration but which it is compulsory to explore\\". One interpretation is that the play is an absurdist comedy about two men waiting in a universe without meaning or purpose, like Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. \\"The Dumb Waiter.... achieves, through its unique blend of absurdity, farce, and surface realism, a profoundly moving statement about the modern human condition\\".Brewer, Mary F. (Ed) \\"Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter\\". Rodopi, 2009 Another interpretation is that the play is a political drama showing how the individual is destroyed by a higher power. \\"Each of Harold Pinter's [first] four plays ends in the virtual annihilation of an individual.... It is by his bitter dramas of dehumanisation that he implies \\"the importance of humanity\\". The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter's plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual.\\" Pinter supported the interpretation of The Birthday Party and The Dumb Waiter as \\"political plays about power and victimisation\\". Overall, \\"it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority and a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other and raking over old times\\". It is \\"a strongly political play about the way a hierarchical society, in pitting the rebel against the conformist, places both at its mercy\\", but at the same time \\"a deeply personal play about the destructiveness of betrayal\\". \\"For an audience to gaze into Ben and Gus' closed basement room and overhear their everyday prattle is to gain insight into ... the terrifying vision of the dominant-subservient battle for power, a battle in which societies and individuals engage as a part of daily existence\\". Comedy Although the play uses \\"the semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music hall comedy\\" and is generally considered funny, this is not comedy for its own sake, but \\"a crucial part of the power-structure\\". \\"The comedy routines in the early plays are maps to the themes and meaning of the plays as a whole.... Our failure to laugh may be an indication that we, the audience, have come to side (or have been taught to side) with the victim rather than the victimiser.\\"Coppa, Francesca. \\"The Sacred Joke: Comedy and Politics in Pinter’s Early Plays\\", The Cambridge Companion to Harold Pinter. Cambridge University Press, 2009. The stories Ben picks out from his newspaper have a similar purpose. He describes an old man, wanting to cross the street, who crawls under a lorry and is run over by it (but it is not clear if the man is killed or not). Ben seems to expect the response, \\"What an idiot!\\" but Gus replies \\"Who advised him to do a thing like that?\\" which shifts responsibility and suggests the old man was a victim to be pitied. \\"The eventual split between Ben and Gus is foreshadowed in the very first joke.... By the end of the play, Pinter has trained us to see that the content of the joke-exchange is meaningless: what is important is the structure, and the alliances and antagonisms it reveals.\\" Performance history Frankfurt The world premiere was in Frankfurt as Der Stumme Diener in February 1959 with Rudolf H. Krieg as Ben and Werner Berndt as Gus. London The first performance in London was in January 1960, as part of a double bill with Pinter's first play The Room, at the Hampstead Theatre Club, directed by James Roose-Evans, with Nicholas Selby as Ben and George Tovey as Gus.

In 2007 a 50th anniversary revival at the Trafalgar Studios was directed by Harry Burton, with Jason Isaacs as Ben and Lee Evans as Gus. In 2013 a revival at The Print Room was directed by Jamie Glover, with Clive Wood as Ben and Joe Armstrong as Gus.

Tallymen, appointed by political candidates and parties, observe the opening of ballot boxes and watch as the individual ballot papers are counted. Individual tallymen may be placed to observe the opening of each box and watch as separate bundles of ballot papers are sorted, stacked and counted. They record their estimation of counts by marking votes for each candidate on their 'tally sheet' as a tick (/) which are then assembled together to produce a full prediction of what the likely outcome of the result will be. Many political parties, having been rival during elections, co-operate in producing a tally. Tally results are then released to the media before a formal account may even have begun, allowing predictions as to how some, or in most cases all, the seats in multi-member constituencies, may go hours in advance of the official count, by noting how many number 1s a candidate may get, who gets their number 2s, whether voters vote for one party or spread their first, second, third, fourth etc. preferences randomly, by party, by alphabet, by local area, or by some other criteria. In the Republic of Ireland, a national prediction of an election outcome may be made on RTÉ by lunchtime on count day, before a single seat has officially been filled. Tally results are used after the elections by political parties to work out, on the basis of from which ballot box the tally came, how many votes they picked up in a particular area, or even a particular street. The planned introduction in the Republic of Ireland of electronic voting for the 2004 local elections was expected to lead to the demise of the tally system. However, widespread criticism of the electronic voting programme has meant that a hand-count remains in operation in Ireland . Tally predictions and long complex counts have given election outcomes on television and radio much of their appeal, making election results coverage, which may last from 15 hours to days, depending on the closeness of an election, producing a form of spectator sport watched by vast viewerships. For a sort of variation on writing numbers in the unary numeral system, see Tally mark. Tallyman, UK usage In poorer parts of England (including the north and London's East End), the tallyman was the hire purchase collector, who visited each week to collect the payments for goods purchased on the never never, or hire purchase. These people still had such employ up until the 1960s. Another possible definition is a person who called to literally do a head count, presumably on behalf of either the town council or the house owners. This is rumoured to have occurred in Liverpool, in the years after the First World War.

Achenes are monocarpellate (formed from one carpel) and indehiscent (they do not open at maturity). Achenes contain a single seed that nearly fills the pericarp, but does not adhere to it. In many species, what is called the \\"seed\\" is an achene, a fruit containing the seed. The seed-like appearance is owed to the hardening of the fruit wall (pericarp), which encloses the solitary seed so closely as to seem like a seed coat. Examples Cypsela of Cynara The fruits of buttercup, buckwheat, caraway, quinoa, amaranth, and cannabis are typical achenes. The achenes of the strawberry are sometimes mistaken for seeds. The strawberry is an accessory fruit with an aggregate of achenes on its outer surface, and what is eaten is accessory tissue. Rosa hypanthium encircling separate achene fruits A rose produces an aggregate of achene fruits that are encompassed within an expanded hypanthium (aka floral tube), which is a structure where basal portions of the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens unite with the receptacle to form a cup- shaped tube. Variations A winged achene, as in maple, is called a samara. Some achenes have accessory hair-like structures that cause them to tumble in the wind in a manner similar to a tumbleweed. This type sometimes is called a tumble fruit or diaspore. An example is Anemone virginiana. A caryopsis or grain is a type of fruit that closely resembles an achene, but differs in that the pericarp is fused to the thin seed coat in the grain. An utricle is like an achene, but the fruit is bladder-like or inflated. Fruits of sedges are sometimes considered achenes although their one-locule ovary is a compound ovary. The fruit of the family Asteraceae is also so similar to an achene that it is often considered to be one, although it derives from a compound inferior ovary (with one locule). A special term for the Asteraceae fruit is cypsela (plural cypselae or cypselas). For example, the white-gray husks of a sunflower \\"seed\\" are the walls of the cypsela fruit. Many cypselas (e.g. dandelion) have calyx tissue attached that functions in biological dispersal of the seed.

A cohort is considered to be the equivalent of a modern military battalion. The cohort replaced the maniple following the reforms attributed to Gaius Marius in 107 BC. Shortly after the military reforms of Marius, and until the middle of the third century AD, ten cohorts (about 5000 men total) made up a Roman legion. The cohorts were named \\"first cohort\\", \\"second cohort\\" etc. The first cohort consisted of experienced legionaries, while the legionaries in the tenth cohort were less experienced. Legionary cohort Originally, a cohort consisted of six centuriae, each commanded by a centurion assisted by junior officers. At various times prior to the reforms, a century might have a hundred men. The cohort had no permanent commander; during combat, the most experienced centurion of the six commanded the entire cohort. In order of seniority, the six centurions were titled hastatus posterior, hastatus prior, princeps posterior, princeps prior, pilus posterior and pilus prior. The first centurion of the first cohort was called primus pilus. During the reforms in the 1st century AD, the command structure and make-up of the legions was established in a formal standard. Standard centuriae consisted of eighty men each. The first cohort was made up of five double-strength centuries (160 men). The centurion of its first century automatically was senior in the legion known as the primus pilus. The primus pilus could be promoted to praefectus castrorum, (camp-prefect). The praefectus castrorum was in charge of the daily administration of a legion. These ranks followed the order of seniority in the earlier manipular legions. Youngest and least experienced units were termed hastati, next principes, and the oldest and most experienced triarii (pilus was a rare alternative name for triarius, the singular of triarii).http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/primipilo/ The reformed legion numbered about five thousand men, including officers, engineers, and cavalry (equites legionis; 120 men plus horses).Goldsworthy, Adrian (2003).

BED is a recently described condition, which was required to distinguish binge eating similar to that seen in bulimia nervosa but without characteristic purging. Individuals who are diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder exhibit similar patterns of compulsive overeating, neurobiological features of dysfunctional cognitive control and food addiction, and biological and environmental risk factors. Some professionals consider BED to be a milder form of bulimia with the two conditions on the same spectrum. Binge eating is one of the most prevalent eating disorders among adults, though there tends to be less media coverage and research about the disorder in comparison to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Signs and symptoms Binge eating is the core symptom of BED; however, not everyone who binge eats has BED. An individual may occasionally binge eat without experiencing many of the negative physical, psychological, or social effects of BED. This example may be considered an eating problem (or not), rather than a disorder. Precisely defining binge eating can be problematic, however binge eating episodes in BED are generally described as having the following potential features: * Eating much faster than normal, perhaps in a short space of time * Eating until feeling uncomfortably full * Eating a large amount when not hungry * Subjective loss of control over how much or what is eaten * Binges may be planned in advance, involving the purchase of special binge foods, and the allocation of specific time for binging, sometimes at night * Eating alone or secretly due to embarrassment over the amount of food consumed * There may be a dazed mental state during the binge * Not being able to remember what was eaten after the binge * Feelings of guilt, shame or disgust following a food binge In contrast to bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not regularly followed by activities intended to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative or enema misuse, or strenuous exercise. BED is characterized more by overeating than dietary restriction and over concern about body shape. Obesity is common in persons with BED, as are depressive features, low self-esteem, stress and boredom.  Causes  As with other eating disorders, binge eating is an \\"expressive disorder\\"—a disorder that is an expression of deeper psychological problems. People who have binge eating disorder have been found to have higher weight bias internalization, which includes low self-esteem, unhealthy eating patterns, and general body dissatisfaction. Binge eating disorder commonly develops as a result or side effect of depression, as it is common for people to turn to comfort foods when they are feeling down. There was resistance to give binge eating disorder the status of a fully fledged eating disorder because many perceived binge eating disorder to be caused by individual choices. Previous research has focused on the relationship between body image and eating disorders, and concludes that disordered eating might be linked to rigid dieting practices. In the majority of cases of anorexia, extreme and inflexible restriction of dietary intake leads at some point to the development of binge eating, weight regain, bulimia nervosa, or a mixed form of eating disorder not otherwise specified. Binge eating may begin when individuals recover from an adoption of rigid eating habits. When under a strict diet that mimics the effects of starvation, the body may be preparing for a new type of behavior pattern, one that consumes a large amount of food in a relatively short period of time. However, other research suggests that binge eating disorder can also be caused by environmental factors and the impact of traumatic events. One study showed that women with binge eating disorder experienced more adverse life events in the year prior to the onset of the development of the disorder, and that binge eating disorder was positively associated with how frequently negative events occur. Additionally, the research found that individuals who had binge eating disorder were more likely to have experienced physical abuse, perceived risk of physical abuse, stress, and body criticism. Other risk factors may include childhood obesity, critical comments about weight, low self-esteem, depression, and physical or sexual abuse in childhood. A few studies have suggested that there could be a genetic component to binge eating disorder, though other studies have shown more ambiguous results. Studies have shown that binge eating tends to run in families and a twin study by Bulik, Sullivan, and Kendler has shown a, \\"moderate heritability for binge eating\\" at 41 percent. More research must be done before any firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the heritability of binge eating disorder. Studies have also shown that eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia reduce coping abilities, which makes it more likely for those suffering to turn to binge eating as a coping strategy. A correlation between dietary restraint and the occurrence of binge eating has been shown in some research. While binge eaters are often believed to be lacking in self-control, the root of such behavior might instead be linked to rigid dieting practices. The relationship between strict dieting and binge eating is characterized by a vicious circle. Binge eating is more likely to occur after dieting, and vice versa. Several forms of dieting include delay in eating (e.g., not eating during the day), restriction of overall calorie intake (e.g., setting calorie limit to 1,000 calories per day), and avoidance of certain types of food (e.g., \\"forbidden\\" food, such as sugar, carbohydrates, etc.) Strict and extreme dieting differs from ordinary dieting. Some evidence suggests the effectiveness of moderate calorie restriction in decreasing binge eating episodes among overweight individuals with binge eating disorder, at least in the short-term. “In the U.S, it is estimated that 3.5% of young women and 30% to 40% of people who seek weight loss treatments, can be clinically diagnosed with binge eating disorder.” Diagnosis International Classification of Diseases The 2017 update to the American version of the ICD-10 includes BED under F50.81. ICD-11 may contain a dedicated entry (6B62), defining BED as frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (once a week or more over a period of several months) which are not regularly followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Previously considered a topic for further research exploration, binge eating disorder was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013. Until 2013, binge eating disorder was categorized as an Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, an umbrella category for eating disorders that don't fall under the categories for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Because it was not a recognized psychiatric disorder in the DSM-IV until 2013, it has been difficult to obtain insurance reimbursement for treatments.5 tips: overcome your tendency to overeat . Paper Boys Club, 2 December 2017. The disorder now has its own category under DSM-5, which outlines the signs and symptoms that must be present to classify a person's behavior as binge eating disorder. Studies have confirmed the high predictive value of these criteria for diagnosing BED. According to DSM-5, the following criteria must be present to make a diagnosis of binge eating disorder. Studies have confirmed the high predictive value of these criteria for diagnosing BED. A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: # Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances. # A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating). B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following: # Eating much more rapidly than normal. # Eating until feeling uncomfortably full. # Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry. # Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating. # Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward. C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present. D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.  Treatment  Counselling and certain medication, such as lisdexamfetamine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs), may help. Some recommend a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the disorder. Counselling Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment has been demonstrated as a more effective form of treatment for BED than behavioral weight loss programs. 50 percent of BED individuals achieve complete remission from binge eating. CBT has also been shown to be an effective method to address self-image issues and psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., depression) associated with the disorder. Recent reviews have concluded that psychological interventions such as psychotherapy and behavioral interventions are more effective than pharmacological interventions for the treatment of binge eating disorder. There is the 12-step Overeaters Anonymous or Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous. Medication Lisdexamfetamine is a USFDA-approved drug that is used for the treatment of moderate to severe binge eating disorder in adults. Three other classes of medications are also used in the treatment of binge eating disorder: antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti-obesity medications. Antidepressant medications of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) have been found to effectively reduce episodes of binge eating and reduce weight. Similarly, anticonvulsant medications such as topiramate and zonisamide may be able to effectively suppress appetite. The long-term effectiveness of medication for binge eating disorder is currently unknown. Trials of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and anti-obesity medications suggest that these medications are superior to placebo in reducing binge eating. Medications are not considered the treatment of choice because psychotherapeutic approaches, such as CBT, are more effective than medications for binge eating disorder. Medications also do not increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy, though some patients may benefit from anticonvulsant and anti-obesity medications, such as phentermine/topiramate, for weight loss. Surgery Bariatric surgery has also been proposed as another approach to treat BED and a recent meta-analysis showed that approximately two-thirds of individuals who seek this type of surgery for weight loss purposes have BED. Bariatric surgery recipients who had BED prior to receiving the surgery tend to have poorer weight-loss outcomes and are more likely to continue to exhibit eating behaviors characteristic of BED.  Lifestyle Interventions  Other treatments for BED include lifestyle interventions like weight training, peer support groups, and investigation of hormonal abnormalities. Prognosis Individuals suffering from BED often have a lower overall quality of life and commonly experience social difficulties. Early behavior change is an accurate prediction of remission of symptoms later. Individuals who have BED commonly have other comorbidities such as major depressive disorder, personality disorder, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, body dysmorphic disorder, kleptomania, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or an anxiety disorder. Individuals may also exhibit varying degrees of panic attacks and a history of attempted suicide. While people of a healthy weight may overeat occasionally, an ongoing habit of consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time may ultimately lead to weight gain and obesity. Bingeing episodes usually include foods that are high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, but low in vitamins and minerals, as these types of foods tend to trigger the greatest chemical and emotional rewards. The main physical health consequences of this type of eating disorder are brought on by the weight gain resulting from calorie-laden bingeing episodes. Mental and emotional consequences of binge eating disorder include social weight stigma and emotional loss of control. Up to 70% of individuals with BED may also be obese, and therefore obesity-associated morbidities such as high blood pressure and coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes mellitus gastrointestinal issues (e.g., gallbladder disease), high cholesterol levels, musculoskeletal problems and obstructive sleep apnea may also be present. Epidemiology The prevalence of BED in the general population is approximately 1-3%. Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in adults. The limited amount of research that has been done on BED shows that rates of binge eating disorder are fairly comparable among men and women. The lifetime prevalence of binge eating disorder has been observed in studies to be 2.0 percent for men and 3.5 percent for women, higher than that of the commonly recognized eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Rates of binge eating disorder have also been found to be similar among black women, white women, and white men, while some studies have shown that binge eating disorder is more common among black women than among white women. Though the research on binge eating disorders tends to be concentrated in North America, the disorder occurs across cultures. In the USA, BED is present in 0.8% of male adults and 1.6% of female adults in a given year. Additionally, 30 to 40 percent of individuals seeking treatment for weight-loss can be diagnosed with binge eating disorder. History The disorder was first described in 1959 by psychiatrist and researcher Albert Stunkard as \\"night eating syndrome\\" (NES). The term \\"binge eating\\" was coined to describe the same bingeing-type eating behavior but without the exclusive nocturnal component. There is generally less research on binge eating disorder in comparison to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. See also *Prader–Willi syndrome  References  Bibliography * Fairburn, C.G. (1995).

Early life and education Thomas Jackson Walker III was born in Edgartown, Massachusetts (on the island of Martha's Vineyard), on 6 August 1919, into a family with long maritime connections—three of his great- grandfathers had been whaling ship captains. After attending schools in Massachusetts and Florida, he attended the Marion Military Institute in Alabama. He then entered the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, with the class of 1939, and while there was stroke of the Academy crew and vice-president of his class for four years. World War II Following his commission as an ensign in June 1939, he joined the cruiser . In August 1941, he was detached for flight training at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Designated Naval Aviator in March 1942, he joined the battleship as Senior Aviator. In this position, Walker spotted shore bombardment during the North African invasion at Safi, French Morocco and Casablanca and later participated in anti-submarine flights over convoys. He was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal \\"for his performance of duty on November 8, 1942, during the bombardment of Safi, French Morocco. Despite heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire he kept his ship supplied with accurate and timely reports without which the effect of the bombardment may not have been so effectively executed....\\" Returning to the United States in 1943, he attended the Post Graduate School at Annapolis, where he completed the course in Aviation Ordnance in December 1944. He next reported to the Fire Control Desk in the Bureau of Aeronautics and remained there until July 1945. He was then assigned as Prospective Bomb Commander for the fourth atomic bomb at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. That bomb was never dropped due to the cessation of hostilities in August 1945. Post-war career Immediately after World War II, Walker served as Commanding Officer of Fighter Squadrons 17, 5-B and 61, during which time he was embarked with his respective squadrons aboard the newly commissioned carriers and . After service as Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Special Weapons Facility at the Sandia base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. In July 1951, he assumed command of Air Development Squadron 5. A group engaged in developing tactics for the delivery of special weapons from light aircraft at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California. In 1955 he became a student at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington, D.C. Walker then began his association with the Polaris missile program as head of the Test Branch of the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program. He was temporarily assigned as Assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, working on a classified project until June 1957. He then spent a year as Commanding Officer of the Fleet All- Weather Training Unit where he was concerned with training of carrier pilots for all weather flying and in the air defense of southern California. In July 1958 Walker was back in Washington working with the Polaris as head of Ship Operations and Test Branch and Systems Development Analysis Chief. For his work with Polaris Captain Walker received the Navy Commendation Medal with Citation, which reads in part, \\"Captain Walker carried out his responsibilities with outstanding leadership and resourcefulness. Through his untiring efforts and high level of technical skill, he made a major contribution to the success of the Fleet Ballistic Missile System....\\" In April 1960 Walker assumed his first ship command, the ammunition ship . Six months later he was ordered detached from Nitro as Prospective Commanding Officer of , which was under construction at the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York. Walker assumed command of Constellation on 27 October 1961. On 9 November 1963, Walker was promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half) and was relieved of command of Constellation by Captain Stanley W. \\"Swede\\" Vejesta.

The American Humanist Association was founded in 1941 and currently provides legal assistance to defend the constitutional rights of secular and religious minorities, actively lobbies Congress on church-state separation and other issues, and maintains a grassroots network of 250 local affiliates and chapters that engage in social activism, philosophical discussion and community-building events. The AHA has several publications, including the bi-monthly magazine The Humanist, a quarterly newsletter Free Mind, a peer-reviewed semi-annual scholastic journal Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism, and a daily online news site TheHumanist.com.List of Publications americanhumanist.org (Retrieved 2011-10-01) The organisation states that it has over 34,000 members. Background In 1927 an organization called the \\"Humanist Fellowship\\" began at a gathering in Chicago. In 1928 the Fellowship started publishing the New Humanist magazine with H.G. Creel as first editor. The New Humanist was published from 1928 to 1936. By 1935 the Humanist Fellowship had become the \\"Humanist Press Association\\", the first national association of humanism in the United States.Harris, Mark W., The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism, Scarecrow Press, 2009 The first Humanist Manifesto was issued by a conference held at the University of Chicago in 1933. Signatories included the philosopher John Dewey, but the majority were ministers (chiefly Unitarian) and theologians. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses reason, ethics, and social and economic justice.Walter, Nicolas. Humanism: What's in the Word? (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p.43. In July 1939 a group of Quakers, inspired by the 1933 Humanist Manifesto, incorporated under the state laws of California the Humanist Society of Friends as a religious, educational, charitable nonprofit organization authorized to issue charters anywhere in the world and to train and ordain its own ministry. Upon ordination these ministers were then accorded the same rights and privileges granted by law to priests, ministers, and rabbis of traditional theistic religions. History Curtis Reese was a leader in the 1941 reorganization and incorporation of the \\"Humanist Press Association\\" as the American Humanist Association. Along with its reorganization, the AHA began printing The Humanist magazine. The AHA was originally headquartered in Yellow Springs, Ohio, then San Francisco, California, and in 1978 Amherst, New York. Subsequently, the AHA moved to Washington, D.C.. In 1952 the AHA became a founding member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The AHA was the first national membership organization to support abortion rights. Around the same time, the AHA joined hands with the American Ethical Union (AEU) to help establish the rights of nontheistic conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. This time also saw Humanists involved in the creation of the first nationwide memorial societies, giving people broader access to cheaper alternatives than the traditional burial. In the late 1960s the AHA also secured a religious tax exemption in support of its celebrant program, allowing Humanist celebrants to legally officiate at weddings, perform chaplaincy functions, and in other ways enjoy the same rights as traditional clergy. In 1991 the AHA took control of the Humanist Society, a religious Humanist organization that now runs the celebrant program. Since 1991 the organization has worked as an adjunct to the American Humanist Association to certify qualified members to serve in this special capacity as ministers. The Humanist Society's ministry prepares Humanist Celebrants to lead ceremonial observances After this transfer, the AHA commenced the process of jettisoning its religious tax exemption and resumed its exclusively educational status. Today the AHA is recognized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3), publicly supported educational organization. Membership numbers are disputed, but Djupe and Olson place it as \\"definitely fewer than 50,000.\\"Djupe, Paul A. and Olsen, Laura R., \\"American Humanist Association\\", Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics\\", Infobase Publishing, 2014 The AHA has over 575,000 followers on Facebook and over 42,000 followers on Twitter. Adjuncts and affiliates The AHA is the supervising organization for various Humanist affiliates and adjunct organizations.  Black Humanist Alliance  The Black Humanist Alliance of the American Humanist Association was founded in 2016 as a pillar of its new \\"Initiatives for Social Justice.\\" Like the Feminist Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, the Black Humanist Alliance uses an intersectional approach to addressing issues facing the Black community. As its mission states, the BHA \\"concern ourselves with confronting expressions of religious hegemony in public policy,\\" but is \\"also devoted to confronting social, economic, and political deprivations that disproportionately impact Black America due to centuries of culturally ingrained prejudices.\\" Feminist Humanist Alliance The Feminist Humanist Alliance (formerly the Feminist Caucus) of the American Humanist Association was established in 1977 as a coalition of women and men within the AHA to work toward the advancement of women's rights and equality between the sexes in all aspects of society. Originally called the Women's Caucus, the new name was adopted in 1985 as more representative of all the members of the caucus and of the caucus' goals. Over the years, members of the Caucus have advocated for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and participated in various public demonstrations, including marches for women's and civil rights. In 1982, the Caucus established its annual Humanist Heroine Award, with the initial award being presented to Sonia Johnson. Others receiving the awards have included Tish Sommers, Christine Craft, and Fran Hosken. In 2012 the Caucus declared it would be organizing around two principal efforts: \\"Refocusing on passing the ERA\\" and \\"Promoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\" In 2016, the Feminist Caucus reorganized as the Feminist Humanist Alliance as a component of their larger \\"Initiatives for Social Justice.\\" As stated on its website, the \\"refinement in vision\\" emphasized \\"FHA's more active partnership with outreach programs and social justice campaigns with distinctly inclusive feminist objectives.\\" Its current goal is to provide a \\"movement powered by and for women, transpeople, and genderqueer people to fight for social justice. We are united to create inclusive and diverse spaces for activists and allies on the local and national level.\\"  LGBTQ Humanist Alliance  The LGBTQ Humanist Alliance (formerly LGBT Humanist Council) of the American Humanist Association is committed to advancing equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their families. The alliance \\"seeks to cultivate safe and affirming communities, promote humanist values, and achieve full equality and social liberation of LGBTQ persons.\\" Paralleling the Black Humanist Alliance and the Feminist Humanist Alliance, the Council reformed in 2016 as the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance as a larger part of the AHA's \\"Initiatives for Social Justice.\\" Disaster Recovery In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and Foundation Beyond Belief (FBB) merged their respective charitable programs Humanist Charities (established in 2005) and Humanist Crisis Response (established in 2011). AHA's Executive Director Roy Speckhardt commented that, “This merger is a positive move that will grow the relief efforts of the humanist community. The end result will be more money directed to charitable activities, dispelling the false claim that nonbelievers don’t give to charity.” Now Foundation Beyond Belief's Disaster Recovery program, this effort serves as a focal point for the humanist response to major natural disasters and complex humanitarian crises all over the world. The program coordinates financial support as well as trained humanist volunteers to help impacted communities. The Disaster Recovery program is sustained through the ongoing partnership between FBB and AHA, and ensures that our community's efforts are centralized and efficient. Between 2014–2018, Humanist Disaster Recovery has raised over $250,000 for victims of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, Refugee Children of the U.S. Border, Tropical Cyclone Sam, and the Nepal and Ecuadoran Earthquakes, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In addition to grants for recovery efforts, volunteers have also helped to rebuild homes and schools in the following locations: Columbia, South Carolina after the effects of Hurricane Joaquin, in Denham Springs, Louisiana; and in Houston, Texas after the flooding from Hurricane Harvey. Appignani Humanist Legal Center Official logo of the AHLCThe Association launched the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) in 2006 to ensure that humanists' constitutional rights are represented in court. Through amicus activity, litigation, and legal advocacy, a team of cooperating lawyers, including Jim McCollum, Wendy Kaminer, and Michael Newdow, provide legal assistance by challenging perceived violations of the Establishment Clause. * The AHLC's first independent litigation was filed on November 29, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Attorney James Hurley, the AHLC lawyer serving as lead counsel, filed suit against the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections on behalf of Plaintiff Jerry Rabinowitz, whose polling place was a church in Delray Beach, Florida. The church featured numerous religious symbols, including signs exhorting people to “Make a Difference with God” and anti-abortion posters, which the AHLC claimed demonstrated a violation of the Establishment Clause. In the voting area itself, \\"Rabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view, both surrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. He took photographs that will be entered in evidence.\\" U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ruled that Jerry Rabinowitz did not have standing to challenge the placement of polling sites in churches, and dismissed the case. *In February 2014, AHA brought suit to force the removal of the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a war memorial honoring 49 residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, who died in World War I. AHA represented the plaintiffs, Mr. Lowe, who drives by the memorial \\"about once a month\\" and Fred Edwords, former AHA Executive director. AHA argued that the presence of a Christian religious symbol on public property violates the First Amendment clause prohibiting government from establishing a religion. Town officials feel the monument to have historic and patriotic significant to local residents. A member of the local American Legion Post said, \\"I mean, to me, it's like they're slapping the veterans in the face. I mean, that's a tribute to the veterans, and for some reason, I have no idea what they have against veterans. I mean, if it wasn't for us veterans they wouldn't have the right to do what they're trying to do.\\" *In March 2014, a Southern California woman reluctantly removed a roadside memorial from near a freeway ramp where her 19-year-old son was killed after the AHA contacted the city council calling the cross on city- owned property a \\"serious constitutional violation\\". *AHLC represented an atheist family who claimed that the equal rights amendment of the Massachusetts constitution prohibits mandatory daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance because the anthem contains the phrase “under God.” In November 2012 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court permitted a direct appeal with oral arguments set for early 20 but . in May 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the daily recitation of the phrase “under god” in the US Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the Massachusetts Constitution. *In February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit challenging the Pledge of Allegiance, ruling that \\"...the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.\\" In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, \\"Under (the association members') reasoning, the very constitution under which (the members) seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deem unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which (association members) do not and cannot advance here.\\" Advertising campaigns 2008 Bus CampaignThe American Humanist Association has received media attention for its various advertising campaigns; in 2010, the AHA's campaign was said to be the more expensive than similar ad campaigns from the American Atheists and Freedom From Religion Foundation.Laurie Goodstein, Atheist Groups Promote a Holiday Message: Join Us , New York Times (November 9, 2010). In 2008 it ran ads on buses in Washington, D.C. that proclaimed \\"Why believe in a god? Just be good for goodness' sake\\", and since 2009 the organization has paid for billboard advertisements nationwide. One such billboard, which stated \\"No God...No Problem\\" was repeatedly vandalized. In 2010 it launched another ad campaign promoting Humanism, which The New York Times said was the \\"first (atheist campaign) to include spots on television and cable\\" and was described by CNN as the \\"largest, most extensive advertising campaign ever by a godless organization\\". The campaign featured violent or sexist quotes from holy books, contrasted with quotes from humanist thinkers, including physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Richard Dawkins, , and was largely underwritten by Todd Stiefel, a retired pharmaceutical company executive. In late 2011 it launched a holiday billboard campaign, placing advertisements in 7 different cities: Kearny, New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Cranston, Rhode Island; Bastrop, Louisiana; Oregon City, Oregon; College Station, Texas and Rochester Hills, Michigan\\", cities where AHA stated \\"atheists have experienced discrimination due to their lack of belief in a traditional god\\". The organization spent more than $200,000 on their campaign which included a billboard reading \\"Yes, Virginia, there is no god.\\" In November 2012, the AHA launched a national ad campaign to promote a new website, KidsWithoutGod.com, with ads using the slogans \\"I'm getting a bit old for imaginary friends\\" and \\"You're Not The Only One.\\" The campaign included bus advertising in Washington, DC, a billboard in Moscow, Idaho, and online ads on the family of websites run by Cheezburger and Pandora Radio, as well as Facebook, Reddit, Google, and YouTube. Ads were turned down because of their content by Disney, Time for Kids and National Geographic Kids. National Day of Reason The National Day of Reason was created by the American Humanist Association and the Washington Area Secular Humanists in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for secularists, the National Day of Reason was created in response to the unconstitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. According to the organizers of the event, the National Day of Prayer \\"violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it asks federal, state, and local government entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies\\". Several organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized food drives and blood donations, while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings. Other organizations, such as the Oklahoma Atheists and the Minnesota Atheists, have organized local secular celebrations as alternatives to the National Day of Prayer.Minnesota Atheists Day of Reason Additionally, many individuals affiliated with these atheistic groups choose to protest the official National Day of Prayer.  Reason Rally  In 2012, the American Humanist Association co-sponsored the Reason Rally, a national gathering of \\"humanists, atheists, freethinkers and nonbelievers from across the United States and abroad\\" in Washington, D.C. The rally, held on the National Mall, had speakers such as Richard Dawkins, James Randi, Adam Savage, and student activist Jessica Ahlqvist. . According to the Huffington Post, the event's attendance was between 8,000–10,000 while the Atlantic reported nearly 20,000. The AHA also co-sponsored the 2016 Reason Rally at the Lincoln Memorial.  Famous awardees  The American Humanist Association has named a \\"Humanist of the Year\\" annually since 1953. It has also granted other honors to numerous leading figures, including Salman Rushdie (Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism 2007), Oliver Stone (Humanist Arts Award, 1996), Katharine Hepburn (Humanist Arts Award 1985), John Dewey (Humanist Pioneer Award, 1954), Jack Kevorkian (Humanist Hero Award, 1996) and Vashti McCollum (Distinguished Service Award, 1991).

Notification of the treaty to the city of Seville, March 14 1480. 1st page. The Treaty of Alcáçovas (also known as Treaty or Peace of Alcáçovas-Toledo) was signed on 4 September 1479 between the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon on one side and Afonso V and his son, Prince John of Portugal, on the other side. It put an end to the War of the Castilian Succession, which ended with a victory of the Castilians on land↓ Bailey W. Diffie and George D. Winius “In a war in which the Castilians were victorious on land and the Portuguese at sea, ...” in Foundations of the Portuguese empire 1415–1580, volume I, University of Minnesota Press, 1985, p.152. and a Portuguese victory on the sea.↓ Historian Malyn Newitt: “All things considered, it is not surprising that the Portuguese emerged victorious from this first maritime colonial war. They were far better organised than the Castilians, were able to raise money for the preparation and supply of their fleets and had clear central direction from ... [Prince] John.” In A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400–1668, Routledge, New York, 2005, p.39,40. The four peace treaties signed at Alcáçovas reflected that outcome: Isabella was recognized as Queen of Castile while Portugal reached hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean. The treaty intended to regulate: *The renunciation of Afonso V and Castilian Monarchs to the Castilian throne and Portuguese throne, respectively *The division of the Atlantic Ocean and overseas territories into two zones of influence *The destiny of Juana de Trastámara *The contract of marriage between Isabella, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, with Afonso, heir of Prince John.

In the subsequent civil war, Afonso V of Portugal married Juana and invaded Castile (May 1475), defending her rights.European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648, p.33, Washington, D.C., Frances Gardiner Davenport, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1917–37 – Google Books.

The main events of this war were the indecisive↓ British historian Ian Robertson: “Civil war, however, was immediately provoked by the partisans of \\"la Beltraneja\\", whose claim was supported by the king of Portugal, but after the indecisive battle of Toro (1476) the Portuguese withdrew leaving Fernando and Isabel firmly established” in Spain, the mainland, E.

Treaty outcomes *Juana de Trastamara and Afonso V waived their rights to the Castilian throne in favour of the Catholic Monarchs, who gave up their claims over the throne of Portugal. *There was a sharing of the Atlantic territories between both countries and a delimitation of the respective spheres of influence. * With the exception of the Canary Islands, all territories and shores disputed between Portugal and Castile stayed under Portuguese control; Guinea with its gold mines, Madeira (discovered in 1419), the Azores (discovered about 1427) and Cape Verde (discovered about 1456). Portugal also won the exclusive right of conquering the Kingdom of Fez. * Castile's rights over the Canary Islands were recognised while Portugal won the exclusive right of navigating, conquering and trading in all the Atlantic Ocean south of the Canary Islands. Thus, Portugal attained hegemony in the Atlantic not only for its known territories but also for those discovered in the future. Castile was restricted to the Canaries. *Portugal gained a war compensation of 106,676 dobles of gold in the form of Isabella's dowry. *Both infants (Isabella and Afonso) stayed in Portugal under the regiment of Tercerias, at the village of Moura, waiting for the appropriate age. The Catholic Monarchs were responsible for all costs of maintaining the Tercerias. *Juana had to choose between staying in Portugal and entering a religious order or marrying Prince Juan, son of the Catholic Monarchs: she chose the former. *The Castilian supporters of Juana and Afonso were pardoned. Possessions Afonso V of Portugal This treaty, ratified later by the Papal bull Aeterni regis in 1481, essentially gave the Portuguese free rein to continue their exploration along the African coast while guaranteeing Castilian sovereignty in the Canaries. It also prohibited Castilians from sailing to the Portuguese possessions without Portuguese licence. The Treaty of Alcáçovas, establishing Castilian and Portuguese spheres of control in the Atlantic, settled a period of open hostility, but it also laid the basis for future claims and conflict. Portugal's rival Castile had been somewhat slower than its neighbour to begin exploring the Atlantic, and it was not until late in the fifteenth century that Castilian sailors began to compete with their Iberian neighbours. The first contest was for control of the Canary Islands, which Castile won. It was not until the union of Aragon and Castile and the completion of the Reconquista that the larger country became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492, the joint rulers of the country decided to fund Christopher Columbus' expedition that they hoped would bypass Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, and instead, reach Asia by travelling west over the Atlantic. Aftermath The Treaty of Alcáçovas can be considered a landmark in the history of colonialism. It is one of the first international documents formally outlining the principle that European powers are empowered to divide the rest of the world into \\"spheres of influence\\" and colonise the territories located within such spheres, and that any indigenous peoples living there need not be asked for consent. This remained a generally accepted principle in the ideology and practice of European powers up to the 20th century decolonization. The Treaty of Alcáçovas could be regarded as the ancestor of many later international treaties and instruments based on the same basic principle. These include the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which further codified the positions of Spain and Portugal in world exploration, and the resolutions of the 1884 Conference of Berlin, four centuries later, which in much the same way divided Africa into colonial spheres of influence.

He had seven fights in 1993, including one against future NABO champion and world title challenger Jesse Magana. Ayala won all seven of those bouts, four by knockout. Magana was knocked out in the fourth round, after which Ayala went on to score wins over prospects Evgeny Novoselov and George Acevedo. In 1994, he won all four of his bouts, including one over veteran Lee Cargle. Cargle was knocked out by Ayala in round three. 1995 was a productive year for Ayala, who won all five of his fights, including his first regional championship bout. By defeating Mike Espinoza by knockout in three rounds at the Fort Worth Convention Center, Ayala claimed the NABF bantamweight title. He defended it twice before the end of the year, beating Mario Diaz and Sergio Millan, both by decision in 12 rounds. Ayala only had two fights in 1996, both of them successful defenses of his NABF title. In the first, he knocked out Roland Gomez in seven rounds but was forced to take a seven-month layoff due to a broken Hand. Returning to the ring in September, Ayala defeated Ivan Alvarez by decision in twelve to retain the NABF bantamweight title. He began 1997 by defeating Cuauhtemoc Gomez by decision in twelve, once again retaining his belt as the headliner at the Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Ayala won three more bouts that year, defeating heavy-handed puncher Nestor Lopez in a co-main event feature on an HBO pay-per-view card, headlining at The Orleans in Paradise, Nevada with a fifth-round knockout over Roberto Lopez to retain the NABF belt. This was followed by another HBO PPV appearance, in which Ayala won a unanimous decision against Ricardo Medina. At the beginning of 1998, Ayala was very close to a world championship bout. Fighting two more bouts, he received his first chance at a world title by becoming the mandatory contender for the WBC belt. Ayala then traveled to Japan to challenge WBC bantamweight champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi on August 23. Ayala lost the fight by a sixth-round technical decision when the fight was stopped due to a cut. Tatsuyoshi came out fast in the opening rounds, but Ayala rallied back to win the fifth and sixth rounds unanimously. During the fight, an accidental clash of heads caused a cut and Ayala was docked 2 points. The fight was stopped in round seven due to the severity of the cut, sending the decision to the scorecards and thereby handing victory to Tatsuyoshi.http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id;=491 WBA bantamweight title After a win against Ivan Salazar, Ayala began 1999 by beating David Vazquez by decision in ten.

On October 7, 2000, Ayala and Tapia met in a rematch for the vacant IBA featherweight title, at a catchweight of 124 lbs. As with the first fight, this took place on Showtime. Due to Tapia being unable to make the bantamweight limit, Ayala's WBA bantamweight title was not at stake. Ayala defeated Tapia once again by a twelve-round unanimous decision, a result which was seen as controversial. On March 30, 2001, Ayala recovered from a fourth-round knockdown to retain his WBA bantamweight title with a twelve-round decision against Hugo Dianzo in an ESPN telecast bout. Ayala then vacated his title in order to move up in weight.

The cardholder is obligated to repay the debt to the card issuer in full by the due date, usually on a monthly basis, or be subject to late fees and restrictions on further card use. Charge cards are typically issued without spending limits, but credit cards usually have a specified credit limit that the cardholder may not exceed. Most charge cards are business and corporate charge cards, not personal charge cards. Charge cards are issued to customers with good or excellent credit score.  History  In 1914, Western Union opened the first charge account for its customers and provided them with a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store charge accounts for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, Diners Club began opening charge accounts with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card could be used in a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store's cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards. In Europe, the MasterCard-affiliated Maestro brand (which is a debit card rather than a charge card) replaced the European Eurocheque brand for payment cards in 2002. Many Eurocheque cards, particularly in such countries as Austria and Germany, were charge cards branded with the Eurocheque logo. In addition, the European Eurocard, issued as the competitor for American Express was, and in some countries (such as the Nordic countries) still is, a charge card. Therefore, the majority of MasterCards in these countries still are charge cards. Visa charge cards are also available in Europe.  Operation  The user of the charge card has to pay the balance of their account at the end of each month and the charge card company, unlike a credit card, does not charge interest. A charge card company's main source of revenue is the merchant fee, which is a percentage of the transaction value which typically ranges between 1 and 4%, plus an interchange or minimum fee. Many charge cards have the option for users to pay for some purchases over time. American Express charge card customers, for instance, can enroll in the Extended Payment Option (internally referred to as ExPO) to be able to pay for purchases over $200 over time,American Express Extended Payment Option or in Sign & Travel to be able to pay for eligible travel-related expenses over time.American Express Sign & Travel Most charge cards also have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit (NPSL). While consumers often take NPSL to mean that their cards are without limits, NPSL really means that a card's limit changes, often from month-to- month, based on factors such as consumer charging and payment history as well overall economic trends. According to a CardHub.com NPSL study, the way NPSL charge cards are reported to the major credit bureaus varies by issuer and can lead to artificial increases in credit utilization, thereby lowering one's FICO Score. Governments and large businesses often use charge cards to pay for and keep track of expenses related to official business; these are often referred to as purchasing cards. Many retailers and banks issue charge cards to customers. Some American Express and Diners Club cards are charge cards, rather than credit or debit cards such as VISA and MasterCard. The SELECT Black Card and the Coutts Silk Charge Card are charge cards.

The series revolves around Eric Feeble, a middle class man who is always stressed because of his family, work, co-workers, etc. The show ran for two series in the UK, although the redubbed American version broadcast on NBC only lasted for 1 series. Overview 40-year-old Eric Feeble is still upset over his divorce two years before. He lives in a middle-class London house and is always kept under extreme amounts of pressure and stress from all aspects of life, which is represented by a throbbing vein in his temple. His two children, Brian and Claire, plague him with fear and worry daily. Claire is a frail 6-year-old who is allergic to virtually everything, including wheat, ponies, and spices; 10-year-old Brian has learning problems and has been kept back three straight years in school, and has an oral fixation and pica. The family's au pair housekeeper, Maria, is an 18-year-old Portuguese woman with a serious drinking problem; despite Eric's frequent attempts to keep her under control and focused, she stays passed-out drunk for hours at a time. His former wife Liz left him for a Buddhist but phones him up incessantly, which merely adds to his stress level. The next-door neighbours, the wealthy, successful, snobbish Perfect family, provide him a constant and painful view of what his life could have been. Eric's workplace is absolutely no escape from his everyday problems. His boss, Paul Power (known as PP), is loud, rude and demanding; he has demoted Eric from Assistant Manager to a low-level clerk in an office sandwiched between the janitor's closet and the men's toilets. His secretary Alison is completely useless, spending all her \\"working hours\\" in personal phone calls and shrilling rudely at Eric when he requests her attention. At the end of almost every episode, as the climax of events cause Eric's stress to reach breaking point, the throbbing vein emerges from his temple and wraps itself around his neck, strangling him.  Characters   Main  *Eric Feeble – Stressed out divorced father of two children. Eric is a kind, well-meaning man who loves his children. Although bitter and sarcastic about many aspects of his life, Eric genuinely tries to make the best out of situation and deeply loves his children, going to great lengths to make them proud. However, he normally fails due to no fault of his own, and the rare times he actually does well, something always happens to ruin it. *Claire Feeble – Daughter of Eric; allergic to just about everything, but an intelligent, curious, playful little girl. Her allergies require her to eat special regulation food, but she is always sneaking ordinary food which immediately swells her up. *Brian Feeble – Son of Eric; has been held back in school for 3 years straight. He has pica and as a result, is always putting strange things in his mouth. *Maria Gonzalez – The Feeble family's punk-looking live-in au pair; she is Portuguese and always drunk or hungover.

De l'affaire Dreyfus à nos jours (The Intellectuals in France: From the Dreyfus Affair to Our Days), Paris: Armand Colin, 2002, p. 10. As a status class, the intelligentsia includes artists, teachers and academics, writers, and the literary hommes de lettres.Williams, Raymond. Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1983) Rev. Ed., p. 170. Individual members of the intelligentsia are known as intellectuals. The intelligentsia status class arose in the late 18th century, in Russian- controlled Poland, during the age of Partitions (1772–95). In the 19th century, the Polish intellectual Bronisław Trentowski coined the term intelligentcja (intellectuals) to identify and describe the educated and professionally active social stratum of the patriotic bourgeoisie who could be the cultural leaders of Poland, then under the authoritarian régime of Russian Tsarist autocracy, from the late 18th-century to the early 20th century.Billington, James H. Fire in the Minds of Men (0000), p. 231. In Russia, before the Bolshevik Revolution (1917), the term intelligentsiya described the status class of educated people whose cultural capital (schooling, education, enlightenment) allowed them to assume practical political leadership.Oxford English Dictionary, p. 1387. In practice, the status and social function of the intelligentsia varied by society. In Eastern Europe, intellectuals were deprived of political influence and access to the effective levers of economic development; the intelligentsia were at the functional periphery of their societies. In contrast, in Western Europe, especially in Germany and Great Britain, the Bildungsbürgertum (cultured bourgeoisie) and the British professions had defined roles as public intellectuals in their societies. European history The philosopher Karol Libelt identified the intelligentsia status class as associated with social progress, yet willing to work for the State. The Russian writer Pyotr Boborykin defined the intelligentsia as the managers of a society and as the creators of high culture. In Europe the intelligentsia existed as a status class (social stratum) even before intelligentsia, the term, was coined in the 19th century. As people whose professions placed them (physically, economically, and socially) outside the traditional places and functions of the town-and-country monarchic social-classes (royalty, aristocracy, bourgeoisie) of the time, the intelligentsia were an urban social-class. In their status class functions, the intellectuals had involvement with the cultural development of cities, the dissemination of printed knowledge (books, texts, newspapers), and the economic development of rental-housing (the tenement house) for the teacher, the journalist, and the civil servant. In his 2008 work The Rise of the Intelligentsia, 1750–1831, Maciej Janowski identified the intelligentsia as intellectual servants to the modern State, to the degree that their state-service policies decreased social backwardness and political repression in partitioned Poland. The Polish philosopher Karol Libelt coined the term inteligencja in his publication of O miłości ojczyzny (On Love of the Fatherland) in 1844. In the Polish language, the popular understanding of the word inteligencja is close to Libelt's definition, which saw the inteligencja status-class as the well-educated people of society, who undertake to provide moral leadership, as scholars, teachers, lawyers, engineers et al.; the intelligentsia \\"guide for the reason of their higher enlightenment.\\" In the 1860s, the writer Pyotr Boborykin popularised the term intelligentsiya () in Imperial Russia; he claimed to have originated the concept of the intelligentsia as a social stratum.С.

In 2006, Dr Vitaly Tepikin identified the characteristics of the group Tepikin, Vitaly (2006), Culture and intelligentsia. Ivanovo: Ivanovo University Press, p. 41-42. comprising the intelligentsia as follows: #the advanced for its time moral ideals, sensitivity to the neighbor, tact and gentleness in manifestations; #active mental work and continuous self-education; #patriotism, based on faith in his people and selfless, inexhaustible love for small and big motherland; #the creative tirelessness of all the units of the intelligentsia (and not just the artistic part of it, as many people consider it), asceticism; #independence, the desire for freedom of expression and finding it yourself; #a critical attitude to the current government, the condemnation of any manifestations of injustice, anti-humanism, anti-democracy; #loyalty to one's convictions prompted by conscience under the most difficult conditions and even a tendency to self-denial; #ambiguous perception of reality, which leads to political fluctuations, and sometimes – and the manifestation of conservatism; #an aggravated sense of resentment due to lack of implementation (real or apparent), which sometimes leads to the extreme closeness of the intellectual; #periodic misunderstanding, rejection of each other by representatives of various groups of the intelligentsia, as well as a single squad, which is caused by bouts of selfishness and impulsivity (most often characteristic of artistic intelligentsia). Poland 19th century The surgeon Ludwik Rydygier and his assistants. (Portrait by Leon Wyczółkowski) In 1844 Poland, the term intelligencja, identifying the intellectuals of society, first was used by the philosopher Karol Libelt, which he described as a status class of people characterised by intellect and Polish nationalism; qualities of mind, character, and spirit that made them natural leaders of the modern Polish nation. That the intelligentsia were aware of their social status and of their duties to society: Educating the youth with the nationalist objective to restore the Republic of Poland; preserving the Polish language; and love of the Fatherland. Nonetheless, the writers Stanisław Brzozowski and Tadeusz Boy- ŻeleńskiBoy-Żeleński, T. (1932) Nasi okupanci  Our Occupants. criticised Libelt's ideological and messianic representation of a Polish republic, because it originated from the social traditionalism and reactionary conservatism that pervade the culture of Poland, and so impede socio-economic progress. Consequent to the Imperial Prussian, Austrian, Swedish and Russian Partitions of Poland, the imposition of Tsarist cultural hegemony caused many of the political and cultural élites to participate in the Great Emigration (1831–70). WWII After the Invasion of Poland (1 September 1939), by Nazi Germany and the Soviet union, in occupied Poland each side proceeded to eliminate any possible resistance leader. In their part of occupied Poland, the Nazis began the Second World War (1939–45) with the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia, by way of the military operations of the Special Prosecution Book-Poland, the German AB-Aktion in Poland, the Intelligenzaktion, and the Intelligenzaktion Pommern. In their part of occupied Poland, the Soviet Union proceeded with the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia with operations such as the Katyn massacre (1940), during which university professors, physicians, lawyers, engineers, teachers, writers and journalists were murdered. Russia Imperial era Vissarion Belinsky The Russian intelligentsiya also was a mixture of messianism and intellectual élitism, which the philosopher Isaiah Berlin described as follows: \\"The phenomenon, itself, with its historical and literally revolutionary consequences, is, I suppose, the largest, single Russian contribution to social change in the world. The concept of intelligentsia must not be confused with the notion of intellectuals. Its members thought of themselves as united, by something more than mere interest in ideas; they conceived themselves as being a dedicated order, almost a secular priesthood, devoted to the spreading of a specific attitude to life.\\"Berlin, Isaiah. A Remarkable decade. Published in: Russian Thinkers, Penguin UK, 2013, The Idea of Progress, which originated in Western Europe during the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, became the principal concern of the intelligentsia by the mid-19th century; thus, progress social movements, such as the Narodniks, mostly consisted of intellectuals. The Russian philosopher Sergei Bulgakov said that the Russian intelligentsia was the creation of Peter, that they were the \\"window to Europe through which the Western air comes to us, vivifying and toxic at the same time.\\" Moreover, Bulgakov also said that the literary critic of Westernization, Vissarion Belinsky was the spiritual father of the Russian intelligentsia.Сергей Булгаков. Героизм и подвижничество. Вехи (сборник статей о русской интеллигенции), 1909 In 1860, there were 20,000 professionals in Russia and 85,000 by 1900. Originally composed of educated nobles, the intelligentsia became dominated by raznochintsy (classless people) after 1861. In 1833, 78.9 per cent of secondary-school students were children of nobles and bureaucrats, by 1885 they were 49.1 per cent of such students. The proportion of commoners increased from 19.0 to 43.8 per cent, and the remaining percentage were the children of priests.Richard Pipes, Russia Under the Old Regime, p. 262. In fear of an educated proletariat, Tsar Nicholas I limited the number of university students to 3,000 per year, yet there were 25,000 students, by 1894. Similarly the number of periodicals increased from 15 in 1855 to 140 periodical publications in 1885.Pipes, Richard. Russia Under the Old Regime p. 264. The \\"third element\\" were professionals hired by zemstva. By 1900, there were 47,000 of them, most were liberal radicals. Although Tsar Peter the Great introduced the Idea of Progress to Russia, by the 19th century, the Tsars did not recognize \\"progress\\" as a legitimate aim of the state, to the degree that Nicholas II said \\"How repulsive I find that word\\" and wished it removed from the Russian language.Ascher, Abraham. The Revolution of 1905: Russia in Disarray, p. 15. Bolshevik perspective In Russia, the Bolsheviks did not consider the status class of the intelligentsiya to be a true social class, as defined in Marxist philosophy. In that time, the Bolsheviks used the Russian word prosloyka (stratum) to identify and define the intelligentsia as a separating layer without an inherent class character. In the creation of post- monarchic Russia, Lenin was firmly critical of the class character of the intelligentsia, commending the growth of \\"the intellectual forces of the workers and the peasants\\" will depose the \\"bourgeoisie and their accomplices, intelligents, lackeys of capital who think that they are brain of the nation. In fact it is not brain, but dung\\". (На деле это не мозг, а говно)Lenin, V. I. (1915). Letter from Lenin to Gorky. https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/g2aleks.html The Russian Revolution of 1917 divided the intelligentsia and the social classes of Tsarist Russia. Some Russians emigrated, the political reactionaries joined the right-wing White movement for counter-revolution, some became Bolsheviks, and some remained in Russia and participated in the political system of the USSR. In reorganizing Russian society, the Bolsheviks rid themselves, by fair and foul means, of class enemies, by way of deportation on Philosophers' ships, forced labor in the gulag, and summary execution. The members of the Tsarist-era intelligentsia who remained in Bolshevik Russia (the USSR) were proletarianized. Although the Bolsheviks recognized the managerial importance of the intelligentsia to the future of Soviet Russia, the bourgeois origin of this stratum gave reason for distrust of their ideological commitment to Marxist philosophy. Soviet Union In the late Soviet Union the term \\"intelligentsia\\" acquired a formal definition of mental and cultural workers. There were subcategories of \\"scientific-technical intelligentsia\\" (научно- техническая интеллигенция) and \\"creative intelligentsia\\" (творческая интеллигенция). Between 1917 and 1941, there was a massive increase in the number of engineering graduates: from 15,000 to over 250,000. Post-Soviet period In the post-Soviet period, the members of the former Soviet intelligentsia have displayed diverging attitudes towards the communist regime. While the older generation of intelligentsia has attempted to frame themselves as victims, the younger generation, who were in their 30s when the Soviet Union collapsed, has not allocated so much space for the repressive experience in their self-narratives.See Kaprans, M. (2010) \\"Retrospective Anchoring of the Soviet Repressive System: the Autobiographies of the Latvian Intelligentsia.\\" In Starck, K. (ed.) Between Fear and Freedom: Cultural Representations of the Cold War. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. P. 193–206. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the popularity and influence of the intelligentsia has significantly declined. Therefore, it is typical for the post-Soviet intelligentsia to feel nostalgic for the last years of the Soviet Union (perestroika), which they often regard as the golden age of the intelligentsia.See Procevska, O. (2010). \\"Powerlessness, lamentation and nostalgia: discourses of the post-Soviet intelligentsia in modern Latvia.\\" In: Basov, N., Simet, G.F., Andel, J. van, Mahlomaholo, S., Netshandama, V. (eds). The Intellectual: A Phenomenon in Multidimensional Perspectives. Oxford: Inter-Disciplinary Press. . P. 47–56. Vladimir Putin has expressed his view on the social duty of intelligentsia in modern Russia. > We should all be aware of the fact that when revolutionary—not > evolutionary—changes come, things can get even worse. The intelligentsia > should be aware of this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that > should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and > revolutions of all kinds. We've had enough of it. We've seen so many > revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development. Usages Derived from the Polish cultural concept, the word intelligentsiya entered the languages of Europe; in English usage, \\"intelligensia\\" identifies the intellectual status class in the countries of Central Europe (e.g. Poland) and Eastern Europe (e.g. Russia) in the 19th and 20th centuries. A narrower term 'intellectuals', according to Pierre Bourdieu, can be applied to those members of intelligentsia who not only work using their intellect, but also create cultural wealth. The emergence of elite classes of intellectuals or well-educated people had been observed in other European countries (e.g., intellectuels in France and Gebildete in Germany.) In contemporary usage, the denotations and connotations of the term Intelligentsia include the intellectuals and the managerial middle-class whose professional and societal functions are the creation, distribution, and application of knowledge throughout society.Ehrenreich, B. (1989). Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class. New York: Harper Collins The sociologist Max Weber defined the intelligentsia as a major social category (status class), which is essentially distinct, in their social function, political attributes, and national interests, from the other social categories of society. In Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology, Weber used the term intelligentsia in chronological and geographical frames of reference, such as \\"this Christian preoccupation with the formulation of dogmas was, in Antiquity, particularly influenced by the distinctive character of 'intelligentsia', which was the product of Greek education.\\"Weber, Max. Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology, p.462 Mass intelligentsia In the 20th century, from the status class term Intelligentsia, sociologists derived the term mass intelligentsia to describe the populations of educated adults, with discretionary income, who pursue intellectual interests by way of book clubs and cultural associations, etc. That sociological term was made popular usage by the writer Melvyn Bragg, who said that mass intelligentsia conceptually explains the popularity of book clubs and literary festivals that otherwise would have been of limited intellectual interests to most people from the middle class and from the working class. In the book Campus Power Struggle (1970), the sociologist Richard Flacks addressed the concept of mass intelligentsia: See also *Academia *Anti-intellectualism *Philippine ilustrado *Creative class *Obrazovanshchina *Organic intellectual References Further reading * Roach, John. \\"Liberalism and the Victorian Intelligentsia.\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 13#1 (1957): 58-81. online. *Boborykin, P.D.

It manages the historic Wang and Shubert Theatres on Tremont Street in the Boston Theater District, where it offers theatre, opera, classical and popular music, comedy, dance, and Broadway musicals. The Center also offers a diverse mix of educational workshops and community activities; collaborates with artists and local performing arts organizations; and, acts as a champion for the arts in the Greater Boston community by aggressively helping to make the arts an integral part of the community's collective, daily experience. It maintains partnerships with numerous arts organizations in Boston, including the Celebrity Series of Boston, Fiddlehead Theatre Company, Express Yourself, and more.  History  When the Wang Theatre first opened in 1925, it was called the Metropolitan Theatre. After 30 years as the Metropolitan Theatre, the venue was called the Music Hall, then the Metropolitan Center. In 1983, An and Lorraine Wang donated the funds to renovate the theatre, and it became the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. The Wang Theatre is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and with 3,600+ seats, it is one of the five largest stages in the country. The Wang Center began managing and operating the Shubert Theatre in 1996 when it entered a 40-year lease agreement with the venue. In 2006, the Wang Center became the Citi Performing Arts Center after establishing a 10-year partnership with Citigroup. In 2016, the Citi Performing Arts Center became the Boch Center following the announcement of a long-term partnership with the Boch family. In the past, it also managed the booking and preservation of the Emerson Colonial Theatre and the Strand Theatre.  Programming  The Boch Center hosts a variety of performances and events at the Wang and Shubert Theatres, including theatre, dance, comedy, opera, classical and popular music concerts, and Broadway shows. The Center maintains partnerships with other Boston arts nonprofits such as Fiddlehead Theatre Company, Handel and Haydn Society, A.R.T., Celebrity Series of Boston, Huntington Theatre Company, World Music, Dance Umbrellas, and Express Yourself. The Wang and Shubert Theatres also host special events, such as corporate conferences, award ceremonies, galas, weddings, and more. They are also used as locations for movie filming. Movies filmed at the Wang Theatre include Ghostbusters (2016), American Hustle, The Pink Panther 2, The Witches of Eastwick, and The Great Debaters.  Nonprofit Work  In 1988, the Education Department at the Boch Center was founded, and the following year the Walter Suskind Memorial Education Fund was established. The nonprofit arts education initiatives at the Center include the City Spotlights Leadership Program, Teen Council, Target Arts, Interactive Readings Stories Alive, and Ticket Access. City Spotlights Leadership Program is a seven-week summer employment program for teens in the Boston area. In 2016, the program reached 61 students from 30 different high schools and 13 Boston and Everett neighborhoods. The program includes arts and leadership training, community advocacy, and performance. Teen Leadership Council brings together a smaller group of teens from greater Boston for year-round programming where teens create original performance pieces, facilitate workshops, advocate for social change, and volunteer in the community. Founded in 2009 in partnership with Boston Public Schools, the Target Arts Program is an artist residency program funded by Target Corporation. It provides an in- depth arts residency at four different Boston schools each year. The Interactive Reading: Stories Alive program provides interactive storytelling to children in various Boston neighborhoods. The Center's Ticket Access program provides tickets to roughly 3,000 community organizations and schools in Greater Boston each year. ArtWeek Boston is another nonprofit initiative produced by the Boch Center. This bi-annual, 10-day creative festival features more than 150 unique and creative experiences that are hands-on, interactive or offer behind-the-scenes access to artists or the creative process. It is presented by Highland Street Foundation.

Music Hall In 1962 it became the home of the Boston Ballet and was renamed the Music Hall. During the 1960s and 1970s, audiences could see the Stuttgart Opera, the Metropolitan Opera, Bolshoi Ballet and Kirov Ballet as well as popular movies and performing artists. With time though, they could no longer attract the large touring companies because of the size of their stage as well as their outdated production facilities. Converted to a non-profit center in 1980 and renamed the Metropolitan Center, they were able to attract theatrical performances again. Bob Marley and the Wailers 1978 concert at the Music Hall was released in 2015 in honor of Bob Marley's birthday as Bob Marley And The Wailers – Live: Boston Music Hall (June 8th 1978).

Biography  Hill was born to a \\"very ordinary\\"Adrian Muller, 'Interview: Reginald Hill', in Crime Time 2.3 (1998), p. 33. family. His father, Reg Hill, was a professional footballer. His mother was a fan of Golden Age crime writers, and he discovered the genre while fetching her library books.John Lennard, 'Reginald Hill', in Jay Parini, ed., British Writers, Supplement IX (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004), p. 109. He passed the Eleven plus exam and attended Carlisle Grammar School where he excelled in English. After National Service (1955–57) and reading English at St Catherine's College, Oxford (1957–60), he worked as a teacher for many years, becoming a senior lecturer at Doncaster College of Education. In 1980 he retired from salaried work to devote himself full-time to writing. Hill is best known for his more than 20 novels featuring the Yorkshire detectives Andrew Dalziel, Peter Pascoe and Edgar Wield. The characters were used by the BBC in the Dalziel and Pascoe series, in which Dalziel was played by Warren Clarke, Pascoe by Colin Buchanan, and Wield by David Royle. He also wrote more than 30 other novels, including five featuring Joe Sixsmith, a black machine operator turned private detective in a fictional Luton. Novels originally published under the pseudonyms of Patrick Ruell, Dick Morland, and Charles Underhill have now appeared under his own name. Hill was also a writer of short stories and ghost tales. Hill's novels employ various structural devices, such as presenting parts of the story in non-chronological order, or alternating with sections from a novel supposedly written by Peter's wife, Ellie Pascoe (née Soper). He also frequently selected one writer or one work of art to use as a central organizing element of a given novel, such as one novel being a pastiche of Jane Austen's works, or another featuring elements of classical Greek myth. The novella One Small Step (dedicated to \\"you, dear readers, without whom the writing would be in vain, and to you, still dearer purchasers, without whom the eating would be infrequent\\"Reginald Hill, One Small Step: A Dalziel and Pascoe Novella (London: Collins, 1990), p. 7.) is set in the future, and deals with the EuroFed Police Commissioner Pascoe and retired Dalziel investigating the first murder on the moon. The duo do not always \\"get their man\\", with at least one novel ending with the villain getting away and another strongly implying that while Dalziel and Pascoe are unable to convict anyone, a series of unrelated accidents actually included at least one unprovable instance of murder. Hill commented in 1986: > I still recall with delight as a teen-ager making the earth-shaking > discovery that many of the great \\"serious novelists,\\" classical and modern, > were as entertaining and interesting as the crime-writers I already loved. > But it took another decade of maturation to reverse the equation and > understand that many of the crime writers I had decided to grow out of were > still as interesting and entertaining as the \\"serious novelists\\" I now > revered.Reginald Hill, 'Looking for a Programme', in Robin Winks, ed., > Colloquium on Crime (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1986), p. 151., Hill died in Ravenglass, Cumbria, on 12 January 2012 after suffering a brain tumour.
