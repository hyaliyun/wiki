Like many previous generations of Luttrells since the 16th century, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Minehead, his family's pocket borough near Dunster. == Early life and family == Fownes Luttrell was the fifth surviving son of Henry Fownes Luttrell I (formerly Henry Fownes, –1780). His mother Margaret was the daughter of Alexander Luttrell (1705–1737), who had bequeathed his estates to Margaret on condition that her husband take the surname Luttrell. In 1782 Fownes Luttrell married Catherine Browne, daughter of John Cave Browne of Stretton-en-le-Field in Leicestershire. They had no children. == Career == Fownes Luttrell was educated at Blundell's School in Devon from 1772 to 1775. He then joined the British Army, becoming a lieutenant in the 89th Foot in 1783. He transferred to the 49th Foot in 1783, and was promoted to captain in 1787. He was lieutenant colonel of the Somerset Fencibles from 1795 to 1801. After his father's death in 1780, his oldest brother John had succeeded to the family estates, including control of Minehead's parliamentary representation. John had been returning himself to Parliament since 1774, and had continued his father's habit of renting the second seat to a government supporter. A vacancy arose in 1795 when Viscount Parker succeeded to the peerage, and John then nominated his younger brother Thomas, who was in poor health after returning from service in the West Indies. Thomas was returned unopposed at the by-election in March 1795, but was defeated at the general election, in May 1796. The London banker John Langston had purchased land in the borough on which he had built houses, and set out challenge the Luttrell interest. After Langston's defeat in 1802 a deal was reached whereby John Fownes Luttrell purchased all of Langston's property in the borough, and Luttrell control was restored. Thomas's made no mark during his year in the House of Commons. After his defeat, John tried lobbied William Pitt to promote Thomas to a higher rank in the army. This was unsuccessful, and ill-health forced him to retire from full-time army service in 1801. He then became a Commissioner of the Lottery. == See also == * Feudal barony of Dunster == References == Category:1763 births Category:1811 deaths Thomas Fownes Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of The Queen's College, Oxford Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1790–1796 Category:49th Regiment of Foot officers ","title":"Thomas Fownes Luttrell"},{"id":"46778773","text":" Frigg is a chemical tanker operated by Nesskip of Iceland.

WhoFest is a production of the Dallas Future Society, a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation that seeks to promote the advancement of science, literature, and music for all mankind. This is the same organization that has run FenCon, a literary and music oriented general interest science fiction convention, since 2004. ==Programming== Notable features of WhoFest include how-to programming, panels, fan discussions, gaming, a diverse selection of guests, celebrity encounters, a charity auction, a dealers room, \\"WhoKids\\" children's programming, trivia contests, concerts, and a dance on Saturday night. Many attendees wear costumes as various Doctor Who characters and others. ==Critical reaction== In June 2013, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram named WhoFest as one of the \\"red-letter dates for geeks, fans, [and] collectors\\" as well as one of the signs that Dallas/Fort Worth has become \\"so geeky\\". In November 2013, the Dallas Observer called WhoFest \\"an enjoyable, eye-opening experience\\". In February 2015, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram declared WhoFest an event that \\"jumped out and made our nerd hearts go pitter-pat\\".

The parish of Stow Bardolph also includes Barroway Drove. Stowbridge is between Downham Market and King's Lynn on the banks of the River Great Ouse. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. The Great Ouse, the Relief Channel and the mainline railway from King's Lynn to Cambridge run through the heart of the community. ==History== At the time of the Domesday Book in 1085, Stowbridge did not exist, and the Great Ouse did not run through the area. It was largely marshy ground drained by a small river system seemingly referred to in the old documents as the Wiggenhall Eau which ran up through Wiggenhall Parish to Lynn and The Wash. It seems from this record that Runcton Holme and Wiggenhall shared a watermill on this watercourse, and that there were some fisheries in the area. Side view of former Bethesda chapel of the United Methodist Free Churches (1860) In around 1181, a group of hermetic women arrived from Lynn to set up a community in a \\"desolate and marshy place\\" (ref: Register of Crabhouse Nunnery, British Library).British Library MS 4733 This community became regularised in the mid 1180s when the Prior of Raynham gave them a Charter of Incorporation.Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum After massive flooding from inland water in the early 13th Century which washed away the nunnery such that they had to seek refuge at St Mary Magdalen. It was at this time that the Great Ouse came to run through this area after having breached the watershed near Denver. The nuns returned and refounded the institution, calling it the Priory of St John the Evangelist at Crabhouse - Crabhouse appearing to be the early name for the place. At this time, the first flood defences were built by the nuns and their staff to protect them from the river and floods from the South. The Southern defence still exists as the levee that runs from the bridge to West Head Farm (which is at the west end of the nun's embankment - hence its name). As Crabhouse Priory grew in wealth and stature, a community developed outside its precinct on the southern side (all this on the west side of the Great Ouse). At this time, there would not have been a bridge here. That was to come later when the Hares of Stow Bardolph took possession of the lands to the south and west of the old Priory in the era after its Dissolution by Henry VIII's commissioners in 1537. After the bridge was built, the place was renamed Stowbridge. A livestock fair was held annually on the first Saturday after Whitsun. ==Church== St Peter's church, on West Head Road, is a Church of England chapel of ease for Stow Bardolph, now shared with the Methodists. It was built of glazed terracotta blocks in 1908 and is a Grade II listed building. The church has a stained glass window to the memory of the Reverend James Adams (1839-1903), vicar of Stow from 1895 to 1902, who had held services in a schoolroom. The communion table was his portable altar, presented by his widow. The Norman font was transferred from Stow Bardolph after 50 years in the Vicarage garden. ==References== Category:Villages in Norfolk Category:King's Lynn and West Norfolk ","title":"Stowbridge"},{"id":"46778827","text":"Skaalurens Skibsbyggeri in the 1870s Skaalurens Skibsbyggeri in 1901 Skaaluren Skibsbyggeri A/S was a shipyard in Rosendal, Norway.

She adopted the name of María of Jesus when she became a nun. She was beatified on 14 November 1976 and her cause for sainthood continues. A miracle needed for that is now under investigation. ==Life== María López de Rivas Martinez was born in Spain on 18 August 1560 into a life of wealth. Her father died when she was four and her paternal grandparents raised her after her mother remarried. She was well educated and favored a simple life rather than one of wealth. She was introduced to a Jesuit priest on 12 August 1577 and took this as a chance to become a member of the Carmelites at Toledo at the age of seventeen despite her precarious state of health. She was professed as a full member of the order on 8 September 1578. She also was said to have borne the stigmata. She served as prioress of the institution from 1591 to 1595 and in 1598. She was accused of an offence in 1600 - an unjust accusation - and was removed as the prioress and was isolated for two decades. She accepted this without resentment and, after the accuser had died, she was rehabilitated while asking for forgiveness. She was re-elected as prioress on 25 June 1624 and served until 1627. She was also a close friend to Saint Teresa of Avila and the two confided in each other. Her health continued to decline and she died on 13 September 1640 at 10:00am. She died after she received the Eucharist. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced in Toledo on 10 December 1926 and it conferred the title of Servant of God upon her. She was declared to be Venerable on 22 June 1972 after Pope Paul VI recognized her life of heroic virtue. Two miracles were required for her beatification. The process for the first opened in Cartagena and spanned from 1928-1929. The second was held at exactly the same time in Toledo. Both processes were ratified in 1974.

The term identifies different structures in different phyla: in vertebrates it is a double fold of the peritoneum enclosing the intestines; in other organisms it forms complete or incomplete partitions of the body cavity, whether that is the coelom or, as in the Anthozoa, the gastrovascular cavity. The word \\"mesentery\\" is derived from the Greek mesos, \\"in the middle\\" and enteron, an \\"intestine\\". ==Vertebrates== In vertebrates, a mesentery is a membrane consisting of a double fold of peritoneum that encloses the intestines and their associated organs and connect them with the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity. In invertebrates, a mesentery is a support or partition in a body cavity serving a similar function to the mesenteries of vertebrates. ==Bilateria== In bilaterally symmetrical organisms there is often a major mesentery separating the two halves of the coelom. In segmented organisms such as earthworms, there are a pair of coelomic cavities in each segment. The mesothelium of the body wall is extended round the central gut to form a mesentery, a longitudinal partition in the sagittal plane. Above the gut is the dorsal mesentery and below the gut, the ventral mesentery. The transverse partition between the separate segments is known as a septum. ==Cnidaria== Dissection of a sea anemone 5 – complete mesentery 10 – incomplete mesentery 11 – one of the two ostia In the phylum Cnidaria and the class Anthozoa, the mesenteries are sheet-like partitions that extend from the body wall of the animal into its gastrovascular cavity. They are composed of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. They can either be \\"complete\\", joining the gastrodermis of the body wall with that of the pharynx, or \\"incomplete\\", extending only part way into the cavity (the terms \\"perfect\\" and \\"imperfect\\" are sometimes used instead). They stretch from the pedal disc to the oral disc, and there are two perforations or ostia near the oral disc. Mesenteries are usually in pairs. The free edge of incomplete mesenteries are thickened to form glandular, ciliated bands called mesenterial filaments. The lower ends of the mesenterial filaments are elongated into acontia which are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells) and can protrude through the body wall or mouth. The gonads are situated on the mesenteries alongside the mesenterial filaments. Stony corals, order Scleractinia, have the mesenteries arranged radially in pairs which develop cyclically. The mesenteries deposit calcium carbonate which forms a stony ridge, the septum, between each pair of mesenteries and builds the corallite, the cup in which the polyp sits. Sea anemones, order Actiniaria, have at least eight complete mesenteries and a variable number of incomplete ones near the base. The functional significance of the mesenteries in sea anemones is unclear. Their margins are involved in only a limited amount of digestion and absorption, so their chief function may be to provide support to help the animal maintain its shape. Soft corals, order Alcyonacea, have eight primary mesenteries which alternate with the eight tentacles. The mesenteries are complete and unpaired and bear unilobed filaments. ==References== Category:Animal anatomy ","title":"Mesentery (zoology)"},{"id":"46778931","text":"Arnica sachalinensis is an Asian species of arnica in the sunflower family.

It has been suggested that it derives from the Byzantine imperial name Nikephoros, via Arabic Nikfor. It is sometimes also said that it derives from the Armenian takavor, \\"king\\". The term and its variants (tekvur, tekur, tekir, etc.) began to be used by historians writing in Persian or Turkish in the 13th century, to refer to \\"denote Byzantine lords or governors of towns and fortresses in Anatolia (Bithynia, Pontus) and Thrace. It often denoted Byzantine frontier warfare leaders, commanders of akritai, but also Byzantine princes and emperors themselves\\", e.g. in the case of the Tekfur Sarayı , the Turkish name of the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus in Constantinople (mod. Istanbul). Thus Ibn Bibi refers to the Armenian kings of Cilicia as tekvur, while both he and the Dede Korkut epic refer to the rulers of the Empire of Trebizond as \\"tekvur of Djanit\\". In the early Ottoman period, the term was used for both the Byzantine governors of fortresses and towns, with whom the Turks fought during the Ottoman expansion in northwestern Anatolia and in Thrace, but also for the Byzantine emperors themselves, interchangeably with malik (\\"king\\") and more rarely, fasiliyus (a rendering of the Byzantine title basileus). Hasan Çolak suggests that this use was at least in part a deliberate choice to reflect current political realities and Byzantium's decline, which between 1371–94 and again between 1424 and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 made the rump Byzantine state a tributary vassal to the Ottomans. The 15th-century Ottoman historian Enveri somewhat uniquely uses the term tekfur also for the Frankish rulers of southern Greece and the Aegean islands. == References  Sources == * * Category:Byzantine Empire–Ottoman Empire relations Category:Turkish titles Category:Royal titles ","title":"Tekfur"},{"id":"46778942","text":"Albert Joseph Maria Defant (July 12, 1884, Trient – December 24, 1974, Innsbruck) was an Italian-Austrian meteorologist, oceanographer and climatologist. He published fundamental works on the physics of the atmosphere and ocean and is regarded as one of the founders of physical oceanography. ==Early life and academic work== Albert Defant was born in Trient when this was still part of the Austrian Empire. Since 1919 this city is Trento in Italy. Albert Defant went to schools in Trient and Innsbruck and then studied mathematics, physics, and geophysics at the University of Innsbruck in Austria from 1902.G. Böhnecke,1976.

He started working at the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics) in Vienna, Austria in 1907. He obtained his Habilitation (degree permitting to teach at the university) at Vienna University in 1909 A. Pichler, 1978.

Defant stayed at the Zentralanstalt until 1918, working mostly on problems of atmospheric physics, in particular in mountain ranges. He also gained experience in applied weather forecasting. During the later years of that period, he mainly focused on large-scale atmospheric circulation and on water level changes in lakes and adjacent seas, in particular tides and seiches. Defant was Professor of Cosmic Physics (corresponding to meteorology and geophysics) at Innsbruck University from 1919 to 1926.H. Oberkofler, P. Goller, 1991.

By that time he was also rated as an expert on tides, and he was invited to participate in two cruises of the German survey vessel \\"Panther\\" in the North Sea in 1925 and 1926. Defant was Professor of Oceanography at the \\"Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität\\" (later Humboldt University) and also Director of the \\"Institut and Museum für Meereskunde\\" (Institute and Museum of Marine Science) in Berlin from 1926 to 1945. This institute was the leading institution of marine research in Germany at that time. The famous German Meteor expedition (1925-1926) had been started in 1925. The chief scientist Alfred Merz unfortunately died in Buenos Aires in 1925, and Albert Defant took over the task of Merz from 1926 to 1927.F. Spiess, 1928. Die Meteor-Fahrt.

His later work in Berlin focused on the physics of the ocean, in particular on the upper ocean and its boundary to the atmosphere.H. Thorade, 1944. A. Defant sechzig Jahre alt. Die Naturwissenschaften, 32, 27/39, 165-166 (A.Defant sixty years old). International relations were important for him, particularly to Scandinavian scientists. These contacts were interrupted by World War II. Defant stayed in Berlin until the bomb strikes stopped the scientific work. The institute’s library had been evacuated to Wunsiedel in central Germany, and Defant did some teaching in Vienna and scientific work in Wunsiedel until the end of the war. The University of Innsbruck (now an Austrian city again) offered him the Chair of Meteorology and Geophysics in 1945, and he was Professor and Director of the Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics at Innsbruck University until 1955. He accepted a visiting appointment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California in San Diego in 1949-1950. He was Rektor (president) of Innsbruck University in 1950-1951. After his retirement in 1955 he repeatedly worked as visiting professor, during 1952-1956 at the University of Hamburg, Germany, and during 1956-1958 at the Free University of Berlin. Between these stays he was also hosted by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1957-1958. ==Family== Albert Defant was married to Maria Krepper in 1909, and the couple had three children. The meteorologist Friedrich Defant is his son. His wife died in 1949, and he married Maria Theresia Schletterer in 1952. ==Awards== * \\"Ludwig Haitinger Preis\\" der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien, Österreich (\\"Haitinger Prize\\" of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria) * 1917 Österreichisches Verdienstkreuz in Gold, Wien, Österreich (National Decoration in Gold awarded for services to the community, Vienna, Austria) * 1928 \\"Alfred Ackermann-Teubner-Gedächtnispreis\\" zur Förderung der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, Leipzig, Deutschland (\\"Alfred Ackermann-Teubner Memorial Medal\\" promoting mathematical sciences, Leipzig, Germany)F.

Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka called the demolition \\"the violation of that ancestral place\\" noting that \\"the order came from the military governor: 'Dig up those dead and forgotten ancestors and plant a modern council building - with all its lucrative corollaries on that somnolent spot\\". ==Notable burials== *James Pinson Labulo Davies *Samuel Ajayi Crowther * Consul Benjamin Campbell * Police Magistrate Josiah Gerard * Thomas Babington Macaulay == References == Category:Cemeteries in Lagos Category:History of Lagos Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Lagos Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1971 ","title":"Ajele Cemetery"},{"id":"46778980","text":"Pikul Khueanpet (; born 20 September 1988) is a Thai international footballer who plays as a midfielder. == References  External links == * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Thai women's footballers Category:Footballers at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Footballers at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Thailand women's international footballers Category:People from Chanthaburi Province Category:Southeast Asian Games gold medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games Category:2019 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:FIFA Century Club Category:Asian Games competitors for Thailand Category:Competitors at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players ","title":"Pikul Khueanpet"},{"id":"46778998","text":"Orathai Srimanee ( born 12 June 1988) is a Thai international footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Thailand national women's team. ==References External links == * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Thai women's footballers Category:Footballers at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Thai women's futsal players Category:Thailand women's international footballers Category:Southeast Asian Games gold medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in futsal Category:Footballers at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games Category:People from Sisaket Province Category:2019 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Asian Games competitors for Thailand Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players ","title":"Orathai Srimanee"},{"id":"46779009","text":"Wilaiporn Boothduang ( born 25 June 1987) is a Thai international footballer who plays as a midfielder. == References  External links == * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Thailand women's international footballers Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Thai women's footballers Category:People from Udon Thani Province Category:Footballers at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Footballers at the 2014 Asian Games Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Southeast Asian Games gold medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games Category:2019 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Asian Games competitors for Thailand Category:Competitors at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand ","title":"Wilaiporn Boothduang"},{"id":"46779017","text":"Alisa Rukpinij ( born 2 February 1995) is a Thai international footballer who plays as a forward. == References  External links == * * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Thai women's footballers Category:Thailand women's international footballers Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games Category:Asian Games competitors for Thailand Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players ","title":"Alisa Rukpinij"},{"id":"46779020","text":"Snatched is a 2017 American comedy film directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Katie Dippold. The film stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn (in her first film since 2002's The Banger Sisters), with Joan Cusack, Ike Barinholtz, Wanda Sykes and Christopher Meloni in supporting roles, and depicts a mother and daughter who are abducted while on vacation in South America. Snatched premiered in New York City on May 2, 2017, and was theatrically released on May 12, 2017, by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $60 million worldwide on a $42 million budget. At the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards, Hawn was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress for her performance. ==Plot== Recently fired from her job and dumped by her rock musician boyfriend, Emily Middleton is determined to enjoy a previously planned nonrefundable trip to Ecuador. Learning of her relationship status from social media, her mother, Linda, tells her to come home in order to move on, where she reunites with her agoraphobic brother, Jeffrey. Initially refusing, Linda agrees to go on the trip with her daughter. In Ecuador, after they check into the upscale hotel, Emily meets a handsome man named James at the hotel bar, and they begin a relationship. After one night of drinking and dancing with James, Emily and her mother take a sightseeing day trip with him. During their ride, a white van rams James' Jeep and the masked men abduct Emily and Linda. James escapes, but Linda suspects he was in on the kidnapping plot from the start. Emily awakens inside a cell and begins to panic, while Linda tries to calm herself by reading men's magazines. The leader, Hector Morgado, contacts Jeffrey and demands $100,000 in ransom money. Morgado then has his nephew take both women away from the kidnappers' hideout to another location. They manage to escape from their captors' car and stow away into a passing truck. As it drives away, Emily kills the leader's nephew who is chasing them by pounding his head with a shovel. The truck's driver then stops his truck and leaves them both in the middle of the jungle. They find a phone at a nearby bar, where they call the U.S. State Department officer Morgan Russell, saying that they are in peril, and Morgan advises them to go to the US Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. They meet a rugged-looking American named Roger Simmons. He agrees to help them find the consulate. After the three share a meal, Morgado and his men track them down. Morgado is about to kill them both as revenge for his only nephew's death, but Linda distracts him while Emily retrieves a nearby spear gun with which to threaten him. As she retrieves it, she accidentally fires it, killing Morgado's only son. They manage to escape with Simmons onto a boat. Soon, however, they are forced off the boat when the captain detects another boat nearby that is looking for the two women. Meanwhile, Jeffrey, learning that his mother and sister have been kidnapped, calls Morgan at the State Department, saying he will join forces with the agents in order to find his mother and sister. Morgan reluctantly agrees. In Colombia, Emily, Linda, and Simmons hike through the jungle until Simmons falls to his death from a cliff. Later, Emily passes out from the effects of a tapeworm infestation. After a local village doctor removes the tapeworm from her body, Morgado and his men track them down again. They spot a zip line and decide to use it to escape. Unfortunately, the zip line is good for only one person. Linda forces Emily to leave her behind and is recaptured. Emily safely arrives at the US Consulate. Determined to find her mother, she seeks help from two feisty American women veterans, Ruth and Barb, whom Emily met at the resort in Ecuador. Ruth and Barb take her to James, who was conspiring with Morgado, to the apartment where he is being interrogated for the kidnappers' location. With the ladies' help, Emily rescues her mother at the kidnappers' apartment. They try to escape in another truck, but Morgado intercepts them. As he is about to kill Emily, Linda blows her dog whistle, summoning a dog that attacks Morgado. U.S. State Department agents arrive to arrest Morgado, and Jeffrey reunites with his mother and sister. One year later, Emily and Linda take another trip to Kuala Lumpur, where Emily meets another man, who offers her a drink. Emily refuses, and she and Linda proceed to dance. == Cast == * Amy Schumer as Emily Louise Middleton, Jeffrey's sister, Linda's daughter and Michael's girlfriend * Goldie Hawn as Linda Middleton, Emily and Jeffrey’s mother * Ike Barinholtz as Jeffrey Middleton, Emily’s agoraphobic brother and Linda's son * Wanda Sykes as Ruth, Barb's friend and a woman Emily and Linda meet on vacation * Joan Cusack as Barb, Ruth's friend * Christopher Meloni as Roger Simmons * Óscar Jaenada as Morgado * Bashir Salahuddin as Morgan Russell, an officer at the U.S. State Department * Tom Bateman as James * Randall Park as Michael, Emily's boyfriend who breaks up with her * Tom Choi as the Colonel * Raven Goodwin as Lew, Emily’s boss *Al Madrigal as Embassy Official * Arturo Castro as Dr. Armando == Production == On May 22, 2015, trade reports announced that Amy Schumer would star in an action-comedy film scripted by Katie Dippold, which was rewritten by Schumer and her sister Kim Caramele.

On August 18, 2015, Jonathan Levine was reported to be in talks to direct the film.

In North America, Snatched was released on May 12, 2017 alongside King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and was projected to gross $15 million to $20 million during its opening weekend. It made $675,000 from Thursday night previews at about 2,625 theaters, before expanding to 3,501 theaters for the weekend and made $5 million on its first day (including previews).

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Snatched has a pair of terrifically talented stars, but their presence isn't enough to compensate for this rote comedy's threadbare plot and scattershot laughs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100, based 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"The tantalizing enticement of Goldie Hawn pairing with Amy Schumer for a mother- daughter, road-trip buddy comedy has some moments, but never fulfills its promise. As their onscreen adventures and antics grow zanier and broader, the laughs actually grow softer and more sporadic.\\" ===Home media=== Snatched was released on DVD and Blu-Ray August 8, 2017. == References  External links == * * * Category:2017 films Category:2017 action comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about families Category:Films about vacationing Category:Films directed by Jonathan Levine Category:Films produced by Peter Chernin Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Category:Films set in Colombia Category:Films set in Ecuador Category:Films shot in Hawaii Category:Films with screenplays by Katie Dippold Category:TSG Entertainment films Category:2017 comedy films ","title":"Snatched (2017 film)"},{"id":"46779024","text":"Trần Thị Hồng Nhung (born 28 October 1992) is a Vietnamese footballer who plays as a midfielder.

She was ridiculed for her dedication and her experiences as some believed them to be heretical or a need for attention. She was beatified in 1783 after the recognition of two miracles that were found to have been attributed to her intercession. == Life == Giovanna Maria Bonomo was born on 15 August 1606 in Vicenza to Giovanni Bonomo. Her mother died when she was six in 1612. Her father took her to a convent in 1615 where she was educated. The Poor Clares in Trent educated her and she studied Latin. She received her First Communion at the age of nine. At the age of twelve she informed her father of her intention to become a nun and to remain in Trent. He at first was opposed but he relented after a short time. She entered a Benedictine convent on 21 June 1621. She became a Benedictine nun in Bassano on 8 September 1622 and fell into an ecstatic state for the first time at her profession celebration. She was also believed to have obtained the stigmata. She served as a novice mistress and later as a prioress. She also served as an abbess three times. She taught that holiness did not consist in great things but rather in simple and common things. She died on 1 March 1670 with a formidable reputation for holiness. == Beatification == The beatification process started in Vicenza on 1 September 1699 under Pope Innocent XII which conferred upon her the title of Servant of God. The local process closed in mid 1704 and was validated before it was evaluated in Rome. Pope Clement XIII recognized her life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable on 21 December 1758. Pope Pius VI approved two miracles attributed to her intercession in mid 1780 and beatified her on 9 June 1783. == References  External links == * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN Category:1606 births Category:1670 deaths Category:17th-century Christian mystics Category:17th-century venerated Christians Category:Benedictines Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian nuns Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:Stigmatics ","title":"Giovanna Maria Bonomo"},{"id":"46779086","text":"The Malacca Crocodile Farm (Malay: Taman Buaya Melaka) is a crocodile farm in Ayer Keroh, Malacca, Malaysia.http://www.destinationtomalaysia.com/melaka/Crocodile- Farm.htmlhttp://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2009&dt;=0711&pub;=Utusan_Malaysia&sec;=Selatan&pg;=ws_01.htmhttp://www.mphtj.gov.my/en/taman- buaya;jsessionid=DF32A17BA8289290C8DA9CA3DB6EAC60 The farm is the largest crocodile farm in Malaysia. ==History== The farm was established in July 1987 with a cost of MYR650,000.http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2008&dt;=1006&pub;=Utusan_Malaysia&sec;=Selatan&pg;=ws_03.htm ==Geography== The farm expands over an area of 3.5 hectares of reserved forest land. ==Architecture== The farm entrance gate was built like a mini fort with a flight of steps leading inside. ==Attractions== * Crocodile farm * Reptile corner * Mammal House * Walkthrough Aviary * Water park * Malaysia miniature * Petting Zoo * Haunted house * Herb's Garden ==Shows== Includes of 4 types of shows *Cultural Dances Show *Crocodile Interactive Show *Magic Show *Crocodile feeding demonstration The farm features live crocodile shows every weekends or public and school holidays. ==See also== * List of museums in Malaysia * List of tourist attractions in Melaka ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1987 establishments in Malaysia Category:Tourist attractions in Malacca Category:Zoos in Malaysia Category:Buildings and structures in Malacca ","title":"Melaka Crocodile Farm"},{"id":"46779133","text":"Faraaz Khan (born 27 May 1960) is an Indian film actor who was seen in some popular Bollywood films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Fareb and Mehndi.

He was beatified in 1954 after the approval of two miracles attributed to his intercession. ==Life== Tommaso Riccardi was born in Trevi on 24 June 1844 and spent his childhood in Umbria. He moved to Rome in 1865 in order to commence his studies for the priesthood. He underwent philosophical studies under the Dominicans at the Collegio Angelico, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome. This led to a pilgrimage to Loreto and his entrance to the Cassinese Congregation of the Order of Saint Benedict on 12 November 1866. He made his final profession in 1868 and assumed the name of \\"Placido\\". As a deacon on 5 November 1870 he was arrested due to the fact that he dodged conscription and he was imprisoned in Florence and then sent as a soldier in Livorno after his release from prison on 24 December 1870. After that debacle he returned to Rome to resume his studies. He was ordained to the priesthood on 25 March 1871. His students included the future cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster. He contracted malaria in 1881 and suffered from that disease for the rest of his life. He served as a spiritual director in Perugia from 1882 and served as a rector to the Benedictines in Rome in 1887. He served as the rector of the Basilica of Santa Maria di Farfa in Rome in 1894 and lived in hermitage near San Fiano. He served as a confessor to a convent of Poor Clares he lived near. He died on 25 March 1915 in Rome at the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced in Rome on 3 March 1935 under Pope Pius XI and the two local process ensured. It granted him the title of Servant of God. Both processes were ratified on 20 November 1940. The recognition of his life of heroic virtue on 4 June 1944 allowed Pope Pius XII to confer upon him the title of Venerable. Pius XII also approved two miracles attributed to his intercession and beatified him on 5 December 1954. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN Category:1844 births Category:1915 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Benedictines Category:Italian priests Category:Italian beatified people ","title":"Tommaso Riccardi"},{"id":"46779260","text":"The Tauber Valley Cycleway (), official name in German: Liebliches Taubertal (der Klassiker), in English Lovely Tauber Valley (the Classic), also Charming Tauber Valley (the Classic), is a German bicycle path running about 101 km along the River Tauber in Franconia, Germany.

Most notably scientists have proposed that ecological systems can exhibit a hydra effect when \\"a higher death rate in a particular species ultimately increases the size of its population\\". The hypothesis is suggested to have implications for the eradication of pests, and resource management. There are also said to be indications that reducing the death rate can shrink a population. The hydra effect has also been used about negative outcomes when shutting down torrent sites which come back in more incarnations, and is cited by those opposing the war on drugs and targeted killing as counter-productive effects. In 2016 the site Torrentz shut down its operations without further information for the cause of the shut down. However, within two weeks, there were 3 torrent sites that were built as replacements for Torrentz, which stands as a perfect example of the hydra effect.

Iliensi in Enciclopedia Italiana, cited in TreccaniIliensi, Enciclopedia on line Treccani According to the archaeologist Giovanni Ugas, the Ilienses were the most important population of Nuragic Sardinia and were connected with the Sherden, one of the Sea Peoples widely cited in Ancient Egyptian sources. This hypothesis has been, however, opposed by other archaeologists and historians.Stephen L. Dyson and Robert J. Rowland, Archaeology And History in Sardinia From The Stone Age to the Middle Ages: Shepherds, Sailors, & Conquerors (UPenn Museum of Archaeology, 2007: ), p. 101 (with refs). Eduardo Blasco Ferrer correlates their name with the Iberian root *ili-, meaning settlement.Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Paleosardo. Le radici linguistiche della Sardegna neolitica, Berlin/New York (2010) In the nuragic period their territory extended from the plain of Campidano (called in antiquity Iolean plain) to the Tirso river in north where began the territory of the Balares. They were probably divided into 40 tribes, each ruled by a king or chieftain. These rulers lived in the complex nuraghi, called \\"polilobates\\", such as Su Nuraxi of Barumini. In what was once their territory, very important are the findings of Mycenaean artifacts, confirming the wealth of exchanges between these two ancient populations. Of particular interest are also the Oxhide ingot, which perhaps came from Cyprus and was discovered in various locations, including the Cagliari area, in the province of Ogliastra and other central areas. Between 1300 and 1200 BC in central-southern Sardinia was produced a kind of gray pottery also called \\"gray Sardinian\\"; remains of this type of pottery have been found in Kommos, Crete, and at Cannatello near Agrigento, Sicily.Ceramiche. Storia, linguaggio e prospettive in Sardegna, p.34 ===Punic and Roman period=== As witnessed by the ancient sources (Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica and Pausanias, Description of Greece) since the sixth century BC this population opposed fiercely to the domination of Carthage. After the end of the First Punic War in 238 BC the Romans occupied the main strongholds of the Punic Sardinia, but the people of the interior opposed even to the new invaders. In 227 BC, Corsica and Sardinia became the second Roman province (the first was Sicily). The outbreak of the Second Punic War and the victories of Hannibal in the Italian Peninsula provoked new stirrings of rebellion in Sardinia where, after the Roman defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Sardinian-Punic landowner and military Hampsicora, helped by the Carthaginians and by Ilienses, organized a new uprising. In 215 BC the rebels were defeated and massacred in the battle of Decimomannu by Titus Manlius Torquatus and so Carthage lost the island definitively. In Roman times the Ilienses and the Balares of the interior continued to resist, but in 177 BC they were heavily defeated by the consul Tiberius Gracchus the Elder who killed or enslaved about 80,000 Sardinians. However still in imperial time they were not completely subjugated by Rome and continued to live relatively independently in the central region called Barbagia. ==Ilienses / Iolaes tribes (Iolei)== *Acconites (Acconiti) *Aechilenenses / Aichilenses / Cornenses (Aichilensi) / Cornenses Pelliti, they dwelt south of the Æsaronenses and north of the Rucensi. *Barbaricini (in the region later known as Barbagia) *Beronicenses (Beronicensi) *Campani (Patulcenses Campani) *Caralitani (Carales, today's Cagliari, was in their territory) *Carenses, they dwelt south of the Coracenses and north of the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses. *Celsitani, they dwelt south of the Rucensi and north of the Scapitani and the Siculensi. *Corpicenses, they dwelt south of the Rucensi and north of the Scapitani and the Siculensi. *Cunusitani / Cusinitani / Celesitani, they dwelt south of the Coracenses and north of the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses. *Galillenses (Galillesi) *Martenses *Mauri (Paleo-Sardinian tribe) *Moddoli *Neapolitani, they dwelt south of the Scapitani and the Siculenses and north of the Solcitani and the Noritani. *Noritani / Norenses, they dwelt at the extreme south part of the island, immediately south of the Neapolitani and the Valentini (not to be confused with the Nurritani or Nurrenses) *Parati *Rubri / Rubrinses / Alticienses *Rucensi, they dwelt south of the Æchilenenses (also called Cornenses) and north of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses *Salcitani, they dwelt south of the Carenses and the Cunusitani and north of the Æsaronenses. *Scapitani, they dwelt south of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses and north of the Neapolitani and the Valentini *Semilitenses (Semilitensi) / Maltamonenses (Maltamonensi) *Siculenses (Siculesi), they dwelt south of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses and north of the Neapolitani and the Valentini.

In 1911 he joined Richmond in the Victorian Football League and made his debut in their Round 1 clash with Collingwood. He scored two goals in the loss to Carlton in Round 5, where again it was noted that “Jones again showed up well in the matter of marking, but failed lamentably in shooting for goal.” In early 1913 Jones moved to Melbourne after failing to gain a place in Richmond’s team in the first few weeks of the season but he never played a senior game for Melbourne.

A total of 1,205 athletes (907 men and 298 women) participated in a rain-affected games which had only one clear day out of the ten scheduled. The hosting of the event, originally planned for 1974, had met trouble from the start. Carlos Comacho, the Governor of Guam in 1972, had been opposed to spending any government money on the games. With a new Governor in office in late 1973, the games were rescheduled for 1975. However, preparations for the events did not progress smoothly, and visiting teams were disappointed with the condition of some of the venues and the scheduling in the middle of the rainy season. The games went ahead despite the logistical problems. Sixteen South Pacific Games records were broken in the track and field athletics events alone. Guam's basketball gold medal win by the men's team captained by Tony Susuico was the highlight of the Games for the hosting country. ==Participating countries== Thirteen Pacific nations or territories competed at the Games: Note: A number in parentheses indicates the size of a country's team (where known). ==Sports== There were 16 sports contested at the 1975 South Pacific Games: Note: A number in parentheses indicates how many medal events were contested in that sport (where known). ==Medal table== New Caledonia topped the (unofficial) medal count. ==Notes== Team sizes were reported before the Games for several countries including: American Samoa, New Hebrides, and Papua New Guinea.

Weightlifting: medals were awarded only for total lift in each weight class. The medal table as reported in Pacific Islands Monthly at the conclusion of the Games is used as the source here. An incomplete medal tally was published on the official Pacific Games Council webpage (as at May 2015).

From 2003 to 2008, he had small roles in several films and television shows, where he was typecast as the comical sidekick. He also appeared in some independent films. Marquez then appeared in TV5's Lokomoko (2008–2013), Tropa Mo Ko Unli (2013–2015), and played the titular superhero character in Kapitan Awesome (2012–2013). He also portrayed Chiz in the 2015 sitcom Mac & Chiz. In 2018, he had a supporting role in the television drama Since I Found You and also co-starred in the film Kusina Kings. ==Life and career== Julius Erman Ramos Marquez was born in Baliuag, Bulacan on July 3, 1981. He is the eldest among seven siblings, and his parents separated when he was in sixth grade. He earned his college degree in mass communication with the intention of becoming a DJ. In 2003, Marquez won the Mr. Suave look-alike contest on ABS-CBN's Magandang Tanghali Bayan. Aside from the cash prize, he was also awarded a role in the film, which starred Vhong Navarro as the title character. He also became a co-host of MTB Ang Saya-Saya for a year. Marquez was signed to Star Magic from 2003 to 2007, and moved to TV5 in 2008. During this time, he had small roles in several films and television shows where he was typecast as the comical sidekick. He also appeared in the independent films Sa Aking Pagkakagising Mula Sa Kamulatan (2005) and Carnivore (2008), both directed by Ato Bautista and starring Carlo Aquino. In TV5, Marquez appeared in the sketch comedy show Lokomoko, which aired from 2008 to 2013 – the network's longest-running comedy show. He then played the titular superhero character in Kapitan Awesome (2012–2013), and became a cast member of Tropa Mo Ko Unli (2013–2015). He considers the 2015 sitcom Mac & Chiz as his \\"big break\\", where he co-starred as Chiz, alongside Derek Ramsay who played Mac. In 2017, Marquez returned to ABS-CBN and became part of the comedy gag show Banana Sundae.

Against expectations, Kita Kita went on to become the highest-grossing Filipino independent film of all time, earning ₱300 million (approx. US$5.88 million) within three weeks of release.

By archaeological building research in 2009 the timber frame of the barn was determined to date back to 1263.http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-archief/armenhoef-blijkt-een-rijke- vondst~a3453471 The modern farmhouse itself dates from a much later period and was built in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680. The farm is a monument and was in urgent need of restoration. The government was prepared to provide a contribution to this restoration. Also, the building has been recognized as a monument. This deviates from state policy not to designate buildings dating from the period before 1940 as a national monument. The name of the farm has to do with the former function. Armenhoef means Poor People Farm. The proceeds of this then-largest farm in Best were used for poor aid. The municipality has recognized the building as a municipal monument because of its cultural, historical, architectural and scenic value. Elements such as the age, the integrity of the farm and the function for poor relief played a role. To the state, the age of the farm and the rare building characteristics, such as the barn overhang above the north facade, was decisive for admission to the qualification procedure as a national monument.Oudste boerderij van Nederland wordt rijksmonument == References  External links == * Category:Brabant Category:Medieval Netherlands Category:History of North Brabant Category:Farms in the Netherlands Category:Archaeology of the Netherlands Category:Best, Netherlands ","title":"Armenhoef"},{"id":"46780164","text":"Frederick Richard Larkin (21 March 1888 – 22 August 1969) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1888 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Richmond Football Club players ","title":"Fred Larkin"},{"id":"46780175","text":"Percicval Lee Speakman (5 November 1885 – 12 May 1933) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1885 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Richmond Football Club players ","title":"Percy Speakman"},{"id":"46780182","text":"George Leopold Rankine (4 November 1884 – 26 July 1945), known as \\"Leo\\", was an Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==Family== The son of Henry George Rankine, and Eva Anne Rankine, née Crossley, George Leopold Rankine was born at Warrnambool on 4 November 1884.

In May 2015, he was put under investigation by the Communist Party of China's anti-corruption agency. An alternate member of the Central Committee from 2007 until his downfall, Yu was duly expelled from the party and lost his Central Committee seat in 2015 and was sentenced to 11 years in jail.http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/xwtt/201510/t20151016_63607.html ==Career== Yu was born in Gongcheng Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi, in January 1964. He joined the Communist Party of China while attending university in December 1984. In 1986 he graduated from Guangxi Agricultural College (later merged into Guangxi University, majoring in agriculture.

In 1995, he had joined the party organization in Qinzhou, and ascended through the ranks there. By 1998, he had assumed the post of deputy head of the provincial department of personnel. During his political career, Yu continued further education at the provincial party school, the Minzu University of China, and Guangxi University, eventually earning a master's degree in law.

He was a steel industry executive and participated in mergers that unified much of the American steel industry. Later, continuing an association with J. P. Morgan, he was the first president of Bankers Trust. Late in his life, the U.S. Steel founder ( not the founder, please cite source) consolidated 20 farms to create the tract known as Conyers Farm in Greenwich, Connecticut. Conyers Farm remained unoccupied for 15 years after Converse's death. ==Early life and career== Converse was born in Boston. After graduating from Boston Latin School in 1869, he secured an apprenticeship in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, with National Tube Works. He held several patents on improvements to tubing, such as lock-joints. After his innovations brought in several million dollars in sales, he became general manager of the company in 1889. Converse purchased a lot on 78th Street in New York City from railroad executive Henry H. Cook in the late 1890s. He had C. P. H. Gilbert build his house at 3 East 78th Street. Converse moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, several years later, buying 20 farms and consolidating them into the Conyers Farm, which he named after the Old English spelling of his family name. In addition to cows, pigs and poultry, the farm had apple, pear and peach orchards; butter, eggs and milk were produced there. Conyers Farm was unoccupied from Converse's 1921 death to 1936. Since the farm began accommodating luxury homes in the 1980s, several celebrities have lived there, including Tom Cruise, Ron Howard and Jessica Biel. In 1899, he and William Nelson Cromwell facilitated the J. P. Morgan-funded merger of National Tube Works with 20 other companies, resulting in an enterprise known as the National Tube Company. Within two years, another Morgan-financed merger resulted in U.S. Steel. Converse became the president of two banks in 1903, Liberty National Bank and Bankers Trust. He led Liberty National Bank until 1907 and Bankers Trust until 1913. He was the president of Astor Trust Company from 1907 to 1917, when it was merged with Bankers Trust. He served on the board of directors of U.S. Steel until 1916. ==Baseball== After the Pittsburgh Alleghenys baseball team in the American Association experienced a very poor season in 1883, they elected Converse, a substantial shareholder in the club, as team president. The team got worse in 1884, but after that season Converse found out that the Columbus Buckeyes were disbanding and sent manager Horace Phillips to Columbus to recruit the players. Phillips enlisted almost all of them, poising the Alleghenys for significant improvement. Converse did not reach a second season as president, though, as William A. Nimick took over the position. ==Personal life== Portrait of Benjamin Thompson given to Harvard University by the bequest of Converse Converse engaged in philanthropic activities. In 1912, Converse financed the first endowed chair at the Harvard Business School. Four years later, he donated $250,000 to establish a library at Amherst College, the alma mater of his brother James. The Converse Library was dedicated in November 1917. In 1879, Converse was married to Jessie MacDonough Green. She died in 1912, several months after undergoing an operation for appendicitis. Two years later, the 64-year-old Converse married Mary Edith Dunshee, who was 48. Dunshee was the sister of Converse's brother's widow. Converse's son, Edmund, Jr., owned the Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy in Ventura County, California. A daughter, Antoinette, moved to Germany after marrying Baron von Romberg, who died in World War I. Another daughter, Katherine, married one of her father's protégés, Benjamin Strong, Jr.; Strong was a president of Bankers Trust and governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ==Death== Converse died at the Huntington Hotel of heart problems in 1921. Local press coverage after his death included the unsubstantiated assertion that Converse may have been murdered. Upon his death, his estate was valued at US$21,000,000 ($ today), most of which was willed to colleges, charities and family members. Among the willed items was a portrait of Benjamin Thompson, which was thought to be worth $75,000 in 1912; it was bequeathed to Harvard University. ==References== Category:1849 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Boston Latin School alumni Category:Businesspeople from Boston Category:Major League Baseball team presidents Category:Pittsburgh Pirates executives Category:U.S. Steel Category:Trust Company of America people ","title":"Edmund C.

He then made peace and was restored to royal favour following the Treaty of Mellifont. Conn's mother was Catherine O'Neill, Countess of Tyrone, from the Magennis family of Iveagh. Conn was left behind when Tyrone, his wife Catherine and other supporters departed Ireland during the Flight of the Earls in 1607. He was taken into the custody of the Crown and was taken to England and attended Eton College. However Conn quickly became the focus of plots to make him the figurehead of an uprising, notably the Ulster Conspiracy of 1615. For security reasons he was taken out of Eton and transferred to the Tower of London to prevent a further outbreak of violence in Ireland similar to O'Doherty's Rebellion in 1608. Following the death of three of his elder brothers in exile, Conn move up the line of succession. His father died in Rome in 1616, and Conn's elder brother John O'Neill succeeded him.

Although they had written many songs together as teenagers, they decided to form a band in 2013 after Katie, a singer-songwriter, graduated from the Berklee College of Music, where Ben had also studied. Ben is also the drummer for the band Savoir Adore. The duo took the name Paperwhite from the flower species narcissus papyraceus, also known as paperwhites; Katie worked at a florist during her years at Berklee and had written a song called \\"Paperwhites\\". Ben adopted the role of co-writing, producing, arranging and providing backing vocals to their music, while Katie focused on songwriting and singing. Paperwhite based themselves in Brooklyn, New York City and released their debut single, \\"Got Me Goin'\\", in January 2014, the same month as their first live show. They produced remixes for Deidre & the Dark (\\"Skeleton\\") and Fickle Friends (\\"Swim\\"). The duo premiered the single \\"Take Me Back\\" in July 2014 to positive reviews from Stereogum and Complex magazine's Pigeons & Planes blog. Their song \\"Pieces\\" was premiered on The Guardians music blog in October 2014, and Spin magazine's website streamed Paperwhite's debut EP, Magic, in November 2014. The duo performed at music festival SXSW in early 2015 and released \\"Get Away\\" on November 30, 2015. The music blog Vehlinggo said that Get Away was \\"genetically predisposed to make listeners dream big.\\" Billboard premiered the band's single \\"Unstoppable\\" on February 2, 2016 describing it as \\"starlit\\" and noting that Paperwhite had previously earned the title \\"Most Blogged Artist\\" twice on Hype Machine. Unstoppable was mastered by Chris Zane (St. Lucia, Passion Pit). Oblivious Pop stated that Unstoppable \\"hits you full force with a cosmic rush\\" and went on to say: \\"This duo keeps proving time and time again that they are fighting for the top spot, and with a smash this big they are miles in the lead.\\" On February 15, 2017, Paperwhite released their single \\"Human Nature\\". BuzzFeed named Paperwhite's single Wanderlust one of the 22 Most Summer-Ready Pop Songs of 2016. The band released their latest single, Only Us, on May 12, 2017. It was picked up on Spotify's New Music Friday playlist. The blog, GoingSolo, called it \\"super summery\\" and \\"a feast of dreamy synth stabs, bold melodies and pounding electronic percussions\\" Paperwhite initially drew inspiration from pop music of the 1980s for their output, as well as from acts such as Aphex Twin, Daft Punk, Depeche Mode, Marvin Gaye, Postal Service, Tears for Fears, and Stevie Wonder. Contemporary artists that the band have cited as influences include ASTR, Beyoncé, Broods, Chvrches, Kate Boy, and Janelle Monáe.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on 27 May 2015 into Steam Early Access and left it on 30 June 2015. A later update for the game introduced builds for OS X and Linux on 15 October 2015. A PlayStation 4 port of Ronin was released on 1 November 2016. == Gameplay == Ronin has a stealth-based business complex level design, which the designer Tomasz Wacławek described as a rip-off from Tom Francis' Gunpoint. The player needs to avoid being seen by the guards and use the surprise moment for silent kills. Once in a fight situation, the player has to dodge the guards' attacks and get the right angle to defeat them. == Plot == Ronin is about a young girl, known as the \\"Rōnin\\", who has lost her father for unknown reasons and the only thing she has left is a photo of five former associates of her father, responsible for his death. The Rōnin is now in charge of self-justice by taking revenge upon those five persons, one at a time. == Development and release == Ronin was originally created for the itch.io \\"Cyberpunk\\" Game Jam, it was submitted under the user name teedoubleu in March 2014. Although it didn't get any high ratings, the highest being place #88 in the category \\"Relevance\\", it won the Developer's Showcase and Jury Award at the World of Gamedev Knowledge Conference 2014 (WGK) in Gdańsk, Poland. After having gained a new artist, Łukasz Piskorz, the game's graphics were polished up from pixel art to high-quality 2D art. This change was done not only to make it look better, but also to distinguish it from Gunpoint. Piotr Iwanicki, creative director of Superhot and part of the WGK award jury, gave Wacławek then the idea of handing Ronin over to Devolver Digital, and so he did. Their first public collaborative announcement was the release of Ronin's reveal trailer. After a longer silent development phase, Wacławek released an updated version of the original Ronin game jam entry, using the new graphics, soundtrack and functions of the full game, to its itch.io page on 20 April 2015, therefore recalling the page from \\"RONIN\\" to \\"RONIN Demo\\". The game was initially released onto Steam Early Access on 24 May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, however, the OS X and Linux versions were taken down due to their instability. The game left Early Access on 30 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows only. On 18 June 2015, it was announced that Ronin would be ported to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. On 15 October 2015, update #9 for the game introduced builds for OS X and Linux. On 1 November 2016, the port of Ronin for PlayStation 4 was released. == Reception == Ronin generally received positive reviews. The review aggregator Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version of Ronin a score of 70/100, based on 39 reviews. Reviers praised the game's overall design concept and the alikeness with Gunpoint. Though, people still differentiated them, where Phil Savage from PC Gamer stated that Ronin is \\"the schlocky B-movie to Gunpoint more cerebral stealth-puzzling\\". Something that was not as well received was the repetitivity of some levels, as Matt Porter from Hooked Gamers wrote: \\"Each of the five people you have to kill are in the same type of boring office building\\". Ronins lowest review rating, was given by Steven Bogos from The Escapist, who gave the game a low score of a 2/5, stating that \\"Ronin is a remarkably average game. When it works, it's kind of fun, but there just isn't enough here to maintain interest, and it has nothing that we haven't seen before\\". == References  External links == * Category:2015 video games Category:Action video games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:GameMaker Studio games Category:Linux games Category:Video games about ninja Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in Poland Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games Category:Early access video games ","title":"Ronin (video game)"},{"id":"46780331","text":"Elm Park (foaled 23 January 2012) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse. As a two-year-old he became regarded as a leading contender for the 2015 British Classic Races after wins in the Royal Lodge Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. In 2015 he finished third to Golden Horn and Jack Hobbs in the Dante Stakes but finished unplaced in The Derby. He later won the listed Fortune Stakes. ==Background== Elm Park is a bay horse with a white blaze bred in England by the Berkshire-based Kingsclere Stud. He is the first major winner sired by Phoenix Reach, an Irish-bred, British-trained horse whose wins included the Canadian International Stakes, Hong Kong Vase and Dubai Sheema Classic. Elm Park's dam, Lady Brora, was a moderate performer who won one minor race at Great Leighs Racecourse from twelve starts in 2008 and 2009. She was a distant descendant of Own Sister, a full-sister of the leading sire Son-in-Law. Elm Park was sent into training with Andrew Balding at Kingsclere. He began his racing career in the ownership of the Kingsclere Racing Club but was later bought by Qatar Racing. ==Racing career2014: two-year-old season=== Elm Park made his debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Sandown Park Racecourse on 30 July. Ridden by David Probert he showed his inexperience (\\"ran green\\") and finished third of the eight runners behind the 8/15 favourite Latharnach. In a similar event at Newbury Racecourse on 15 August he started favourite against twelve opponents and won by three lengths having taken the lead two furlongs from the finish. Two weeks later the colt was stepped up in class and distance and started favourite for the Listed Stonehenge Stakes over one mile at Salisbury Racecourse. He led from the start and drew away in the final furlong to win by three lengths. Andrea Atzeni took over from Probert when Elm Park contested the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 27 September. He started the 11/4 second favourite behind the Barry Hills-trained Nafaqa, who had won the Listed Flying Scotsman Stakes at Doncaster earlier in the month. Elm Park appeared to stumble exiting the starting stalls and again a furlong out but recovered to take the lead 100 yards from the finish and won by a length from Nafaqa, with a gap of four lengths back to Salateen in third. On his final appearance of the season Elm Park was stepped up to Group One class for the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on 25 October and was made 13/8 favourite against seven opponents headed by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Jacobean. The colt was sent into the lead by Atzeni after a quarter of a mile and set the pace before pulling away in the final furlong to win by two and three quarter lengths from the O'Brien second-string Aloft. ===2015: three-year-old season=== Elm Park was initially aimed at the 2000 Guineas but was withdrawn from the race as Balding felt that he would have been unsuited by the prevailing firm ground. On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Elm Park contested the Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, a major trial for the 2015 Epsom Derby which attracted a strong field. The colt started 7/2 second favourite behind Jack Hobbs, with the other contenders including John F Kennedy, Nafaqa, Golden Horn (winner of the Feilden Stakes) and Ol' Man River (Beresford Stakes). Elm Park took the lead three furlongs from the finish but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind Golden Horn and Jack Hobbs. On 6 June, Elm Park, ridden by Atzeni, started the 9/1 fourth choice in the betting for the 236th running of the Epsom Derby. He started quickly and battled for the lead with Hans Holbein in the early stages as Atzeni struggled to restrain him. He was still among the leaders in the straight but tired badly in the last quarter mile and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Golden Horn. Elm Park was off the course for more than three months after the Derby, before eventually reappearing in the Listed Fortune Stakes over one mile on soft ground at Sandown on 16 September. Starting the 4/7 favourite he took the lead after two furlongs and won \\"comfortably\\"Racing Post by two lengths from the six-year-old Gabrial. The colt was then moved back up to Group One class for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse a month later and started a 16/1 outsider. He led from the start but was overtaken approaching the final furlong and finished fifth of the nine runners behind Solow. ==Assessment== In the official International Classification for 2014, Elm Park was given a rating of 117, making him the third best two-year-old colt in Europe behind Belardo and the Middle Park Stakes winner Charming Thought. ==Pedigree== *Through his dam, Elm Park was inbred 4 x 4 to Sharpen Up, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – Elm Park Category:2012 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 5-d ","title":"Elm Park (horse)"},{"id":"46780339","text":"Galen Benjamin Seaman (August 8, 1837 - September 12, 1932) was an American lawyer and politician.

He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain and its successor the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for most of the years between 1784 and 1807. == Early life and family == Langston was the oldest son of James Langston and his wife Sarah, of Sarsden House in Oxfordshire. In 1784 he married Sarah Goddard, daughter of John Goddard of Woodford Hall, Essex. They had one son (James Langston) and four daughters. == Inheritance == Langston was probably educated at Eton. He had a generous inheritance from his father, who died in 1795. As well as being a wine merchant in London, James Langston was a deputy governor of the Bank of England and founder of the merchant bank of Langston, Towgood and Amory. John inherited a partnership in the bank, shares in the British East India Company, the Sarsden and Churchill estates in Oxfordshire, and £300,000 (equivalent to £ in ). == Career == Langston was a director of the Sun Fire Office from 1794 until his death. He aimed to buy himself a place in Parliament, but never found a safe seat. At the 1784 election he was returned after a contest as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Sudbury, an open borough with a reputation for venality where the government backed his candidacy. At the next election, in 1790, he contested Bridgwater in the interest of the 4th Earl Poulett. The Earl of Egmont had funded his son Viscount Perceval to contest the seat, but Langston and Poulett's brother Vere won by a comfortable margin. Having joined the opposition, Langston was no longer acceptable to Poulett, so he turned instead to Minehead, where opposition was mounting to the \\"overbearing conduct\\" of the borough's patron John Fownes Luttrell, whose Dunster Castle-based family had dominated the borough for most of the period since its 16th-century enfranchisement. Langston bought some building land in Alcombe, within the borough, from a Quaker William Davis who had advertised for a wealthy challenger. There he rapidly built some houses to register voters, and nominated himself and his wife's brother-in-law Admiral Charles Morice Pole. At the election in 1796 John Fownes Lutrell held his own seat, but Langston defeated his brother Thomas Fownes Luttrell. Luttrell rallied his support by the next election in 1802, and defeated Langston, whose illegal treating of voters after the arrival of the writ, had not been enough to win. An election petition was prepared, but after a period of negotiations, Langston sold all his Minehead interests to Fownes Luttrell. Out of Parliament, Langston was Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1804–05. He was returned to the Commons in March 1806 for the Irish rotten borough of Portarlington, whose patron the 2nd Earl of Portarlington accommodated Langston as a favour to the Prince of Wales. At the general election in 1806, Langston returned to Bridgwater, where he won a contested election with Vere Poulett again returned as his running-mate. However, by 1807 the earl had disowned his brother's politics, and Langston withdrew. Langston never returned to Parliament, and died in 1811, aged about 54. == References == Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1758 births Category:1812 deaths Category:People from West Oxfordshire District Category:People educated at Eton College Category:English investment bankers Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1784–1790 Category:British MPs 1790–1796 Category:British MPs 1796–1800 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1801–1802 Category:UK MPs 1802–1806 Category:UK MPs 1806–1807 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Portarlington Category:High Sheriffs of Oxfordshire ","title":"John Langston (MP)"},{"id":"46780389","text":"Marlon Chenjeria Brutus (born 10 October 1980) is a Sint Maartener cricketer.

Its members settled historically in Sidon in Lebanon with a large branch that also grew in Damascus in Syria, and a much smaller presence also in Acre ('Akka) mainly in pre-1948 Palestine. == Origin == Traditionalist Arab/Levantine genealogists (nuqaba’ Sayda wa Dimashq) who established the family-tree noted that the El- Bizri descent comes from the lineage of the Imam Husayn ibn Ali as 'Sheriffs' (Ashraf). Following Arab clan lineages, which are recorded as well as transmitted orally, the El-Bizri line is traced back to the grandfather of the family al-Siyyid ‘Abd’Allah al-Bizri al-Sidawi, who is linked to the descendants of al-Siyyid Ja’far al-Tawwab al-Rabhi, known as ¨Abi al-Banin¨ جعفر بن علي الهادي, who is the son of al-Imam al-Hadi and the uncle of the hidden and awaited Imam al-Mahdi ( الإمام مهدي المنتظر). (His grandfather is al-Imam Muhammad al-Jawwad, ibn al-Imam ‘Ali al-Rida, ibn al-Imam Musa al- Kazim, ibn al-Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq, ibn al-Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, ibn al-Imam ‘Ali Zayn al-‘Abidin, ibn al-Imam Husayn). The El-Bizri family is a bearer of the historical titles ‘Husayni’ and ‘Ridwi’ (in a respective attribution of their lineage to Imam al-Husayn and Imam al-Rida). Although being Ashraf who descend from the Husayni and Ridwi line, they are not Shi’a and for a long time they have been associated with the Sunni Hanafi tradition in Islam, perhaps under influences from the Ottoman era in the Levant. The ancient lineage of the family is safeguarded in the records of its elders, and the clerics who search for genealogies (ansab al-ashraf) confirmed the old family- tree manuscript that is traced on papyrus . Many of the young members of the El-Bizri family are not aware of their Arabian lineage, let alone that tradition links their clan history with the descendants from the tree of the Imam al-Husayn bin 'Ali, or that they have migrated historically from the eastern regions of the Fertile Crescent to Damascus and the Lebanese coast. == Modern Times == In modern times, the El-Bizri family (Bizri or Al-Bizri) contributed to the social, economic and political life in Sidon and Damascus in the wider Levantine context. Their role from the late Ottoman period, at the end of the nineteenth century, then throughout the forming of the greater Lebanon and its history till the end of the twentieth century (especially in Sidon) was notable. This was mainly felt on the political scene. They were mainly civil servants, notaries, merchants, army officers, and muftis in the late Ottoman era, and had a bond in marriage with a branch of the famed Abaza clan that came from Egypt to settle in Sidon at the end of the nineteenth century. ==Politics== This sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between the pro-Palestinian Sunni Muslims and the anti-Palestinian Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and the Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, the Christians have gradually returned to their hometowns. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon). The local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El- Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament. The El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Taki El-Din Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saab Salam, father of the current Lebanese prime minister, Tamam Salam. The presence of the El- Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service. The Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. They remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family started to rise to prominence and it became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The politics of Sidon is similar to that of the traditional old cities of the Levant in the sense of being family- based. In broad terms one could say that the El-Bizri family had an influence since Ottoman times, and then most significantly across almost the entirety of the 20th century. It was local in impact at first, but then the members of this family became influential within the Lebanese state and institutions, and they supported the Solh family that had successive Prime Ministers and that moved its power base from Sidon to Beirut. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and up till today. Maarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). As for the Hariri family, they are regionally focused on Saudi orientations in politics. The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the middle 1990s. It is now one of the most organized in political terms and it follows modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes but that is usually seen as a Sunni political movement with regional weight due to its close ties with Saudi Arabia. == El Bizri Notable Members == The names of many notable members of the El-Bizri family in the twentieth century are listed on the Sidon Wikipedia webpage with additional Wiki-links and external references.

Pyotr Ricord was born in 1776 in the family of the prime major of Carabinier Ingermanland Regiment; he graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps; he began military service in the Baltic Fleet and got his first war decoration for the distinction in the landing operation on the coast of the Netherlands in 1799, it was the 4th class of the Order of St. Anne. In 1803–1805 among the twelve best naval officers, he was sent as a volunteer to the British Fleet to improve Russian maritime practices. At that time he made sea trips to almost all British maritime dominions and took part in the war with France and Spain. In 1807–1809 Ricord took part as a senior officer in Vasily Golovnin's world cruise on the ship Diana. He was awarded with the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th class \\"for the excellent performance of his office on the sloop \\"Diana\\" and for his help and assistance rendered to the captain of the sloop\\" and in particular \\"for the preservation of people's health.\\" In 1810–1811 he participated in the hydrographic exploration of the North Pacific, and he was awarded with the Order of St. George 4th class for 18 six-month maritime campaigns.

On 21 March 1848, a demonstration with 10,000 people gathered on the plaza in front of Christiansborg Palace, demanding a new government and democratic reforms. The king immediately agreed and the Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849. The statue was created on the initiative of a committee chaired by Carl Ploug to commemorate the monarch's role in ensuring Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. It was financed through contributions from the Danish state, the City of Copenhagen and private donations. Herman Wilhelm Bissen was charged with the design of the statue which was later completed by his son Vilhelm Bissen. It was cast by Parisian bronze casters at Vilhelm Bissen's workshop at Carlsberg.

From the 1990s, the company diversified into online payments with Axime, which gave birth - after its merger with Sligos \\\\- to the Atos Group. === 2004–2014: integration into Atos === In 2004, Atos integrated its payment and online services activities into a division then called Atos Worldline. In 2006, Atos Worldline included in its scope the Belgian companies Banksys, responsible for securing and guaranteeing electronic payments in Belgium, and Bank Card Company (BCC), specializing in the management of payment systems linked to the country's two largest credit card networks, Visa and MasterCard. The two companies, employing around 1,100 people with a turnover of 309 million euros, were bought out from their four shareholders: Dexia, Fortis, ING, and KBC. In 2010, Atos Worldline acquired and integrated the Indian company Venture Infotek for around 100 million dollars. The company, specializing in payment and transaction processing, had merchants, as well as banks and government programs, as clients locally. In 2011, Atos acquired the IT services activities of Siemens, which also included electronic transaction activities, which were integrated into its Worldline division. In 2012, Atos Worldline acquired and integrated Quality Equipment, a Dutch electronic payment company, for an unknown amount. In 2013, Atos branched out its Atos Worldline division, giving it more autonomy. In 2014, Atos partially listed Worldline for 26.59% of its holdings worth 575 million euros, valuing Worldline at a capitalization of 2.1 billion euros. === Since 2014: consolidator of European payments === In November 2015, Worldline merged its electronic financial transaction processing activities with Equens, a Dutch company. As part of this merger, Worldline paid out 72 million euros and owned 63.6% of the created equensWorldline Company, the rest being held by the shareholders of Equens, Dutch, German and Italian banks. In the context of this merger, Worldline acquired the possibility in the long term to acquire the remaining shares of these banks. In July 2017, Worldline announced the acquisition of the Swedish company Digital River World Payments (DRWP) for an undisclosed amount. The company, founded in 1997 and based in Stockholm, generated annual sales of 37 million dollars. Next, Worldline acquired First Data Baltics, a subsidiary of First Data Corp in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia for approximately 73 million euros. These three subsidiaries generated a turnover of 23 million euros in 2016, employing around 200 people. In May 2018, Worldline acquired SIX Payment Services (Europe) SA, the payment services division of the Swiss group SIX, for € 2.3 billion, mainly financed by the issue of new actions. With the integration of SIX Payment Services’ 1,600 employees and merchant acquisition activities and services serving more than 200,000 merchants for an income of around 530 million euros, Worldline gained a 30% increase in turnover as well as a number one place in Switzerland, Austria, and Luxembourg. Worldline's ambition through this operation was to create a European payment champion. In January 2019, Atos, which then had a 50.8% stake, announced the sale by an exchange of shares of a 23.4% stake in Worldline to its shareholders. === Since 2019: Worldline becomes an independent company === In May 2019, Worldline gained independence when Atos’ shareholders approved the plan to redistribute 23.4% of Worldline shares to their investors. Atos still remained Worldline’s main shareholder at 27% just ahead of the SIX Group but lost the possibility to control its finances. In September 2019, Worldline announced the completion of the acquisition of the 36.4% minority interest in equensWorldline, hence becoming the sole owner of equensWorldline. In February 2020, Worldline announced the acquisition of Ingenico, the world leader in the payment terminal market, for 7.8 billion euros subject to the green light from the competition regulators. The shareholders of Worldline would retain a 65% stake and those of Ingenico 35%. Following this announcement, Atos announced the sale of a 13.1% stake, keeping only a 3.8% stake in Worldline. In parallel, Bpifrance announced the increase of its stake in the Company. In March 2020, Worldline entered the CAC 40, the flagship index of the Paris stock market, which mainly reflected the evolution of the Group's liquidity and market capitalization from 2.2 billion euros in June 2014 at the time of its listing on the stock exchange to more than 11 billion euros when it entered the CAC 40. In April 2020, Worldline announced the acquisition of GoPay through the purchase of 53% of its shares. The company also announced the contemplated purchase of all remaining shares for 2022. GoPay is a specialist in online payments in Eastern Europe. Through this acquisition, Worldline intended to reinforce its offers to merchants and to strengthen its position in Eastern and Central Europe. In May 2020, its CEO Gilles Grapinet announced the creation of EDPIA (the European Digital Payment Industry Alliance), a professional organization bringing together the main European companies specializing in electronic payments (Ingenico, Nets, Nexi, and Worldline), and which has set itself the objective of better coordinating the representation of major industrialists in the sector with European authorities and other stakeholders in the payments ecosystem. Gilles Grapinet is its first president. == Activities == Worldline's revenue was divided, in 2018, as follows: * Merchant services (36.3%). * Financial services (45.2%). * Mobility & transactional web services (18.5%) === Fintech === In July 2017, Worldline and the oil Group Total joined forces to finance the deployment of a digital one-stop solution in Africa, designed by the Senegalese startup InTouch, specialized in Fintech. === New payment methods === In spring 2017, Worldline developed in collaboration with the Belgian bank Belfius the first smartphone payment application in Belgium. == Management == * CEO (since July 2013) and President (since October 2019): Gilles Grapinet * Deputy CEO (since July 2013): Marc-Henri Desportes == Shareholders == List of main shareholders as of March 17, 2020. {  SIX Group Ltd. 16.00 % - Capital Research & Management Co. 5,25 % - Wellington Management Co.

He played college basketball for Fresno State and the University of Washington. ==College career== Upshaw played high school basketball for San Joaquin Memorial High School in his hometown of Fresno, California. A top 100 recruit, he originally committed to play college basketball for Kansas State University, but was released from his commitment when Wildcats head coach Frank Martin left for another job. He then chose local Fresno State, where as a freshman in the 2012–13 season he averaged 4.1 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. In the summer after his freshman season, Upshaw was dismissed from the Bulldogs for violations of team rules. The 7'0\\" center then transferred to Washington.

At the NBA Draft combine, Upshaw measured as one of the tallest players in attendance (an even seven feet tall in shoes) with the longest standing reach and wingspan. He was projected as a late first-round or early second-round selection, but went undrafted, likely due to his personal issues. In July 2015, he joined the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2015 NBA Summer League, where he averaged a mere 1.4 points and 2.2 rebounds per game. Upshaw felt there was more in him than his Summer League showing, and after dropping 20 pounds, he signed with the Lakers for training camp on September 14, 2015. He was later waived by the Lakers on October 20 after appearing in four preseason games. On October 31, 2015, he was acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Lakers. Upshaw received consistent minutes for the D-Fenders throughout the season before losing his spot in the rotation in late February 2016. On March 11, 2016, his contract was terminated by the D-League for violating the league's anti-drug program. In 28 games (two starts) for the D-Fenders in 2015–16, he averaged 7.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 15.6 minutes per game. ===BC Kalev/Cramo (2016)=== On September 1, 2016, Upshaw signed with BC Kalev/Cramo of the Estonian League.

The election was held simultaneously with local elections all throughout Spain. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Barcelona (, ) was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Barcelona, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Barcelona and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the eldest one would be elected. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates.

The topic was common in the Soviet Union. On the stamps of the USSR, Lenin was most frequently portrayed among the Bolsheviks. After 1923, his pictures were present on about 11% of all Soviet stamps. Lenin portrait first appeared on a stamp series that was the printed immediately after his death in 1924. Images of the first Soviet leader soon became ubiquitous. Because of various Lenin representations on postage stamps, it is hardly possible to categorise them all. Among different ways and roles in which Lenin was shown, there were: * his simple portraits, * Lenin as a child and youth, * Lenin as the organiser of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, * Lenin as the founder of the first socialist state, * Lenin as the organiser of the Party press, * Lenin as an inspirer of Soviet organisations and activities, etc. There was even a stamp depicting Vladimir Lenin near a New Year's tree celebrating the holiday with children.

He played college football at Cal State Fullerton. ==Early years== Stewart was born in the West Indies (Kingston), Jamaica on August 24, 1964. In December 1977, his family migrated to Canada to avoid the political turmoil of his native country. He eventually moved to the United States. Stewart first played high school football at Malverne High School in Malverne, New York before transferring to play football at Uniondale High School in Uniondale, New York. ==College career== He moved on to Nassau Community College but did not play football. He began his college career at Fresno City College for two seasons and earned J.C. Grid-Wire All-American honors. He later moved on to the University of Southern California. After the firing of head coach Ted Tollner and not playing in any games, he decided to transfer to Cal State Fullerton to play out his final year of eligibility. As a senior, he was played mostly at nose guard. After being slowed by injuries early on the year, he finished with 38 tackles and 9 sacks in eight games. He was named the North's outstanding defensive player (registering 3 sacks) at the 1988 Senior Bowl and also played in the 1989 Blue-Gray Game. ==Professional careerPre-draft measurables=== At the 1989 NFL scouting combine, he ran a 4.7 40-yard dash, had a 37.5 inches vertical leap, a 10-feet-3 broad jump and recorded 27 consecutive repetitions at 225 pounds in the bench press, which outdid almost every lineman. ===Minnesota Vikings=== Stewart was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the eight round (219th overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft to play defensive end, which was his natural position. He was in contention for a starting spot on the defensive line, until breaking his wrist a few weeks before the season. On October 12, he was sent to the Dallas Cowboys as part of the Herschel Walker trade. ===Dallas Cowboys=== When he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, he was still on the disabled list and spent his time on the practice squad. He was waived on November 9, 1989, after suspicions of steroid use. After waiving Stewart, the Cowboys threatened to waive the other Vikings players that came in the Herschel Walker trade, in order to get all of the conditional draft picks. Head coach Jimmy Johnson eventually had second thoughts on the February 1 deadline and traded three future draft choices (third-round and tenth-round in 1990 and a third-round in 1991) to the Vikings for the right to retain the original full package of draft choices, plus Issiac Holt, Jesse Solomon and David Howard. ===Houston Oilers=== On April 3, 1990, he signed as a free agent with the Houston Oilers. A sprained knee limited his play in training camp and was eventually cut. ===BC Lions=== Stewart was signed by the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in October 1995, but was released before the start of the season. ==Personal life== His brother Andrew Stewart played defensive end in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Despite Quick Career, Stewart Could Make Titan History Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:Sportspeople from Kingston, Jamaica Category:American football defensive ends Category:USC Trojans football players Category:Cal State Fullerton Titans football players Category:Fresno City Rams football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Jamaican emigrants to Canada Category:Nassau Community College alumni Category:Malverne High School alumni ","title":"Alex Stewart (American football)"},{"id":"46780681","text":"Visa requirements for Kiribati citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Kiribati.

That year she lived in Hvidsten Inn with her 72-year-old grandfather as inn keeper, her parents, brother and three sisters and a farm hand, a maid and a manager. She was confirmed Palm Sunday in Gassum church in 1941, while living in Hvidsten with her family. During the later stage of the occupation the family and other locals formed a resistance group, the Hvidsten group. With the group she helped the British Special Operations Executive parachute weapons and supplies into Denmark for distribution to the resistance. In March 1944 the Gestapo made an \\"incredible number of arrests\\" including in the region of Randers herself, her father the \\"nationally known folklore collector and keeper of Hvidsten inn Marius Fiil\\", her brother Niels Fiil, her oldest sister Kirstine and her brother-in-law Peter Sørensen. The following month De frie Danske reported on her father again, that he along with other arrestees from Hvidsten had been transferred from Randers to Vestre Fængsel. In June 1944 a court martial sentenced Fiil to two years in a juvenile prison. On 29 June 1944 her father, brother and brother-in-law and five other members of the Hvidsten group were executed in Ryvangen. On 15 July 1944 De frie Danske reported on the executions, her two-year prison sentence and the life sentence of her sister Kirstine and compared her father to Svend Gønge and Niels Ebbesen. Fiil and her sister were imprisoned separately in Germany, but she was soon after pardoned and returned to Denmark. In April 1945 Fiil was therefore able to join her mother in receiving her older sister in the Danish border town Padborg, to which Kirstine had been evacuated with the White Buses after also receiving a pardon. On 2 July 1945 the remains of her father and brother were found in Ryvangen and transferred to the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen. The remains of her brother-in-law and the five other executed members of the group were found in the same area three days later. The following inquests showed that they had been executed with gunshot wounds to the chest. On 10 July 1945 her executed family members and the five other executed group members were cremated at Bispebjerg Cemetery. Gerda Fiil died in Hvidsten on 26 June 1994, survived by her husband Svend Jessen. They are both buried in Spentrup cemetery. ==Portrayal in the media== * In the 2012 Danish drama film Hvidsten Gruppen (This Life) Gerda Fiil is portrayed by Laura Winther Møller. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Danish people of World War II Category:Danish resistance members ","title":"Gerda Fiil"},{"id":"46780708","text":"Raphael J.

He and his family emigrated to South Australia on the , under Captain John Finlay Duff, arriving at Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island on 6 November 1836. Hallett, who was a business associate of Duff and both part-owners of the ship, was one of those who remained on the island, at least in part to assist in a search party for group who on 1 November went ashore to hike along the north of the island, a trek that took much longer than anticipated. They intended rejoining the Africaine at Nepean Bay, an easy trek (so Captain Sutherland's 1919 book would have them believe) of around . Instead, the going was hard and there was little water to be found; their two- or three-day trek turned into over a week and the Africaine left Kingscote without them. Osborne took ill and could not continue; Dr. Slater stayed with him and must have perished; neither body, if found, was positively identified. Hallett and his family lived for a time on Kangaroo Island before moving to Glenelg. He and his wife were present at the Proclamation on 28 December 1836, and purchased a town acre at the first land sale on 27 March 1837. He set up a business with Duff as merchants, and on 28 March 1838, was one of a panel (with Rev. C. B. Howard, Rev. T. Q. Stow, J. B. Hack, E. Stephens and J. Morphett) appointed to develop an official policy on the treatment of Aborigines. He built a substantial two-storey brick house on South Terrace, later occupied by Captain Charles Berkeley (–1856), Inspector of Police, and since demolished. Hallett had a property, Willogoleechee, in the Mid North of South Australia that became the town of Hallett, named in Hallett's honour. In 1844, sheep were stolen from the property by local Ngadjuri Aboriginal people. Hallett's men tracked the Aboriginal people down and opened fire on them, killing as many as 30. The Protector of Aborigines investigated but only recommended that one of the Aboriginal men, 'Kangaroo Jack', be tried for stealing sheep. He was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. This incident is sometimes known as the Mount Bryan massacre\\". ==Politics and after== He was a member for The Sturt in the South Australian House of Assembly from March 1857 to October 1862, having been narrowly reelected in 1860. His colleague in the first parliament was Thomas Reynolds and Joseph Peacock in the second. On 21 October 1862 parliament was prorogued, and the next day dissolved by proclamation. Hallett was a candidate at the ensuing election, but was beaten by R. B. Andrews. In August 1863 he was one of five candidates for three vacancies in the Legislative Council, but was unsuccessful. He withdrew from public affairs, and until his death lived in relative obscurity. Around 1860 he took up his residence at Ilfracombe, near Beaumont. In July 1863 his health deteriorated, and he transferred his business to his brother Alfred, and subsequently ventured to the city only once, in September, 1865. In 1868 he had three attacks of \\"serous apoplexy\\" (perhaps strokes), followed by bronchitis and died an hour or two before midnight, 10 June, surrounded by his family. At his request, the funeral and burial were private affairs, no public notice being issued. ==Recognition== *Hallett Cove (previously Hallett's Cove) was named for him. *The town of Hallett, South Australia was named for him, and laid out on his property \\"Willogoleechee\\". ==Family== John Hallett (30 August 1804 – 10 June 1868) married Maria King (c. 1808 – 31 January 1891); they had five sons (three born in England) and five daughters: *John Charles Hallett (c. 1832 – 31 October 1882) lived on Wakefield Street, Adelaide *Richard Hallett (c. 1833 – 20 April 1882) lived at Wandillah Station, died of consumption. *Henry Hallett (c. 1835 – 25 October 1911) married Martha Pike (10 June 1845 – 25 October 1926) on 24 July 1875.

He was appointed Surgeon and Protector of Aborigines in Northern Territory and resigned shortly after, having lost the confidence of the Government Resident, B. T. Finniss.

Leboy worked to make the University of Pennsylvania safer and more welcoming to women. In 1970, she chaired and founded Women for Equal Opportunity at the University of Pennsylvania (WEOUP).

Although it has a history dating to the 1770s, it is most notable (and a local landmark) for its early 20th- century purpose-built clock tower, which adorns the barn at one end of the connected complex. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Description and history== Clock Farm is a rambling extended farm complex, set at the northern side of the junction of Goose Rocks Road and Maine State Route 9 in a rural northern part of Kennebunkport. The main house, at the southernmost end of the complex, is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with a side gable roof and a pair of gabled dormers. A two- story ell extends to its rear, and a series of single-story ells connect it a pair of barns, one set behind the other at the northern end of the complex. The one closest to the street has a square cupola with ventilator at the center of its roof line, with a tall square clock tower set on the ridge line in front of the cupola. The tower has clock faces with Roman numerals on each side. The rear barn also has a square cupola. The most predominant architectural style of this assemblage of buildings is the Greek Revival. The oldest portion of this complex, probably one of its ells, was built about 1773 by Peter Johnson. Its intervening history is not documented, but the complex was acquired in the late 19th century as a summer residence by Thomas Lemmons, owner of a factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The story associated with the clock is that originally was mounted on his factory, but kept such bad time that his employees complained. In the early 20th century Emmons had the tower specially built to house the clock, which was transported here from Lawrence. It has since that time been a local landmark and architectural curiosity. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Greek Revival houses in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1773 Category:Houses in York County, Maine Category:Kennebunkport, Maine Category:Farms in Maine Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in York County, Maine ","title":"Clock Farm"},{"id":"46781000","text":"In the Times of Don Porfirio (Spanish:En tiempos de Don Porfirio) is a 1940 Mexican musical film directed by Juan Bustillo Oro and starring Fernando Soler, Marina Tamayo and Emilio Tuero.Segre p.89 The film nostalgically portrays the Porfirio Díaz' government, who is played by Antonio R.

The 2015 Christchurch Borough Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. ==Background== After the last election in 2011 the Conservatives had a majority on the council with 21 seats, while independents had two seats and there was one Liberal Democrat. However the only Liberal Democrat councillor, Peter Hall of Town Cente ward, defected to the Conservatives in June 2011. 69 candidates stood in 2015 for the 24 seats on the council, including a full slate of 24 from the Conservatives. Labour had 20 candidates and the UK Independence Party 16, up from 11 and 6 respectively in 2011. Other candidates were six from the Green party and three independents, including the two sitting councillors in Jumpers ward, Colin Bungey and Fred Neale. After the Liberal Democrats stood 11 candidates in 2011 they had no candidates in 2015, with the party's candidate for the Christchurch parliamentary constituency saying that the local party \\"wanted to concentrate on the general election campaign\\". Three Conservative councillors, Mike Duckworth, Gillian Geary and Myra Mawbey, stood down at the election. Meanwhile, the election in North Highcliffe and Walkford ward was delayed until June 2015 after the death of one of the candidates. ==Election result== The Conservatives remained in control of the council after winning 19 of the 22 seats contested in May. They lost one seat to the UK Independence Party, but retained all of the other seats they had been defending, including both seats in Town Centre ward where Peter Hall held his seat as a Conservative after his defection from the Liberal Democrats in 2011. The UK Independence Party gain came in Grange ward where Janet Abbott was elected and the party got an increased vote share across the council. Meanwhile, the only other seats not won by the Conservatives came in Jumpers where the two independent councillors, Colin Bungey and Fred Neale, held their seats. The Conservatives also won both seats at the June delayed election in North Highcliffe and Walkford ward. The above totals include the delayed election in North Highcliffe and Walkford. ==Ward resultsNorth Highcliffe and Walkford delayed election=== The election in North Highcliffe and Walkford ward take place on 18 June 2015, delayed from 7 May when the rest of the council voted, after the death of Labour candidate Richard Walls.

Pace Law School had conceived of the moot as an in-class exercise in 2004, and it was in 2005 that a domestic competition was started. The competition became international the following year, with the finals being held in 2007. With more than 100 teams from 50 countries taking part annually, the ICCMCC is the world's largest competition on international criminal law and is considered one of the grand slam or major moots.https://www.ibanet.org/ICC_ICL_Programme/ICC-Moot-Court-Competition.aspx Judges of the competition include ICC judges and officers, and teams have to present arguments based on a fictitious problem via the roles of prosecution counsel, defence counsel, government counsel, or victim's representative. The arguments made usually relate to pre-trial or appeal proceedings. Each team is given 20 minutes for the main submissions and 10 minutes for rebuttal/surebuttal. For the English edition of the moot, each country can only send two to three teams to participate; where necessary, regional rounds and national are organised to select the teams that will compete in the international rounds. As of 2020, such rounds have been held for the Americas and Caribbean, Brazil, China, Georgia, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, and the Netherlands. In 2013, semi-final rounds were introduced for the top nine teams, with the top three teams proceeding to the championship final. In 2015, the number of preliminary rounds were increased from three to six, and in 2016 quarter-final rounds were introduced for the top 27 teams. In 2020, the oral rounds were cancelled due to Covid-19.

He was an Albanian born Isa. He moved to Istanbul at an early age and lived there until his death around 1512. Mesihi became a softa, a theological or madrasa student, and soon distinguished himself as a calligrapher. He was able to gain the support of the Grand Vizier Khadim Ali Pasha, and became his diwan secretary, who had had plenty of reasons to be annoyed with Mesihi. Mesihi is mentioned as undisciplined, running after a pleasure-oriented life, and conscienceless toward his official duties. The vizier, of Albanian descent himself, is quoted to have called him \\"street-Arab\\" or \\"street boy\\" (Ottoman: Sheher Oglani). Nevertheless, Mesihi held his position until Khadim Pasha died in 1511 during the Şahkulu Rebellion. Mesihi composed a deeply felt elegy on Vizier's death. He tried to get the protection of other high rank officials. According to Ashik Çelebi, he did not succeed in getting protection from Yunus Pasha or Nishandji Tadji-zade Dja'fer Çelebi, and also failed in his attempts to get patronage from Selim I. According to the French scholar Victor L. Ménage, he was in service of Yunnus Pasha, which seems to be more reliable. Mesihi's place in the Ottoman diwan poetry is that of a highly gifted and original poet. His language is relatively plain and clear, his manner devoid of affectation. A touch of Rumelian dialect here and there is of particular interest. Mesihi's not- especially voluminous diwan has not been printed. Several critical studies on his work exist. His Murabba' -i bahâr (Ode to Spring) was translated and published by the Orientalist Sir William Jones, and remained for a long time the best known Turkish poem in Europe. His Shehr-engiz became popular and he had many followers in this poetic genre. He is regarded as \\"the third great Ottoman poet and the greatest lyric poet before Bâkî\\". ==References== Category:Divan poets of the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Pristina Category:15th-century poets of the Ottoman Empire Category:1470 births Category:Calligraphers of the Ottoman Empire Category:15th-century writers of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century writers of the Ottoman Empire Category:15th-century Albanian people Category:16th-century Albanian people Category:Albanians of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century poets of the Ottoman Empire Category:Male poets of the Ottoman Empire Category:15th-century artists of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century artists of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Mesihi of Prishtina"},{"id":"46781118","text":"Love Is All You Need? is a 2016 American drama film.

In 1974, during a visit to Toronto he defected to Canada, leaving behind his wife and three children in Togliatti, Russia. Reunited with his family he led a life of an engineer, entrepreneur and traveled the world making up for the lost opportunities not available to the citizens of the Soviet regime. In later years he became a prolific writer dedicating his free time to writing autobiographical books and philanthropic pursuits in support of the forgotten and underprivileged Siberian Jewry. ==BiographyEarly years=== Born in the Soviet Union at the end of the depression into a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants, Vladimir’s childhood was scarred, at the age of three, by the arrest of his father Ferenc in 1938, along with millions of other innocent people during Stalin’s Great Purge.Fathers Letters from Siberian Prison, 2007, Szephalom Konyvmuhely Publisher. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004746T7S The family became Soviet Citizens in the hopes that the unjust arrest and imprisonment of Ferenc would somehow be overturned. Along with mother Regina and older brother Jozef, Vladimir endured the stigma of being the family of the \\"Enemy of the State\\" during the Soviet regime. When the Soviet regime collapsed, the invading Nazis imposed their own order in Belarus, life for the Jewish population of Bobruysk saw a traumatic change. All of Bobruysk's Jews were rounded up, isolated, and systematically exterminated. But, amazingly, Vladimir's family of three, survived due to their \\"Hungarian\\" ancestry. Following the arrest of Ferenc in 1938, Regina had to take on several jobs in order to ensure the family’s survival, leaving Vladimir to fend for himself. Street smart, and able to fix almost anything, Vladimir’s personality developed into that of a tough survivor who is drawn to challenges and able to work his way out of any situation. ===Middle years=== The family moved to Tomsk Siberia in 1954, in order to be closer to Ferenc, still hoping to be reunited. Vladimir attended Tomsk Polytechnic University and received undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering. While playing violin in the university's Big Band orchestra, he met and married Iya Yaroslavskaya. They had two children in Tomsk, Sandor and Ilona. Their third child Edwin, was born after the family moved to Togliatti where Vladimir became the head of Installation and Maintenance of Machinery department of the LADA VAZ - Volga Automobile Plant, supervising 1,500 employees. Vladimir and family traveled to Hungary to be reunited with family there and to meet their extended family from Canada. This led to an invitation to visit Canada and to Vladimir's ultimate defection in Toronto in 1974. In late 1975, Vladimir was reunited with his wife and three children in Toronto, where he still lives today. ===Later years=== In 1984, he was reunited with his childhood diaries and the cherished letters his father wrote from prison in Kolyma, Siberia, from 1935-1952. These documents were smuggled out of Russia via Hungary and Austria by his friends. The arrival of this archive was marked by a congratulatory letter from the renowned Russian exiled author, Alexander Solzhenitsyn. These historical documents inspired him to write several books starting with \\"My Father’s Letters from Siberian Prison,\\" which were purchased by many Hungarian high school libraries and became part of the curriculum. He received an award from the Hungarian Government and became an honorary member of the Hungarian Writers' Guild in 2013.

Devil's wheels have been used at Oktoberfest celebrations since at least 1910. ==Overview== A Devil's wheel is a rotating circular platform upon which riders sit or lie. It begins by spinning slowly and increases its speed to make riders slide off the platform. Spectators stand around the platform, the announcers often offer some satirical commentary. Riders who slide off the platform usually hit a cushioned wall. Injuries are possible if riders collide with spectators or other objects. An operator controls the speed of the platform, sometimes slowing it down to give participants the opportunity to re-position themselves toward the center. ==Function== A boy sliding to the edge of the wheel; a ball is seen. The Platform is a disc. It is not an inertial system because of its rotation. The riders' sense of balance is compromised by the rotating disk. This complicates movement towards or away from the center of the wheel. If one is moving radially outward, in addition to the expected centrifugal force (directed outward), the Coriolis force applies directed tangentially (i.e. laterally). ==Versions and use== A smaller version of the Devil's Wheel was displayed at EXPERIMINTA Science Center FrankfurtRheinMain in December 2011.

A ball attached to a chain may swing at them or the ride may shake. ==In popular culture== In Evelyn Waugh's first published novel, Decline and Fall, the character Otto Silenus describes a Devil's Wheel (referred to as the \\"big wheel at Luna Park\\") as a metaphor for life. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Abbildungen und Beschreibung eines Teufelsrades auf dem Oktoberfest *Spiele auf dem Teufelsrad, München *Video of Human Roulette Wheel at Steeplechase Park, Coney Island, early 1900s Category:Amusement rides ","title":"Devil's wheel"},{"id":"46781325","text":"Dorothea of Lorraine (24 May 1545 – 2 June 1621), was by birth a member of the House of Lorraine and by marriage to Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Calenburg. Born at the Château de Deneuvre, she was the third child and second daughter of Francis I, Duke of Lorraine and Christina of Denmark. Her paternal grandparents were Antoine, Duke of Lorraine and Renée of Bourbon-Montpensier and her maternal grandparents were Christian II of Denmark and Isabella of Austria. ==Life== Dorothea was named after her maternal aunt and she was born crippled or lame, which was attributed to the stress of her mother during the pregnancy (her father died one month after her birth, on 12 June 1545). During the visit of her maternal aunt and uncle in 1551, she and her sister were described: ::\\"both lovely little maidens, only that the youngest is lame and cannot walk, for which cause her uncle and aunt embraced her the more tenderly.\\" Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 Dorothea was described as having a certain charm and gaiety which made her brother and his family devoted to her. She helped her brother design the terraced gardens, adorned with fountains and orangeries, in the precincts of the ducal palace: he named a bell in the new clock-tower of Nancy from 1577 after her. She attended the wedding between the King of France and Louise of Lorraine in Reims in 1573. On 26 November 1575 at Nancy, she married Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, an old friend of her family and a recent widower from an unfortunate marriage with Sidonie of Saxony. In 1578, she joined Eric on his war expedition to support Juan d'Austria in Namur. The same year, Eric was employed by Philip of Spain in his attempt to conquer Portugal. Dorothea lived at the Spanish court, and became a personal friend of the King. He made instructions that certain amounts of her spouse's salary be given to her rather than to him, granted her personal gifts, a patent for working certain gold-mines, and the succession of her spouse to Tortona, the dower estate of her mother in Italy, upon her mother's death. In 1582, Dorothea persuaded Granvelle to recommend Eric to the post of Viceroy of Naples. However, he died in 1584. Her marriage was childless. After the death of Eric, Dorothea joined her mother in Tortona. In 1589, she met her niece Christina of Lorraine in Lyon and escorted her to her marriage with the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Marseilles. In 1597 she married secondly with a French noble, Marc de Rye de la Palud, Marquis de Varambon, Comte de la Roche et de Villersexel, who died one year later, in December 1598. In 1608, she returned to Lorraine to nurse her brother on his deathbed. She remained in Lorraine the rest of her life, dying aged 76 in 1621.

'Boy on Motorcycle' street installation from Ernest Zacharevic == Technique and style == Zacharevic creates oil paintings, installations, sculptures and stencil and spray paint to produce culturally relevant compositions both inside gallery space and in the arena of public art and walls His interest in the outdoor pieces is in the interaction between mural and the urban landscape, with concepts arising as part of a spontaneous response to the environment. As well as his on street works Ernest creates originals on canvas and found objects alike. These works belong to private collections and institutions across the world including the Ritz Carlton and Dean Collection, a private collection of works owned and maintained by Swizz Beats. == Career == Children on Bicycle, George Town Festival 2012 In 2012, Zacharevic received worldwide recognition after creating a series of six street art murals for the George Town Festival in Penang, Malaysia, with the BBC calling him Malaysia's answer to Banksy. These images depict scenes of everyday Malaysian life using local people as the models. The two most popular are Children on Bicycle and Boy on Motorcycle; a combination of installation and painting allows the outside community to interact with the works. These murals now stand as cultural landmarks in George Town, complete with plaques and frequent queues of people waiting to have their photographs taken with the works. Zacharevic held his first solo show in Penang in 2012 at the Hin Bus Depot, a centre for arts and culture located in George Town Art is Rubbish Rubbish is Art. A collection of 30 plus works painted on reclaimed and found materials. In 2013 Zacharevic received viral attention for his on-street work with the controversial lego mural in Johor Bahru, home to Malaysian \\"Legoland\\". Using the lego figures, Zacharevic comments on the violent state of JB, positioning them on a street corner, as a woman carrying a Chanel bag approaches, a masked villain waits around the corner for her. The piece was buffed over quickly, but not before the image went viral, with thousands of people showing their support for the mural and the serious statement it was making. Zacharevic also painted a series of murals in Singapore, one of the most restrictive countries in the world in terms of street art. He created Children in Shopping Trolleys and one of his most iconic concepts Style Wars. The piece sees two duelling children about to engage in combat with mops and brooms upon crayon illustrated horses. In 2014 Zacharevic opened his second solo show 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' in Barcelona at Montana Gallery. The collection saw a juxtaposition of more figurative works featuring characters from different cultures all dynamic poses and actions in 2015 Ernest held a solo exhibition at the Underdogs gallery in Lisbon Portugal, this was the first introduction publicly of his origami themed body of work entitled The Floor is Lava. Since this time he has been travelling around the work for independent projects, producing beautiful walls globally. Since 2016 Ernest has directed focus to the initiation of the Splash and Burn Project, an artist led artivism campaign which used street art to communicate issues concerning the unsustainable production of Palm Oil in South East Asia. Since its inception, the project has collaborated with 9 international artists all creating works to generate awareness of the issues towards positive change. == Replay NYC == In September 2015 Artist Ernest Zacharevic and Photographer Martha Cooper began their series of collaborations entitled “ReplayNYC.” The project was inspired by Martha’s iconic book \\"Street Play” which captured carefree New York City kids in the late 1970s. In his signature style, Ernest brings Martha’s subjects back to the streets; combining elements of painting and installation. Seven works were carefully curated by Martha and Ernest, with each image corresponding to a specific location to illustrate the vibrant, ever changing landscape of New York City. Most of these paintings have disappeared, existing now only though Martha’s photos. This on-street project was showcased for the first time in 2016 at the Long Beach Museum of Art; Martha’s original images paired with the photographs of Ernest’s recreations. Also featured were in-progress photos of the project, along with a wider selection of Martha’s images from around the world of children engaged in creative play. == Splash and Burn == Splash and Burn is a public art project curated by Ernest Zacharevic and coordinated by Charlotte Pyatt, run in association with the SOS Sumatran Orangutan Society and the OIC Orangutan Information Centre. The aim is to provide an alternative platform for organisations and NGOs fighting to initiate positive change by embracing the weight of the Street Art community, inviting international artists to create murals/sculptures and interventions in and around the urban landscape of Medan Indonesia. Ernest hopes to raise a wider consciousness of conservation issues globally while helping to facilitate relationships with communities directly. Splash and Burn is an ongoing initiative. The latest project was realised in 2019 by Spanish Artist ESCIF, which involved a rewind symbol carved into a palm oil planation in Indonesia to be rewilded with trees indigenous to the surrounding rainforests. In Collaboration with Indonesian musician Nursalim Yadi Anugerah, REWILD was accompanied by a short film produced by Studio Birthplace currently on the festival circuit. === Recent work === In May 2016, Zacharevic went to Christmas Island, an Australian Territory in the Indian Ocean at the invitation of Christmas Island Phosphates and the local Shire government for a scoping trip to beautify the island landscape. He left behind his first ever Australian art installation with 'Forklift Boy,' near a local tavern. An abandoned forklift adjacent to a shipping container provided the canvas for the piece. It is similar in aesthetic to his Boy and Girl on a Bike and Boy on a Motorbike art installations in George Town, Penang.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-10/christmas-island-street- art/7402618 ==References External links== * https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24924283 * http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/firstlook/lotsmore/beyond-wall- murals/1794716.html * http://www.juxtapoz.com/street-art/ernest-zacharevic- art-is-rubbish-rubbish-is-art-hin-company-bus-depot-penang-malaysia * http://www.yatzer.com/ernest-zacharevic * http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaime- rojo-steven-harrington/ernest-zacharevic-_b_4104136.html * http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/malaysian-authorities-paint-over- ernest-zacharevics-lego-mural-over-fears-it-will-hurt- tourism/story-e6frfq80-1226759375985 * http://www.timeout.com/penang/art/street-art-by-ernest-zacharevic * http://www.mtn-world.com/blog/tag/ernest-zacharevic/ * http://www.streetartnews.net/2014/08/ernest-zacharevic-new-mural-for- living.html * http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/10/jousting-painters-in- singapore-by-ernest-zacharevic/ Category:Lithuanian artists Category:Living people Category:1986 births Category:Contemporary artists Category:Penang Category:Street artists ","title":"Ernest Zacharevic"},{"id":"46781339","text":"In the area of mathematics known as K-theory, the Quillen spectral sequence, also called the Brown-Gersten-Quillen or BGQ spectral sequence (named after Kenneth Brown, Stephen Gersten, and Daniel Quillen), is a spectral sequence converging to the sheaf cohomology of a type of topological space that occurs in algebraic geometry.

All 43 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Barcelona (, ) was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Barcelona, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Barcelona and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the eldest one would be elected. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one-thousandth of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election—with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures—disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead.

In a racing career which lasted 367 days from October 2014 until October 2015 he won seven of his nine races and was never beaten by a male horse. He was bred in England by his owner Anthony Oppenheimer and was trained throughout his racing career by John Gosden. After winning his only race as a two-year-old in 2014, Golden Horn showed improved form in the Spring of the following year to win the Feilden Stakes and then established himself as favourite for the 2015 Epsom Derby with a victory over a strong field in the Dante Stakes. After his owner paid a £75,000 supplementary entry fee, Golden Horn won the Derby on 6 June, beating his stablemate Jack Hobbs into second place. On his next appearance he defeated the top-rated three-year-old colt of 2014, The Grey Gatsby by three and a half lengths in the Eclipse Stakes. Golden Horn was subsequently withdrawn from an intended run in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes due to unsuitable going, before losing his unbeaten record when defeated by the filly Arabian Queen in York's Juddmonte International. He went on to win a controversial race for the Irish Champion Stakes in September before ending his European career with a victory in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Golden Horn ended his racing career by finishing runner-up to Found in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland. ==Background== John Gosden, Golden Horn's trainer Golden Horn is a brown horse with no white markings bred in England by his owner Anthony Oppenheimer's Hascombe and Valiant Stud. Oppenheimer is a member of the family that controlled the De Beers Mining Company. Golden Horn was sired by Cape Cross a leading miler who won the Lockinge Stakes in 1998 and the Queen Anne Stakes in the following year. As a breeding stallion Cape Cross, who stands at the Kildangan Stud in County Kildare has had considerable success, being the sire of Ouija Board, Sea the Stars and Able One. Golden Horn's dam, Fleche d'Or was an unraced daughter of Dubai Destination and came from a family which had produced several major winners for the Oppenheimers. Her half-sister Rebecca Sharp was a top-class racemare who won the Coronation Stakes and finished second in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, whilst her great-grandmother Lora produced the 1000 Guineas and Sussex Stakes winner On The House. Other descendants of Lora's dam Courtessa have included Habibti and the Australian champions Danewin and Octagonal. Nine months after foaling Golden Horn, Fleche d'Or was sent to the Tattersalls Breeding Stock sale in December 2012 and bought for 62,000 guineas by Harry McAlmont of the Norelands Stud. Golden Horn was offered for sale as a yearling in October 2013 at Tattersalls but was bought back by his breeder when the bidding stopped at 190,000 guineas. The colt was sent into training with John Gosden at his Clarehaven Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. Gosden is a British native (the son of John \\"Towser\\" Gosden) who began his training career in California in 1980 and had his first major success with Bates Motel in 1984. He left the United States in 1989 and has trained in Britain ever since. His other major winners in Europe have included Kingman, Taghrooda, Ravens Pass, Nathaniel and Benny the Dip. ==Racing career2014: two-year-old season=== Golden Horn made his first and only appearance as a two-year-old in an eight-runner maiden race over eight and a half furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 29 October 2014. Ridden by William Buick he started the 15/8 second favourite behind the William Haggas-trained Storm The Stars. He started slowly, but recovered to make progress in the second half of the race and was switched to the wide outside by Buick three furlongs from the finish. Despite showing inexperience (running \\"green\\") he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a head from Storm The Stars, with the pair finishing seven lengths clear of the others. The runner-up went on to finish second in the Chester Vase and win both the Cocked Hat Stakes and the Great Voltigeur Stakes in 2015. ===2015: three-year-old season=== Trial races On his three- year-old debut, Golden Horn was ridden by the veteran Frankie Dettori in the Listed Feilden Stakes over nine furlongs on the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 15 April and was made the 2/1 favourite ahead of the previously unbeaten Godolphin colt Festive Fare and the Queen's runner Peacock (trained by Richard Hannon Jr.). He was restrained by Dettori in the early stages before making a forward move two furlongs out, taking the lead approaching the final furlong (despite hanging to the left) and winning by one and a half lengths from Peacock. York Racecourse On 14 May Golden Horn was moved up in class to contest the Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, a major trial for the 2015 Epsom Derby which attracted a strong field. Ridden by Buick colt started 4/1 third favourite behind Jack Hobbs (also trained by Gosden), and Elm Park with the other contenders including the Aidan O'Brien-trained pair John F Kennedy and Ol' Man River (winner of the Beresford Stakes). Golden Horn was restrained by Buick in the early stages as the outsider Lord Ben Stack led, before moving into contention three furlongs from the finish. He moved past Elm Park to take the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and three quarter lengths from Jack Hobbs, with Elm Park three and a quarter lengths back in third. Golden Horn had not been entered for the Epsom Derby and Oppenheimer was initially unwilling to pay the £75,000 supplementary entry fee as he believed that the colt's pedigree meant that he was unlikely to stay the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Prix du Jockey Club was named as a probable target. After discussions with Gosden however, Oppenheimer agreed to supplement the horse and Golden Horn was elevated to the position of ante-post favourite for the Derby. Epsom Derby On 6 June, Golden Horn, started the 13/8 favourite for the 236th running of the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. As Buick was required to ride Jack Hobbs for the Godolphin Racing team, Golden Horn was ridden again by Frankie Dettori. Elm Park was again in opposition as well as Storm The Stars and the leading French colt Epicuris. The Aidan O'Brien stable was represented by Hans Holbein (Chester Vase), Kilimanjaro (Lingfield Derby Trial) and Giovanni Canaletto (full-brother of the 2013 winner Ruler of the World). Dettori restrained the horse towards the rear of the field as Elm Park and Hans Holbein duelled for the lead in the early stages. In the straight Golden Horn made rapid progress on the outside, overtook Jack Hobbs a furlong from the finish and won by three and a half lengths from his stable companion with Storm The Stars four and a half lengths back in third place. Dettori commented \\"What an unbelievable day. I was excited at the big job ahead of me, but it all went like clockwork from start to finish. When you're young, you don't really appreciate the full importance of this Derby, so it means a great deal to win it for a second time. I've had a colourful life, but I'm not finished\\". Before the race Dettori had requested some \\"lucky white tape\\" for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented \\"The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited. He's a proper horse.\\" On the following day Gosden indicated that the Eclipse Stakes would be the colt's most likely next target. British and Irish bookmakers reportedly sustained heavy losses on the race, largely due to Dettori's popularity with the general public. A spokesperson for Paddy Power said \\"Frankie is the only jockey the whole world and his dog knows and his win means the bookies have done their absolute conkers\\". Eclipse Stakes On 4 July, Golden Horn was matched against older horses for the first time when he was brought back in distance to contest the 120th running of the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He started the 4/9 favourite against four opponents headed by The Grey Gatsby, with the other runners being Cougar Mountain (third in the Queen Anne Stakes), Western Hymn (Prix Eugène Adam, Gordon Richards Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and Tullius (Sandown Mile). With no recognised front-runner in the race, Frankie Dettori had admitted that: \\"There is a possibility we could make the running if no-one else wants to. Otherwise we will sit off it. Golden Horn is very versatile but what we don’t want is a messy race. He is a Derby winner not a sprinter\\". Gosden was not overly enthusiastic about the colt's chances saying \\"I have a lot of respect for The Grey Gatsby... these are top older horses we’re taking on... any horse can get beaten\\" and described the horse's position as odds-on favourite as \\"a bit unusual\\". As in the Derby, Dettori had a \\"lucky\\" piece of kit: the left boot he had worn at Epsom had been ripped at Royal Ascot, but the jockey insisted on having it repaired by his valet and wore it at Sandown. Dettori sent the colt into the lead from the start with The Grey Gatsby racing in second ahead of Western Hymn, Cougar Mountain and Tullius. As the horses entered the straight, The Grey Gatsby moved up alongside the favourite and the two horses raced together in what BBC Sport described as a \\"gripping duel\\" until Golden Horn accelerated clear approaching the final furlong to win by three and a half lengths. There was a further gap of four and a half lengths back to Western Hymn in third. He became the tenth winner of the Derby to win the Eclipse in the same season following Flying Fox (1899), Diamond Jubilee (1900), Lemberg (1910), Coronach (1926), Blue Peter (1939), Tulyar (1952), Mill Reef (1971), Nashwan (1989) and Sea the Stars (2009). The Racing Post's Sam Walker rated Golden Horn's victory as the best performance in the world in 2015 up to 6 July, placing him four pounds in front of Shared Belief and five ahead of American Pharoah. Commenting on the colt's success, Dettori said \\"I had an easy lead, but Jamie [Spencer, on The Grey Gatsby] was very clever. He attacked early, he eyeballed me, but the horse showed what a true champion he is. He has a lot of guts and was going away at the end.\\" After the race Oppenheimer was reportedly keen to run the colt in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes but Gosden was cautious in outlining future plans saying \\"a day at a time, a week at the time, the horse’ll tell me. I watch, I listen, that's my job. It's up to the horse\\". He did however, suggest that the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe could be a long-term target but added that the colt would not run if the ground was \\"bottomless\\". King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Three weeks after the Eclipse, Golden Horn was the only three-year-old scheduled to contest the 55th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. On the eve of the race, Gosden indicated that colt had made further progress, saying \\"Golden Horn's been fine since the Eclipse and even progressed physically – he's filled out. We always thought that he was a good, proper horse, but he just seems that much more streetwise – harder and tougher now.\\" Heavy rain on the day before the race softened the ground and led to the withdrawal of the only French challenger Flintshire. After walking the course on the morning of the race, Gosden withdrew Golden Horn, saying \\"It is very frustrating... The ground in the straight would be no problem – it's just the old track. It rides deep, deep down there and holding. If it was all on the new track I wouldn't hesitate on running, but it is not. Once I got down to Swinley Bottom the stick went in 12 inches and made a pop sound as it came out... He can go on good to soft no problem. He can probably go on genuine soft, but I don't want to involve him in a sticky, holding ground\\". In Golden Horn's absence the race was won by Postponed. International Stakes Golden Horn and Frankie Dettori The International Stakes at York (run over the same course and distance as the Dante Stakes) was expected to feature a clash between Golden Horn and the 2000 Guineas winner Gleneagles. The highly anticipated contest was described as \\"the race of the season\\" with the other contenders including The Grey Gatsby and the impressive Royal Ascot winner Time Test. In the build-up to the race Dettori said \\"It's a great line-up. It's an absolute cracker, possibly the race of the year. You've got all the best horses racing each other. York is very slick, very flat. You need a horse with pace and gears. If you've got any chinks in your armour, you'll be found out.\\" The field was reduced to seven when Gleneagles was withdrawn owing to the rain-softened ground and Golden Horn started the 4/9 favourite ahead of Time Test and The Grey Gatsby with the other runners being Criterion from Australia (Australian Derby), Cougar Mountain from Ireland (Desmond Stakes), the British filly Arabian Queen and the seven-year-old gelding Dick Doughtywylie, who was acting as a pacemaker for the favourite. Golden Horn pulled hard against Dettori's attempts to restrain him in the early stages and raced in third behind Dick Doughtywylie and Arabian Queen. He made a forward move in the straight, moving up outside the leader Arabian Queen a furlong out and sustained his first defeat, finishing a neck behind the filly. After the race Dettori commented \\"The horse was more keen than usual today and the ground being the way it was, he couldn’t use his turn of foot. It's a great shame, but this is racing\\". Irish Champion Stakes Leopardstown Racecourse, where Golden Horn hon the Irish Champion Stakes Golden Horn's comeback came in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 12 September. In the build-up to the race he was reported to have been performing impressively in training although Gosden warned that the colt might not run if the ground were to be unsuitably soft. The ground at Leopardstown was described as \\"yielding\\", which was enough to see the withdrawal of Gleneagles, but Golden Horn took up his engagement and was made the 5/4 favourite. His six opponents were Free Eagle, Found, The Grey Gatsby, Cirrus des Aigles, Pleascach (Irish 1000 Guineas, Yorkshire Oaks) and Highland Reel (Secretariat Stakes). Dettori sent the colt into the lead soon after the start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he challenged the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said \\"It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is. Pat [Smullen, on Free Eagle] came to me then I gave him a couple of cracks and I got the measure of him and I thought, right, come on, let's go home. All of a sudden, he just took a right turn. He must have seen something\\". Gosden offered the view that the horse had swerved because of the shadow cast across the course by the grandstand. Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe Longchamp Racecourse, where Golden Horn won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe On 4 October 2015 Golden Horn was one of seventeen horses to contest the 94th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. As he had not been among the original entries for the race, Oppenheimer had to pay a supplementary entry fee of €120,000. The draw for starting stalls saw Golden Horn allotted the fourteenth stall, on the wide outside of the field: Dettori commented \\"I’d have loved a single-figure number but we’ll have to deal with what we’ve got. We will make a plan.\\" Gosden initially said \\"We are used to a wide draw in the Arc as Taghrooda had one last year and spent most of her time on that bicycle track they have around the outside of the course at Longchamp. We expected a high draw and we got one.\\" He later explained that he was not suggesting any unfairness saying \\"I was merely having a joke... I'm sorry if other people don't have a sense of humour\\". Golden Horn started the 9/2 third favourite behind Treve who was attempting to win the race for the third time and New Bay, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. Found and Free Eagle were again in opposition and the other runners included Flintshire, Erupt (Grand Prix de Paris) and Dolniya (Sheema Classic). At the start, Dettori tracked to the left and sent Golden Horn to the far outside where he raced alone in the early stages before moving back to the inside and settling in second behind the pacemaker Shahah. Golden Horn took the lead entering the straight, opened up a clear advantage entering the last 200 metres and won by two lengths from Flintshire. New Bay and Treve were close behind in third and fourth places. Dettori, who was winning the race for a record-equalling fourth time, said \\"I really believed in the horse. I was going so fast in the last 300 metres I knew no other horse would pass me. I had the best horse and I wanted to show how good he is. His record is unbelievable and he is probably the best horse I have ridden\\". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said \\"It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England – that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, if you stay wide for a long time, you can run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect as we sat behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie says, if you don't kick at a certain time here they come like arrows at your back\\". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying \\"The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there\\". Breeders' Cup Turf Gosden reported the horse to be in excellent condition after his Arc win commenting \\"He's got such a constitution, you can hardly see a rib which is not usually the case at the end of a long campaign\\" and the colt was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland Racecourse on 31 October. Before shipping to Kentucky he reported worked well in an exercise on the long gallop at Newmarket. In the build-up to the race, there was some concern about the state of the turf course which had been softened by heavy rain, with the track supervisor saying that the ground was likely to be \\"good to soft\\" by British standards. Golden Horn was attempting to become the first Arc winner to win the race, following the failures of Dancing Brave (fourth in 1986), Trempolino (second in 1987), Saumarez, (fifth in 1990), Subotica (fifth in 1992) and Dylan Thomas (fifth in 2007). In the Breeders' Cup Turf Golden Horn, the only one of the twelve horse field not running on Lasix, started odds-on favourite ahead of the other European challenger Found. The best of the ten American horses appeared to be The Pizza Man and Big Blue Kitten. The colt broke slowly but was settled behind the leaders as the outsider Shining Copper set the early pace. He moved into second place half a mile out and overtook the leader to gain the advantage approaching the final furlong. He was headed by Found in the closing stages, and although he rallied in the final strides he was beaten half a length by the filly. Gosden accepted the colt's defeat but felt he had been unable to produce his best on the soft ground, commenting \\"It was too loose for Golden Horn, but full marks to the filly for beating us fair and square... I said to everyone beforehand that after all the rain and three inches of it, it would be far from ideal... Frankie said he was spinning his wheels all the time\\" but added that \\"he appears to be bright after his race\\". ==Assessment and awards== In the June edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Golden Horn was rated the joint-second best racehorse in the world, three pounds behind American Pharoah and level with Shared Belief and Able Friend. After the Eclipse win the British Horseracing Authority's handicapper gave Golden Horn a rating of 130, a mark for a three-year-old equalled only by Frankel since 1996. The July edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings saw Golden Horn overtake American Pharoah to become the world's highest rated racehorse, but dropped back into second behind the American Triple Crown winner in August. In the end of year rankings he was rated the second-best racehorse in the world, four pounds behind American Pharoah: he was rated the best horse in Europe, the best horse on turf and the best horse in the long- distance division. On 10 November 2015, Golden Horn was named Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt and Cartier Horse of the Year at the 25th edition of the Cartier Racing Awards. On 1 August 2018, during an interview on ITV Racing at Goodwood, Frankie Dettori declared Golden Horn as his favourite horse of all time. ==Racing statistics== { class = \\" sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" style=\\" text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:centre ;border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\\" - dacaa4; text- align:center;\\" ! dacaa4;\\" Date ! dacaa4;\\" Race ! dacaa4;\\" Dist (f) ! dacaa4;\\" Course ! dacaa4;\\" Class ! dacaa4;\\" Prize (£K) ! dacaa4;\\" Odds ! dacaa4;\\" Ran ! dacaa4;\\" Place ! dacaa4;\\" Margin ! dacaa4;\\" Time ! dacaa4;\\" Jockey ! dacaa4;\\" Cite -  Oath Maiden Stakes 8.5 Nottingham Maiden 6 15/8 8 1 Head 1:46.69 William Buick  -  Feilden Stakes 9 Newmarket Listed 20 2/1 7 1 1.5 1:48.16 Frankie Dettori  -  Dante Stakes 10.5 York 2 90 4/1 7 1 2.75 2:08.74 William Buick  -  Epsom Derby 12 Epsom 1 813 13/8 12 1 3.5 2:32.32 Frankie Dettori  -  Eclipse Stakes 10 Sandown 1 255 4/9 5 1 3.5 2:05.77 Frankie Dettori  -  International Stakes 10.5 York 1 518 4/9 7 2 Neck 2:09.92 Frankie Dettori  -  Irish Champion Stakes 10 Leopardstown 1 494 5/4 7 1 1 2:05.41 Frankie Dettori  -  Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe 12 Longchamp 1 2214 9/2 17 1 2 2:27.23 Frankie Dettori  -  Breeders' Cup Turf 12 Keeneland 1 1057 4/6 12 2 0.5 2:32.06 Frankie Dettori  } ==Stud career== Shortly after his victory in the Arc, it was announced that Golden Horn would be retired to stud at the end of the year and would stand as a breeding stallion at Dalham Hall in 2016 in a partnership between Oppenheimer and Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. ==Pedigree== *Golden Horn is inbred 4 × 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – Golden Horn Category:2012 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-c Category:Epsom Derby winners Category:Arc winners Category:Cartier Award winners Category:European Thoroughbred Horse of the Year ","title":"Golden Horn (horse)"},{"id":"46781402","text":"The 1946 King's Birthday Honours, celebrating the official birthday of King George VI, were announced on 13 June 1946 for the United Kingdom and British Empire.

Vilma Reyes Díaz (born 1958) is a Puerto Rican poet, storyteller and educator. She has served as a teacher of Spanish language and has chaired the International Poetry Festival in Puerto Rico (Festival Internacional de Poesía en Puerto Rico) since 2010. She has been an influence on young Puerto Ricans in literary creation by offering free workshops for children and youth poetry and has published several books as a result of that work. ==Biography== Vilma Reyes Díaz was born 2 September 1958 in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. She enjoyed literature from an early age, writing her first work, a school play, at age 10. In 1980, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in French Language and Literature at the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón (University of the Sacred Heart) in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Her thesis, entitled \\"El Suícidio, el último recurso para la felicidad de Madame Bovary\\" (Suicide, the last resort for the happiness of Madame Bovary) was provocative and caused a mixed reaction from students and faculty, but she received praise from the President of the French Alliance of Puerto Rico and earned her degree. After graduation, she married fellow poet, Antonio Rosa Montañez, with whom she had two children, Antonio Rosa Reyes and Linda Rosa Reyes. She completed her Master of Arts from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, and then obtained a Spanish Teaching Diploma for secondary schools. She was accepted to the Doctoral Program of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus, where she studies Hispanic-American literature. In 2001, she founded a Poetry Forum called \\"Canto Poético\\" (Poetic singing) to allow poets to share their works internationally and participated in the First Celebration of Literary Magazines by The House of the Peruvian Poets held in Barranca, Peru in November 2004. The following year, in 2005, she participated in the First International Encounter of the poets \\"Matilde Alba Swann\\" and \\"Manuel Agustín Aguirre\\" held in Loja, Ecuador. She received an Honorary Degree from the Universidad Nacional de Loja (National University of Loja). She is the editor of the literary magazine En Sentido Figurado and has written several textbooks which are in use in Puerto Rico and the United States. She has also served as a teacher of Spanish language and has chaired the International Poetry Festival in Puerto Rico (Festival Internacional de Poesía en Puerto Rico since 2010. She is a member of the World Poetry Movement which was founded in 2011. She has also participated in the Havana International Festival of Poetry and the Carlos Pellicer Iberoamerican Poetry Meeting in Tabasco, Mexico. Her poems have been published in numerous anthologies and literary journals including: Revista Prometeo (Medellín), Ventana de Luz y de Armonía at the Universidad Autónoma de Loja, Ecuador; Antología Internacional de Poesía Amorosa (Lima); Antología Mar de por medio (España); Libro Verde (México); Revista Guajana (Puerto Rico); El Cuervo (Puerto Rico); Luciérnaga of the University of Puerto Rico; Revista En Sentido Figurado (Puerto Rico) and Remolinos, among others. ==Selected worksPoems=== *Amanecí *A Medias *Dudas *Hipnosis *Indefinido *Sexto Insomnio *Séptimo Insomnio *Octavo Insomnio *Noveno Insomnio *Décimo Insomnio *Undécimo Insomnio *Duodécimo Insomnio *Cuarta Lluvia *Quinta Lluvia *Octava Lluvia *Parpadeos *Qué Decir *Rezo en tu Piel *Rutinas *Su Rostro ===Books=== *Versos para la lluvia Insomne Los Libros de la Iguana: San Juan, Puerto Rico (2010) (in Spanish) ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Río Piedras, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican poets Category:Puerto Rican women writers ","title":"Vilma Reyes"},{"id":"46781437","text":"Michael Schumann (24 September 1946 - 2 December 2000) was a retired German philosophy professor who became an East German advocate for reform and a politician during the build-up to German reunification. He is widely seen as a pioneer of the Party of Democratic Socialism which superseded the Socialist Unity Party in the German Democratic Republic in 1989/90. ==Life== Michael Schumann was born in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany, slightly more than a year after the Second World War had ended in defeat and regime change. He was born in Zella-Mehlis, a small industrial town some 65 km (40 miles) south-west of Erfurt. His father, Erwin Schumann, worked as a foreman. Long before he was old enough for school, the Soviet occupation zone had reinvented itself, formally in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, which involved a return to one-party dictatorship, this time with constitutional arrangements modeled on those of the Soviet Union itself. Michael Schumann attended primary and secondary schools locally, passing his school final exams in 1965. In parallel with this, 1965 was also the year in which he obtained a certificate of expertise in cattle breeding from the VEB agricultural cooperative in nearby Rohr. Between 1965 and 1970 he studied Philosophy at the \\"Karl Marx University\\" (as it was then known) in Leipzig. A defining influence during his first year of study was the philosophical school of his tutor, Helmut Seidel. In 1967, the year of his twenty-first birthday, Schumann joined East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED /Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Although he would later come to prominence at a party conference late in 1989 because of his critical attitude to the direction taken by East Germany under the SED, he would remain a member of the party, and then of its successor entity, for the rest of his life. He received his doctorate in 1970 for work on Hegel. His first job after this was as a research assistant in the Marxism–Leninism section of the Philosophy Department at the party's own \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" Academy for Law and Political Sciences in Potsdam-Babelsberg, which placed him at the heart of one of the SED's most important cadre schools. Until 1989, albeit with a couple of breaks, the Academy would be his political and academic home in the years preceding his emergence as a politician. From November 1970 till April 1972 Schumann performed his Military Service in the National People's Army, reaching the rank of junior officer in a political section. It was during this period that he married Ingeburg Reuß who was at the time employed on the commercial side by DEFA, the state-owned film studin. He had a son, Marco. Back in the academic world, in 1986 he was appointed to a full professorship at the Walter Ulbricht Academy. He is remembered for the frequently repeated assertion, \\"We break irrevocably with Stalinism as a system!\\",\\"Wir brechen unwiderruflich mit dem Stalinismus als System!\\" which he delivered to the extraordinary SED Party Conference of 16 December 1989. As matters turned out it would be the last SED conference before the party began its slightly awkward conversion process into the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) in preparation for a democratic future which after the events of the previous month was widely anticipated. The resolution, which marked a break with the government by dictatorship that had controlled the German Democratic Republic for more than four decades, was created by several people, including the Stasi Intelligence Chief Markus Wolf and the politician Heinz Vietze, but it was Schumann's part in its authorship that was given greater prominence precisely because, some said, Wolf and Vietze were both highly positioned members of the now largely discredited East Germany political establishment whereas Schumann's party work had been low level and peripheral to his career.Tim Peters: Der Antifaschismus der PDS aus antiextremistischer Sicht, Wiesbaden 2006, p.121 To have a chance of survival, the party would need to undergo a new beginning appropriate to a new kind of East Germany. On 18 March 1990 the German Democratic Republic conducted its first — and as matters turned out, only — free parliamentary election. Michael Schumann was elected a member of the National Legislature (Volkskammer). Following reunification in October of that year he sat as a member of the German Bundestag till December. 1990 also marked a return for regional government in what had been East Germany, and in the 1990 Brandenburg state election Schumann was returned as one of the 13 PDS Assembly members, retaining his seat till his death in December 2000 after which his former seat went to Gerrit Große. From 1989 till October 2000 Schumann was also a member of the PDS National Executive. Michael and Ingeburg Schumann were killed in a road traffic accident near Gransee (Brandenburg) on 2 December 2000. They are buried in the cemetery at Bornstedt (Potsdam). ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Zella-Mehlis Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Category:Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany) politicians Category:Members of the 10th Volkskammer Category:Members of the Landtag of Brandenburg Category:University of Potsdam faculty ","title":"Michael Schumann"},{"id":"46781439","text":" The Caudron Type L was a two-seat French pusher configuration amphibious biplane, flown around 1913 and intended for naval use. ==Design== With unequal span, two bay, unstaggered wings and an open frame fuselage the Type L had much in common with the smaller Caudron-Fabre pusher amphibian, as well as with the tractor configuration Type J amphibians and Type H floatplanes, some of which were also amphibians. Most of the earlier Caudron biplane types had similar wings and fuselages. The Type L had three sets of parallel and vertical interplane struts on each side, the innermost close to the central nacelle and bracing the centre section. The overhanging upper wing were braced by a pair of parallel, outward leaning struts which joined the lower wing at the base of the outer vertical struts. The inner struts, to which the engine was attached, were ash and the remainder hollowed out spruce; all joined the rather close pairs of spars in the upper and lower wings. Diagonal flying wires completed the bracing. The interplane gap was . Lateral (roll) control was by wing warping. The Type L did not have a long, enclosed fuselage but instead the empennage was supported on an open girder. The Type L, unusually for Caudron, had two parallel sided, cross braced side frames. The longitudinal members were steel and the cross-members ash. The side frames began from the rear spars of both upper and lower wings and converged rearwards to meet at the tail, with upper and lower cross-members towards the rear. A short nacelle on the lower wing contained an open, wide cockpit with side-by-side seating, the pilot on the right. Controls were conventional. The nacelle ended behind the forward wing spar, ahead of the Gnome Delta nine cylinder rotary engine mounted on the rear interplane struts and driving a two blade propeller via 2:1 reduction gearing and a long shaft to clear the trailing edge. At the extreme tail, the final vertical frame member served as the axis for the rudder, with a small, roughly triangular fin ahead of it. The elevator hinge was also mounted high on this member, with a straight edged tailplane ahead of it. The Type L had short floats, flat bottomed with no chine but in plan and profile curving inwards to the nose. Unlike the Fabre floats of the Caudron-Fabre, these had a step about halfway back. A landing wheel was located on the float centreline, working on an unsprung axle in a slot through to the upper side. The floats were mounted on outer N-form struts to the bases of the inner interplane struts and by W-form struts to the lower longitudinal girder member, pivoted at the front with rubber shock absorbers at the rear. Another rectangular cross-section but unstepped float was positioned under the tail. The first prototype, intended for delivery to the British Navy, appeared at the 1913 Paris Salon in December but it is not known if it had been flown by then. It was destroyed by fire after an engine backfire during tests. The second was trialled by the French Navy, who found it unsatisfactory, it was then delivered to the British as a replacement for the lost first prototype. The last two were rebuilt as Type J marines and used by the French Navy. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:Amphibious aircraft Category:1910s French military aircraft TL Category:Biplanes Category:Rotary-engined aircraft ","title":"Caudron Type L"},{"id":"46781444","text":"On May 22, 2015, a three-hour shootout broke out between the Mexican Federal Police and alleged members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Ecuandureo, Michoacán, leaving 43 dead. One of the fatalities was a Federal Police officer, while the others were suspected to be organized crime members. The confrontation started when the Federal Police spotted a suspicious vehicle on a highway in Tanhuato, Michoacán. The authorities had received information that one of the properties in the area had been overrun by criminals. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\") was in the area. When they tried to pull over the vehicle, however, the men onboard opened fire at the police units. A vehicle chase ensued and the security forces made their way into a large, rural property where the shootout intensified. The Federal Police then called for ground and air reinforcements and neutralized the situation. The shootout is widely regarded as one of the bloodiest incidents in the ongoing Mexican Drug War, which to date has taken the lives of tens of thousands in Mexico. According to the government, the shootout was one-sided because the security forces were better trained and equipped than the gangsters. Critics, however, believed that there was a possibility that the incident was an extrajudicial mass murder. The Federal Police conducted tests at the crime scene and confirmed that the gunmen fired at the security forces and were shot from a distance. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission concluded their investigation in 2016 and stated that the Federal Police extrajudicially killed at least 22 of the 42 men. The police denies these findings. ==Shootout: initial incident== According to Mexico's national security commissioner , at around 7:00 a.m. on May 22, 2015, agents of the Federal Police were patrolling the Autopista de Occidente, a highway that connects Guadalajara with Morelia and Mexico City, when they noticed several suspicious vehicles with armed civilians leaving a property close to the highway. The authorities were heading to a ranch property known as \\"Rancho del Sol\\" in Ecuandureo, Michoacán, which borders the state of Jalisco, that they believed had been taken over by organized crime members on May 18. On the highway, the police tried to pull over the vehicle, but the gunmen opened fire at the police units and attempted to escape, initiating a vehicle chase. The gunmen then fled to the original destination of the authorities, the \\"Rancho del Sol\\" ranch, where other gunmen were hiding. Inside the property, the organized crime members exited the vehicle and started shooting at the Federal Police units. The other gunmen that were inside the property joined them. The Federal Police commissioner stated that the police asked for the gunmen to surrender through a megaphone, as part of the law enforcement protocol, but most of the gunmen ignored the request and continued the confrontation. Only three of them surrendered and turned themselves in. ==Reinforcements and wrap up== Due to the intensity of the shootout, the Federal Police called for ground and air reinforcements, including a Black Hawk helicopter with additional troops. Initially, 41 Federal Police officers participated in the confrontation. However, they called for 60 more officers to join them in the operation. The gunmen managed to shoot and hit the helicopter at least three times with AK-47s and AR-15s. However, the troops shot back at them and the gunmen were not able to use their grenade-launchers and machine guns, which had the capability of shooting down the helicopter. The gunmen that were hiding in one of the property's warehouses were killed by the helicopter's artillery. Some of them managed to run away from the warehouse and attempted to shoot at the helicopter, but they were neutralized in open field. The night shift gunmen who were sleeping also joined the confrontation but were also killed in the exchange. The Federal Police believed that at least 60 or 70 organized crime members participated in the shootout, but that some of them managed to escape. In total, Michaocán authorities concluded that at least 2,000 shots were fired during the gunfight after they recovered the fired bullets from the crime scene. Over 1,000 more unused ammunition were found in the gunmen's possession. The shootout lasted at least three hours, mainly because the property was 112 hectares (277 acres) and it allowed for the gunmen to attack from various sides. 42 organized crime members were killed along with a Federal Police officer who was shot while aiding one of his comrades. Of the forty-two organized crime members killed, two of them were also former municipal police officers in Jalisco. In addition, one Federal Police officer was wounded, while three gunmen were arrested. Eight vehicles, 36 assault rifles, a rocket launcher and several other weapons were seized by police in the shootout. Six of the vehicles, however, were consumed by flames that created a large cloud of smoke visible from a distance. The vehicles were burned because of grenades that detonated inside the warehouses where they were parked. Other reports suggested that the gunmen also had stolen fuel tanks close to the vehicles, and that they exploded during the shootout. Once the situation was neutralized, federal agents established several checkpoints in the border regions of Michoacán and Jalisco to tighten security and prevent the mobilization of organized crime groups. ==Aftermath and investigation== In a press conference on May 22 in Zamora, Michaocán, Rubido García provided to the media the details of the shootout. Though he did not name the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) directly, he alluded that it was the group that was involved in the shootout. This was known because he stated that the group involved in the clash had its center of operations in Jalisco. In addition, the municipalities of Ecuandureo, Tanhuato, , and Yurécuaro, were areas where the CJNG operated. He also stated that the operative was part of Operation Jalisco, a government-led military initiative that began on May 1, 2015. One of the main tasks of the operative is the dismantling of the CJNG. The official version of the events states that authorities went into the property where the shootout took place because they believed it had been invaded by criminals. However, other unconfirmed reports stated that law enforcement had information that Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the leader of the CJNG, was hiding inside the property. Those reports alleged that \\"El Mencho\\" managed to escape when the Federal Police engaged with the first CJNG unit in the highway since the element of surprise was gone. Moreover, initial reports confused the setting with the rural community of Tinaja de Vargas in ; this was because Tanhuato and Ecuandureo are divided by the federal highway and thus easily confusable. This version was confirmed by Tanhuato's mayor José Ignacio Cuevas Pérez, who stated that the ranch where the shootout took place is visible from the regional highway and is known for growing alfalfa. However, he noted, the property was listed for rent before being overrun by criminals. Officials believed that criminals had taken over the property because of its strategic location; the ranch was isolated and provided easy access to the highway and other roads that connected the property to nearby villages. In addition, the large size of the property allowed for criminals to hide. The mayor of Ecuandureo, José de Jesús Infante Ayala, said in an interview that the municipal government had not received any property taxes from the ranch and thereby had no information about it or the owner, who local citizens alleged that lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The 43 corpses were recovered by the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) and the Forensic Medical Service of Morelia, Michoacán, for their formal identification. At least six vehicles were needed to carry the bodies from the crime scene to the coroner's office in Morelia. The recovery of the bodies began at around 11:00 a.m. on May 22, 2015 and lasted before dawn the following day. This procedure was done in accordance to Mexican law, which required every corpse involved in the shootout to undergo a post-mortem study. Once this procedure concludes, the family members of the deceased can reclaim the bodies. The crime scene was cordoned by federal agents in order to prevent anyone from going into the property and tampering with the evidence of the shootout. The coroner's office in Morelia was also guarded by law enforcement. That same day, the Federal Police carried out a large ceremony in memory of their fallen officer in Iztapalapa, Mexico City. They recognized the officer's professionalism, discipline, and service, and honored the fact that he died while aiding a colleague. === Possible extrajudicial mass murder === In terms of organized crime–law enforcement clashes in Mexico, the death toll was one of the biggest in the presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) and in the Mexican Drug War. Because of the one-sided casualty rate, however, several media outlets have expressed doubts about the official version of the incident. The government claims that the events resulted in higher casualties from the side of the CJNG because law enforcement was better trained and equipped. However, critics believe that it may be a result of a staged incident or extrajudicial mass murder. On social media, some people uploaded several photographs of the crime scene that they believed showed some discrepancies. The Federal Police, however, conducted tests on the corpses and determined that all the CJNG gunmen had gunshot residue (meaning that they used their firearms to attack the officiers), and that they were killed from a distance (meaning that they were not killed execution-style). Despite the Federal Police's conclusions, the CNDH decided to open an independent investigation and did not discard the possibility of a mass murder case. In August 2015, leading journalist Carlos Loret de Mola reportedly had access to the details of the investigation and published an article claiming that the killings were indeed extrajudicial. According to his findings, at least 70% of all the victims had a coup de grâce. He also stated that one of the victims did not have gunshot wounds and showed signs of a physical beating. As stated by other critics, Loret de Mola said that the corpses were moved around and that guns were planted next to them to resemble a shootout. This was apparently noticeable because some of the gun magazines were reportedly placed in incorrect models, and thus impossible to use during combat. In addition, given the corpses' state of decomposition, Loret de Mola argued that the shootout occurred between 4 and 5 a.m., several hours before the Federal Police reported that it happened. In August 2016, the CNDH concluded their investigation and stated that at least 22 of the 42 were killed extrajudicially. They said that the Federal Police killed 22 men, most of them from Ocotlán, Jalisco, and then moved their bodies to the scene in order to fake their deaths there. The CNDH believes that this attack was a retaliation from the Federal Police. They suspected that the men were involved in organized crime since Ocotlán was traditionally a base and recruitment hub of the CJNG. The Federal Police, however, denies these findings and stated that the police's response was proportionate to the aggression they received from the gunmen killed at the shootout. ==Arrests and legal actions== The three detainees who surrendered and turned themselves in during the shootout were sent to the Office of the General Prosecutor in Michoacán for their formal declaration on May 22, 2015. They said they were natives of the state of Jalisco, but the municipalities where they were born, their names, and their ages were not revealed to the media that day. It was later confirmed that their names were Roberto Rafael Gutiérrez Rodríguez, José Eduardo Mares Lara, and César Jesús López Solís. They confessed that they had been recruited by the CJNG a few weeks before to sell drugs, carry out extortions, spy on law enforcement, and serve as foot soldiers in their confrontations against security forces. From there they were transferred to SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigation agency, in Mexico City, before being taken to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 4 (also known as \\"El Rincón\\"), a maximum-security prison in Tepic, Nayarit. Federal authorities decided to carry out legal actions against the three for violating Mexico's Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives, which prohibits civilians from using weapons exclusively used by the Mexican Armed Forces. ==Identification of bodies== On May 24, 2015, forensic specialists identified 28 of the 43 bodies. Some of the family members complained that the victims were facially unrecognizable and questioned the official version of the events. An unnamed state official from Michoacán who was not authorized to speak with the press confirmed that all the victims were male and between 25 and 45 years old, and that most of them were native of Ocotlán, Jalisco. Others were from the State of Mexico, Michoacán, Aguascalientes, Coahuila, Sonora, and Tabasco. By May 25, 36 bodies had been handed over to their respective family members. Two days later, 38 bodies had been identified. For the four remaining bodies, Michoacán state authorities carried out DNA tests to the family members in order to determine the identities. One of the four corpses, however, was severely burned and physically unrecognizable. ==FootnotesReferences== Category:2015 crimes in Mexico Category:Attacks in 2015 Category:Jalisco New Generation Cartel Category:May 2015 crimes in North America Category:Mexican drug war Category:Organized crime events in Mexico ","title":"2015 Tanhuato–Ecuandureo shootout"},{"id":"46781458","text":"Apollo Theater 03/09/12 is a live album by Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, released in November 2014 and was the first official release through the Bruce Springsteen Archives.

After having played at the World Games in 2001 and 2005, they made their Olympic debut at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where they won the silver medal, losing the final to Fiji. ==Olympic history== When rugby sevens was admitted to the Summer Olympics in 2009, it was not initially known how Great Britain could qualify. As England, Wales and Scotland; three of the nations that make up Great Britain all compete separately in international competition, it was suggested that if any of them gained a qualifying spot then Great Britain would qualify. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), stated that Great Britain must select a lead nation to be the only one able to gain the qualification spot. The individual British rugby unions selected England to be the lead nation as the Rugby Football Union was the only British union to fund a full-time rugby sevens programme. England secured Great Britain's qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics by finishing fourth in the 2015 Sevens World Series. ==Eligibility== While England was the team that qualified Great Britain for the 2016 Olympics, the Great Britain national rugby sevens team is able to select players from Wales and Scotland as well as England similar to the British and Irish Lions in rugby union. Northern Irish players according to the British Olympic Association's rules as British citizens would have been eligible to play for Great Britain; however the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) announced that Northern Ireland players would represent the Ireland national rugby sevens team as rugby in Ireland is organised on an All-Ireland basis. However, it was stated that Northern Irish and Ulster contracted players could legally challenge that determination, particularly if Ireland failed to qualify. ==Tournament historyWorld Games=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !colspan=10World Games Rugby 7s - !style=\\"width:5.5em;Year !style=\\"width:7em;Round !Position ! ! ! ! - bgcolor=#ddeeff align=left Quarter final  7  5  1  4  0 - align=left 2005 Third play-off  4  5  2  3  0 - bgcolor=#ddeeff align=left 2009 colspan=\\"6\\" rowspan=2 f9f9f9;\\"Did not participate - align=left 2013 - !Total!!0 Titles!!2/4!!10!!3!!7!!0 } ===Summer Olympic Games=== A silver medal for Great Britain in the 2016 Olympics is a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament.

On 31 May 2015, as most of the offensive operations in the western Al-Hasakah Governorate ended, the part of the offensive in the Ras al-Ayn District expanded into the Tell Abyad region, in the northern Raqqa Governorate. ==BackgroundThe offensiveTell Tamer countryside and Mount Abd al-Aziz=== Map of the maximum gains made by ISIL advances during the Eastern al-Hasakah offensive, by mid-April 2015. On 6 May 2015, Kurdish forces launched an offensive in the area of Tell Tamer to recapture territory they had previously lost to ISIL. Over the next three days, the YPG advanced in the Aalyah area, northwest of Tell Tamer, and elsewhere, while backed up by U.S.-led Coalition air-strikes. On the fourth day of the offensive, Kurdish Commander Rûbar Qamishlo, per whom the operation was named, was heavily wounded. Commander Qamishlo died of his wounds on 14 May. On 10 May, the YPG advanced on the road between Tell Tamer and Aleppo. On 11 May, the YPG advanced in the al-Salihiyyi area and continued advancing northwest of Tell Tamer the following day, eventually capturing the Alya area by 13 May. On 15 May, the YPG, backed up by the Syriac MFS and Khabour Guards, advanced in the Tal Hormoz area amid continuing fighting and an ISIL car-bomb attack. Two days later, the YPG captured parts of Tal Hormoz amid mutual bombardment by both sides and an ISIL suicide car-bomb attack, while clashes also took place around Razaza village where Coalition air- strikes took place. On 18 May, the YPG-led forces captured two villages overlooking the road towards Mount Abdulaziz. On the following day, the YPG captured another three villages on the road heading towards the mountain, as ISIL hit them with two suicide car-bombs. In all, between 17 and 19 May, the YPG captured about 20 villages. On 20 May, the YPG and allied forces captured wide parts of the mountain. In addition, on 21 May, they seized the village of Aghaybesh, located on the road between Qamishli and Aleppo. On 21 May, Kurdish-led forces captured the Assyrian villages of Tal Shamira and Tal Nasri, as well as two other villages. Thus, they completed the first stage of their two-week offensive successfully, recapturing Christian villages that ISIL took control of three months earlier and seizing Mount Abd al-Aziz. ===Ras al-Ayn countryside=== On 26 May, the YPG captured the town of Mabrouka, in the border area of Ras al-Ayn, bringing them closer to the ISIL-held border town of Tell Abyad, then a major transit point for ISIL black-market oil commerce and foreign fighters from Turkey. In all, since 6 May, the YPG and allied forces captured 4,000 square kilometers of territory throughout the western Al-Hasakah Governorate, including 230 towns, villages and farmlands. After the capture of Mabrouka, the YPG launched attacks on ISIL-held villages on the border. The Kurds claimed that 184 ISIL fighters were killed between 25 and 28 May. On 29 May, the YPG captured the entire countryside of Ras al-Ayn, as they continued the second phase of their campaign. Later that day, clashes on the administrative boundary between Al-Hasakah and Raqqa provinces took place that left 30 civilians dead at Nis Tal, on the Syrian–Turkish border, according to SOHR. In contrast, Kurdish sources claimed nearly 100 people were massacred. The civilians were killed by ISIL while trying to escape an advance by the jihadists. Meanwhile, the Kurds executed 20 civilians on the charges of supporting ISIL and burned and demolished homes of suspected ISIL supporters near Tell Tamer and Ras al-Ayn. On 31 May 2015, Kurdish forces pushed beyond the provincial boundary between the Al-Hasakah and Raqqa Governorates, thus ending the offensive operations within the western Al-Hasakah Governorate. ==Aftermath== Map of the territorial changes in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, after the conclusion of the YPG-led counterattack phase of the Al-Hasakah offensive, on 31 May 2015 On 30 May, ISIL launched an offensive towards the Syrian government-controlled part of Al-Hasakah, and advanced in the city's outskirts after two suicide bombers targeted Syrian Army positions, killing and wounding 50 soldiers. The offensive originated from the ISIL-held town of Al-Shaddadah, south of Al-Hasakah, and was the jihadist organizations's third assault on the city in 2015. On 31 May, Kurdish forces seized four villages on the provincial boundary between Al-Hasakah and Raqqa. The SOHR also reported that clashes were continuing between YPG and ISIL forces to the southwest of Ras al-Ayn.

Lee (February 8, 1859 – February 13, 1929), was a wealthy lumberman from Pollock and then Alexandria, Louisiana, who served as a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for his adopted Grant Parish from 1904 to 1908. His term corresponded with the administration of Governor Newton C. Blanchard. ==Biography== One of eight children of Stephen Lee, Sr., and the former Rebecca Grantham, Lee was born two years before the start of the American Civil War in Perry County in southeastern Mississippi. He was a lineal descendant of Light Horse Harry Lee of Virginia, the father of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. His grandfather, Elijah Lee of North Carolina, fought in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson. Lee's middle was derived from his paternal grandmother, Martha Roland. The Lees left Perry County when he was twelve years of age. He was educated in the public schools of Grant Parish; after reaching adulthood, he taught school for a number of years. Lee was the president and general manager of the Lee Lumber Company, which operated a large sawmill at Tioga in northwestern Rapides Parish. The company closed c. 1917 after the nearby timber was exhausted. He was the Grant Parish assessor during the 1890s, having been appointed to the since elected position by then Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. After his legislative term ended, he relocated to Alexandria. He had a large political following and worked in 1928 for the successful election of Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Huey Pierce Long, Jr., as the Louisiana governor. Lee was a cousin by marriage of Huey Long. On November 12, 1884, Lee married Martha Cornelia Nugent (1862-1933), a daughter of Matthew and Julie Ann Mackie Nugent, pioneer Grant Parish settlers. Lee died of an illness of several months at his Alexandria home at the intersection of Fourth and St. James streets five days after his seventieth birthday. He was survived by his widow and four children, Maude Lee Eubank (1885-1958) and husband Benjamin Franklin Eubank (1882-1962), J. H. Lee, and Ethel Lee Jarrell (1896-1967) and husband Marion Fahy Jarrell (1897-1977), all of Alexandria, and Mrs. S. J. Rogers of Monroe in Ouachita Parish in northeast Louisiana. Three other Lee children had died prior to their father, Florence, Lucille, and Samuel Patterson Lee. He had two surviving grandsons, one of whom, James Eubank served briefly in the Louisiana House in 1952, during which time he was a floor leader for Governor Robert F. Kennon and a big man. Representative Eubank died of a heart attack in Alexandria at the age of thirty-seven.

Seductive details can take the form of text, animations, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the learning objectives of a lesson. John Dewey, in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.” While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor learning outcomes. Since the late 1980s, many studies in the field of educational psychology have shown that the addition of seductive details results in poorer retention of information and transfer of learning. Thalheimer conducted a meta-analysis that found, overall, a negative impact for the inclusion of seductive details such as text, photos or illustrations, and sounds or music in learning content.. More recently, a 2020 paper found a similar effect for decorative animations This reduction to learning is called the seductive details effect. There have been criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners. == The research == Example of an image that is relevant to the topic of carbon sequestration. Example of a seductive detail. This image of a fossil-fuel power plant is tangentially related to carbon sequestration. Most studies are conducted through experiments that compare the learning results between two scenarios: an explanation with seductive details and an explanation with no seductive details. The explanation format can vary in form from text-based, video, web- based or presentation style. The seductive details in these experiments includes extraneous details, irrelevant images, irrelevant video and decorative animations . Learning outcomes of participants are determined through a variety of tests that include both recall abilities and problem- solving abilities. This is known as transfer performance. Early research showed that adding seductive details did not have the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be detrimental to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text. An example of a seductive detail in a training context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are designed to make the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content. Harp and Mayer conducted an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In six out of six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were three times more likely to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall. == The psychology == Researchers focus on various aspects of cognitive theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, the construction of a coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function. === Metacognition === Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, looked at readers' ability to monitor their own comprehension. Their study used a science text as the base of a lesson and decorative images as the seductive details. They found that readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images. === Activating inappropriate prior knowledge === A 1998 study by Harp and Mayer determined that it was likely that the seductive details effect created an inappropriate diversion for the learner \\"by activating an inappropriate base of prior knowledge in the learner\\". Further, they found that when seductive details were placed at the beginning of a lesson, a learner's performance would be particularly hindered. However, when seductive details were put at the end of a lesson, a student's performance was similar to a student who had not experienced seductive details in their lesson. === Cognitive Load and Working Memory === Seductive details can act as a source of extraneous cognitive load, occupying some of the limited working space in working memory . A study by Sanchez and Wiley compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies. This vulnerability as it relates to low working memory capacity individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working memory capacity than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children. === Transfer of learning === The seductive details effect has primarily been demonstrated at the point of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial. In another study, students who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required an application of the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall will not be as good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information. == Criticisms == Classic learning theories and the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material. Several recent studies have shown that adding seductive details does not have a significant impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation. ==See also== * Assistive technology * Blended learning * Distance education * E-assessment * Educational animation * Educational research * E-learning (theory) * Instructional design * Instructional theory * Intelligent tutoring system * Learning theory (education) * Technology integration == References == Category:Educational psychology Category:Educational technology Category:Learning theory (education) ","title":"Seductive details"},{"id":"46781555","text":"Medan Maimun (Jawi: ماءيمون ; ) is one of 21 districts in the city of Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia.

The company is more known for being an exchange rate reference to the Venezuelan bolívar, a currency which is not freely convertible; it is also known for the company's focus in monitoring the Venezuelan economy. ==History Founding === DolarToday was founded on May 18, 2010. It is headquartered in Miami, Florida, United States. Prior to the election of Nicolás Maduro in 2013, DolarToday was the second most popular exchange rate reference in Venezuela, behind Lechuga Verde. However, when a scandal caused the demise of Lechuga Verde, DolarToday became the most popular exchange rate reference. Its president is Gustavo Diaz, a Home Depot salesman in Alabama. According to BBC Mundo, DolarToday was founded as \\"a form of protest against a dictatorship increasingly committed to silence and intimidate the media in Venezuela.\\" Up until today, the company's website publishes criticisms about the Maduro administration which the founder states \\"are selected by the site’s writers based in Venezuela\\". === Loss of popularity === As hyperinflation in Venezuela grew out of control, prices changed at such fast paces that Venezuelans no longer relied on the site and would usually set prices on group chats, such as WhatsApp, or through cryptocurrency exchanges. ==DataExchange rates=== Since its inception, DolarToday has provided black market exchange rates that are updated daily for Venezuelans who cannot exchange currencies with the Venezuelan government for the dwindling supply of the US dollar. The company bases its computed exchange rates of the Venezuelan bolívar to the Euro or the United States dollar from the fees on trades in Cúcuta, Colombia, a city near the border of Venezuela. Currently, with no other reliable source other than the black market exchange rates, these rates are used by Reuters, CNBC, and several media news agencies and networks. The Economist states that the rates calculated by DolarToday are \\"erratic\\", but that they are \\"more realistic than the three official rates\\" released by the Venezuelan government. The website maintains that the rates are not manipulated in order to undercut the Venezuelan government. Today the exchange rate of Venezuelan currency, monitored and governed by the Central Bank of Venezuela, is prohibited by the Venezuelan government from being accessed by its citizens. Thus, the exchange rates posted by DolarToday are only accessible outside Venezuela. ===Inflation rate=== DolarToday also publishes the implied inflation rate of the Venezuelan bolívar that is based on their currency exchange rates. The implied inflation rate that DolarToday uses is based on information calculated by Steve Hanke of the Cato Institute. ==Controversy== DolarToday is used as a reference by several finance websites and medias around the world when it comes to reporting the Venezuelan exchange rate. In 2013, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro banned several internet websites, including DolarToday, to prevent its citizens accessing the country's exchange rates. Maduro accused DolarToday of fueling an economic war against his government and manipulating the exchange rate. ===Censorship=== According to DolarToday, the Venezuelan government had been attempting to censor the website since November 2013. In March 2015, in a televised appearance, Maduro told the nation that he will ask United States President Barack Obama for the capture of the owners of the company. In a press statement published in the government's website, Maduro's government said that it will exert all legal means against the company in response for defaming the Venezuelan economy. That month, the Venezuelan government attempted to censor the website and brought down websites Amazon, Snapchat, and Pinterest in the process. Since President Maduro made such comments, DolarToday began to face blockages of their website almost every hour in Venezuela. DolarToday then began using mirror sites on content distribution networks, placing cryptic links on their social media pages to such sites since foreign social media sites are difficult for the Venezuelan government to censor. Each time a mirror site is blocked by the Venezuelan government, DolarToday begins to use a new one, with website engineers finding \\"ways to automatically create a new mirror site every 20 minutes\\". ===Lawsuit=== On October 23, 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) filed a lawsuit against DolarToday for allegedly falsifying the country's exchange rates. The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States judge on February 26, 2016, with the judge signing that court did not have the authority to take on the case and that BCV lacked standing to sue. In response, BCV filed an amended complaint on March 4, 2016, alleging specific injuries including diminished seigniorage, harm to the reputation of the bank, and deprivation of capital available to the bank. ==Reception== Approximately 1 million people visited DolarToday's website daily in 2015. DolarToday's Android and iOS apps were also among the most downloaded by mobile users in Venezuela. It also has more than 3 million Twitter followers, updating them with the up-to-date exchange rates. The Venezuelan government, however, has viewed DolarToday as a platform to launch an \\"economic war\\" against the government, with Fusion stating: > \\"Dollar Today’s posts are becoming a source of increasing embarrassment to > the Venezuelan government. The site is essentially reminding Venezuelans how > life has become increasingly unaffordable under that country’s socialist > management\\". According to George Selgin, Cato Institute's director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, the lawsuit by the Venezuelan government against DolarToday \\"offers a remarkable glimpse at the twisted logic of totalitarian regimes\\" and that if something were to happen to the website, the Cato Institute shares the same data and more on their Troubled Currencies Project website. Selgin, regarding to the fact that the Cato Institute publishes the same information as DolarToday, stated: > \\"So, if the Central Bank of Venezuela really wants to snuff-out information > concerning its mismanagement of the bolívar, shutting down DolarToday just > won’t cut it: it’s going to have to shut us down as well. So how ‘bout it, > guys? Our lawyers can’t wait!\\" ==Awards and recognition== In 2014, DolarToday received a PremiosClick award and was recognized as one of the best 100 websites in Venezuela and one of the best economics websites. ==References* * * Category:American news websites Category:Venezuelan news websites Category:Media of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Internet properties established in 2010 ","title":"DolarToday"},{"id":"46781586","text":"Lantern is the second studio album by Scottish producer and DJ Hudson Mohawke.

The Middleton campus of Hopwood Hall College on the site of Hopwood Hall. Hopwood Hall is a Grade II* historic house in Middleton, Greater Manchester, England, which was the ancestral country home of the Hopwoods, landed gentry who held it from the 12th century. Hopwood Hall was founded as a moated site. Later, the property had pleasure grounds and an extensive park with scattered woods. Features in the grounds included a kitchen garden, ice house, ha-ha, Italian garden, fountain, corn mill and small cross-shaped bower or grotto. Hopwood Hall gives its name to an electoral ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, and Hopwood Hall College, a further education college with a campus on the original estate grounds. ==Architecture== Hopwood Hall is a Grade II*-listed two-storey brick- and-stone manor house, built in a quadrangle around a timber-framed hall that has been dated back to 1426. Some of the current building dates back to the early 17th century, with some late-16th century elements. The 1830s ice house in the grounds is also listed. After over 500 years, the Hopwoods were no longer living at the estate in 1923. The Hall was utilised by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation (LCC) during World War II. The corporation used it, in conjunction with Blackfriars House, to run the firm during the war years. After the war, in 1946, the Hall became a training ground for Roman Catholic teachers under the De La Salle Brothers. Hopwood Family On part of the estate grounds, the Brothers built a concrete chapel (1964–65) designed by Frederick Gibberd (architect of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral), now deconsecrated but a listed building. It has been retained for use by Hopwood Hall College as the Milnrow Building. ==Occupants and ownersHopwood family=== The family name Hopwood is a corruption of \\"Hopwode\\", which dates from when a Knight was granted land between the then townships of Hopwood, Thornham, and Middleton. Thesse estates - Hopwood, Birch, Stanleycliffe and Thornham - were ruled thereafter by the specific family of \\"Hopwode de Hopwode\\". For a period of at least 500 years, the Hopwoods were interred in the churchyard of the Church of St Leonard, Middleton. The family is documented since before 1380, when Alain de Hopwood was mentioned. Edmund Hopwood was a magistrate and sheriff during the Commonwealth of England, and a member of the Presbyterian congregation at Bury.'Townships: Hopwood.' A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 5. Ed. William Farrer and J. Brownbill. London: Victoria County History, 1911. 170–173. British History Online. Web. 22 May 2015. http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol5/pp170-173. ===Lord Byron=== The poet Lord Byron (1788-1824), stayed with the Gregge-Hopwood family at Hopwood Hall from the end of September 1811 for about 10 days. He had come up to try and sell parts of the Byron family estate in Rochdale, a complex deal that was not to be completed fully in his lifetime. The 23-year-old poet probably spent his days at the Hall revising the draft of his ground breaking poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. A first hand account of his stay and the impression he made on the Gregge-Hopwood family and their friends can be found in an essay 'Byron’s Week in Middleton', by Anne Falloon of Middleton Archaeological Society, published in the Byron Journal of 2013. ===Hopwood DePree=== In September 2017, The Daily Telegraph released a feature article announcing American actor and entrepreneur Hopwood DePree, a descendant of the Hopwoods, had accepted an offer from Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council to take over Hopwood Hall with plans to restore it. DePree had been living in Hollywood and subsequently has moved to England to pursue the restoration full time. Emergency work to make the building structurally sound and waterproof started in May 2018. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester *Listed buildings in Middleton, Greater Manchester ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale Category:Country houses in Greater Manchester Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Manchester Category:Grade II* listed houses Category:Middleton, Greater Manchester ","title":"Hopwood Hall"},{"id":"46781611","text":"The Agora, Cleveland 1978 is a live album by Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, released in December 2014 and was the second official release through the Bruce Springsteen Archives. The concert is available on CD-R and digital download at http://live.brucespringsteen.net. Recorded at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio on August 9, 1978, during the band's Darkness Tour, the show is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the most essential live recordings by Springsteen and the E Street Band. Rolling Stone said of the recording \\"This is simply the greatest live LP this greatest of live rockers has ever officially released.\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/bruce-springsteen- the-agora-cleveland-1978-20150113 The show was originally broadcast live on the radio with bootlegs circulating for years but this marks the first official release of the album, completely restored and remastered. ==Background== The concert was sponsored by radio station WMMS as part of their 10th anniversary.

The team played their first competitive match at the 2016 Summer Olympics after England finished in an Olympic qualifying place at the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. ==Olympic history== Britain vs Brazil at the 2016 Olympics When rugby sevens was admitted to the Summer Olympics in 2009, it was unknown how Great Britain could qualify. England, Wales and Scotland; three of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom that Great Britain represents at the Olympics, all compete separately within international sevens competition. It was suggested that if any of them finished in an Olympic qualifying spot then Great Britain would qualify through them. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Rugby Board (IRB) clarified that Great Britain must select only one nation to be the only one able to obtain qualification as it was viewed that the three individual nations could give Great Britain three chances to qualify compared with other nations only having one. The individual British rugby unions selected England to be the lead nation due to their professional sevens set-up. This also meant that Wales and Scotland could no longer participate in the repecharge competition on behalf of the Sevens Women Grand Prix Series if they qualified due to participation in the repecharge being limited to nations who could qualify for the Olympics. England secured Great Britain's qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics by finishing fourth in the 2015 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series after defeating the United States in the third place playoff in Amsterdam. Following qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics, a new Great Britain Sevens organization was set up called GB Rugby Sevens. Despite England being the nation that qualified Great Britain for the Olympics, it was announced that the Welsh Rugby Union and the Scottish Rugby Union would join the Rugby Football Union for Women in forming the executive board and committee to decide the selection of the team. In May 2015, Joe Lydon was appointed as the performance manager responsible for recruiting the head coach for the Great Britain women's rugby sevens team. ==Eligibility== While England was the team that qualified Great Britain for the Olympics, the Great Britain national rugby sevens team is able to select players from Wales and Scotland as well as England in accordance with IOC eligibility rules based on passport ownership. The Rugby Football Union for Women will make recommendations for the team however the British Olympic Association will be the body that makes the final determination for places. Players would be eligible for selection if they had played in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, Rugby Europe International Sevens or any other invitational tournament 14 months before the Olympics. Northern Irish players, according to the IOC's rules as British passport holders, would have been eligible to represent Great Britain. However the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), which governs rugby in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland together, demanded that Northern Irish players only play for the Ireland national rugby sevens team. However, it was stated that Northern Irish players could legally challenge that demand, particularly if Ireland failed to qualify due to differences in World Rugby and IOC qualifying criteria. ==Tournament recordSummer Olympics=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !colspan=10Olympic Games record - !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! ! -  2016 Bronze Medal Game 4th 6 4 2 0 -  2020 colspan=6Qualified - !Total!!0 Titles!!1/1!!6!!4!!2!!0 } ==Current squadReferences== Category:Great Britain at the Summer Olympics Category:Women's national rugby sevens teams R ","title":"Great Britain women's national rugby sevens team"},{"id":"46781766","text":"Rex Piano is an American film director, screenwriter, TV actor and producer.

Venni is identified with present day Kovilvenni near Thanjavur, southern India. Upon the accession of Karikala, at a young age, there was a civil conflict in the Chola territory. By the time Karikala had succeeded in vanquishing rival claimants and establishing his hold over the territory, the neighboring Chera and Pandya rulers saw their opportunity. The two rulers formed a confederacy which also included eleven Velir chieftains apart from the two major rulers and invaded the Chola territory. It is unclear why even the Velir who were generally the allies of the Cholas stood against Karikala, the scion of the solar race and of the Kashyapa gotra, though Karikala by his brilliant stratagem inflicted a crushing defeat on the alliance in the ensuing encounter at Venni. Following his defeat, the Chera ruler Uthiyan Cheralathan starved himself to death (suicide by slow starvation).

Nicholson on Indian philosophy, describing the philosophical unification of Hinduism, which it places in the Middle Ages. The book was published in the US in 2010 in hardcover, with a paperback edition appearing in 2014. An Indian hardcover edition was published by Permanent Black in 2011. The book won the 2011 award for Best First Book in the History of Religions from the American Academy of Religion, and has been reviewed in numerous professional journals. ==Topics covered== Unifying Hinduism contains 10 chapters. Much of the book focuses on the thought of the medieval Indian philosopher, Vijnanabhiksu. The book's central concern is to show that Vijnanabhiksu provided a philosophical synthesis of diverse schools of Indian philosophy, thereby providing a philosophical unification of Hinduism long before the British colonial conquest and rule of India. This refutes claims that Hinduism only attained unity (or only was \\"invented\\") as a response to colonial influence. After an introductory first chapter, the next five chapters focus on Vijñānabhikṣu's philosophical syntheses. Chapter 2, entitled \\"An Alternate History of Vedanta\\", sets the stage by tracing the history of Bhedābheda Vedānta, a comparatively neglected tradition that teaches the \\"difference and nondifference\\" of Brahman and the individual self. Vijnanabhikshu's version of this \\"Difference and Non-Difference\\" Vedanta is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 offers a historical overview of two important non-Vedanta Indian philosophies, the schools of Sāṃkhya and Yoga, focusing on their views of God, documenting that contrary to widespread views of Sāṃkhya as entirely atheistic, most first millennium Sāṃkhya authors were theists. Chapter 5, \\"Reading Against the Grain of the Samkhyasutras\\", focuses on a controversial assertion by Vijñānabhikṣu that some Sāṃkhyasūtra verses that explicitly argue against God's existence do not ultimately intend to deny God's existence, but represent merely a “temporary concession” (abhyupagamavāda) or “bold assertion” (prauḍhivāda). Finally, Chapter 6, \\"Yoga, Praxis, and Liberation\\", discusses Vijñānabhikṣu's commentary on Patañjali's Yogasūtras, arguing that Vijñānabhikṣu's commentaries on Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga represent a unified whole. Chapter 7, \\"Vedanta and Samkhya in the Orientalist Imagination\\", discusses how Vijñānabhikṣu was diversely viewed by nineteenth-century European scholars, who in some sense can be understood as \\"intellectual inheritors of Vijñānabhikṣu’s thought\\". The next two chapters return to South Asian thought, with Chapter 8 focuses on Indian philosophical doxographies (categorizations) and Chapter 9, \\"Affirmers (Astikas) and Deniers (Nastikas) in Indian History\\", providing a history and preferred translation of the two terms āstika and nāstika, which are more often translated as \\"orthodox\\" and \\"heterodox\\". The concluding tenth chapter, \\"Hindu Unity and the Non-Hindu Other\\", discusses the timing of the unification of Hindu philosophical schools, suggesting that the stimulus was the presence of Islam. ==Reception== Unifying Hinduism won the 2011 award for Best First Book in the History of Religions from the American Academy of Religion. Reviews have appeared in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Religious Studies Review, Sophia, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Journal of Asian Studies, Journal of Hindu Studies, South Asian History and Culture, Literature and Theology, Choice, and Metapsychology. Unifying Hinduism has also been discussed in the book Indra's Net. In the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Christopher Key Chapple wrote that the author \\"has created a tour-de-force that puts India’s premodern thinkers in conversation with its postmodern intellectuals\\". In particular, Also in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Michael S. Allen wrote that the book won Best First Book \\"for good reason: lucid and accessible... Nicholson’s book offers an excellent model for South Asianists seeking to engage with the wider field of religious studies\\", while the book \\"can also be recommended to nonspecialists with interests in religious identity, boundary formation, and comparative theology\\". To Allen, \\"Nicholson has convincingly shown that a process of unification began well before the British colonial period, extending back several centuries at the very least\\". However, \\"there is reason to suspect that the beginnings of the process he describes predate the twelfth century.... [which] would in turn call into question the degree to which Islam influenced the process.\\" In Religious Studies Review, Jeffrey D. Long wrote that the book \\"sets the record straight\\" regarding the historical emergence Hinduism, and \\"promises to change the scholarly conversation on Hindu identity\\". Long describes the book as \\"marvelously clear, meticulously researched, and tightly argued\\", pointing out that the book also In Sophia, Reid Locklin wrote the book was \\"somewhat fragmented\\", with chapters showing marks of prior publication or presentation elsewhere, but that \\"The cumulative effect is nevertheless very impressive\\", and that \\"Given the enormous scope of its enquiry, the work is relatively concise, very accessible and therefore suitable for the advanced undergraduate or graduate classroom\\". In Journal of the American Oriental Society, John Nemec wrote that the book's strengths \\"lie with the larger, theoretical argument Nicholson makes regarding the role of doxography in shaping knowledge\\", and that the book But Nemec was still left \\"with certain doubts and questions\\", such as how our understanding of Vijnanabhiksu's views might change if more of his works were available in translation, and whether premodern Indian philosophers might have been \\"more aware of their mutual differences than this volume allows\\". Despite such doubts, Nemec suggested that the volume would be \\"of value to medievalists, scholars of Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga, and of Indian philosophy more generally, to scholars concerned with colonialism, and even those concerned with communal relations in contemporary South Asia.\\" In Journal of Asian Studies, Tulasi Srinivas wrote that she \\"found this book very valuable, challenging of my assumptions\\", calling the book \\"erudite and thought provoking\\", and its argument \\"powerful, well researched and delivered, and... remarkably persuasive\\". She wondered whether \\"penetrability\\" between various philosophical schools might be overstated, and how views of Vijnanabhiksu might change if more of his works were available in translation. She regarded the book as having \\"political ramifications that suggest that the origins of Hinduism are not only the Vedas, as Hindu nationalists claim... nor a product of British colonial rule... as understood by some scholars.\\" She also viewed the book as significant for its \\"broader political and critical claim that Bhedabheda Vedanta is valuable and on par with the better known schools of Indian philosophy\\". In Journal of Hindu Studies, David Buchta wrote that the author's position is \\"clearly and coherently argued and well-supported\\", stating that \\"the balance that Nicholson's analysis offers, correcting exaggerated claims about the colonial invention of Hinduism, is its most important contribution to the study of Hinduism\\". Furthermore, Nicholson \\"shows sensitivity to the political implications of the discussion and the possibility that scholarship supporting the pre-colonial development of a sense of Hindu unity can be co-opted in support of communalism\\", and is therefore \\"careful to emphasise that, while Hindus may have long agreed that a sense of unity exists, the details have just as long been to subject of debate and development\\". In South Asian History and Culture, Kaif Mahmood pointed out that \\"beliefs\\" have been only one among many types of religious expression that also include religious art, ritual, and law; Mahmood suggested that Nicholson engaged in \\"unstated [and debatable] theoretical presumptions that philosophy is identical to religion\\". Nicholson's analyses also raise the question, unaddressed by the book, of whether \\"if what we call Hinduism was invented for the purpose of preserving a particular identity, what was it that was being preserved, if there was no Hinduism before? A weak identity may be strengthened, even refined, but can an identity be invented out of nothing?\\" Mahmood is also concerned that the book fails to discuss or acknowledge a core question related to Vijnanbhiksu's motivation, that is In Literature and Theology, Robert Leach wrote that the book was \\"rich, erudite, challenging, and always interesting [and] it will be very difficult to read this book and retain the notion that the idea of Hinduism was dreamt up, virtually from scratch, in the 19th century\\". Leach added that Leach also found of interest Nicholson's conclusion that \\"in Classical India nastika principally denoted non-acceptance of 'correct ritual performance' (i.e. heteropraxy), but in late medieval Vedanta came to be understood as the rejection of 'correct opinion' (heterodoxy)\\", pointing out that \\"This conclusion can have significant consequences for the debate on the so-called 'Protestantisation' of Hinduism in the 19th century\\". In Choice, R. Puligandla described the book as \\"clear, analytical, well-documented\\", recommending that \\"all scholars and students of Hinduism and Indian philosophy should find this book beneficial and rewarding\\", although \\"Nicholson's arguments and conclusions will not persuade some scholars, especially those who hold the view that Hinduism as a unified tradition has existed since ancient times\\". In Metapsychology, Vineeth Mathoor described the book as presenting \\"the history of [the] dialectical relation between Hinduism and the many streams within it [yielding] what it today stands for: tolerance, pluralism and inclusivism\\", calling the book \\"path- breaking\\" and \\"a must read for scholars of Indian history, Hinduism and south Asian religious traditions\\". == Controversy == In his book Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity, Rajiv Malhotra quoted and cited numerous ideas from Unifying Hinduism, describing it as an \\"excellent study of the pre-colonial coherence of Hinduism\\", , and as a \\"positive exception to many [reifying, homogenizing, and isolating] trends in scholarship\\" by Westerners about the evolution of Hindu philosophy. However, despite the citations, it was alleged that Rajiv Malhotra's work actually plagiarised Nicholson's work. It led to an online controversy without any actual lawsuit being filed against Rajiv Malhotra. In response to Nicholson, Malhotra stated \\"I used your work with explicit references 30 times in Indra's Net, hence there was no ill-intention,\\" and provided with a list of these citations. He added that he will be removing all references to Nicholson, replacing them with original Indian sources. Thereafter, a re-written version of the debated chapter was posted on the book's website. ==Editions== The original hardcover edition was published by in 2010 by Columbia University Press.

After finishing second in the inaugural season of the television competition Stimme 2000, she was signed to a recording deal with Hansa Records. In 2001, she released her first single, \\"Bum\\", under her stage name Catterfeld; the song failed to chart in any music market. Her first album, Meine Welt (2003), was preceded by four further singles, including \\"Niemand sonst\\" and \\"Gefühle\\", both of which reached the top forty of the German Albums Chart, and \\"Für Dich\\" which reached number one in Austria, Germany and Switzerland and marked her commercial breakthrough. Meine Welt went Platinum in Germany and earned a Gold certification in Austria and Switzerland. Farben meiner Welt, Catterfeld's second album, reached the top ten in Germany and earned a Gold certification from the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). The album's lead single, \\"Du hast mein Herz gebrochen\\", was her second number one hit. Catterfeld's third album, Unterwegs, produced the top three single \\"Glaub an mich\\", and was also certified Gold by the BVMI. Her fourth record, Aura, debuted at number ten on the German Albums Chart and was less successful than its predecessors. While lead single \\"Erinner mich, dich zu vergessen\\" peaked at number six on the German Singles Chart, the follow-up, \\"Die Zeit ist reif\\", failed to reach the top fifty. Catterfeld released her fifth album, Blau im Blau, on Columbia Records in 2010. It marked a stronger shift towards the adult contemporary genre and peaked at number 37 on the German Albums Chart only, becoming her lowest-charting effort then. Lieber so, her sixth album, was released in 2013 and reached number 21 in Germany. Re-released in 2015, the album surpassed its initial peak when it climbed to number eight on the German Albums Chart following the broadcast of the second season of Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert, the German adaption of The Best Singers series. The second single, \\"Lieber so\\", has since reached number 23 in Germany, Catterfeld's highest-charting single in a decade. ==AlbumsStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions and certifications !

The district encompasses the area around the historic Fort Piute and includes a variety of prehistoric and historic resources. The Piute Pass area was inhabited by several Native American tribes dating back to the middle Holocene epoch. The Patayan people lived in the area during the late prehistoric period, while the Chemehuevi people lived there after the Patayan and through the early historic period. Both groups left petroglyphs in the area, and remains of Chemehuevi habitation sites have also been discovered.

In 2014, he was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing a Lincoln district. Hansen is a member of the Democratic Party. ==Personal life and professional career== Hansen was born February 11, 1988, in Morgantown, West Virginia. He was raised in Lincoln, and graduated from Lincoln Southwest High School in 2006. He attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, receiving a B.A. in psychology and political science in 2010; he then attended the University of Nebraska School of Law, from which he received a J.D. in 2013. As of late 2013, Hansen taught sociology and math one-on-one to gifted students as a mentor for Lincoln Public Schools. He sat on the board of the University Place Community Organization and on Lincoln's Cable Advisory Board. ==Political career2014 election=== 2014 primary In November 2013, Hansen announced that he would run in the 2014 election for a seat in the Nebraska state legislature, representing the 26th District in northeastern Lincoln. The incumbent, Democrat Amanda McGill, was precluded by Nebraska's term-limits law from running for a third consecutive term. Hansen was one of four Democrats seeking the position. Larry Weixelman was a University of Nebraska employee who also owned a market-analysis and software company that worked to promote tourism in Nebraska. Justin Valencia, an attorney, was an adjunct professor at Bellevue University. Bob Van Valkenburg, a 78-year-old described as a \\"perennial candidate\\", had been a registered Republican but had changed his registration to Democrat in recent years; he stated that he was running because of his dislike for one of the other candidates, and because being in the Legislature was on his \\"bucket list\\". A single Republican was also in the race. Brent Smoyer, an attorney, worked as an aide for state legislator Scott Lautenbaugh. Smoyer had run for the Legislature from another Lincoln district in 2008, but had been eliminated after placing third in the three-way nonpartisan primary. In 2010, he had won a four-year term on the Lancaster County Board. As the primary drew near, Smoyer led the field in fundraising; three weeks before the May 13 election, he had raised $19,000 and had $13,000 cash on hand. Hansen led the Democratic candidates, with $11,300 raised and $1,150 on hand. Weixelman reported $5,500 raised and $325 on hand; Valencia and Van Valkenburg had not filed a campaign-finance report with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission, indicating that they had not raised or spent the $5,000 that would require such a report. When the nonpartisan primary was held, Smoyer secured a narrow plurality, with 1968 of the 6086 votes, representing 32.3% of the total. Hansen came in second, with 1823 votes, or 30.0%. Weixelman placed third with 1105 votes (18.2%); Van Valkenburg took 597 votes (9.8%); and Valencia received 593 votes (9.7%). 2014 general election As the top two vote-getters in the primary, Smoyer and Hansen moved on to the general election. The candidates differed on a number of salient issues. Hansen supported the proposed expansion of Medicaid in Nebraska under the terms of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, declaring, \\"Ensuring that all Nebraskans have access to quality health care should remain a top priority of the Legislature\\"; Smoyer opposed it, expressing concern lest the federal government renege on its promise to reimburse states for the costs of the Medicaid expansion. Hansen favored the abolition of capital punishment in Nebraska; Smoyer favored keeping the death penalty, though using it rarely. Hansen was described as supporting a woman's right to an abortion; Smoyer, as \\"anti-abortion\\". Hansen wanted to repeal Nebraska's policy of denying driver's licenses to persons who were residing illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who were granted an exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy; Smoyer believed that such licenses should continue to be denied. Hansen believed that Nebraska's law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets should be kept; Smoyer favored its repeal. In the course of the entire legislative campaign, Hansen raised about $63,000 and spent about $59,000. His major contributors included the Nebraska State Education Association, with contributions totaling about $18,500, the local chapter of the International Association of Fire Fighters, with a contribution of $4000, and the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys, contributing $3500. Smoyer raised about $94,000 and spent about $95,000. His major contributors included the Nebraska Realtors, which gave him $8500 (also contributing $2000 to the Hansen campaign), the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which contributed about $5600, and the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, which contributed about $5600. Hansen was endorsed by the Nebraska State Education Association and by the AFL–CIO; Smoyer, by the National Rifle Association and the Omaha Police Officers Association. Smoyer also won the editorial endorsement of the Lincoln Journal Star, which had endorsed him and Valencia in the primary election. When the general election was held, Hansen defeated Smoyer, with 5376 votes to Smoyer's 4442, for a 55%–45% margin. ===Legislative tenure=== 2015 session In the Legislature's 2015 session, Hansen was appointed to the General Affairs Committee, the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, and the Urban Affairs Committee. As the youngest member of the Legislature, he was named the chair and single member of the Enrollment and Review Committee, charged with correcting spelling and formatting errors in engrossed bills. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to DACA beneficiaries; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Hansen voted in favor of the death-penalty repeal, and to override Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted for passage of LB623, and to override the gubernatorial veto; and he abstained on the vote to pass the gas-tax increase, then voted to override the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Hansen voted for the bill in its 29–15 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37–8, with 4 present and not voting; Hansen was among those voting in favor. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33–11–5; the veto override passed 31–13–5. Hansen voted for the bill, and for the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32–17 cloture motion, Hansen was among those who voted against the bill. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hansen's Nebraska Legislature website *\\"Matt Hansen for Legislature\\", 2014 campaign website.

Kampung Madras encompasses an area of approximately 10 hectares, and hosts a large Indian community (mostly Tamil). Now a now part of the Medan Polonia district, Kampung Madras is home to many sporting goods resellers, sari stores, and other shophouses. In the mid- nineteenth century, the colonial Dutch began importing Indian labor to work on Sumatran plantations and to construct roads, trenches, and dykes; today, Sumatra is home to as many as 60,000 people of Indian descent, many of whom reside in Medan.http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/pallavi-aiyar-on- indonesias-medan-city-and-its-deeprooted-indian-connections/article8227604.ece This area was originally called Patisah (), and the name became a district in Medan called Petisah. The enclave's name changed to Kampung Madras to reflect the native land of the people of Indian descent who reside there. However, many people still refer to the place as Kampung Keling, a more derogatory term that may be offensive to some of its residents and others. Every year, Kampung Madras becomes a meeting point for Hindu and/or Tamil festivals such as Thaipusam, Thai Pongal, and Deepavali. == Location == Kampung Madras is made of a ten acre landscape beginning the edge of Sungai Soekamoelia off Jalan Palang Merah, precisely the corner of Bank Sumut Medan, eclipsing towards Jalan Diponegoro to the East encircling all the way to Jalan Jendral Sudirman Sekolah Immanuel (Formerly Known as Queen Beatrice School) towards Sungai Babura, covering all the areas towards Jalan Cik di Tiro leading to Titi Berlian on the North rounding up all the way to the Chettiar Kovil in Jalan Kebun Bunga.

What boggles one's mind to reflect of Kampung Madras is: Kampung Madras is not only home to many Hindu religious shrines, but there are historical mosques as well, to mention; there are 4 mosques, Masjid Agung, Masjid Gaudiah, Masjid South India and Masjid Al-Madras (Cik di Tiro). 5 Historical churches, namely GPIB opposite the governor's office, the Methodist Church at Jalan Hang Tua, GKPS church at Jln.

There is also Khalsa Indian school, later changed to be Khalsa National School, that has a long history of producing the most English speakers of the resident of Medan and beyond, precisely located next to the Gurduwara in Kampung Madras. == Temples == Several Hindu temples are located in Kampung Madras: * Sri Mariamman Temple * Thandayuthapani Temple * Sri Kaliamman Temple * Maha Muniswarar Temple == Mosques == Two mosques serve the enclave: Jami Mosque, built in 1887, and Ghaudiyah Mosque.

It allows designers to share and sell their 3D printable designs, and people with 3D printers to print those designs on their own printers. ==About== Pinshape was founded in 2013 by Lucas Matheson (CEO), Nick Schwinghamer (COO), and Andre Yanes (CTO). The site is a marketplace that showcases the digital work of 3D designers from all over the world. 3D print designers set their own prices for their design files, and also choose which license to offer their work under (Creative Commons or other). People with 3D printers can browse the selection of designs and then either get the file for free to print themselves, or pay the designer for access to the file before printing. Designs found on Pinshape can be directly downloaded if the designer allows, or they can be sent directly to a user’s 3D printer using a direct browser-to-printer experience that removes the need to access the design source file and thus, increases intellectual property (IP) security. Utilizing a cloud slicing and file streaming technology, designers have the option of charging per print, so that 3D files aren’t stored on a customer’s computer. Pinshape also allows its users to review designs and share the settings they used to print off the files. On 30 March the company announced about its closing. \\"The value of a 3DP marketplace is obvious in the long term, but for many, the path to monetization isn’t so clear.

A baron in the peerage of Ireland, he sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for thirteen of the years between 1806 and 1830. Lord Rancliffe's politics were those of an advanced whig, with links to radicalism, and by the 1830s he supported many of the demands of the Chartists. His championing of progressive causes was later tempered by his private support for protectionism, and had always jarred with his public image as a playboy enjoying his inherited wealth. The History of Parliament describes him as an \\"aristocratic buffoon\\". == Early life and family == Parkyns was born on 10 June 1785, the oldest child and only son of Thomas Boothby Parkyns, 1st Baron Rancliffe (1755–1800). His father was a grandson of Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet (1664–1741), a writer on wrestling whose own father had been awarded the baronetcy in 1681 in recognition of the royalist service of his father Colonel Isham Parkyns during the English Civil War. George was named after his godfather Prince George Augustus, then Prince of Wales and later King George IV, who was a friend of George's father. His father's peerage had been secured in 1795 as a reward for his political support of the 3rd Duke of Portland. As an Irish title, it did not prevent its holder from sitting in the British House of Commons. His mother Elizabeth Anne was the daughter and sole heir of Sir William James, 1st Baronet of Eltham, in Kent. Sir William was a nabob, a self-made man whose fortune was acquired in naval prize money and private commerce from his service with the British East India Company, of which he later became a director. He died of a stroke on the day of his daughter's wedding. == Career  Education, army and inheritance === Parkyns was educated at Harrow, under Rev Dr Drury. His father died of dropsy in November 1800, when George was only 15. He succeeded his father as the second Baron Rancliffe and was placed under guardianship of the Earl Moira (later Marquess of Hastings). In 1801 Moira purchased a commission in the British Army for the young Lord Rancliffe, as a cornet in the 10th Light Dragoons, which was then seen as a first-rate regiment. In 1803 he purchased a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the 15th Light Dragoons. The transfer placed of regiment placed him on half-pay, retaining his rank until the half-pay was stopped in 1834. He also became an equerry to his godfather the Prince of Wales, retaining a close friendship until the prince parted company with the Whigs. On 17 March 1806 he succeeded to the baronetcy of his grandfather Sir Thomas Parkyns, 3rd Baronet. Later the same month he joined Brooks's club, and on his twenty-first birthday in June, he came into an annual income of £21,000 a year (equivalent to £ in ). His inheritance included Bunny Hall and the manor of Bunny in Nottinghamshire, which had been in the Parkyns family since 1574 when it was bought by the barrister Richard Parkyns. === Minehead and marriage === Earl Moira then helped to negotiate for Rancliffe a seat in Parliament. At the general election in November 1806, the 21-year-old Rancliffe was returned as a member of parliament (MP) for Minehead in Somerset. Minehead was a rotten borough, under the patronage of John Fownes Luttrell, whose family had controlled the borough's elections for large periods since its enfranchisement in the 16th century. Fownes Luttrell charged Rancliffe £5,000 for the seat (equivalent to £,000 in ). Rancliffe later cited his experience in Minehead as evidence in favour of parliamentary reform, saying that he had paid a lot of money for the seat but had never in his life set foot in the town. In October 1807 Rancliffe married Earl Moira's niece, Lady Elizabeth Mary Theresa Forbes, daughter of George Forbes, 6th Earl of Granard. The wedding took place by special licence in Castle Forbes, County Longford, Ireland, where the \\"beautiful and accomplished\\" bride was given away by her uncle. The honeymoon was in another seat of the Earl of Granard, Clanhugh Lodge near Mullingar in County Westmeath. The couple had no legitimate children. === Nottingham = Death == Lord Rancliffe died at Bunny Hall on 1 November 1850, aged 65. He had been ill for a long time, and seriously ill for two years. After a funeral service in St Mary's parish church in Bunny on 11 November, he was buried in the Parkyns family vault in the church's chancel. The peerage became extinct on his death, and the baronetcy descended to his first cousin Thomas George Augustus Parkyns, a grandson of the 3rd baronet and the older brother of the travel writer Mansfield Parkyns. His entailed property fell to his nephew Sir Richard Levinge, 7th Baronet of Knockdrin Castle in Ireland, the son of his oldest sister Elizabeth Anne, who had married Sir Richard Levinge, 6th Baronet in 1810. Under the terms of their separation agreement, his estranged wife's income was doubled to £2,000 per annum (equivalent to £,000 in ). == References  External links == * * Category:1785 births Category:1850 deaths Category:People from Rushcliffe (district) Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:10th Royal Hussars officers Category:15th The King's Hussars officers Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Parkyns, George Category:UK MPs who inherited peerages Category:English landowners ","title":"George Parkyns, 2nd Baron Rancliffe"},{"id":"46782126","text":"Grejohn Kyei (born 12 August 1995) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for Swiss side Servette FC. ==Club career== Kyei is a youth exponent from Stade de Reims.

It is the woman's wing of the Popular Front of India, an extremist and militant Islamic fundamentalist organisation in India. In the view of the NWF, \\"the world's largest democracy still has women marginalized and oppressed\\". == Background == The status of Indian women is progressing towards gender equality, but women continue to encounter patriarchal standards. Despite the steps towards gender equality, women still face abuse from society. India has a high rate of rapes, while physical assault and acid attacks are on the rise as well. The National Women's Front was founded with the hope of empowering women in the fight for justice and equality. ===History of the organization=== Although NGOs and humanitarian organizations lend support to women's rights in India, western approaches to feminism may not provide the relief necessary.Subramaniam, M. (2004). The Indian Women's Movement. Contemporary Sociology, 33(6), 635–639. In 2009, the National Women's Front was launched, under the guidance of the controversial Popular Front of India, to \\"create a platform for women through which women can stand up against injustice and fight for their rights\\". The organization started and worked in three states, but is now working within eight states. The aim is to provide support and encourage women living in rural communities that are often overlooked by the government to fight for their equality. == Programs and campaigns== A workshop on Women Safety was organized by the National Women's Front at the India Islamic Cultural Center in New Delhi in 2013 where a participant noted that “the main reason behind the recent rape incident in December 2012 [Referring to Nirbhaya Rape Case] was alcohol, but no one stressed on the probation of alcohol which lead for this heinous crime. A stop this kind of violence we should work on awareness campaign against alcohol.”. In September of the same year National Women's Front organized the national campaign \\"Right to Hijab\\" across the country to create awareness about hijab and also promote the right to cultural identity. In 2014, the NWF Delhi State unit held an International Women's Day celebration with their nationwide campaign \\"Women Representation – The Power to Empower\\". In November of the same year, the NWF organised a conference ‘Awakening’ to debate issues concerning Indian women at Coimbatore. On the eve of the conference, an expo on women's rights and issues was inaugurated by Popular Front of India state president A.S.Ismail. Graphic illustrations of domestic violence, rape, female foeticide and riots victims have been presented at the expo. NWF conducted a campaign related to human rights and legal awareness in various States of India. The Kerala State committee of National Women's Front organized a campaign against the Uniform Civil Code, as a part of national level of initiative to create awareness of the threat posed by the Code to the cultural diversity of India. They termed the Uniform Civil Code \\"anti-national\\" as it eliminates the diversity of different communities ultimately destroying Indian Nationalism. According to them it is a manifestation of anti-Muslim tendencies of Hindutva groups. It strongly condemned the disgraceful attack on muslim women at the Mandsaur railway station in Madhya Pradesh. She called for an end to violence, for the culprits to be brought to justice, and for the Government to control hate speakers. Irom Chanu Sharmila has been fasting since 2000 demanding the withdrawal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) imposed in Manipur. Her arrest, after the release order from the Imphal Sessions Court, was condemned by the NWF national secretariat members who gathered a meeting in their headquarters. When she called an end to her 16 long year fast to enter politics, she received a negative response from the people of Manipur itself.
