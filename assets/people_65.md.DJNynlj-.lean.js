This is Historic Site No. 158, also known as Daewang-am. == Location == The tomb of Munmu of Silla is located in 26, Bonggil-ri, Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. It is located 200 meters off the coast of Bonggil-ri in Yangbuk-myeon. == Appearance == It is the only underwater tomb in the world. It looks like normal rocks from a distance. There is a smaller rock to the south. The area is surrounded by small rocks that are only seen at low tide intervals, making them look like stone beams. It is owned by the Gyeongju National Museum. The monument collapsed early, and two large sections and one small stone were discovered so far, but one stone is not handed over. The stone is a reddish-brown igneous rock with a maximum height of 52cm, 64cm wide and 24cm thick, and the small section is carved with a 2-legged triangle.' Underwater tomb of 'Munmu of Silla' == Underwater tomb == The tomb of Munmu of Silla is located on the sea. To see the tomb, one must go to a rare and mysterious tomb built between small rocks in the middle of the sea. Although the tomb of Munmu of Silla looks like a small rocky island from a distance, it is located on the rock, and it is like a pond in the middle. The rock is built at regular intervals like a pillar, and a large building looks like a turtle. Water flows in and out of the pond in all directions, as the waters that flow in and out of the lake slowly turn around and out to the west. It is believed that the Silla people artificially refined the royal tomb of Munmu of Silla. == History  Silla Dynasty === Munmu of Silla' unified the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but he was worried about the safety of unstable countries and the invasion of Japan. When Japan broke out on the Sea of Japan and killed and pillaged the people, 'Munmu of Silla' began to build temples while increasing military and defense facilities on the east coast. The idea was to defeat the Japanese people with the help of Buddha. But before the temple was finished, 'Munmu of Silla' became ill. 'Munmu of Silla' called his son before his death. \\"If I die, Bury me in Donghae (Sea of Japan). So when he died, but left a will to the of his body be cremated in accordance with Buddhist ceremony to bury the ashes the Sea of Japan. It is called , and it is the Tomb of Munmu of Silla. In this way, 'Munmu of Silla' will become a great dragon and protect the country. His remains from the land in accordance with Munmu of Silla's will be cremated and the Sea of Japan of with and frugal lifestyle he paid funeral. When 'Munmu of Silla' died before completing the temple, his son King Sinmun completed it in 682. And he named it \\" \\" to thank 'Munmu of Silla's grace. Cho geung-seop(조긍섭), who toured Gyeongju from 1918 to 1926 during Korea under Japanese rule, wrote a poem using the tomb of Munmu of Silla. In his poem, Munmu of Silla instructed him to cremate in the Sea of Japan with dying words. People suspected he might have designated such a big tomb. However, people guess that the cremate might have caused him to bury his bones and become a big tomb. He will not get a place like this without great virtue. === A tale of Manpasikjeok === Sinmun of Silla built for his father, Munmu of Silla. In 682, a public official said 'Small mountain in Donghae is coming to Gameunsa'. According to the fortune-telling, King Munmu of Silla, who became the dragon of the sea, and Gim Yu-sin, who became the king of heaven, said, \\" Go out and take the present.\\" When he came and saw at , it looked like a turtle's head and had bamboo on it, divided into two by day and combined into one by night. Nine days after the storm, the king entered the mountain and the dragon said, \\"If you made a flute out of that bamboo, the whole world would be at ease.\\" So he took it out, made a flute and kept it. The name of this flute is Manpasikjeok. The reason for the name is that when the country is worried, he played the flute and country has become quiet. === Tombstone === Unlike most royal tombs, Munmu of Silla's tombstone could not be placed in front of them. He was buried in rocks of the Donghae. It is assumed that Munmu of Silla's tombstone was built at Sacheonwang Temple, a place that was closely related to Munmu of Silla's life. Based on the excavation research, the two royal tombs are believed to be Sacheonwang Temple Historical Hall and Munmu of Silla's Royal Palace. Sacheonwang Temple also appears on the side of Gyeongmyeong of Silla of Samguk sagi, which appears to have been maintained until silla collapsed. However, with the fall of Silla, Munmu of Silla's tombstone has become unknown. However, the existence was confirmed by Hong Yang-ho, then a member of the Gyeongju Buyun, in 1760, and was reconfirmed by Chusa Gim Jeong-hui, who visited Gyeongju in 1817. The lower part of tombstone was discovered in 1961, and the higher part of tombstone was discovered by a gas inspector when it was used as a laundry stone in a house in eastern Gyeongju in 2009. === 2017 === In 2017, the tomb of Munmu of Silla was selected 'the top 10 tourist contents of North Gyeongsang Province'. == Festival  Chunhyang Daeje === in Tomb of Munmu of Silla ' means commemorative rites for ancestors in early spring. The festival is held to inherit the spirit of national defense, to celebrate the king and attract tourists, organized by residents. More than 900 people participated, including heads of government, citizens, and tourists. === Sunrise festival === Every New Year's Day, Gyeongju hold the sunrise festival at the tomb of King Munmu of Silla. The sunrise festival, which was held in 2015, was called 'The sunrise festival of tomb of King Munmu of Silla in Gyeongju' === King Munmu culture festival === The city of gyeongju held various traditional cultural events in front of the tomb of King Munmu of Silla in honor of the great king Munmu. On the first day of the event, the royal procession from Gameunsaji to the Tomb of King Munmu of Silla was reenacted. And There were flying kites, and performing rituals on the king of Munmu. == Succession == 435x435px ROKS Munmu the Great (DDH-976) is the second Destroyer in the South Korean navy.

Sections of the line are also called the Horlofftalbahn (Horloff Valley Railway) and the Seentalbahn (Seen Valley Railway). It originally connected three major railways that run from Giessen, namely: * the Main–Weser Railway (Frankfurt–Gießen–Kassel), * the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, * and the Vogelsberg Railway (Gießen–Fulda). Today only the eleven kilometre-long section to Wölfersheim operates as a feeder line to the regional node of Friedberg, where it connects to the rest of the railway network and, importantly for commuters from the Wetterau, Frankfurt. The Beienheim–Schotten railway, also called the Horlofftalbahn, which branches off in Beienheim to Nidda, opened on the same day and is still operating. == Sections== The line is divided into four sections and a branch line: {   ! Section ! Opened ! Closed ! Length ! Notes -  Friedberg–Wölfersheim-Södel  1897  Operating  11.2 km  Line RB47 of the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund, operated by the Hessische Landesbahn. -  Wölfersheim- Södel–Hungen  1897  2003  12.2 km  Passenger traffic was abandoned on 4 April 2003, while freight traffic had already ended on 31 December 1997. The closure process, which started in the spring of 2004 was interrupted by a contract to preserve the infrastructure. Thus, the line was preserved, but for the time being without a network operator and without an operating license. Reactivation is planned (see #Prospects section). -  Hungen–Laubach  1890  1959  12.7 km  Freight traffic was suspended on 31 December 1997. It was closed in 1999 and the tracks were dismantled around 2007. A cycle path was built on the line in the Hungen area in the spring of 2010. -  Laubach–Mücke  1890  1958/59  13.1 km  Traffic between Freienseen and Mücke stopped on 31 May 1958, while passenger traffic between Hungen and Freienseen and freight traffic between Laubach and Freienseen were discontinued in 1959. The Laubach–Mücke section, also known as the Seental- Eisenbahn (Seen valley railway), was then closed and dismantled. -  Villingen–Friedrichshütte branch line  1896  1959  4.1 km  Originally a narrow-gauge connecting line, mainly for freight to the Friedrichshütte iron foundry. Connection to the main line in Villingen, on the Hungen–Laubach section. } For the Friedberg–Beienheim–Nidda–Schotten line, which was built at the same time, see the Beienheim–Schotten railway article. == History== The line was originally planned and operated by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways (Großherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahnen), which was later merged into the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company (Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft). The Hungen–Laubach section was opened on 1 June 1890 and the Friedberg–Hungen section was opened on 1 October 1897. The whole line could be operated from 1 November 1903. Former line near Laubach From 1936, the line was to be upgraded to two tracks as a main line. This did not happen, however, because of the outbreak of war. A second tunnel with a length of 196 metres had already been built in the immediate vicinity of the existing Freienseen Tunnel (146 metres). In 1968, the line between Inheiden and Berstadt-Wohnbach had to be relocated to allow lignite mining. This also caused Obbornhofen-Bellersheim station to be relocated on 9 June 1968. The old line is now dismantled, but still recognisable from the air. == Villingen–Ruppertsburg–Friedrichshütte branch line== The branch line to Ruppertsburg was initially built by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways from Villingen (Oberhessen) station as a narrow gauge horse-hauled line to the Friedrichshütte iron foundry and later rebuilt under Prussian direction as standard gauge. This conversion went into operation on 1 April 1896. The line was used for the carriage of freight and employees for the Friedrichshütte foundry, but it never used for public transport. The branch line was closed in 1959. == Route== The halt of Obbornhofen-Bellersheim on the section disused since 2003 The route is now only in operation from Friedberg to Wölfersheim- Södel. The trains continued to Hungen until 2003 and to Mücke via the Vogelsberg until 1958/59. It was possible to transfer to the line to Nidda in Beienheim. Originally, the tracks of Laubach station were on the eastern side of the road. When the line was extended to Mücke the track infrastructure was relocated to the other side of the station and only a loading track was preserved on the eastern side of the road. The station had a two-story entrance building with a goods shed as an annex. The station building is currently (as of 2011) used by a youth centre. == Operations== The line is in the area of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association, RMV). Until the 2004/2005 timetable change, public transport services on the two branches of the line were operated by the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company; since the 2005/2006 timetable change services have been operated by Hessische Landesbahn, its parent company. In the peak hour, trains on the line run to and from Friedberg. In the 2012 timetable, seven train pairs a day ran between Beienheim and Wölfersheim-Södel and nine train pairs between Friedberg and Wölfersheim-Södel from Monday to Friday. There are hardly any freight operations left. == Prospects== Buffer stop in Wölfersheim-Södel There are plans to reactivate the decommissioned Wölfersheim-Hungen section. The tracks are complete and apart from minor weathering still in relatively good condition. Despite the blockage of the line at the termini, the signal technology was still in operation; for example, the Wölfersheim semaphore signals were still actively lit until Wölfersheim was rebuilt into a halt in 2008. Nevertheless, at many of the already neglected level crossings, the safety technology and tracks would have to be fundamentally renewed or relocated. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * (line 070) * Category:Railway lines in Hesse Category:Railway lines opened in 1890 Category:1890 establishments in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Wetteraukreis Category:Middle Hesse ","title":"Friedberg–Mücke railway"},{"id":"56891301","text":"Gryllita arizonae, the Arizona cricket, is a species of cricket in the subfamily Gryllinae..

It is also frequently referred to as the desert bee fly. Few studies have been done on the biology of L. pulchrissimus, although their behavior in the wild has been observed. The primary food of desert bee flies is rabbitbrush, a flowering desert plant. The flies feed on its nectar and also aid in its pollination. A trademark of L. pulchrissimus is the daily tendency of males to form large aerial swarm for reasons that are currently unknown. Aside from two studies on this male aggregation behavior, the other behaviors of L. pulchrissimus are less studied. == Description  Physical === Lordotus pulchrissimus has a signature coat of yellowish fur, clear wings, and large brown eyes. The fly also has a notable proboscis, which is used for collecting nectar from flowering desert brush. Both sexes of L. pulchrissimus are hairy, which distinguishes them from the bare but otherwise very similar species, L. luteolus. L. pulchrissimus is a relatively large bee fly compared to other flies in its family. The males and females are distinct in appearance, which caused them to be misidentified as different species in the past.  Male appearance  Male L. pulchrissimus have been found to range from 8-16 millimeters in length. They have considerably less fur than the females in addition to larger wingspans. The males' fur typically ranges from yellow to brown in color. They have characteristic black markings on much of their femora.  Female appearance  Female L. pulchrissimus have been found to range from 2-14 millimeters in length. Females typically have more dense fur than males in addition to brighter shades of orange and yellow fur. An interesting aspect of female L. pulchrissimus is the color change of their fur. Not only does the fur coat of females age more rapidly than males as they age, the color of their fur when the female is alive fades more quickly than when they are dead. This feature of female's fur was used as a study's metric in determining their age in study, as the females' fur tends to fade at similar rates. === Behavioral === Lordotus pulchrissimus' activity distributions are notably different from other flies who have ecologically similar requirements and live in similar habitats. They engage in feeding, as well as more aggressive behavior, primarily in the morning time and for very lengthy periods of time. In comparison, most other flies inhabit similar climates and intersperse these energy-costly activities with resting periods throughout the day. This behavior in most flies is more energy efficient than the activity budgeting of L. pulchrissimus, which starts expending energy at the beginning of the day.  Male aggregation  Observations of male L. pulchrissimus demonstrate the different activity budgeting, who allocate more of their time to energetically costly activities than almost any other species of fly; they spend a majority of their time doing energy-costly activities like engaging in continuous hover flight and lengthy aerial aggregations. While males typically forage somewhat less than females, they use their extra time for more aggregation rather than more rest. Although this behavior could be described as lekking, not enough is known about it to determine the underlying causes. The most notable behavior pattern that male L. pulchrissimus exhibit is their daily aggregation into aerial swarms on stabilized dunes. This behavior has been primarily studied on the north shore of Mono Lake in California. Although on a given day, males typically arrive first to the swarm area and begin interacting before females arrive, the pattern of male aggregation in L. pulchrissimus is especially distinct as this type of male aggregation typically has more costs than benefits. In most other cases where males aggregate, it occurs as a result of female aggregation, but this is not the case for L. pulchrissimus. The aggregation typically occurs over areas of relatively sparse rabbitbrush, showing that the male aggregation is also unrelated to obtaining resources. Most cases of male aggregation occur in concordance with female aggregation and/or resource density, but neither is the case for L. pulchrissimus. == Distribution == The observed distribution of Lordotus pulchrissimus in the United States. Lordotus pulchrissimus have been documented in different desert locations throughout southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This includes multiple sites where they have been studied in the wild in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Not much precise information is known about their overall distribution other than what is mentioned about their presence at specific test sites. On average, males emerge first before females. Both sexes emerge over a relatively long proportion of the season. == Habitat == Lordotus pulchrissimus primarily live in arid deserts including the Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert. They typically occupy regions of the deserts where they can find brush, their primary source of food. They have also been found to inhabit more temperate regions, including Mono Lake, CA, where multiple studies on the species have been performed. == Home range and territoriality  Home range === L. pulchrissimus typically stay within a few hundred square meters of sites of male aggregation, unique because males tend to avoid areas of high resource density when aggregating. The males tend to occupy areas very close to their aggregation sites. The home range of females, however, has not been researched, as their recapture in most studies was relatively unsuccessful compared to males. The females tend to migrate away approximately 70 meters each day, and are not guaranteed to return to the spot they were at the previous day. === Territoriality === Conversely to other species of fly in their areas of inhabitance, L. pulchrissimus males do not typically express territoriality over a single brush bush. L. pulchrissimus males, instead, spend approximately 1.5 hours each day aggregating about 20 meters in the air above areas of brush. However, during these aggregations, the males vigorously defend their territory and engage in aggressive behavior while in their aggregation clouds. === Population structure === The population density of female L. pulchrissimus is higher than the population density of male L. pulchrissimus. Males typically are found at a population density of 2-5 males per hectare. For females, the distribution of ages is biased towards younger females as they typically leave the group after mating. Females live approximately 10–14 days. Less information is given on male population structure, as the study focused more on the presence and absence of females. == Food Resources == Chrysothamnus nauseosus === Larval diet === L. pulchrissimus larvae feed on the flesh and eggs of other insects. The specific insects they feed on are currently unknown.  Parasitism  Bee fly larvae often parasitize the immature stages of other insects for sustenance. Bee fly larvae are parasitoids which take extreme advantage of their hosts, often feeding on them or their eggs. === Adult diet === Adult L. pulchrissimus feed mostly on desert brush. In one of the primary sites of L. pulchrissimus research in Mono Lake, CA, the adult diet consists almost entirely on Chrysothamnus nauseosus or rabbitbrush, a flowering perennial shrub that attracts many different types of pollinating insects. L. pulchrissimus allocate more of their time to feeding than is common for fly species, converse to the concept that they should be foraging-time minimizers. The reason for this is not yet researched. == Mating == Female L. pulchrissimus mate within three days of their emergence into the colony in early August. Observations on their behavior suggests they mate as soon as they can and only once. They typically copulate for 5–10 minutes. L. pulchrissimus tends to exhibit a weak tendency towards size-assortive mating, in which females and males of similar sizes copulate. It is likely that female L. pulchrissimus have little choice in their mate, meaning most of the sexual dimorphism occurs as a result of intrasexual selection. Rabbitbrush == Mutualism  Rabbitbrush === L. pulchrissimus have a mutualistic relationship with rabbitbrush. The flies feed on its nectar and pollinate the brush in the process. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:Bombyliidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1893 ","title":"Lordotus pulchrissimus"},{"id":"56891356","text":"Stephen Paul Kelly (born 30 December 1961) is a British businessman, and the former chief executive officer of Sage Group. ==Early life== He was born in Kent, England and attended the Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone.

C. fontinella is typically around 1 mm long with a black and yellow color pattern. C. fontinella develops by parasitizing nutrients from its host, typically the white-footed mouse. C. fontinella has even been known to parasitize humans in rare cases. Individuals parasitized by C. fontinella will develop a large bump on the skin that is indicative of parasitization. ==Etymology== The genus name Cuterebra is a blend of the Latin words cutis : skin and terebra : borer. ==Distribution== C. fontinella is found all around North America. C. fontinella has been found in most of the continental United States, Southern Canada, and Northern Mexico. The prevalence of C. fontinella is reliant on temperature, so colder regions will not be as densely populated as the warmer ones. == Habitat == C. fontinella inhabits deciduous forests of North America. C. fontinella prefer territories near running water and with low-elevation vegetation. These flies are found in the highest density near the edges of their habitats. ==Description== C. fontinella look very similar to other species within the Cuterebra genus but have a few distinguishing features. The easiest indicator to use is the host species, as different species of Cuterebra infest different hosts. However, this method is not always reliable as C. fontinella have been known to infest multiple host species in addition to their preferred host, Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed mouse. C. fontinella eggs are typically 1.05 mm long and 0.03 mm wide. They are shaped like canoes and have a large groove along their underside; this groove enables attachment to vegetation. C. fontinella larvae transition from golden brown to black during development. The larvae are oval in shape. Grown larvae are typically 22 mm long, 13.9 mm wide, and 12.5 mm thick. The larva is segmented into 12 sections, with backwards facing conical spines on almost every segment. The head segment is shield shaped, colored white or tan, contains antennal pits and retractable mandibles. The 12th segment bears two spiracles and is also lightly colored. However, the spines on this segment are outward facing. Adult C. fontinella have black hair on their scutum and a black spot on their anipisterum. Adults are typically 30 mm long and have a close resemblance to bees. ==Home range and territoriality== C. fontinella are territorial insects. Males chase away intruding males while patrolling their territory by flying in figure-eight and oval patterns. Since females only fly when looking for a mate, it is important that the male controls as much high-quality territory as he can. C. fontinella are territorial and congregate above heat reflecting surfaces on roadsides and near streams. These flies are very dependent on temperature, so even though they can live in a vast array of latitudes, the climate they live in influences their prevalence throughout the year. Different Life Stages of Cuterebra Flies ==Life history== Eggs Egg development is slowed by temperatures below 15°C and under arid atmosphere conditions. The ideal conditions for development are warm and humid, characteristic of southern climates. Stimulation from moisture and heat (often from the host passing by the egg) will cause the egg to hatch and the larva to be rubbed onto the host. Larval Instars Once on the host, the larvae enter through the nose, mouth, eyes, anus or any open wound. Inside the body, the larva migrate and settle near the groin. The larva then create a “warble” with a small hole at the top layer of skin for breathing. The backward facing spikes on the segments of the larva help to stabilize the larva. The spikes help prevent the larva from being pulled out of the host by gripping to the flesh surrounding it. The larva typically emerge after the host dies (typically 3.5-4 weeks), and then burrow into the ground. Pupae C. fontinella pupate in the ground and emerge as adults. Diapausing can occur during winter months or other general unfavorable conditions. Pupae can remain in diapause for as long as 12 months if need be. In simulated standard settings (27 degrees Celsius and an alternating day and night light schedule), pupal development typically occurs in 50 days. Adults Adult C. fontinella live a short life without feeding. Oocyte development begins as soon as females leave the pupal stage of development. Oocyte development finishes in about 5 days. Mating can occur before oocyte development is finished. No secondary egg development occurs, likely due to the short adult life-span of C. fontinella. Female C. fontinella will typically lay their eggs in vegetation, especially vegetation located near the homes/burrows of their intended hosts. Adult females can lay up to 2000 total eggs. == Parasitism Migration Within the Host=== After entering the body, the larva follow a distinct path within the host. If entering either through the nose, mouth or eyes, the larvae first orient themselves using the host's nasal passageway. Then the larvae travel through the upper respiratory system, making their way to the thoracic cavity. They then proceed to the abdominal cavity and eventually to the inguinal region of the host. If the larvae enter the host through an open wound or the anus, they find the closest portion of the standard tract, then continue their journey as they normally would. Warbles Once settled, the larva creates areas of swelling in the subcutaneous skin layer of their host. These swellings, known as warbles, are located between the anus and genital organs of the host. They last the same amount of time that the larva spends in its larval stage (3.5-4 weeks). The warble consists of a pore, a cavity, and a capsule. The pore serves as a breathing hole for the larva. As the larva grows, the size of the warble grows with it. Translucent yellow liquids are secreted both from the larva. The cavity is the area of the warble where the larva lives. It expands gradually as the larva grows in size. The capsule is the tissue that surrounds the cavity. The capsule starts off as thin tissue, and thickens as the larva's development continues due to natural bodily healing of the host. ===Effect on Host===  Effect on Individual  Splenomegaly, which can be caused by the Cuterebra fly. Individuals infested with C. fontinella can experience anemia, leukocytosis, plasma protein imbalances, local tissue damage, and splenomegaly. Infested female hosts produce fewer and smaller litters than those who are parasite-free. Counterintuitively, infestation actually leads to an increase in survival time for the host, not a decrease in survival as one would expect. It's possible that this could be caused by the change in resource allocation from reproduction to body preservation, a change that is favorable for both the host’s and the C. fontinella’s survival. Interestingly, if multiple C. fontinella infest a host simultaneously, the host will instead experience a decrease in survival time.  Behavioral Changes  No effect on host fecundity has been recorded within C. fontinella’s preferred host, Peromyscus leucopus. Male movement was also unaffected. However, female movement decreases when infested with C. fontinella. This suggests that P. leucopus has evolved a tolerance for infestation.  Host Resistance  Resistance to infestation has been documented in hosts that have been previously infested. The resistance occurs at the entry points that have been used previously by larva as well as the genital region of the host where the larvae typically create their warbles. Nasal, oral and anal resistance cause a decrease in infestation rate when exposed to larvae of 15-30%. No resistance from repeated ocular entry occurs. Maximum antibody production from the host occurs 28 days after infestation. The resistance causes the larvae to take abnormal alternate paths within the host. These abnormal paths caused the larva to develop in atypical regions in the host. The insecticide Ronnel can be used to effectively stop development of larvae by preventing the larvae from boring breathing holes in the skin of the host. ===Effect on Population=== Infestation has varying effects on the host population’s reproductive fitness, depending on the size of the habitat and the infestation rate of C. fontinella. If the host population lives in a vast habitat with scattered areas of infestation, the reproductive rate of the host is essentially unaffected. However, in smaller habitats with higher and more uniform rates of infestation, reproductive rates can be noticeably decreased. ==Food resources== White footed mouse, common hosts of the C. fontinella The species' host serves as the primary food source exploited for nutrients. Different species of Cuterebra prey on various species of rodents. However, there have been documented cases of C. fontinella preying on several different types of rodents. Peromyscus leucopus (White footed mice) is the favored host for C. fontinella. Typically 19%-33% of all P. leucopus are infested within a year. Other hosts for C. fontinella include Lepus artemisia (Cottontail Rabbit), Ochrotomys nuttalli (Golden Footed Mouse), Peromyscus gossypinus (Cotton Mouse), Peromyscus maniculatus (Deer Mouse), Liomys irroratus (Mexican Spiny Pocket Mouse) and even very rarely humans. The highest infestation rates occur in late summer/early fall. ==Mating== Adults aggregate in open, sunny areas which is where the flies find their mates. However, C. fontinella do not mate in temperatures below 20°C. Adult males fly 1-2 meters above the ground for up to 4 hours a day in the presence of sunlight in order to attract a mate. Once a female demonstrates her interest, the pair finds a nearby branch or leaf for stability. The female grabs the branch or leaf and the male mounts her. The pair copulates for about three minutes. Ovipositor The ovipositor of C. fontinella is unusually short relative those of the other members of the family Oestridae. Covered by dense hairs, the ovipositor resembles a horseshoe, with two sclerite ends and a chitinous plate between them. ==Social behavior== Male C. fontinella fly around their territories from the time at which the temperature exceeds 20°C to the early afternoon. Flight will only be initiated during sunlight but can continue during brief cloud coverage not exceeding 15 minutes. Since their flight is limited by temperature, the amount of time spent flying is dependent on the weather and temperature of the day. Female C. fontinella are only seen flying when searching for a mate. Male C. fontinella are extremely territorial. Males usually occupy a stretch of territory 17 m long along the bank of a stream. They chase most airborne intruders that travel through their territory, regardless of their species. If two males intersect in the air, they grab onto each other and tumble to the ground. Chases persist for 10-15 minutes, with the flies typically traveling 35 km. C. fontinella tolerate a population density of up to 250 flies per km^2. Fly density varies depending on weather conditions and the time of the year. ==Genetic identification== Genetic analysis can also be used to discriminate between species. COI and COII genes are reliable markers to differentiate between species. Using species specific markers, scientists can accurately identify the species of a botfly at any stage of life. In many cases larvae look ambiguous enough to be confused for another species, so genetic identification is very important. Hybridization between species within the genus Cuterebra has been known to occur, and can cause ambiguity within testing. === Subspecies === Two subspecies that belong to the species Cuterebra fontinella include Cuterebra fontinella fontinella and Cuterebra fontinella grisea b (deer mouse bot fly). ==Interactions with humans== Rare cases of C. fontinella host infestations have been reported but are not the norm. In most of these cases the larvae remain in benign locations such as the in the eye or in the subcutaneous regions within the eyelid. Occasionally, however, the larvae exploit a pathway gaining access to the tracheal-pulmonary system. Consequent symptoms in the human host include cold-like symptoms and flares-coughing patterns. The larva are exiled from the human host when the host coughs a bloody secretion containing the larva. Another species of bot fly called Dermatobia hominis commonly infests humans in Central and South America. Most cases of human infestation within North America are caused by the victim traveling into regions where D. hominis are present. As of 1989, there were 55 documented cases of myiasis caused by species within the Cuterebra genus. Treatment typically consists of removal of the larva and then prevention of secondary bacterial infections. If the warble is accessible, a specialist can remove the larva by depositing petroleum jelly over the breathing hole of the parasite; this causes the larva to emerge for air and enable easier removal by the specialist. Larvae within or near the eye will sometimes require surgery for removal. Larvae that die within the vitreous humor of the eye do not need to be removed, they will be broken down and absorbed by natural chemical processes within the host. ==Conservation== A major threat to infestation rates of C. fontinella is pasture burning. When soil reaches high temperatures, pupating larvae die, and ash produced during burning causes microclimate changes. These changes contribute significantly to increasing greater congregation of C. fontinella.

Chistovich (1924 – 2006) was a pioneering linguist and speech scientist who co-founded the Leningrad School of Phonology, together with her husband Valery A. Kozhevnikov. == Biography == Chistovich was born in Leningrad in 1924. She trained as a medical doctor before founding in 1960 the Laboratory of Speech Physiology at the Pavlov Institute of Physiology. She was married to Valery A. Kozhevnikov, and collaborated with him until his untimely death in 1981. They had two daughters who also became speech researchers, Elena V. Kozhevnikova and Inna A. Chistovich. After her retirement in 1986, she and her daughters established the St. Petersburg Early Intervention Institute, to foster language development in young children by providing auditory screening and programs for hearing-impaired children. == Research career and legacy == Chistovich pioneered experimental methods for understanding the relationship between speech production and speech perception. The Pavlov Institute developed a distinctive approach to solve \\"the mystery of speech perception\\". Her work was brought to the attention of Western speech scientists by Gunnar Fant. Her work on non-linear dynamics in speech production was a major influence on the development of articulatory phonology and task dynamics, influencing researchers such as Bjorn Lindblom, Elliot Saltzman, Louis Goldstein, and Catherine Browman. She developed the method of close speech shadowing to explore the mechanisms of speech processing at very short time lags (250 to 500 msec). With Patricia K. Kuhl, she co-authored a seminal article on infant-directed speech showing that across different languages, caregivers speak to infants in a way that facilitates acquisition of the phonological system. ==Publications== A complete bibliography of Ludmilla Chistovich's publications was published as part of the special issue of Speech Communication (a joint publication of the European Association for Signal Processing (EURASIP) and the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA)) in honour of her 60th birthday. It was compiled by Christel Sorin, of the Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception, Paris Descartes University. ==References== Category:Women linguists Category:Phoneticians Category:Russian women scientists Category:20th-century Russian scientists ","title":"Ludmilla A.

Since then, it has deteriorated and is partially collapsed. ==Description and history== The Mill Brook Bridge is located several hundred yards east of the Shetucket River, on the north side of Lower Blissville Road just west of its junction with Icehouse and Blissville Roads. It is a single- span masonry arch, with a span of about across Mill Brook, which the roadway crosses on a modern steel girder bridge. The arch is built out of roughly hewn rubble stone, and was originally laid dry (without any mortar. It would have been topped by layers of soil, with a roadbed above. The arch originally had a width of about . The bridge's top layers have been eroded away, and part of the arch has collapsed. The bridge was originally located where Lower Blissville Road now runs; it was relocated to its present position in 1915, when a modern bridge was built on the site. The road has been a historically important route, opened by 1717 as a route connecting Norwich and Plainfield. By the late 18th century, the route had been designated as a post route, resulting in an increase in stagecoach traffic. In 1790, the town of Lisbon made a number of improvements to the route, documented in 1792 to include a \\"stone causeway\\" on Bundy Hill, the slope to the west. The bridge's dry laid and rough cut construction is consistent with bridge building of the period, where later bridge construction tended to use mortar and more formally dressed stone. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ==References== Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in New London County, Connecticut ","title":"Mill Brook Bridge"},{"id":"56891702","text":"The 1960 Drexel Dragons football team represented the Drexel Institute of Technology (renamed Drexel University in 1970) as a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference during the 1960 NCAA College Division football season.

AAA AUTO has branches in 22 cities in the Czech Republic, 14 in Slovakia, 1 in Hungary and 5 in Poland. In September 2017, the company recorded its two millionth customer. In 2016, AAA AUTO International, a.s. was ranked 48 in the \\"Czech TOP 100\\" listing of the most important companies in the Czech Republic (ranked by revenue). According to the audited earnings for 2016, the company reported sales of €276,000,000 and sold 68,772 cars. Since 2012, the company has also been offering cars under the Mototechna brand. In the Czech and Slovak Republics this brand concentrates on offering “nearly new” cars. In April 2014, Mototechna started selling luxury cars in its new Mototechna premium segment. In 2013, a study by Ogilvy & Mather ranked AAA AUTO among the top ten Czech brands post November 1989.Ogilvy & Mather study A study by Medea Research found the Mototechna brand was also one of the most popular re-established Czech brands from before 1989. In January 2018, the company set up the AuresLab innovation laboratory, which is a start-up run by the innovator and executive director Stanislav Gálik. The AAA AUTO business model is based on purchasing cars for cash, so that they are transferred directly to the company’s ownership. This differs from the rest of the market (where typically used cars are sold predominantly in the form of commission sales). AAA AUTO also provides a lifetime money-back guarantee on the cars it sells if there are any legal problems with the vehicle's origins. It also provides Car-life insurance for any mechanical and electrical defects and the option of replacing the car for another within seven days. In September 2007, the Dutch parent company, AAA Auto Group N.V., went on the stock exchanges in Prague and Budapest, and the initial price per share on the stock exchange was CZK 55. Trading in the company’s shares ended on both exchanges in the summer of 2013. Prior to the cessation of trading, the company offered to buy back the shares for CZK 23.30 per share. Since 2014, the majority owner of the AAA AUTO Group has been a British-Polish private equity fund, Abris Capital Partners, which gradually acquired a 100% share that it purchased for €220 million (about CZK 6 billion), roughly CZK 95 per share. Following the statutory share buy-out, the Abris fund became the 100% owner of the group in June 2015. The companies in the group were then brought together in an international merger, which meant the company’s headquarters moved to the Czech Republic and the name changed to AAA Auto International a.s. The company then changed its name to AURES Holdings, a.s. on 1 March 2018.

The three previous such storms had struck the general region on March 1–3, 6–8, and 12–14, respectively. It also affected areas of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States with both snowfall and severe weather. The nor'easter was also one of the heaviest spring snowstorms on record in some areas in the Mid-Atlantic, especially Philadelphia and New York City. Originating from a surface low that formed over the Rocky Mountains, the system tracked across the central United States, bringing some wintry weather to surrounding areas as well as severe weather in the South. It then reached the Northeastern U.S. on March 20–21 and – while moving slowly near the shorelines of Delaware, New Jersey and Long Island – dropped heavy snowfall with rates of up to an hour in some spots. The storm was given unofficial names such as Winter Storm Toby and Nor'easter 4. The storm caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled in advance, and caused many school districts to close for the following day or two. Over 100,000 power outages were reported as a result of the nor'easter. At least 3 people have been killed in the nor'easter as of March 21. In addition, the system produced a tornado outbreak in the Southeast, spawning at least 20 tornadoes on March 19, one of which was a long-tracked EF3 that hit Jacksonville, Alabama causing considerable damage. ==Meteorological history== Projected paths for the developing low off the East Coast. Issued 3 p.m. EST (20:00 UTC) on March 20. On March 18, an area of low pressure consolidated over the Rocky Mountains, bringing moderate to heavy snow to those locations. Over the next day or two, this low slowly moved eastward across the Central United States, while also interacting with a stationary front located in the Southeast. This ultimately resulted in a severe weather outbreak in the South late on March 19, producing at least nineteen confirmed tornadoes, one of which was rated an EF3. As the system moved eastwards towards the Eastern United States, it was still somewhat uncertain how much snow the storm would produce, which depended on its track and intensity; as the impending storm grew closer it became increasingly likely a major snowstorm would occur. Precipitation began to spread into the Mid-Atlantic states by early March 20. This first phase of the nor'easter brought freezing rain and snow to much of the Tri-State area, before it began dissipating later that night while snow continued over the Appalachian Mountains from an associated but weakening low. At the same time, a new surface low formed off the Chesapeake Bay around 03:00 UTC on March 21, prompting the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) to begin issuing storm summaries on the developing nor'easter. After forming, the storm began intensifying as it slowly moved northward parallel to the East Coast, with a large swath of moderate to heavy snow covering the area of New Jersey and Long Island in the morning hours of March 21. Contrary to the previous nor'easters, there was colder air further south then in other storms, which allowed accumulating snow to stick more quickly in areas near southern New Jersey throughout the day. Due to moving slowly near the coast, bands of heavy snowfall (with some embedded rates of up to per hour) hammered the coastline as it continued to slowly move eastward. By the following day, the system attained a minimum pressure of around . Shortly afterwards however, at 15:00 UTC, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the nor'easter as most of the snow in New England had tapered off. ==Preparations and impact== Satellite shot of the snow cover in the Northeast after the nor'easter subsided on March 22. ===Severe weather in the South=== Before impacting the Northeast, the system was also responsible for producing severe weather across the South on March 19–20, with at least twenty tornadoes being confirmed by the National Weather Service (NWS). One possible tornado late on March 19 was reported as having caused \\"unbelievable destruction\\" in the town of Fulton, Alabama.

He survived the December 2015 attack but died on January 18, 2016, from complications after a surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his hip. His story of courage inspired the short film Watu Wote by Katja Benrath. At the time of his death, Farah was the Deputy Headteacher of Mandera Township Primary School. == Background == On 20 December 2015, Farah was in a bus bound for the town of Mandera in northern Kenya. The bus was attacked by suspected Al-Shabaab militants. In a similar attack the year before, the attackers had separated passengers according to faith. Those who could prove they were Muslim, by reciting passages from the Quran, were spared. Those who couldn't were lined up and shot. 28 people were killed, with the only person, Douglas Ochwodho, surviving by a stroke of luck. Farah's bus was stopped near the town of El-Wak on the Kenya–Somali border. Knowing what would happen, female Muslim passengers gave their head scarves to the non-Muslims on the bus. Then Farah and other passengers refused to be separated, telling the attackers to \\"...kill all of us or leave us alone.\\" == Death == For his act of defiance, he was shot in the hand and hip. Two other male passengers were fatally shot, as well as an off-duty policeman who happened to be in a different car. The militants then escaped, leaving Farah critically injured. He was airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment where he died one month later during surgery. His body was airlifted by a police helicopter to his home, where he was buried in a quiet ceremony. == Personal life == Farah was married to Dunia Mohammed Ahmed. They had four children, and his wife was pregnant with a fifth, at the time of his death. Kenyans launched an online fundraising activity, christened #HeroSalah, to raise money to support his young family. == Legacy and Film == In an interview before his death, Farah said \\"It's only the religion that is the difference, so I ask my brother Muslims to take care of the Christians so that the Christians also take care of us... and let us help one another and let us live together peacefully.\\" He was posthumously awarded The Order of the Grand Warrior - one of Kenya's highest civilian honours during the subsequent State of the Nation address. The Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, said Farah \\"...is a costly reminder that we all have a role to protecting our freedoms.\\" Farah's story received international coverage, attracting the attention of German actress and filmmaker Katja Benrath. Benrath chose the story for her graduation project, which became the film Watu Wote: All of Us.

As the game wound down, Austin rallied with two touchdowns of their own leaving the final score 28-20. With the win, Chicago became the first team in the LFL to win forty games (a cumulative 40-10-1 record) and four championships (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018).

According to IDEAS/RePEc, Thomas Dee belongs to the top 3% of economists as ranked by their research.Ranking of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved March 20, 2018. === Research on education=== Throughout his academic career, Dee has studied many topics related to education and education policy, e.g. competition between private and public schools, returns to education, and teacher incentives. Analysing the relationship between public school quality and the effect of competition from private schools, Dee finds that competition from the latter has a significant positive impact on the graduation rates of neighbouring public high schools.Dee, T.S. (1998). Competition and the quality of public schools. Economics of Education Review, 17(4), pp. 419-427. Investigating the existence of returns to education in the form of civic engagement and attitudes, Dee argues that educational attainment strongly increases voter participation, support for freedom of speech and newspaper readership (a measure of civic knowledge).Dee, T.S. (2004). Are there civic returns to education? Journal of Public Economics, 88(9-10), pp. 1697–1720. With regard to the effectiveness of teacher incentives, Dee finds mixed evidence. In his evaluation of Tennessee's Career Ladder Evaluation System, which rewarded teachers who increased student achievement, together with Benjamin J. Keys, he finds that the test scores in mathematics of students assigned to career-ladder teachers were 3 percentile points higher than otherwise, but that such an assignment had no significant impact on reading scores.Dee, T.S., Keys, B.J. (2004). Does merit pay reward good teachers? Evidence from a randomized experiment. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 23(3), pp. 471-488. By contrast, his evaluation of IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by Michelle Rhee in Washington D.C., conducted with James Wyckoff finds that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers.Dee, T.S., Wyckoff, J. (2015). Incentives, selection, and teacher performance: Evidence from IMPACT. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 34(2), pp. 267-297. Additionally, Dee has pioneered research on the impact of demographic similarity between students and teachers as well as on the impact of No Child Left Behind, the flagship education programme of George W. Bush's administration.  The impact of demographic similarity between teachers and students Analysing the impact on students' school achievement of being taught by a teacher of the same ethnic group in Tennessee, Dee finds that assignment of students to a teacher of their own ethnicity significantly increased both black and white students' achievements in mathematics and reading.Dee, T.S. (2004). Teachers, race, and student achievement in a randomized experiment. Review of Economics and Statistics, 86(1), pp. 195-210. Vice versa, Dee has also studied how demographic similarity between students and teachers influences teachers' subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance and found students' racial, ethnic and gender characteristics to substantially colour teachers' perceptions of student performance. However, the former two effects mainly appear in conjunction with students coming from poor family backgrounds or living in the South, which provides a strong argument for the recruitment of teachers from underrepresented minorities.Dee, T.S. (2005). A teacher like me: Does race, ethnicity, or gender matter? American Economic Review, 95(2), pp. 158-165. This research is complemented by Dee's study of the impact of being taught by a teacher of the same gender, which he finds to significantly improve the achievements of both male and female students as well as teachers' perceptions of student performance and engagement.Dee, T.S. (2007). Teachers and the gender gaps in student achievement. Journal of Human Resources, 42(3), pp. 528-554.Dee, T.S. (2006). The Why Chromosome. Education Next, 6(4).  The impact of No Child Left Behind Together with Brian Jacob, Thomas Dee has extensively researched the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) - and its emphasis on test- based school accountability - on students, teachers, and schools. In particular, Dee and Jacob find that NCLB improved the math achievements of younger students, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, but failed to do so with regard to reading, raised school district expenditure, in particular on teacher compensation, and improved the quality of teachers, and resulted in a shift of teaching time towards math and reading as tested subjects.Dee, T.S., Jacob, B.A. (2010). The impact of No Child Left Behind on students, teachers, and schools. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2010(2), pp. 149-194.Dee, T., Jacob, B. (2011). The impact of No Child Left Behind on student achievement. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 30(3), pp. 418-446.Dee, T., Jacob, B., Schwartz, N.L. (2013). The effects of NCLB on school resources and practices. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 35(2), pp. 252-279. === Research on youth health and youth behaviour=== The other main area besides education on which Dee has conducted research is youth health, e.g. teenage smoking and drinking, sexual activity, and traffic accidents. Analysing how teen drinking and youth traffic fatalities respond to beer taxes, Dee finds that - while results vary substantially between U.S. states - beer taxes are generally ineffective in reducing teen drinking and associated traffic fatalities.Dee, T.S. (1999). State alcohol policies, teen drinking and traffic fatalities. Journal of Public Economics, 72(2), pp. 289-315. In another study on teen drinking, Dee finds teen drinking and smoking to be complementary behaviours, with the increase in minimum legal drinking ages (MLDA) from 18 to 21 having reduced the numbers of teen smokers by 3-5% and higher cigarette taxes having lowered the prevalence of teen drinking.Dee, T.S. (1999). The complementarity of teen smoking and drinking. Journal of Health Economics, 18(6), pp. 769-793. However, while teens facing a lower MLDA were substantially more likely to drink, the raise in the MLDA had no significant effect on educational attainment.Dee, T.S., Evans, W.N. (2003). Teen drinking and educational attainment: evidence from two-sample instrumental variables estimates. Journal of Labor Economics, 21(1), pp. 178-209. Further research on the impact of macroeconomic conditions on alcohol abuse by Dee finds binge drinking to be strongly countercyclical, even among those who remain employed during the crisis.Dee, T.S. (2001). Alcohol abuse and economic conditions: evidence from repeated cross-sections of individual- level data. Health Economics, 10(3), pp. 257-270. Finally, Dee, David Grabowski and Michael Morrisey investigated the impact of the introduction of graduated driver licensing (GDL) on teen traffic fatalities and find that GDL regulations reduced fatalities among 15- to 17-year-olds by at least 5.6% over 1992–2002 and didn't increase fatality risks for older teens once they didn't face GDL restrictions anymore.Dee, T.S., Grabowski, D.C., Morrisey, M.A. (2005). Graduated driver licensing and teen traffic fatalities. Journal of Health Economics, 24(3), pp.571-589. == References External links== * Webpage of Thomas Dee on the website of the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis Category:21st-century American economists Category:Education economists Category:Health economists Category:Living people Category:Stanford University faculty Category:Swarthmore College alumni Category:University System of Maryland alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Thomas Dee"},{"id":"56892124","text":"Taungdi, United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ; ) is a large village in Kyain Seikgyi Township, Kawkareik District, in the Kayin State of Myanmar. == References  * \\"Taungdi Map – Satellite Images of Taungdi\\" Maplandia World Gazetteer Category:Populated places in Kayin State ","title":"Taungdi"},{"id":"56892144","text":"Nancy Argenziano (born January 1, 1955) is a former state legislator in Florida and served as chairman of the Florida Public Service Commission.Tampa Bay Business Journal Nancy Argenziano named Public Service Commission chairman She was the Reform Party of Florida's candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018.Richardson for Governor Former Legislator Nancy Argenziano Joins Reform Party Ticket ==Personal life== Argenziano was born in Brooklyn, New York and moved to Florida in 1971.

He showed some promising form as a juvenile in 1900 when he finished fourth in the July Stakes and then won the Richmond Stakes. After running poorly on his thee-year-old debut he recorded a major upset when he won the 2000 Guineas at odds of 33/1. Handicapper raced until the age of five but never won another race of any significance. ==Background== Handicapper was a brown horse bred in England by D Fraser. As a yearling he was bought for 380 guineas by Ernest Cassel who sent him into training with his private trainer Fred Day at Lowther House in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Matchmaker, whose wins included the King Edward VII Stakes and the Princess of Wales's Stakes. His biggest impact as a breedings stallion was as the damsire of Son-in-Law. Handicapper's dam Agnes Osborne was a daughter of Wild Aggie, a broodmare whose other descendants have included Sagace, Slip Anchor and Buena Vista. ==Racing career1900: two-year-old season=== Handicapper made his first appearance at Royal Ascot in June when he finished unplaced behind Bay Melton in the New Stakes. A month later at Newmarket Racecourse he ran fourth in the July Stakes, a race in which Doricles and Veles dead-heated for first place. Despite his unremarkable form he started 13/8 favourite for the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by the American jockey Lester Reiff he won from Osboch, with St Monans in third. He ended his year in the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket in October when he was beaten a neck into second by the filly Aida. ===1901: three-year-old season=== Handicapper began his second season at Newmarket in April when he ran unplaced behind the four-year-old Petridge in a minor handicap race. On 1 May 1901 Handicapper started a 33/1 outsider for the 93rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Veles started favourite ahead of Doricles, Orchid (Champagne Stakes) and Lord Bobs (Dewhurst Stakes) in a field of seventeen. Ridden by Bill Halsey he took the lead at half way, went clear of his rivals, and \\"sailed past the post, the easiest of winners\\" two lengths clear of Doricles with Osboch a neck away in third place. The Jockey Club held an inquiry into the colt's dramatic improvement but were satisfied by Fred Day's explanation. As a result of his win in the Guineas, Handicapper was strongly fancied for the Epsom Derby a month later but his odds drifted on the day of the race and he was not among the first ten finishers in a race won by Volodyovski. At Royal Ascot later in June Handicapper finished unplaced behind the Duke of Devonshire's Lauzun in the St James's Palace Stakes. His poor form led to him being described as \\"one of the worst horses that have attained classic honours\\". ===Later career=== Handicapper remained in training for at least two more years but failed to win any further major races. At the age of five in 1903 he finished third in the Royal Hunt Cup. In the Liverpool Cup he finished third to the six-year-old Captain Kettle, to whom he was conceding 23 pounds in weight. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Handicapper an \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud career== Handicapper was exported to Belgium in 1904, where is progeny earned 700,000 francs. Exported to Germany in 1913, Handicapper was standing in Reuthen, Germany in 1916 for a fee of 500 marks. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1898 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 16-c Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Handicapper (horse)"},{"id":"56892181","text":"Inez Nathaniel-Walker (née Stedman) (1911-1990) was a self-taught African- American folk artist. == Biography == Born into poverty in Sumter, South Carolina, Inez was orphaned at an early age, and married at 12 or 13. She moved to Philadelphia during the Great Migration to escape the harsh reality of intense farm work. In 1949, she moved to Port Byron, New York, where she worked in an apple processing plant. She was convicted of criminally negligent homicide after killing a man who abused her and imprisoned in Bedford Hills Correctional Prison from 1971 to 1973. After her prison sentence, she moved back to Port Byron. It was during her incarceration that she began to draw on the back of any paper she found to distance herself from the inmates who she called the \\"bad girls.\\"Recalled by Pat Parsons of the Webb and Parsons Gallery, New Canaan, Connecticut. She drew prolifically, filling dozens of notebooks in a few months until her release. == Career == While incarcerated, Nathaniel-Walker's work attracted the attention of Elizabeth Bayley, one of Inez' prison teachers, who provided her with drawing paper, notebooks, and pencils. Mrs. Bayley also showed the drawings to a local folk art dealer, who later received the artist's sketch books. Nathaniel-Walker's drawings are almost exclusively portraits of women. The works, executed in color pen, pencil, and ink, are characterized by a great profusion of embellished detail. The faces are shown in strict frontal or profile view with exaggerated eyes. The figures often wear clothes that were part of Inez's wardrobe. Of her process she said, \\"I don't look at nothing to draw by. I can't look at nobody and draw. I just draw by my own mission. I just sit down and start drawing.\\" Her work has been shown at the Akron Art Institute, the Corcoran Gallery, and Musée Art et Marges in Brussels. Several of her drawings were also featured in the landmark exhibition, \\"Black Folk Art in America: 1930-1980.\\" Her work is currently held in several prominent museum collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, and the High Museum. == References  External links == * Inez Nathaniel-Walker at the Smithsonian American Art Museum * Early work of Inez Nathaniel-Walker: drawings made while confined at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, Bedford Hills, NY Category:1911 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century American women artists Category:African-American artists Category:Artists from South Carolina Category:People from Sumter, South Carolina ","title":"Inez Nathaniel-Walker"},{"id":"56892198","text":"Drama Desk Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated Rosalind Productions Inc. is dedicated to Changing The Narrative to one that helps eliminate gender and racial bias.

Alessandro Berri (Castelnuovo Scrivia, end XV century - Castelnuovo Scrivia, 2nd half XVI century) was an Italian painter who lived in Piedmont around the 1500s. == Life == There is no clear information about his dates of birth and death, because most of sources about him are dating back to the 1800s. However, these sources tell that his place of birth was Castelnuovo Scrivia (a town in the province of Alessandria) and that he was the nephew of Vincenzo Bandello (uncle of the novelist Matteo Bandello) the prior of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan during the period when Leonardo painted \\"The Last Supper\\". According to the 19-century historian Goffredo Casalis, thanks to the intercession of Vincenzo Bandello, Leonardo became the tutor of Alessandro Berri: \\"..(Leonardo)…spent quite a long time in Castelnuovo, where [Alessandro Berri] was introduced [to Leonardo] through Matteo Bandello and his uncle Vincenzo… (Leonardo) on his hosts request accepted to train Alessandro Berri in the art of painting…\\". These sources also tell that Alessandro Berri became a \\"distinguished pupil\\" of his great Maestro. There are no further sources of information that may give exact data about the artistic and painterly development of Alessandro Berri. From research conducted recently, Alessandro Berri was married to Gabriella Signorio, lived in Castelnuovo Scrivia in the district of \\"de Molinis\\" and certainly had 6 children even if it is not to be excluded that he had others. == Works == His most known work of art is a copy of the \\"Ultima Cena - Last Supper\\" which can be admired above the altar of the Corpus Domini Chapel of Saints Peter and Paul church in Castelnuovo Scrivia. The artwork (260x265cm) is painted on a table made of five pieces of poplar wood commissioned by the \\"Company of the Holy Sacrament\\" of Castelnuovo Scrivia, of which Alessandro Berri was a member brother. He considerably lowered its cost both for the love for his Company and \\"for the good feeling he had to leave this important memory of his virtue to his Country in such an important place…\\". The paint itself can be seen as a copy of \\"The Last Supper\\" of Leonardo, but with the characters placed in a specular manner in spite of the original.leftOther known works are: * An oil paint \\"Madonna in trono col Bambino\\" (1569) which in the past was located at the picture gallery of Tortona and now is preserved in the Civic Museum of Palazzo Centurione (location of the City Hall) of Castelnuovo Scrivia. The paint is signed in the lower part \\"Alexander Birius neocastrensis pinxit anno 1569\\"; * the frescoes on the southern part of \\"dell’Arengo\\" room of the Castello Podestarile or Pretorio Palace (Castle of Torriani e Bandello) in Castelnuovo Scrivia. In the lower side of an ornament there is the inscription \\"De Berris faciebat 1557\\"; * the coat of arms of the Avalos Gonzaga Family, rulers of Castelnuovo Scrivia from 1526 till 1588, in the Castle of Torriani e Bandello; * two frescoes portraying the Prophets (1570–1571) on both sides of the altar in the Corpus Domini chapel, ordered by the \\"Company of the Holy Sacrament\\". Credited to Alessandro Berri is also the altar-step of \\"The Last Supper\\" where are illustrated some Stories of the Passion. This artwork, sawed in the centre to insert a tabernacle, was re- discovered during the 1986 restoration works of \\"The Last Supper\\" hidden by the lower wooden frame of the altar. == Bibliography == * Antonello Brunetti, La parrocchiale \\"Santi Pietro e Paolo\\" di Castelnuovo Scrivia, 2005, pp. 163-182 * Antonello Brunetti, Storia e arte miscellanea castelnovese, Comune of Castelnuovo Scrivia, 2005, pp. 165-172 * Goffredo Casalis, Dizionario geografico, storico, statistico, commerciale degli stati di S.M. il re di Sardegna, G.

The nonprofit conservation organization African Parks began managing Chinko in partnership with the government of the Central African Republic in December 2014. ==Description and terrain== Chinko is a 5.9 million hectare (or nearly 7,000 square miles) protected area in the southeastern part of the Central African Republic, managed by the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks as part of a fifty-year public–private partnership with the Ministry of Water, Forest, Hunting and Fishing. African Parks began managing Chinko in December 2014, becoming the eighth park to be included in the organization's management portfolio. David Simpson, who co-founded the project, serves as the park's manager. Chinko is located on a volcanic plateau, above sea level. Rain and other freshwater sources are plentiful, and Precambrian bedrock erosion has created a layer of alluvial soil, allowing abundant and diverse wildlife to disperse throughout the region. The park has been described having uncommon geology, plentiful water, and a role as a \\"diversifying agent\\". ==Flora and fauna== Pousargues's mongoose in the park in 2012 Chinko has of \\"uninhabited Medio-Sudanian and Sudano Guinean\\" wooded savannah with some Congolese rainforest. These diverse ecosystems form an ecotone within the Chinko River basin and support a variety of wildlife, including several primate species, African forest elephants, 23 even-toed ungulate species, more than 20 types of carnivores, 5 anteater mammals, and approximately 500 bird species. Carnivores include the African wild dog, leopard, lion, and mongoose. Other species include: African buffalo, bongo, chimpanzee, monkey, crocodile, Eastern giant eland, giant forest hog, hartebeest (including Lelwel hartebeest), red forest duiker, warthog, waterbuck, and yellow-backed duiker. The reserve is home to dozens of endangered species, and the following bird species: black-bellied bustards, buzzards, guineafowl, hoopoes, hornbills, kingfishers, secretarybirds, stone partridge, and sunbirds. Chinko, being an extensive block of pristine habitat, can provide the genetic diversity to recolonize the surrounding regions when populations there dwindle or become locally extinct. ==History== Chinko previously served as a hunting reserve and was home to thousands of buffalo, elephant, and lion. The area saw significant decreases in wildlife populations during the 1980s–2000s because of cattle grazing, the ivory trade, and poaching. In 2002, it was reported that as much as 95 percent of wildlife in the Chinko region was lost. Erik Mararv and his family acquired a hunting concession in 2005 and launched a safari operation called Central African Wildlife Adventures in 2006. During the safari's six years of operating, the Mararv family built two airstrips, guest rooms, and hundreds of miles of roads, imported machinery and trucks, and trained staff. David Simpson started working as a pilot for the safari company in 2010, and was asked by Mararv to return as general manager the following year. Foreign pastoralists, known as the Wodaabe (or Mbororo), started herding in more remote parts of the Central African Republic, including Chinko and surrounding areas, around 2012. The additional cattle grazing, overgrazing, poaching, and wildfires contributed to deforestation, desertification, and erosion. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service contributed nearly $100,000 in 2013 to reduce poaching by training rangers and reaching out to local communities to increase awareness of conservation efforts. Simpson co-created the Chinko Project to protect the area's habitat and wildlife, and began managing the park when African Parks took over operations in 2014. Thierry Aebischer, Raffael Hickisch, and Erik Mararv have also been credited as partners of the project. Chinko had fifty park rangers in February 2016. In mid 2016, Simpson was reportedly managing 400 staff members and a $2.5 million budget, and Chinko was \\"the only major tax-generating entity in the entire eastern half of the Central African Republic, and one of the largest employers and importers of foreign goods in the country\\". Chinko staff collected more than 700,000 wildlife sightings from motion-activated cameras by mid 2016, and used a small aircraft to identify and track animals and park intruders. Fondation Segré partnered with African Parks in 2016 to hire and train rangers, construct operations centers, improve communications technology, purchase equipment, and enhance data management. In January 2017, a helicopter chartered by African Parks crashed, killing the park's head of law enforcement, his deputy, and the pilot. ==See also== * List of protected areas of the Central African Republic * Wildlife of the Central African Republic ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:African Parks (organisation) Category:Protected areas of the Central African Republic ","title":"Chinko"},{"id":"56892535","text":"The 9th Mirchi Music Awards, presented by the Radio Mirchi, honoured the best of Hindi music from the year 2016.

It is a bioinformatics tool that is used worldwide to compare multiple phages and their genomic annotations. Up to recent dates, there have been more than 8,000 bacteriophages, including over 1,600 with already sequenced genomes, have been entered into the database.Russell DA, Hatfull GF, \\"PhagesDB: the actinobacteriophage database\\" It is an addition to the wide range of priorly existing bioinformatic tools, like NCBI. It provides results of already sequenced phage genomes and aims to allow access to drafted phage genomes to provide a larger spectrum of information. ==Background== PhagesDB provides the Actinobacteriophage research community with an outlet to post their findings and share it with the members of their community who can then further analyze the data and use it to annotate newly discovered phage genomes through comparison. It was designed to keep up with the speed of discovery so new genes can be uploaded in real time. It is supposed to help avoid the \\"time-lag between sequencing and availability of annotated genomes in GenBank. It links students from all over the world who are performing authentic research via the SEA-PHAGES program so they can share their results with the rest of the research community.Hatfull, Graham \\"Genomic Databases:DNA Annotation\\"\\" There are more than 6400 registered PhagesDB users with xxx.edu email addresses, reflecting usage by student researchers. In 1993, the sequencing of L5 led to the start of the first decade of Actinobacteriophage genomics, and concluded in the publication of an analysis that compared 14 different mycobacteriophage genomes in 2003. Using local spreadsheets and GenBank, it was possible to manage the resulting data for approximately a year, provided that it was at the pace of approximately one genome every year. However, the following two developments made this approach indefensible. First of all, the creation of the Phage Hunters Integrating Research and Education (PHIRE) program created a path for beginner high school and college scientists to purify, isolate, and characterize their own new phages, leading to a sharp increase in the amount of phage isolates that can be accessed for sequencing. Secondly, the revelation of Next-Generation Sequencing technologies caused a faster and cheaper sequencing of those genomes of phages. As a result the number of phage genomes sequenced in the next decade exponentially increased. The foundation of the Science Education Alliance- Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program in 2008 increased the pipeline more for isolation and sequencing of Actinobacteriophage, and coping with the data created by these programs brought a challenge. PhagesDB was created to be a single, concentrated archive of phage information where anyone interested in or involved with phage study could access and enter data. A web-accessible database sample allowed the storage and retrieval of data in a methodical and pliable way, as well as giving easy access to anyone with an connection to internet. In April 2010, PhagesDB launched, and was initially only for Mycobacteriophages (phages of mycobacterial hosts). In 2015, it became the Actinobacteriophage Database to contain all phages infecting hosts in the Phylum Actinobacteria. == Design and Features == The creation of PhagesDB was carried out using Django and was hosted on a WebFaction server. Django is a Python-based web-development framework, and it was chosen specifically for its high versatility, accessibility to non-professional programmers, clarity of documentation, and several other out-of-the-box features including a fully functional administrative site. It was important for it to have accessibility to non- professional programmers as that allows for a more diverse range of results. Rather than host PhagesDB locally, WebFaction was chosen for its easy integration with Django, its high-level data security and its low downtime. The database website opens up with a mostly green and black lobby page and on the top left, a search bar is present. Phage names can be, sequenced and/or draft, typed in the search bar and results immediately pop up. PhagesDB has an individual phage page for every single phage out of the more than 8000 phages that have been entered into the database. These pages contain detailed information regarding the phages. This information includes discovery details (GPS coordinates, year found, isolation temperature, host bacterium, etc.), sequencing details (genome length, G + C content, type of genome termini, etc.), characterization details (morphotype, cluster/subcluster, gene list, etc.) and further useful files (fasta sequence file, plaque picture, restriction digest picture, micrograph, etc.). If applicable, there are links to the GenBank entry for the phage, as well as the paper it was published in. Along with all these, there is a separate GeneMark page for each phage which allows one to cross reference the position of genomes within the draft phages to ensure that there is indeed a genome present at a certain spot. PhagesDB can be used on its own but is found to be more accurate when used in collaboration with another bioinformatics website like NCBI Blast. The figure below indicates the different types and numbers of phages sequenced: {  !Phage Types Sequenced !Number Sequenced - Actinoplanes 1 - Arthrobacter 240 - Brevibacterium 2 - Corynebacterium 12 - Gordonia 296 - Kocuria 4 - Microbacterium 98 - Mycobacterium 1590 - Propionibacterium 55 - Rhodococcus 53 - Rothia 1 - Streptomyces 167 - Tetrasphaera 1 - Tsukamurella 2 } There are many different ways in PhagesDB where the user is able to view and contact with groups of phages. Phage lists can be generated and classified by host (genus, species, or strain), cluster, subcluster, institution, year found, genome length, G + C content and a few other criteria. The filter page lets for a combination of criteria to aim at a group of phages with particular characteristics. Each phage cluster and subcluster has its own page with a catalog of member phages. Along with this each cluster and subcluster has days present about itself as well, for example number of members in the clusters, their average genome sizes, and the hosts their members infect or prefer to infect. There is an interactive map that shows all phages/clusters that are sequenced with known GPS coordinates. This gives information about the geographical spread of phage locations of isolation. The compare page lets users view all plaque pictures, limitation digest pictures, or micrographs for a given phage group. PhagesDB has amino-acid level details about its phage genomes that are sequenced by integration with Phamerator == Access and Rights to Data == PhagesDB data can be viewed by anyone freely and anyone can register for the site (through Google, Facebook, Twitter, or PhagesDB itself), giving the ability to add new phages that have been found, and modify the phage data while learning more about the characteristics of phages. Additionally, the site gives multiple ways of bringing back the fundamental data. The download page of the data consists of links for downloading all sequences of phage genome, texts about each phage with a broad information, and photos with all plaque images, restriction digest gel pictures, or micrographs for any given cluster. Each Pham page provides a link to download the amino acid sequences of all members of that Pham for comparative proteomic motives. An Application Programming Interface (API) was recently added to let users approach a lot of underlying data in a way more compatible for computers. The PhagesDB API receives appeals for all phages, the ones by host, by cluster or subcluster, sequenced, etc., and reverts json objects with the wanted information. PhagesDB keeps some unpublished data that is not present in any medium, including genome sequences that have been done recently. The PhagesDB ‘Terms of Use’ contains instructions on how and which data shall be used by third parties. For instance, users willing to take advantage of unpublished data for their private purposes need permission from the owners of data. == References  * Homepage Category:Biological databases Category:Virology Category:Bioinformatics software ","title":"PhagesDB"},{"id":"56892635","text":"Severe Tropical Cyclone Marcus was a very powerful tropical cyclone that struck Australia's Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia in March 2018. It was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2017–18 Australian region cyclone season, as well as the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region basin since George in 2007. It was also considered the worst cyclone to hit Darwin since Tracy in 1974. It was also the strongest tropical cyclone since Tracy to hit Darwin, making landfall there as a Category 2 tropical cyclone. Marcus formed on March 14 from a tropical low situated over the northeast Timor Sea, which quickly moved southeast and strengthened into a tropical cyclone the next day. ==Meteorological history== On 15 March 2018, a tropical low formed in the western Arafura Sea. Drifting east-southeastwards north of the Tiwi Islands, the tropical low strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale early on 16 March, and was accordingly given the name Marcus. In a generally favourable environment for intensification, Cyclone Marcus reached Category 2 status in the hours before it crossed the Northern Territory coastline, on 17 March. On 16 March, Marcus moved down towards the Australian coast, and rapidly intensified before making landfall in Darwin as a weak Category 2 tropical cyclone. Marcus intensified markedly upon moving away from the coast. Soon, the storm started to rapidly intensify, and by 21 March, Marcus reached Category 5 tropical cyclone intensity. However, after doing so, the storm began to rapidly weaken due to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle, stronger wind shear, and cooler waters. Marcus continued to rapidly weaken as it moved southward. The system soon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on March 25, though Marcus' remnant would continue moving southeastward for another couple of days. On March 27, the extratropical remnant of Marcus dissipated off the southwest coast of Australia. == Preparation and impact == A large tree blocks the Stuart Highway in Darwin about three hours after the cyclone passed Darwin. Parap Before the storm, on 15 March, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone warnings for Darwin, the Tiwi Islands, and parts of the northwest Top End. Major events and flights in and out of Darwin were cancelled. Approximately 26,000 homes were affected by electricity outages as a result of the destructive winds, even in areas as far south as Batchelor and Adelaide River. Thousands of trees were destroyed across the Greater Darwin region including many African mahoganies planted after Cyclone Tracy for their fast growing and expansive shade qualities. Public schools and non-essential public service agencies were closed while the clean-up efforts continued and tree trunks removed from roads. Cyclone Marcus was the most destructive storm to hit Darwin since Cyclone Tracy caused devastation on Christmas Eve of 1974. The insurance loss were over A$85 million (US$65.6 million). In all, Marcus caused an estimated total of A$97.46 million (US$75 million) in damages. The cleanup response was coordinated by the Northern Territory Emergency Services and included soldiers from the 5th Battalion and the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment of the Australian Army. The US Marine Rotational Force – Darwin (MRF-D) also contributed to the clean up effort. ==Retirement== Due to the damage caused by the cyclone in Darwin and its subsequent intensification, the name Marcus was retired and was replaced with Marco. ==See also== *1897 Darwin cyclone – a cyclone that also caused severe damage in Darwin *Similarly intense tropical cyclones in the Australian Region: **Cyclone Inigo (2003) **Cyclone Gwenda (1999) **Cyclone Orson (1989) ==References * Australian Bureau of Meteorology Category:Category 5 Australian region cyclones Category:Tropical cyclones in Australia Category:2017–18 Australian region cyclone season Category:2018 natural disasters Category:History of Darwin, Northern Territory Category:Disasters in the Northern Territory Category:2010s in the Northern Territory Marcus ","title":"Cyclone Marcus"},{"id":"56892636","text":"The 8th Mirchi Music Awards, presented by the Radio Mirchi, honoured the best of Hindi music from the year 2015.

Its plot follows a mild-mannered Uber driver named Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) who picks up a passenger (Dave Bautista) who turns out to be a cop hot on the trail of a brutal killer. Iko Uwais, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, Jimmy Tatro, Mira Sorvino, and Karen Gillan also star. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2019. Stuber was produced and released by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized it for not taking full advantage of its potential but praised Nanjiani and Bautista's chemistry. ==Plot== An aggressive Los Angeles Police Department detective Vic Manning is in pursuit of a notorious drug lord Oka Tedjo, who six months earlier, murdered Vic's partner, Sara Morris, after which Vic's superior, Captain McHenry, orders him on leave. Because his pursuit of Tedjo during that encounter was hampered when his glasses were knocked off his face, Vic undergoes corrective laser eye surgery. This requires him to remain off duty for a day or two, due to his reduced vision as his eyes heal. However, when an informant contacts him with a lead on Tedjos' activity, he calls for an Uber, and is picked up by Stu Prasad, an unassuming driver who diligently performs his job with an eye on the reviews he receives on the Uber app. Along the way, Stu deals with Vic's violent and reckless behavior while trying to express his feelings to his friend Becca. As Stu and Vic get to know one another, they confront each other about Stu's lack of courage with Becca, while Stu criticizes Vic for his toxic masculinity and his insensitive treatment of his daughter Nicole. Vic's investigation lead him and Stu around Los Angeles, at locations including Koreatown, then a male stripper club and a house in Long Beach, where Vic detains a key suspect of his investigation and rescues the dog Pico (a Pit Bull Terrier) from being drugged to hide the evidence. Stu accidentally shoots the thug in the leg and Vic leads them to an animal hospital, where a group of thugs find the two and attack them. Though terrified, Stu throws dog food cans at the thugs, enabling the nearly blind Vic to successfully shoot the criminals by using the sound of the impact of the cans. Vic, using the phone of one of the thugs, sends a text to their leader to inform of \\"his\\" death and then runs to Nicole's museum exhibit to warn her about the impending danger. Meanwhile, Stu struggles with his relationship with Becca, a friend and partner of his in an upcoming spin biking gym. Becca, dealing with the end of her relationship with her boyfriend, wants Stu for casual sex, but for whom Stu is genuinely in love with her. Eventually, Stu and Vic face Tedjo at the location of his drop, where Vic finds that McHenry is a dirty cop who has been working with Tedjo and was planning to frame Vic for murder to get him off their trail. Stu does admit he loves Becca, but then realizes it would not work since he knows she does not feel the same way and that they should not even be friends. Stu and Vic work together to take down the villains, but Nicole ends up in the mayhem when crosses path with them, and is nearly shot by Tedjo. Stu takes the bullet, and Vic almost kills Tedjo before Nicole stops him. Police arrive to bring Tedjo to justice. As Stu and Vic recover in the hospital, Vic gives Stu a five-star Uber review (despite the $5534.95 fare he has to pay him), and Becca has started up a successful spin biking business. That Christmas, Vic arrives at Nicole home with Pico, only to discover that Nicole is dating Stu. ==CastProductionDevelopment=== In April 2016, 20th Century Fox bought the spec script Stuber from Tripper Clancy for a mid- six figure deal, with Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley set to produce the film. ===Casting=== In December 2017, Dave Bautista was cast as a \\"detective who commandeers an unsuspecting Uber driver named Stu\\" while Michael Dowse was announced as the director of the film. In March 2018, Kumail Nanjiani signed on to costar with Bautista. In April 2018, Iko Uwais joined the cast. In May 2018, Betty Gilpin, Natalie Morales, Mira Sorvino, Steve Howey, and Amin Joseph joined the cast. ===Filming=== Principal photography commenced on May 3, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia and was shot until July 2, 2018. ==Release== Stuber had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2019 and was released on July 12, 2019. Following their acquisition of 20th Century Fox, the film was Walt Disney Studios' first film to receive an R-rating by the Motion Picture Association since The Fifth Estate (2013). ===Home media=== Stuber was released on Digital HD on October 1, 2019, and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD on October 15, 2019. == Reception Box office=== Stuber has grossed $22.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $32.2 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $7–15 million from 3,050 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $750,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $8 million, finishing fourth at the box office. In its second weekend the film made $4.1 million, dropping 50% and finishing sixth. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 215 reviews, with an average rating of 5.06/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it makes a strong case for future collaborations between Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista, Stuber fails to mesh its contrasting genres, settling for an overtly violent, mildly entertaining diversion that's far from a five-star ride.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3.5 out of 5 stars and a 51% \\"definite recommend\\". Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review and wrote: \\"It's both funny and familiar to see these two incredibly different personalities thrust together for what's meant to be a short ride.\\" Glenn Kenny, writing for RogerEbert.com, said \\"The only thing worse than hot garbage is elaborately lukewarm mediocrity, and for too much of its running time, the new comedy Stuber is just that.\\" Simon Thompson of IGN wrote: \\"Stuber is an awkward, uneven action- comedy that never realizes its full potential. It squanders a good premise and an odd couple pairing with potential that could have delivered something special.\\" A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade C−, calling it \\"a big waste of talent\\". == References  External links == * * Category:2019 films Category:2010s action comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American buddy films Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Dowse Category:Films scored by Joseph Trapanese Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:2019 comedy films ","title":"Stuber (film)"},{"id":"56892858","text":"Kagome metal is a ferromagnetic quantum material created in 2018. In the material, metal atoms are arranged in a lattice resembling the Japanese kagome basket weaving pattern. The material was announced in Nature by investigators from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all in the United States. In the Kagome structure, atoms are arranged into layered sets of overlapping triangles so that there exist large empty hexagonal spaces. Electrons in the metal experience a \\"three-dimensional cousin of the quantum Hall effect\\". The inherent magnetism of the metal and the quantum-mechanical magnetism induce electrons to flow around the edges of the triangular crystals, akin to superconductivity. Unlike superconductivity, this structure and behavior is stable at room temperature. Other structures were shown to exhibit the quantum hall effect at very low temperatures with an external magnetic field as high as 1 million times the strength that of the earth. By building metal out of a ferromagnetic material, that exterior magnetic field was no longer necessary, and the quantum Hall effect persists into room temperature. The Kagome alloy synthesized in 2018 displayed several exotic quantum electronic behaviors that add to its quantum topology. The lattice harbors massive Dirac fermions, Berry curvature, band gaps, and spin-orbit activity, all of which are conducive to the Hall Effect and zero energy loss electric currents. These behaviors are promising for the development of technologies in quantum computing, spin superconductors, and low power electronics. , more Kagome materials displaying similar topology were being experimented with, such as in magnetically doped Weyl-Semimetals Co2MnGa and Co3Sn2S2. == Development  March 2018 experiment === The experiment published in Nature was led by Linda Ye and Mingu Kang from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Physics. The other researches published in the article were: Junwei Liu (MIT), Felix von Cube (Harvard), Christina R. Wicker (MIT), Takehito Suzuki (MIT), Chris Jozwiak (Berkeley Labs), Aaron Bostwick (Berkeley Labs), Eli Rotenberg (Berkeley Labs), David C. Bell (Harvard), Liang Fu (MIT), Riccardo Comin (MIT), and Joseph G. Checkelsky (MIT). The team constructed a Kagome lattice using an iron and tin alloy Fe3Sn2. When Fe3Sn2 is heated to about 750℃ (1380°F), the alloy naturally assumes a Kagome lattice structure. To maintain this structure at room temperature, the team cooled it in an ice bath. The resulting structure had iron atoms at the corners of each triangle surrounding tin atoms, the tin atoms stabilizing the large empty hexagonal space. The photo-electronic structure of this metal was mapped at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Advanced Light Source beamlines 7.0.2 MAESTRO and 4.0.3 MERLIN. The measurements taken here mapped the band structures of the metal under a current and showed “the double-Dirac-cone structure corresponding to Dirac Fermions”. A 30 meV gap between cones was shown, which is indicative of the Hall effect and massive Dirac fermions. The experiment was published in Nature on March 19, 2018. === Expansions upon the 2018 experiment === Linda Ye and the rest of the MIT team continued working with the kagome metal, looking into more properties on Fe3Sn2 and other iron-tin alloys. According to an article published by the team on October 25, 2019 in Nature Communications, the lattice was shown to exhibit spin-orbit coupling de Haas van Alphen oscillations and Fermi surfaces. The team also continued to modify the structure of the metal, and in an article published in Nature Materials on December 9, 2019, they found that FeSn in a 1 to 1 ratio exhibited a more “ideal” lattice. The two-dimensional layers with iron and tin in the kagome shape were separated by a layer entirely of tin, allowing them to have separate band structures. This structure showed both massive Dirac fermions and electronic band structures where electrons do not occur. ==See also== *Herbertsmithite, a natural mineral with kagome lattice at the atomic scale *Magnon ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:2018 in science Category:Materials ","title":"Kagome metal"},{"id":"56892868","text":"Gaius Anicius Cerialis (died 66) was a Roman senator who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the second half of the year 65 as the colleague of Gaius Pomponius Pius.Paul A. Gallivan, \\"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), pp. 292, 310 Beyond his consulate, Cerialis appears three times in history. The first time was during the reign of Caligula when he was accused of majestas against the emperor. Cassius Dio provides a confused account.Dio, Historia Romana, LIX.25.5 Steven H. Rutledge provides an interpretation that makes sense of Dio: Cerialis and another senator, Sextus Papinius, were tortured, but neither provided any information. The emperor then offered to spare Papinius' life if he were to denounce his fellow conspirators, which he did; Caligula then had both \\"Cerialis\\" and the men he named executed.Rutledge, Imperial Inquisitions: Prosecutors and Informants from Tiberius to Domitian (London: Routledge, 2002), p. 163 It is likely that by \\"Cerialis\\" Dio means Papinius, for Anicius Cerialis is very much alive years later. The year before his election as consul the Pisonian conspiracy was uncovered. Nero delivered a speech wherein he shared the news and named the conspirators, and their punishments. The Senate then voted for a thanksgiving, and other acts flattering the emperor. Tacitus recounts other servile acts, which includes an account based on the Acta Senatus that Cerialis proposed a temple be built as soon as possible at public expense to \\"the Divine Nero\\".Tacitus, Annales, XV.14 The last time Cerialis appears in history is also during the reign of Nero. The year after Cerialis' consulate, in AD 66, Tacitus recounts how a delator, or informer, accused Annaeus Mela under the lex maiestas. Faced with certain destruction, Mela made his will and committed suicide. In his will, he accused Rufrius Crispinus, a former commander of the Praetorian guard, and Cerialis of majestas. Tacitus states that it was commonly believed Mela named Crispinus because the man had already taken his life; Cerialis was named because Mela wanted him dead.

He is a member of the Bundestag. From 2014 until 2018, Ziemiak served as federal chairman of the Junge Union Deutschlands, in this capacity being a part of the CDU leadership under chairwoman Angela Merkel. In the 2017 federal election, he was elected as a member of the Bundestag as the direct representative of the constituency of Herne – Bochum II. ==Early life and career== Ziemiak was born in Szczecin, Polish People's Republic. He moved to then-West Germany in 1988 with his parents, who wanted to escape the conditions of Communist Poland and the Eastern Bloc. The Ziemiaks were among the around 140,000 Polish citizens who left for Germany in that year, shortly before the Fall of Communism. Claiming partial German descent, they obtained citizenship under Germany's right of return laws and lived for a year in a refugee camp in Massen next to non-western asylum seekers. Ziemiak has said the facility was often visited by the police and that he befriended a Roma family that also lived there. After a year they settled permanently in Iserlohn. Both his parents had been doctors in Poland, but their qualifications were not recognised in West Germany and they had to retrain as interns in German hospitals before obtaining their German licenses and finding employment.http://www.reporter- forum.de/fileadmin/pdf/Reporterpreis_2017/smechowski_anpasser.pdf Ziemiak grew up bilingual, with parents who were native Polish speakers and who only spoke German as a foreign language. He has said the family was culturally Polish and that Germany only gradually felt like home. After graduation he studied law at the Universität Osnabrück and the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster but failed the first legal exam on both attempts. He then enrolled at the Business and Information Technology School in Iserlohn to study corporate communications. Since 2005 Ziemiak has been a member of the Catholic fraternity AV Widukind Osnabrück within the CV. Furthermore, he is a member of the Catholic student fraternity KDStV Winfridia (Breslau) Münster. ==Political career== Ziemiak joined the Young Union in 1998, and in 2001 the CDU.Paul Ziemiak, CDU/CSU, Bundestag.de From 1999 to 2001 he was the first chairman of the newly founded Children and Youth Parliament of the city of Iserlohn. In 2002 he became a member of the district council of the Junge Union in the Märkischer Kreis. In 2006 he was elected to the state board of the JU NRW. In 2007 he became a member of the executive state board. In 2009 he took over the leadership of the district association of the Junge Union Südwestfalen (South Westphalia). Since 2011 he has been serving as chairman of the CDU Iserlohn and member of the board of the CDU parliamentary group in the council of the city Iserlohn. In addition, he is a member of the district executive committee of the CDU Südwestfalen. ===Chairman of the Young Union, 2012–2018=== On 25 November 2012 Ziemiak was elected state chairman of the Junge Union NRW and held this office until 15 November 2014. In 2014, he won the vote for the presidency of the Junge Union against Benedict Poettering and won with 63 percent of the vote. It was the first battle candidacy for this position since 1973. Ziemiak thus is a member of the CDU federal board and replaced Philipp Missfelder, who did not run again. On 14 October 2016, Ziemiak was again elected Federal Chairman with 85 percent of the vote. In February 2017, Ziemiak was a member of the 16th Federal Assembly for the election of the Federal President. In addition to his political career, Ziemiak worked with consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers until entering parliament. ===Member of Parliament, 2017–present=== In the federal election 2017, Ziemiak ran as successor to Ingrid Fischbach in the constituency Herne – Bochum II, but lost to Michelle Müntefering. Nevertheless, he moved to the Bundestag via the state party list. He has since been serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Ziemiak was part of the working group on families, women, seniors and youth, led by Annette Widmann-Mauz, Angelika Niebler and Katarina Barley. ===Secretary General of the CDU, 2018–present=== The new CDU party leader Annegret Kramp- Karrenbauer nominated Ziemiak on 8 December 2018 as Secretary General.

Vero markets itself as a social network free from advertisements, data mining and algorithms. ==History== The app was founded by Lebanese billionaire Ayman Hariri who is the son of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. The name is taken from the Esperanto word for truth. The app launched officially in 2015 as an alternative to Facebook and their popular photo-blogging app Instagram. Within weeks of its release the app surged in popularity although users expressed mixed reports with some feeling confused about how the app worked. Cosplayers were early to adopt the app as their photo-sharing platform of choice, favouring the app's pinch and zoom magnification feature over Instagram's zoom feature. Other creative communities soon followed, and the app became popular with niche groups of makeup artists, tattoo artists, and skateboarders. In March 2018, Vero's popularity surged, partly helped by an exodus from Facebook and Instagram following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. In the wake of the scandal, Vero devised an advertising campaign aimed at defected Facebook and Instagram users, hoping the app's policies and privacy settings would assuage concerns over sharing personal information on the internet. Within the space of one week, the app went from being a small service, akin to Ello or Peach, to being the most downloaded app in eighteen countries. ==Concept and funding== Vero's content feed resembles Instagram's although users can share a wider variety of content and the app has a chronological content feed whereas Facebook and Instagram's feeds are algorithm based. Vero's business plan is also distinct from similar social media apps. Whereas its competitors such as Facebook or Instagram make money from in-app advertising revenue and the sale of user data, Vero's business plan was to invite the first one million users to use the app for free then charge any subsequent users a subscription fee. The app was entirely funded by its founder and generated additional revenues by charging affiliate fees when someone buys a product they find on Vero. ==ControversiesPrivacy=== Vero has faced some criticism over the wording of their manifesto, in particular; “Vero only collects the data we believe is necessary to provide users with a great experience and to ensure the security of their accounts.” – Vero Manifesto. Because this policy does not implicitly state that the app will not sell data on to third parties some users fear that the need to monetise the app through data might prove too tempting. There have also been concerns over Vero's broad terms of service which grant Vero rights over how it uses its user's content. Users have also complained about not being able to delete their accounts. While this was never the case, the option was hidden deep in the app's settings. ===Russian involvement=== Although Vero remains transparent about the app's Russian development team, they have been caught up in concerns about Russian interference on social media platforms. The app's founder Ayman Hariri was quick to dismiss the remarks as xenophobic and defend the nationality of his employees, stating in an interview with Time Magazine; “At the end of the day, where people are from is really not how anybody should judge anyone”. ===Criticism of the app’s founder=== Until 2013, Vero's founder Ayman Harari was deputy CEO and chairman of Saudi Oger, the Saudi Arabian construction company which collapsed in 2017, mired by controversies over the welfare and treatment of their employees. However, Hariri is quick to point out that he divested from the firm in 2014 and the worker's rights violations occurred after he had left the company. ==References *Official Website *Phone Spy Apps Category:Mobile applications Category:Social media companies Category:Social media ","title":"Vero (app)"},{"id":"56893166","text":"Erik Satie The Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) (True Flabby Preludes for a Dog) is a 1912 piano composition by Erik Satie. The first of his published humoristic piano suites of the 1910s, it signified a breakthrough in his creative development and in the public perception of his music.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, pp. 81-82. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, . In performance it lasts about 5 minutes. Satie biographer Rollo H. Myers, writing in 1948, remarked on the prophetic nature of this seemingly unassuming keyboard suite: \\"In the heyday of Impressionism...came the Flabby Preludes which in their linear austerity heralded the Neoclassic vogue which was to dominate Western music during the nineteen-twenties.\\"Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 128. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. ==Background== Schola Cantorum in Paris The Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) represents Satie's determination to reconcile his belated education at the Schola Cantorum in Paris under Vincent d'Indy (1905-1912) with his own natural sense of wit and fantasy. It was in fact his second attempt at creating a composition on a canine theme, an idea that had long obsessed him.Ornella Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), pp. 187-188. Volta believes Satie was inspired to dedicate a piece of music to a canine by one of his favorite books, Gargantua and Pantagruel by François Rabelais. In the preface to Gargantua, Rabelais paraphrased the ancient philosopher Socrates to urge readers to look beyond the \\"curious\\" titles of written works and explore their contents, just as a dog chews an unappetizing-looking bone to extract the marrow. Rabelais quotes from the same passage of Plato's Symposium that Satie would set to music in his cantata Socrate (1918).The idea stayed with Satie long after he had completed his sets of preludes pour un chien. He would later tell author Jean Cocteau, \\"I want to write a play for dogs, and I already have my set design: the curtain rises on a bone.\\"See Ornella Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone: Some investigations into Erik Satie.\\" Originally published as \\"Le rideau se leve sur un os\\" in the Revue International de la Musique Française, Vol. 8, No. 23, 1987.

In July 1912 Satie composed his piano suite Préludes flasques (pour un chien), but after it was rejected for publication by the Durand firm he informed his protégé Alexis Roland-Manuel that he was going to rewrite it from scratch.Erik Satie, letter to Alexis Roland-Manuel dated August 8, 1912. Quoted in Alan M. Gillmor, \\"Erik Satie\\", Twayne Publishers, Boston, 1988, p. 146. The three pieces of the new set were completed between August 12 and August 23, 1912.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 296. On September 13 Satie offered it to publisher E. Demets, who not only bought the work on the spot (for 50 francs) but asked for more.Caroline Potter, \\"Erik Satie: A Parisian Composer and His World\\", Boydell & Brewer, 2016, p. 101. This modest triumph convinced Satie that he was on the right creative path at last. On November 23, 1912, he formally ended his studies with d'Indy.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Clarendon Press, Feb 18, 1999, p. 359. Also see footnote 33 on same page. As Robert Orledge noted, \\"Once Satie could laugh at the Schola and himself he was back on course.\\"Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 120. The Véritables Préludes flasques were published the following month. Unlike Durand, Demets saw commercial potential in the amusing novelty of the Préludes. The firm would publish 10 of Satie's humoristic piano suites over the next four years. ==Music and texts== Cover of the original edition (1912) of the Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) Despite Satie's description of them as \\"flabby\\", the three Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) are lean, dry, and starkly contrapuntal: :1. Sévère réprimande (Severe Reprimand) :2. Seul à la maison (Home Alone) :3. On joue (We Play) Composer Charles Koechlin observed that here Satie \\"gets rid of repetitions and redundancies. He prunes, throws out ballast, suppresses held notes, condenses, reduces the musical dialogue to a strict minimum.\\"Alexander Carpenter, Allmusic review at http://www.allmusic.com/composition/v%C3%A9ritables-pr%C3%A9ludes-flasques- pour-un-chien-truly-flabby-preludes-for-a-dog-for-piano-mc0002368379%3C Biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier noted that \\"The novelty of the flabby preludes came as a charming surprise. Yet Satie's imagination is still kept in check here. Sévère réprimande, a lively and emphatic toccata with singing bass chords; Seul à la maison, a delightful two-part invention; On joue, with lightly bouncing fourths and fifths and minor sevenths climbing menacingly up the keyboard: no trace of humor here, in the music. But the directions are in mock Latin...\\"Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p.82. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. These Latin directions include corpulentus (fat), epotus (drunken), caeremoniosus (ceremonially), paululum (tiny), opacus (shady) and, in a possible dig at d'Indy, paedagogus (schoolmaster).Complete score available at http://imslp.org/wiki/3_V%C3%A9ritables_pr%C3%A9ludes_flasques_(pour_un_chien)_(Satie%2C_Erik). ==Performance== Ricardo Viñes in 1919 Satie dedicated the Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) to pianist Ricardo Viñes, who gave the successful premiere of the work at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on April 5, 1913. The composer used this occasion to publish an advertisement announcing his future creative plans in that day's issue of the periodical Le Guide du concert. It is a mission statement of sorts, written in a high-handed tone calculated to bait his critics: :\\"The Véritables préludes flasques...opens a series of pianistic works: :Descriptions automatiques, Embryons desséchés, Chapitres tournés en tous sens and Vieux sequins et vieilles cuirasses.Satie did not entirely adhere to this scheme. The unannounced suite Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois was begun in June 1913 and intermittently worked on throughout the summer. In them I devote myself to the sweet joys of fantasy. Those who will not understand are requested by me to observe the most respectful silence and to show an attitude of complete submission and inferiority. That is their true role.\\"Quoted in Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Satie and the Meaning of the Comic\\". Published as Chapter 2 in Dr Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013, pp. 19-48. Viñes would become the foremost champion of Satie's keyboard music through the early 1920s, premiering several of his compositions.Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 35. Satie was delighted by the \\"irresistibly droll air of secrecy\\" of his interpretations.Erik Satie, autobiographical blurb for publisher E. Demets' Bulletin des Editions musicales, December 1913. Quoted in Nigel Wilkins, \\"The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, p. 79. Viñes was also the piano teacher of Francis Poulenc, an important Satie protégé and future member of Les Six. ==Recordings== Aldo Ciccolini (twice, in 1968 for Angel Records and 1988 for EMI); Frank Glazer (Vox, 1968, reissued 1990); Jean-Joël Barbier (Universal Classics France, 1971); William Masselos (RCA, 1968); Grant Johannesen (Vox, 1976); Yūji Takahashi (Denon, 1979); France Clidat (Forlane, 1984); Johannes Cernota (PolJazz, 1984); Roland Pöntinen (BIS, 1986); Jan Kaspersen (Olufsen Records, 1987); Anne Queffélec (Virgin Classics, 1988); Peter Dickinson (Classical Collection, 1990, reissued by Olympia, 2001); Joanna MacGregor (Collins Records, 1992); Gabriel Tacchino (Disques Pierre Verany, 1993); Jean-Pierre Armengaud (Circé, 1990, reissued 2000); Michel Legrand (Erato Records, 1993); Klára Körmendi (Naxos, 1993); Bojan Gorišek (Audiophile Classics, 1994); Olof Höjer (Swedish Society Discofil, 1996); Jean-Yves Thibaudet (Decca, 2003); Steffen Schleiermacher (MDG, 2005); Cristina Ariagno (Brilliant Classics, 2006); Alexandre Tharaud (Harmonia Mundi, 2009); Katia and Marielle Labèque (KML, 2009), Jeroen van Veen (Brilliant Classics, 2016). == References  * Category:Compositions by Erik Satie Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:1912 compositions Category:Neoclassicism (music) ","title":"Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien)"},{"id":"56893170","text":"Rear Admiral Edward Anderson Wilkinson Jr. (September 21, 1933 – May 23, 2020) of United States Navy was the Director Defense Mapping Agency from July 1983 to July 1985.

The island also had a piping school at one time and Beatrix Potter was a visitor during the 20th century. ==Boswell and Johnson== James Boswell Samuel Johnson painted circa 1772, a year before his visit to Ulva Dr Johnson and Boswell visited The MacQuarrie on Ulva in October 1773, the year after Sir Joseph Banks brought Staffa to the English-speaking world's attention.

Both men left separate accounts of the visit, Johnson in A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (18 January 1775) and Boswell in Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D (1785). They arrived on Saturday, 16 October, and left the following day. Johnson wrote: > We resolved not to embarrass a family, in a time of so much sorrow, if any > other expedient could he found; and as the Island of Ulva was over-against > us, it was determined that we should pass the strait and have recourse to > the Laird, who, like the other gentlemen of the Islands, was known to Col. > We expected to find a ferry-boat, but when at last we came to the water, the > boat was gone.

Great though the age of the Macquarries may have been, it appears at this point that they were considering selling it, and that the house was in a state of disrepair, despite the hospitality: > Talking of the sale of an estate of an ancient family, which was said to > have been purchased much under its value by the confidential lawyer of that > family, and it being mentioned that the sale would probably be set aside by > a suit in equity, Dr Johnson said, 'I am very willing that this sale should > be set aside, but I doubt much whether the suit will be successful; for the > argument for avoiding the sale is founded on vague and indeterminate > principles, as that the price was too low, and that there was a great degree > of confidence placed by the seller in the person who became the purchaser. > Now, how low should a price be? or what degree of confidence should there be > to make a bargain be set aside? a bargain, which is a wager of skill between > man and man.

Boswell and Johnson were not the only famous non-Highland visitors to the island. Walter Scott and James Hogg also visited the islands some decades later.Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 102-05 In 1810 Scott discussed the prospect of a visit, which he describes as a \\"jaunt\\": > Among all my hopes & fears the uppermost thought is that you will be down > this year.

But Ulva has a good anchorage, > and Inchkenneth is surrounded by shoals.\\" By the time Scott visited the \\"mean\\" house of Boswell's journal was gone, and replaced by one from a design by Robert Adam. This in turn has been destroyed, and the current Ulva House is on its site.Haswell-Smith, Hamish \\"Where the wild things are\\" (23 October 2004) Edinburgh. The Scotsman. Retrieved 3 November 2007. Hogg wrote some graffiti on the wall of Ulva Inn, now lost due to its burning down in 1880: > :I've roamed around the creeks and headlands of Mull, :Their fields are > uncultured and cussedly weedy, :Their hard lands are bare and their havens > dull, :Their folks may be brave, but they're cussedly greedy. Naturally, the locals were slightly upset by this, and the Minister of Ulva, Rev. MacLeod wrote the following reply, with a sly pun referring to Jesus' Discourse on holiness from the Sermon on the Mount: > :Ho! Shepherd of Ettrick, :Why sorely complain, :Though the boatman be > greedy for grog? :The beauties of Staffa, :by this we proclaim, :Are like > pearls cast away on a HoggHoward, J. & Jones, A., The Isle of Ulva: A > Visitor's Guide, published by Ulva Estate, (2004) After his visit, Walter Scott used Ulva as material for various works, for example, in his 1815 poem, Lord of the Isles (Canto 4) :And Ulva dark, and Colonsay, ::And all the group of islets gay :That guard famed Staffa round.Scott, Walter (1815)The Lord of the Isles. The Colonsay referred to here, is probably nearby Little Colonsay rather than Colonsay itself. In Tales of a Grandfather, Scott tells the story of \\"Alan-a-Sop\\" (an anglicisation of the Gaelic for \\"Alan of the straw\\", so called because he was born \\"on a heap of straw\\") who was born the illegitimate son of the Maclean of Duart in the 16th century. In his youth, Alan-a-Sop was treated badly by his stepfather, one Maclean of Torloisk.

As a boy I remember listening to him with > delight, for his memory was stored with a never-ending stock of stories, > many of which were wonderfully like those I have since heard while sitting > by the African evening fires.

If, therefore, any of you or any of your children should take to dishonest ways, it will not be because it runs in our blood: it does not belong to you. I leave this precept with you: Be honest.\\" Livingstone also recorded the religion of the yellow stick, which is more connected with the Small Isles. > If, therefore, in the following pages I fall into any errors, I hope they > will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have > forgotten our ancient motto.

Like many Gaels in the 19th century, Livingstone's grandfather was forced to emigrate to the Lowlands for work: > \\"Finding his farm in Ulva insufficient to support a numerous family, my > grandfather removed to Blantyre Works, a large cotton manufactory on the > beautiful Clyde, above Glasgow; and his sons, having had the best education > the Hebrides afforded, were gladly received as clerks by the proprietors, > Monteith and Co.

R. (16 May 2000) As It Was/Sin Mar a Bha: A Ulva Boyhood Birlinn Ltd or \\"Niall MacDhun-lèibhe\\"), who was born on Ulva in 1788, who was in turn the son of another Neil. He also claims that the family stories do not quite fit, and that it is unlikely that he was a descendant of a Culloden combatant. A Mull legend also says that Neil (grandfather) may have been driven from his house by redcoats in the middle of a snowstorm. However, there is no evidence for this.Ross, Andrew. (2006) David Livingstone: Mission and Empire. Continuum International Publishing Group. Pages 1-3 He also notes that Neil's church on Ulva had given the following letter of recommendation of their parishioner, something no doubt David was proud of. :\\"The bearer, Neil Livingstone, a married man in Ulva, part of the parish of Kilninian, has always maintained an unblemished moral character, and is known for a man of piety and religion.

He himself was trained by the great MacCrimmon dynasty of Skye, whose piping skills were legendary in Gaeldom. The MacArthurs themselves were said to be amongst the greatest bagpipers to come out of Scotland. Allen writes: > The MacCrimmons and the MacArthurs were said to have been the finest pipers > and exponents of the piobaireachd and history relates great rivalry between > the families for supremacy.

The opening two stanzas are as follows: :A CHIEFTAIN to the Highlands bound ::Cries, \\"Boatman, do not tarry! :And I'll give thee a silver pound ::To row us o'er the ferry!\\" :\\"Now who be ye would cross Lochgyle, ::This dark and stormy water?\\" :\\"O I'm the chief of Ulva's isle, ::And this, Lord Ullin's daughter. The poem was translated into the Russian language by the Romantic poet Vasiliy Zhukovsky. In Zhukovsky's translation, Lord Ullin's daughter, who is left unnamed in Campbell's original, is given the name Malvina, which the Russian poet borrowed from James Macpherson's Ossian. Vladimir Nabokov has translated Zhukovsky's translation into English to demonstrate the changes that were made.

This is the first verse. :Mi 'nam shuidhe 'n seo leam fhèin :Smaoinich mi gun innsinn sgeul :Na làithean sona bh' agam fhèin :Nuair bha mi òg an Ulbha :(Trans.: Me sitting here by myself :I thought I'd tell a story, :The happy days I had myself :When I was young in Ulva) ==Other authors== The Rev. Donald MacKenzie (Dòmhnall MacCoinnich), author of As it Was: Sin Mar a Bha: An Ulva Boyhood was a noted Gaelic-language author. He was born in Lewis, and his ancestors were from Harris, but he spent a number of years in Ulva itself, from June 1918 onwards. He was formerly minister in Rothesay. Amongst his achievements was a large number of translations of the poems of Robert Burns.Thomson, Derick (ed). (1994) \\"MacKenzie, Donald W.\\" in The Companion to Gaelic Scotland Gairm Publications (Glasgow). He was the last minister on the island. John MacCormick (; 1870–1947), the author of the first full length Scottish Gaelic novel, Dùn Aluinn (1912) was an occasional visitor to the island. He wrote a number of short stories, non-fiction and a novella. He came from Mull, and was a distant relative of the politician of the same name and Neil MacCormick English children's writer, Beatrix Potter (1866–1943) also visited Ulva from time to time. She was a relative of the Clark family, and The Tale of Mr. Tod (1912) is dedicated to F.W. Clark (III - grandson of the man who bought the island). The dedication says rather cryptically: \\"FOR FRANCIS WILLIAM OF ULVA — SOMEDAY!\\" Potter, Beatrix, The Tale of Mr. Tod, Frederick Warne, London, 1912 Curiously, although the main characters of the book are a fox (tod) and a badger (brock), neither species can be found on Ulva. ==ReferencesNotes=General references=== * * Howard, J. & Jones, A., The Isle of Ulva: A Visitor's Guide, published by Ulva Estate, (2004) * Johnson, Samuel (1775) A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland.

Founded in 1872 as the Alexandria Infirmary, it became part of Northern Virginia's Inova Health System in 1997. The hospital is notable for its early contributions in the field of emergency medicine, introducing a 24-hour-a-day emergency department staffed by physicians that has since become the model for emergency care in the United States. == History  Early years: The Alexandria Infirmary === The hospital's history dates to the 1872 founding of the Alexandria Infirmary by a group of local women led by Julia Johns, whose father was the bishop of the Episcopal Church Diocese of Virginia, John Johns. A sailor had arrived at the port of Alexandria with typhoid fever, sparking fears of an epidemic, but there was no place to quarantine or treat those with the disease. The infirmary opened in early 1873 at the corner of Duke Street and South Fairfax Street in a townhouse owned by Johns's father. It would move several times in its early decades, occupying multiple facilities within the area now known as Old Town Alexandria. In 1894, the infirmary opened a nursing school, the first in Northern Virginia. === Alexandria Hospital and the Development of Emergency Medicine === In 1902, the infirmary changed its name to Alexandria Hospital. In 1917, it moved to another new location at the corner of Duke and Washington Streets, where it would remain until the opening of its current campus on Seminary Road, in Alexandria's West End area. The hospital broke ground on the new facility in 1959, and officially opened it in 1962; Vice President of the United States Lyndon Johnson spoke at the opening ceremony. The hospital transitioned its various units to Seminary Road in phases from 1962 until the Duke Street site finally closed in 1974. As the 1960s began, a group of physicians at Alexandria Hospital played a pivotal role in creating the modern medical specialty of emergency medicine. Before this time, hospital emergency departments (EDs) (also called emergency rooms (ERs)) were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them family physicians, general surgeons, internists, and a variety of other specialists. In many smaller emergency departments, nurses would triage patients and physicians would be called in based on the type of injury or illness. In 1961, an Alexandria Hospital general practice physician, Dr. James Mills, recognized that visits to the hospital's emergency department had rapidly increased while staffing had failed to keep pace, since much of the medical staff did not want to serve in the ED. Dissatisfied with his own general practice, Mills recruited three other physicians to work full-time in the emergency department rather than on rotation; the four became \\"the first group of American doctors to engage in full-time emergency practice.\\" This approach became known as the “Alexandria Plan\\" and quickly became a model for other hospitals around the country. By 1968, the specialty was established enough to form the American College of Emergency Physicians, of which Mills served as the second president. === Merger with Inova Health System === By the 1990s, many patients were covered by health insurance plans that provided larger hospital groups with advantages over smaller independent facilities, which led to many mergers and consolidations in the industry. Alexandria Hospital, though still financially sound at the time, began considering merger options, including both not-for-profit and for-profit partners. Ultimately, the hospital decided in 1996 to merge with its Fairfax County-based competitor Inova Health System, which was the largest not-for-profit hospital network in Virginia at the time. In addition to concerns about insurance providers, the hospitals' leaders said they expected to save money by avoiding duplication of services. Upon the merger in 1997, the hospital adopted its current name of Inova Alexandria Hospital, and remains a nonprofit organization. == References  External links == * INOVA Alexandria Hospital  INOVA Health System Category:Hospitals in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Alexandria, Virginia Category:Hospitals established in 1872 Category:1872 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Inova Alexandria Hospital"},{"id":"56893396","text":"Lazaros Arkhontopoulos (born 18 July 1958) is a Greek alpine skier.

Prostitution was a very widespread phenomenon in nineteenth-century Paris and although an accepted practice among the nineteenth century bourgeoisie, it was nevertheless a topic that remained largely taboo in polite society. As a result, Impressionist works depicting the prostitute often became the subject of scandal, and particularly venomous criticism. Some works showed her with considerable sympathy, while others attempted to impart an agency to her; likewise some work showed high-class courtesans, and others prostitutes awaiting clients on the streets. In addition to the sexual revulsion/attraction the figure of the prostitute stirred, she functioned as a sign of modernity, a clear sign of the entanglement of sex, class, power and money. \\"Prostitution, now hidden in the shadows, was for these painters a fact of modernity, and while they drew inspiration from women of the night, they also at times imagined the distance between the studio and the brothel was not so great. Charles Baudelaire, in his early intimate journals, made the equation explicit: 'What is art? Prostitution.'\\". ==Nineteenth-century France== Prostitution was a part of society and integrated into life in France. The brothels and street walkers were regulated by the state; it was legal in Paris in the nineteenth century and government regulation were placed on brothels. By 1810 Paris alone had 180 government approved brothels. There were bi-weekly inspections of all brothels, which by law were controlled by women. Registering as a prostitute in Paris involved having the woman's real name on a national registry and agreeing to the terms of the bi-weekly medical exams to make sure the prostitutes were not carrying venereal diseases. The bi weekly medical examinations set a standard that was used and spread quickly throughout Europe. Prostitutes in nineteenth-century Paris were arrested for contravention and malady. Contravention, or breaking the rules, was used as a reason for the arrest of a prostitute when they engaged in anything that went against a government law. Prostitutes could also be arrested if they had a venereal disease. According to scholar Alain Corbin, arresting a prostitute for having a venereal disease served as a way of keeping Paris \\"clean\\", both morally and physically. Although the existence of prostitution posed a threat to nineteenth-century Parisian society, it was viewed as a \\"necessary evil. The view that prostitution was to be tolerated in Paris comes from the belief that it was needed for survival.As a requirement for survival, prostitution helped to \\"satisfy the needs of men\\" and prevented infection through the excretion of bodily fluids. Alexandre Jean-Baptiste, Distribution of Prostitutes in Paris, 1836 - Cornell University Library During the nineteenth century, many women were forced into prostitution. Most scholars have noted that women who were alone in life or abandoned did not have another choice. On the spectrum of prostitution, there were illegal prostitutes, street walkers, legal workers in brothels and courtesans of the bourgeoisie class. The women who were involved in brothels, or walked the street legally or illegally were regulated by the government and subjected to their rules, whereas the courtesans of the upper class were basically ignored by the government. Street walkers (for example those depicted in the film Les Miserables, (Directed by Tom Hopper in 2012), worked impoverished areas to support their family or themselves. According to Robert Schwartz and his students at Mount Holyoke College, these women lead miserable lives and might service hundreds of men for sexual pleasure. Men often attacked brothels, and the majority of these assaults would go undocumented. On the opposite end of the spectrum, courtesans would often be able to choose which men they served and possibly worked as a courtesan as a second job. These women lived pampered lives, and would be able to make choices for themselves. Above all, courtesans were not forced to abide by the laws that street walkers did. A section of brothels that were most well known and considered to be the most expensive were called Maisons de Tolérance. The appearance of these brothels looked like regular living apartments on the outside. Gustave Brion-Image of Fantine at Javert's feet in Les Miserables The interest in prostitution became prevalent in French art and culture during this time, with paintings such as Édouard Manet's Olympia (1863) and novels such as Émile Zola's Nana,( 1880) or Alfred de Musset, Rolla (1833). Victor Hugo (1802-1885) portrayed 'streetwalkers' in Les Misérables (1862) as desperate women forced to sell themselves, women with no options, such as his character Fantine. In Fantine's case, she was forced to turn to prostitution to support herself and her daughter, Cosette, after losing her factory job. Alexandre Dumas (1824-1895), like many men, was familiar with the world of prostitution. He was in love with a courtesan, a woman named Marie Duplessis, about whom he would go to write a very popular novel, and then a play based on his experience with her called La Dame aux Camélias, (1848). Men of this time, as stated by Dumas, were born with the need for sexual promiscuity; women were not. He made many claims scorning women of the night.\\"Alexandre Dumas: Views on Women and Prostitution.\\" Mtholyoke. Accessed April 18, 2018. https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/courtesans/Alexandre- Dumas-view-on-wom&prost.htm; Charles Baudelaire believed that in many ways the poet resembled a prostitute because they sold their poetry, a part of themselves; to sell their works they were selling themselves. Essentially, the city of Paris revolved around a form of prostitution, consumerism. He believed that no one understood this more than the flâneur (an idler or lounger). Baudelaire claimed that prostitution was embedded in Paris and everything involved with it. === Édouard Manet: Olympia (1863) === Edouard Manet - OlympiaOn two occasions, Manet painted works which focused on prostitutes and caused great scandal when exhibited. According to T.J. Clark, during this time period, the issue of prostitution was brought into the center of society whereas in the past, it had been pushed to the outskirts. The divisions between the outskirts of society and what was acknowledged and accepted were not as clear as they had been. Édouard Manet's (1832-1883) Olympia (1863) attracted negative criticism unlike any other painting had before. Jean Ravenel's described the work as a The journalist Bonnin wrote the following in La France :\\"We prefer to think he [Manet] has made a mistake. And what is his aim? His canvases are too unfinished for us possibly to tell\\". The work was considered unfinished, like a sketch rather than a real painting.“Olympia” was the name preferred by prostitutes because it referred to La Dona Olympia, the main character of a book by Etienne Delécluze. As Clark notes, the work was found offensive because some people thought she was not a courtesan but a working class prostitute, making her class and place in society definitive and less of an abstract, floating idea. People also did not like this painting because of the lack of skill it seemingly portrayed on Manet's part. They objected particularly to the black outlines and yellowish skin tone present in the painting. Most art historians agree that Manet was challenging the romantic ideals of female nudity and prostitution that were previously held in society. By giving Olympia a completely disinterested expression on her face, the fact that prostitution is a job, unromantic and unenjoyable, for her, is emphasized. The painting itself was inspired by Titian's (1488-1576) Venus of Urbino (1534), but was seen as a crude, badly painted version of its highly esteemed academic predecessor. Many critics chose to ignore the similarities between the two works and viewed them as two totally separate and unrelated paintings.Edouard Manet Nana === Edouard Manet: Nana (1877) === In 1877, Edouard Manet created the painting Nana (1877). Due to its scandalous nature, Manet's painting was not included in the yearly Salon. The inspiration for this painting was the novel L'Assommoir (1876) by Émile Zola. The model for Nana was a Parisian, :fr:Henriette Hauser. The painting shows a young, beautiful woman standing in front of a mirror. She is not completely dressed: She is wearing only a short, sleeveless bodice, a slip, silk stockings, and high – heeled shoes. Henriette is in a dressing room called a boudoir and behind her is a settee. A gentlemen caller is seated behind her in a top hat, staring at her as she is turned to face the audience. Manet's painting of the courtesan created much controversy at the time. Society believed prostitutes to be submissive and weak.Wei, Billie. “Power to the Prostitute: Gender Subversion in Manet and Zola's Nana.” Medium, Medium, 31 Dec. 2015, medium.com/@billiewei/power-to-the-prostitute-gender-subversion-in-manet-and- zola-s-nana-1f717edf1c47. Nana's gaze challenged this notion. Just like in Manet's Olympia, she is staring back at the audience, challenging them. According to Billie Wei, the reversal of gender roles helped to make the painting so controversial. Wei also notes that Manet gives Nana power by painting her surroundings as an \\"extensions of her corporal being\\". Wei mentions how \\"the mirror faces her, the sofa's golden frame curves in parallel with the gentle roundness of her belly, and the blue of the painting behind her echoes the blue of her bodice.\\" The fact that she is at the center of the painting gives her more authority as she is the main character, the protagonist. This feature was scandalous. The fact that the prostitute has more power is made evident in the way the male figure is turned sideways, with only half of his body visible, giving him less significance in the piece. === Edgar Degas: Brothel Monotypes and other works === Edgar Degas' After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself (1890-1895) Edgar Degas's initial interest in prostitutes, in the years 1876–1890, started with his interest in Edmond de Goncourt's novel La Fille Elisa (1877). In 1876–77, Degas filled a sketchbook with illustrations from de Goncourt's novel depicting scenes of a girl who becomes a prostitute with her soldier lover. Following soon after, Degas began illustrating the Monotyping monotypes of brothel scenes, drawing the same physical type as the illustrations in his sketchbook. Although Degas drew individual prostitutes in a notebook, his actual monotypes were entire brothel scenes. Several scholars have tried to identify a literary source of Degas' fifty-some brothel monotypes, but none have found a direct connection. However, there have been parallels to Huysman's Marthe, histoire d'une fille (1876), and in Émile Zola's Nana (1880). Although the prostitution themes of the novels and of Degas' monotypes have similarities, there is a difference between the treatment of the subject; while Degas' prostitutes are \\"earthy, ugly creatures\\", the novelists tend to depict their prostitutes as more \\"heroic and noble\\". One of the more recently notable exhibitions that displayed several of Degas' monotypes was the Museum of Modern Art's \\"Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty\\" in 2016. \\"The exhibition includes approximately 120 rarely seen monotypes—along with some 60 related paintings, drawings, pastels, sketchbooks, and prints—that show Degas at his most modern, capturing the spirit of urban life; depicting the body in new and daring ways; liberating mark-making from tradition; and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction.\\" One of the works that was displayed in the exhibit, After the Bath III (1891–92), is a lithograph that illustrates a woman stepping out of a bath, similar to the work shown to the right. Critics have tried to interpret Degas' scenes involving prostitutes and understand them. On one hand, many argue that, \\"rather than being victims of an intrusive gaze or performers in a sexual economy, the women depicted in Degas' [bathing] works are simply alone and unobserved. The works... are depicted from a perspective, but that perspective is not relevant to the fictional content of the work\\". In other words, Degas \\"did not exhibit the customary male dominance and instead created images of women who are involved with their own bodies without regard for a male viewer\\". Female art critics that wrote about this and argued for this include Carol Armstrong, Norma Broude, Wendy Lesser and Eunice Lipton. On the contrary, authors such as Anthea Callen, Hollis Clayson and Heather Dawkins argue that Degas \\"embodied the dominant masculinity of his era\\". Specifically, Anthea Callen has argued that \\"all of Degas' Bathers imply a notional \\"keyhole\\" viewpoint such that the works become inscribed with the gaze of a male voyeur. Even in works that are structured so as to provide multiple perspectives or unusual angles on the principal subject in a way that calls into question the embodied viewpoint of a fictional observer, Callen suggests that the 'discursive significance' of such a point of view remains pivotal in understanding the works' sexual and social implications. For Callen, even though the works are not set up pornographically, the implied gaze of a male spectator intrudes on the scene and becomes central to comprehension of the works' content by the viewer.\\" Toulouse Lautrec The Medical Inspection === Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec: Elles and other works === Toulouse Lautrec was known for his famous paintings of prostitutes. He visited the Moulin Rouge and other cabarets in the district of Montmartre in Paris. He began by just sketching the women but then as time progressed, Lautrec started painting them as well. His paintings were more of a documentary of the life of these woman rather than objectifying them. La Toilette (1889) depicts a woman, probably a prostitute, sitting on the floor, surrounded by sheets who has either just finished bathing or is about to start. In The Sofa (1896) Lautrec shows two prostitutes resting on the couch; they are both wearing slips and look exhausted. This could show that they just finished working for a client, or that they are taking breaks between jobs.The Medical Inspection (1894) is a painting that depicts a reality many prostitutes faced; the dreaded medical inspections. Sexually transmitted diseases were common during this time because of the lack of contraceptives and knowledge about the results of unprotected sex. Toulouse Lautrec captured this phenomenon perfectly; he does not glamorize their profession. The two women are standing with their dresses pulled up as if they know what they are about to experience. == References == Category:Impressionism Impressionism Impressionism ","title":"Prostitution in Impressionist painting"},{"id":"56893465","text":"\\"Vstříc nekonečnům\\" is a song from the Katarze album of Czech pop music group Slza.

The model originated in the 1972 seminal paper, A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice, written by Michael D. Cohen, James G. March, and Johan P. Olsen. Organized anarchies are organizations, or decision situations (also known as choice opportunities), characterized by problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation. While some organizations (such as public, educational, and illegitimate organizations) are more frequently characterized by these traits of organized anarchy, the traits can be partially descriptive of any organization, part of the time. Within this context, of an organized anarchy view of organizational decision making, the garbage can model symbolizes the choice-opportunity/decision-situation (for example: a meeting where ideas are discussed and decided on) as a \\"garbage can\\" that participants are chaotically dumping problems and solutions into, as they are being generated. The \\"garbage can\\" term's significance is best understood by considering the manner in which items in a trash can are organized, which is a messy, chaotic mix. The model portrays problems, solutions, and participants/decision-makers as three independent \\"streams\\" that are each generated separately, and flow disconnected from each other. These three streams only meet when the fourth stream of choice opportunity arises, as a garbage can, for the streams to flow into. The mix of garbage (streams) in a single can (choice opportunity) depends on the mix of cans available, on the labels attached to each can, and on what garbage is currently being generated. The mix of garbage in a single can also depend on the speed at which the garbage is collected and removed from the scene, for example, how long before problems, solutions, and/or participants move on to other choice opportunities, or, depending on how long the current choice opportunity remains available. This anarchic view of decision making contrasts with traditional decision theory. == Organized anarchy == Organized anarchies can be characterized by a sense of chaos and dynamism. Problems and solutions are loosely coupled. Proposed solutions change during bargaining. All participants involved do not get the chance to fully participate, and have limitations on their time and energy. Many things happen at once, all competing with each other for attention. Amongst the confusion, participants try to make sense of their role in the organization. === General properties === The behavioral theory of organized anarchy views organizations, and/or decision-situations/choice-opportunities, as generally characterized by the three properties of problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation (detailed below). These properties of organized anarchy are characteristic of any organization in part, part of the time.  Problematic preferences  The organization has no clear preference or guidelines. It operates on the basis of a variety of inconsistent and ill-defined preferences, goals, and identities. The organization can be described more accurately as a loose collection of ideas, rather than as a coherent structure. Organizations discover their preferences through actions, more than actions are taken on the basis of preferences. It is unclear which problems matter, and which do not.  Unclear technology  The organization's processes are not understood by the organization's own members. The organization operates based on trial and error procedures, learning from accidents of past experiences, and pragmatic inventions of necessity. It is not clear what the consequences are for proposed solutions, or how to solve problems with solutions that lack evidence.  Fluid participation  Participants vary in how much time and effort they commit to different domains. Participant involvement also varies, depending on the time. Consequently, the boundaries of the organization are continuously uncertain and changing. Audiences and decision makers for any type of choice change suddenly and unpredictably. === Meaning making === Organizations can be viewed as vehicles for solving problems, or structures where conflict is resolved through bargaining. However, organizations also provide procedures through which participants gain an understanding of what they are doing and what they have done. Organizations, especially organized anarchies, may have difficulty creating their collective platform and identity. In situations of ambiguity, decision making moves away from ideas of reality, causality, and intentionality, to thoughts of meaning. Therefore, decisions become seen as vehicles for constructing meaningful interpretations of fundamentally confusing worlds, instead of outcomes produced by comprehensible environments. As the complexity of decision situations increase so that they more closely resemble reality, they become meaning generators instead of consequence generators. Hence, we understand organized anarchies as meaning makers that we need within organizations so that we can feel like we have reasons and identities for which to be present at the organization and to address many types of concerns, such as in meetings, where the issues may or may not be relevant to the existing topic of discussion. Within this perspective, an organization is a collection of choices seeking problems, issues and feelings seeking decision situations where they can be raised, solutions seeking issues to which they may be able to solve, and decision makers seeking out work. == The Garbage Can Model == Whereas the theory of organized anarchy provided a larger view to describe how organizations and decision situations function, the garbage can model focuses in on how decisions get made within these organized anarchies. The model details what elements are involved in the decision making process, how the outcomes are generated, and who/what is able to access this interaction. === Decision streams === The garbage can model views decisions as outcomes of four independent streams (detailed below) within organizations. Prior to the garbage can model, the decision process was imagined very differently, as visually displayed, based on references from the foundational literature, in the figures below. thumb490x490px\\"Although it may be convenient to imagine that choice opportunities lead first to the generation of decision alternatives, then to an examination of their consequences, then to an evaluation of those consequences in terms of objectives, and finally to a decision, this type of model is often a poor description of what actually happens.\\" Cohen, M. D., March, J. G., & Olsen, J. P. (1972). A garbage can model of organizational choice. Administrative Science Quarterly. 17(1) p. 3 thumb311x311px\\"In the garbage can model, on the other hand, a decision is an outcome or interpretation of several relatively independent streams within an organization.\\" Cohen, M. D., March, J. G., & Olsen, J. P. (1972). A garbage can model of organizational choice. Administrative Science Quarterly. 17(1) p. 3-4  Problems  Problems arise from people both inside and outside of the organization, and for many different reasons, all consuming attention. Examples may include family, career, distribution of status and money, or even current events in the media. These problems do not need to be real, or actually important, but only to be perceived as such by the decision makers.  Solutions  Solutions are an individual's or a collective's product. Examples may include ideas, bills, programs, and operating procedures. None of the solutions need to pertain to an existing problem. Instead, participants use the solutions generated to actively seek out problems that the solutions may be able to solve.  Participants  Participants have other demands on their time, and actively arrive to, and leave from, the decision making process. They may also have different preferences for different solutions.  Choice opportunities  Choice opportunities give the organizations chances to act in ways that can be called decisions. These opportunities occur regularly, and organizations are able to determine moments for choice. Examples may include the signing of contracts, hiring and firing employees, spending money, and assigning tasks. The first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, flow into the fourth stream of choice opportunities, and mix based on chance, timing, and who happens to be present. === The decision arena === While the first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, meet in the stream of choice opportunity (for example, a choice to hire a new employee), the decision/choice arena is the larger domain where all four of these streams meet. This arena can be the type of organization (government, school, university) or the greater setting in which this interaction is occurring. For example, a board or committee may be a choice arena, while the committee's annual elections may be a choice opportunity. Choice opportunities may also move between different choice arenas, such as a decision being passed between committees, or departments. === Decision outcomes === The outcomes of how the four streams mix in a choice arena can vary. Sometimes decisions are made. Other times no decisions are made. Still other times, decisions are made, but do not address the problem that they were meant to solve.  Resolution  Resolution occurs when the choices taken resolve the problem that was being addressed. This success occurs when problems arise in choice opportunities, and the decision makers present have the energy/ability to properly address the problems' demands.  Oversight  Oversight occurs when a decision is taken before the problem reaches it. This happens when choice opportunities arrive and no problems are attached to them. This may be due to problems being attached to other choice arenas at the moment. If there is sufficient energy available to make a choice quickly, participants will make the choice and move on before the relevant problem arrives.  Flight  Flight occurs when a decision is taken after the problem goes away. This happens when problems are attached to choice opportunities for a period of time and exceed the energy of their respective decision makers to stay focused on the problem. The original problem may then move to another choice arena. Examples are tabling, or sending decisions to subcommittees, where the problems may not get attached to solutions. === Early implications === The Fortran model simulations, used in the original paper, found that, most often, decisions are not made to resolve problems. Decision making processes were found to be very sensitive to variations in energy and time. Decision makers and problems were also found to seek each other out, and continue to find each other. Three key aspects of the efficiency of the decision process are problem activity, problem latency, and decision time. Problem activity is the amount of time unresolved problems are actively attached to choice situations. This is a rough measure of the potential for decision conflict in an organization. Problem latency is the amount of time problems spend activated but not linked to choices. Decision time is the persistence of choices. Good organizational structures would be assumed to keep problem activity and problem latency low by quickly solving problems with choices. Notably, this result was not observed in the garbage can model. The model's processes are very interactive, and some phenomena are dependent on specific combinations of other structures at play. Important problems were found more likely to be solved than unimportant ones, and important choices were less likely to solve problems than unimportant ones. == Model constraints == Access structures and deadlines provide limitations on what can enter into the garbage can model's processes. === Access Structure === thumb258x258px Democratic structures allow everyone to participate, but can also complicate the decision-making process. Access structures are the social boundaries that influence which persons, problems, and solutions are allowed access to the choice arena.  Unrestricted/democratic access  The loosest access structure, unrestricted/democratic access allows all problems, solutions, and people to enter. Any active problem has access to any active choice. This creates more energy, but also permits problems, solutions, and participants to interfere with each other. Conflict and time devoted to problems (anarchy) are increased. An example could be an open forum, town hall, or general body meeting.  Hierarchical access  Hierarchical structures, such as this chairpersons meeting, limit access to important actors. Hierarchical access gives priority entry to important actors, problems, and solutions. Both choices and problems are arranged in a hierarchy so that important problems (having low numbers) have access to many choices, and important choices (also having low numbers) are accessible to only important problems. An example could be making big decisions in an executive meeting/committee, while small decisions are left for the general population. thumb Specialized access allows experts, such as these climate scientists, to address issues that fit their expertise. 256x256px  Specialized access  Specialized access happens when only special problems and solutions can gain entry to certain meetings. Specific specialists have access to specific choices that fit their expertise. Each problem has access to only one choice and each choice is accessible to only two problems. Hence, choices specialize in the types of problems that can be connected to them. An example could be computer specialists in a technology committee addressing technical issues. === Deadlines === Deadlines characterize temporal boundaries, the timing of decision arenas and what flows access them. Constraints include arrival times of problems (seasonal or weather issues, such as a heat wave, or a blizzard), solutions (time delayed, for example by 1 or 5 year plans), participants (determined by the timing of business days, school semesters, etc.), and choice opportunities (for example, meetings based on budget cycles, or student admissions). Decisions arise from the constraints of access structures and deadlines interacting with the time-dependent flows of problems, solutions, and participants. == Origins of the garbage can model == While still a doctoral student at the University of Bergen in Norway, Johan P. Olsen came to the University of California, Irvine as a visiting scholar from 1968–1969. At that time, James G. March was both the Dean of the School of Social Sciences (1964–1969), and a professor of psychology and sociology at the University of California, Irvine (1964–1970). Coinciding with the time of Olsen's visit, and March's last year serving as a dean, Michael D. Cohen was a doctoral student at the University of California, Irvine, and was just beginning his work as a research assistant to March. All three scholars were present at the right time, to witness the university conduct a search process to hire a new dean. Ultimately, the search process ended with none of the potential candidates being chosen, and the head of the search committee taking the position of dean. During an interview, Olsen describes the chaotic decision-making process that he observed at the university throughout this search process, and how it served as a foundational experience for the three scholars to later collaborate and produce their model. Olsen explains in this interview how topics previously considered to be important to the decision making process, such as if the actors were reasonable or rational, actually proved to be less important, and were instead trumped by issues such as time constraints of the participants involved. An example provided was a professor being present in one meeting, only to be absent from the following meeting due to professional travel commitments, which can be common for university faculty. This prompted Olsen to consider a contextual model of decision making, one that examined the ability to make calculations and implement them, as opposed to models that focused on motivation. Olsen observed decision makers give each other head nods, and other non-verbal communication, in meetings, and noted the possible communication, or miscommunication this may have entailed. Olsen also highlighted how the search committee's decision-making process was affected by misinterpreting the silence of the current dean (March) regarding applicants as a sign for lack of support, when in fact this was not an accurate interpretation of the dean's preferences. Olsen, therefore, gained an interest to examine collective, as opposed to individual, decision making, and how routines and chance may affect the decision-making process. All of these factors would lead into the development of the garbage can model. By 1972, March, Cohen, and Olsen had all found their way from the University of California, Irvine to Stanford University, in the positions of professor, post-doctoral fellow, and visiting professor, respectively. That year, they published the seminal paper A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice. In this paper, the authors used version 5 of the programming language Fortran to translate their ideas into a computer simulation model of a garbage can decision making process. == Practical applications == The model enables choices to be made and problems resolved, even when an organization may be plagued by conflict, goal ambiguity, poorly understood problems that come and go, variable environments, and distracted decision makers. There are many situations where the garbage can process of decision making cannot be eliminated, and in some of these instances, such as research, or family, the garbage can process should not be eliminated. Knowing the characteristics of an organizational anarchy and a garbage can model can help people to properly identify when and where these phenomena exist, and approach them strategically. Understanding how these decision arenas operate provide tools to successfully manage what could otherwise be a problematic decision-making process. === Management styles === Organized anarchies can be managed, to use the garbage can model to your advantage. Three different management styles can be used, as detailed below.  Reformer  A reformer eliminates the chaotic garbage can elements from decisions. This creates greater order and control, which centralizes and rationalizes the organization.  Enthusiast  In contrast to the reformer, the enthusiast tries to discover a new vision of the decision making within garbage can processes. The enthusiast realizes that the planning is in large part symbolic, and is an excuse for participants to interact and generate meaning. It allows participants to feel a sense of belonging, and to learn about identities and views. Once the enthusiast understands that the decision arena is more for sense-making and observations, than for making decisions, temporal sorting can be used as a way to organize attention. The temporal order of topics presented can suggest what is of more concern for collective discussion. Flows of problems and solutions are viewed as a matching market, where energies and connections are mobilized. Assessing who is present, and where time and energy are sufficient, allows the enthusiasts to advance their case most effectively. Characteristics of the garbage can model that were seen by others as disadvantages, such as flexible implementation, uncoordinated action, and confusion, are viewed as advantages by the enthusiast.  Pragmatist  The pragmatist tries to exploit the anarchy inherent in the garbage can processes to further personal agendas. Timing can be manipulated to have solutions arrive when attention is low. The meeting can be arranged in an order that is personally favorable, where items that are desired to be discussed are placed at the top of the agenda, and items that need to be passed, in which discussion is not desired, are placed at the bottom of the agenda, so that the decision can be rushed through when there is not enough time for discussion. The pragmatist pays attention to fluctuations in interests and participant involvement, so that when certain individuals are not present, it can be easier to advance issues and solutions that may have otherwise been opposed by different participants. Initiatives that are entangled with other streams can be abandoned, and if an unfavorable topic arises, the system can be overloaded to protect the pragmatist's interests. This can be accomplished by bringing up different problems and solutions, which will slow the decision making process down and make it more complex. Other choice opportunities (meetings) can also be proposed to lure problems and participants away from choices that are of interest, in the process gaining time for the pragmatists to address the issues of their concern. == Multi-disciplinary impact == The garbage can model can be especially helpful in explaining all types of meetings where problems and solutions are fluidly discussed. The model fits well with almost any decentralized social system attempting to address issues, and the model is continuously finding its way into new domains. For example, across a sample of firms involved in hydrocarbon megaprojects, researchers found that problems given the most attention are different from those responsible for budget overruns, and that the attribution of reasons for these overruns differ between project owners and supply chain firms. These inconsistencies are addressed by the garbage can model. Also, trade fairs have been found to be organizational forms that have permeable, fluid participation, and diversified and spontaneous in terms of individual goals and actions, once again displaying traits characteristic of the model. Several fields such as higher education, the policy-government world, and academic research, are discussed further below. === Higher education === The American college or university is, in a way, a prototypical organized anarchy. Students constantly enter and leave the institution, and the faculty and staff working there for longer periods of time may have many competing demands on their attention and resources, such as course instruction, research, and conference travel. Different academic departments may prioritize different, and even competing, goals for the university. University senates, in particular, provide an opportunity to see the characteristics of organized anarchy and the garbage can model in action. These senates largely serve symbolic meaning making functions for participants to express themselves through their membership, commitment to professional values, and maintaining relationships. Often, committees that report to the senate take so long to work on their issue, due to constraints on participant time, or difficulty matching problems with solutions, that by the time the committee produces anything, the issue has already passed on. Hence, this provides an example for how the decision was already made, by the garbage can model's decision outcome of flight, where decisions are taken after problems have already gone away. The university senate is known for this latency. === Public policy === Government can be viewed as an organized anarchy. The actors (politicians) can consistently change with election cycles. There are multiple, often competing, preferences. Problems arise from current events, and can gain or lose focus based on media coverage. Policies may be proposed by think tanks or lobby groups, but these policies may not gain attention until the right situation arises that promotes their relevance. John W. Kingdon built on the ideas of organized anarchy to examine these dynamics in his \\"Multiple Streams Approach\\", adapted for the field of public policy Kingdon renamed some of the terms familiar in the garbage can model. Problems remain termed as problems, but solutions became renamed as policies, and participants were termed as politics. These streams converge, or, as Kingdon says, couple, in the policy window (choice opportunity). Ambiguity, competition, an imperfect selection process, actors having limited time, and decision-making processes being neither \\"comprehensively rational\\" nor linear, are several key elements of multiple streams approach that clearly reflect the general properties of organized anarchy. === Research in psychology === The research process in the field of social sciences, particularly in psychology, can be interpreted as an organized anarchy. The academic field of psychology is much more a loose collection of ideas and theories, rather than a coherent structure with a shared intellectual paradigm. Technologies used to conduct research may not be fully understood. Methods for analyzing data, or conducting research, are taken from other fields when the need arises. Participation in the research process is fluid, with some research being done by students, other research being done by professors who may publish one or a few articles and then not continue as a researcher, and other research being done by people who make the research process their life-long profession. Joanne Martin recognized these characteristics of organized anarchy, and applied an adapted version of the garbage can model to the psychological research process. Martin's model restyled the original model's four streams. Problems took the parameters of theoretical problems. Solutions were seen as the results of the research process. Choice opportunities were understood as the selection of which methodology to use for the research. Finally, the stream for participants was re-termed resources, to reflect that, unlike in organizational decision making, not only were actors required to move the decision/research process forward, but specific intellects and skill-sets could also be required, as well as financing, study subjects, and access to certain environments for conducting the research in. The garbage can model of the psychological research process describes how and why some research topics may go unaddressed, certain theoretical problems may be linked with only a single methodological approach, researchers may continue to work on the same issues throughout their careers, some methods may be seldom applied, and how and why the field may appear to make little progress at times. == Current use and future growth of the model == The garbage can model continues to appear in academic articles, textbooks, and the press, being applied across many diverse domains. Features of organized anarchy have increased in modern times, and many attempts have been made to contribute to the theoretical discourse of the garbage can model by extending it to include new components. For example, fluid participation, a key characteristic of organized anarchy, has greatly increased since the original model was formulated. Some recent research has sought to contribute to the theoretical discourse of the model, by finding leadership style to be a key predictor of decision structure in organized anarchy. Other recent research has found problems with the computer simulation model used in the original article by Cohen, March, and Olsen, suggesting that decision making styles have not been sufficiently analyzed. In 2012, the volume The Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice: Looking Forward at Forty was published, containing a collection of papers celebrating 40 years since the original article on the garbage can model was introduced. The papers collected in the volume present theories of organizational decision processes that build on the original garbage can model, at times adding new ideas to create a hybrid extension of the original, and at other times perhaps violating the original model's core assumptions, thereby proposing alternatives to the existing model. Some of these papers attempt to attach elements of economic reasoning based on rational action assumptions onto the model. Many of the volume's chapters address the problem of agency, to which the garbage can model offered a solution based on a temporal, instead of a consequential, ordering of organizational events. Some of the newer models that have been proposed make assumptions returning to a consequential view of decision making, as well as assuming that individual preferences may play a larger role in the process. The volume's papers collectively suggest that the next logical stage of evolution for the garbage can model may be to directly model complex network dependencies linking participants, solutions, problems, and choice opportunities, or overall, social processes, within organizations. Taken as a whole, the volume contributes to defining an intellectual agenda that may well extend far beyond the next forty years of organizational research. == References  External links == * Bell, S.

Stewart was inactive for five games (Weeks 9-13) after injuring his foot. Stewart lost his role as a starting cornerback to Ryan Smith during his absence and remained a backup for the last four games of the season. Stewart finished his rookie season in 2018 with 33 combined tackles (31 solo) and three pass deflections in 11 games and five starts. On August 6, 2020, Stewart was waived by the Buccaneers. ===Cleveland Browns=== Stewart was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Browns on August 8, 2020.

The musical is inspired by the 1995 album of the same name by Morissette. It premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 5, 2018, directed by Diane Paulus. The show began previews on Broadway in November 2019, and opened on December 5, 2019. At the 74th Tony Awards, Jagged Little Pill received 15 nominations, the most of any show of the ceremony. ==Background== In November 2013, it was revealed that a musical version of the album Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette was being adapted for the stage with composer Tom Kitt attached to arrange the orchestrations. A first workshop was expected to take place in 2014, however in 2015 Morissette revealed that the show was still in the early stages and had yet to be written. In May 2017, it was announced that the musical would receive its world premiere in May 2018, 23 years after the album was released. A reading took place in 2017, with Idina Menzel taking the part of Mary Jane. The first public performance of songs from the show took place in March 2018, at the American Repertory Theater Gala. The show has a book by Diablo Cody, with direction by Diane Paulus, choreography by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, set design by Riccardo Hernandez, costume design by Emily Rebholz, lighting design by Justin Townsend, and video design by Finn Ross. Music and lyrics are by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, with musical direction by Bryan Perri, sound design by Jonathan Deans and orchestration by Tom Kitt. In addition to music from the show's namesake album, Jagged Little Pill also features other songs from Morissette's catalog, including \\"Thank U\\", \\"That I Would Be Good\\", and \\"So Pure\\" from 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, \\"So Unsexy\\" and \\"Hands Clean\\" from 2002's Under Rug Swept, \\"Unprodigal Daughter\\" from 2002's Feast on Scraps, \\"No\\" from the Japanese edition of 2012's Havoc and Bright Lights and \\"Uninvited\\" from the soundtrack of the 1998 film City of Angels. Morissette also wrote two new songs for the musical, \\"Smiling\\" and \\"Predator\\", with the former being included as the second single from her ninth studio album Such Pretty Forks in the Road. ==Plot summary== Inspired by the themes and emotions from Morissette's album, the musical Jagged Little Pill deals with pain, healing, and empowerment. Act I Mary Jane Healy, or MJ for short, is a mother who is writing the yearly family Christmas letter, which is her way of bragging about her seemingly perfect family. She writes about her husband Steve's job promotion, her daughter Frankie's art, and her son Nick's early admission to Harvard University. MJ writes that she got into a car crash, but is healing with the help of natural remedies, like hot yoga. What she doesn't write is that Steve is addicted to pornography, Frankie is making out with her best friend, Jo, as this letter is being written, and MJ is addicted to the painkillers from the car accident (\\"Right Through You\\"). One morning before breakfast, Steve complains about MJ's refusal to be intimate. At breakfast, MJ reprimands Frankie for wearing revealing shorts. Frankie is mad that they noticed her shorts, but not her sign for a protest she organized. MJ pressures Nick to be perfect to keep up the family's image (\\"All I Really Want\\"). At school, Nick's friends congratulate him on his acceptance to Harvard and tell him that he should come to a party that night to celebrate. Frankie and Jo discuss how their mothers don't understand or accept them: Frankie's because of her disapproval of her self expression and Jo's mom not accepting her being gay or her gender expression (\\"Hand in My Pocket\\"). MJ goes to a pharmacy to get a refill on her prescription for her painkillers. The pharmacist says that she needs a new prescription in order for them to fill it. MJ then calls a drug dealer to get her the painkillers instead. MJ moves through her day backwards, starting with getting the drugs in the alley, then doing her daily activities, and ending with her running out of the pills at the beginning of the day (\\"Smiling\\"). On the last day of Frankie's English class before winter break, she reads a short story she wrote aloud in a writer's workshop for her class to critique. The students in the class interrupt and criticize her for stating that the things she claims to be ironic in her piece are not actually ironic, just bad things that happened to someone. A new student, Phoenix, defends Frankie and encourages her to finish (\\"Ironic\\"). A romantic attraction begins between the two, and Phoenix states that he is single. After class, Phoenix and Frankie decide to go to the party that night. At home, Steve calls MJ to say that he is stuck at work. MJ and Steve get into an argument. Steve says he wants to see a marriage counselor, yet MJ refuses (\\"So Unsexy\\"). Nick comforts MJ after the fight. MJ claims that Nick is the only thing that she has ever done right. MJ asks Nick to watch a movie with her. He tells her that he is going to a party with Frankie. MJ claims that parties are 'not his scene' but still encourages him to go, and Nick reflects on the pressures of him from his mother to be perfect (\\"Perfect\\"). Frankie and Nick go to the party (\\"Lancer's Party (So Pure)\\"). Frankie and Phoenix find each other and leave the crowded party to talk alone, and they discuss their imperfect family lives. Frankie feels like her black identity is being erased by her adoptive white family. Phoenix's dad left when he was young and never calls, and Phoenix has to help his mom take care of his sister with a medical condition. Meanwhile, Jo couldn't attend the party because her mom forced her to go to a church function. Jo is scolded by her mom and church for being gay and not dressing femininely enough (\\"That I Would Be Good\\"). Phoenix asks Frankie if she has a boyfriend, and she says that she doesn't. The next morning at school, Jo and Frankie discuss how both of their nights were not fun and didn't go as planned. Jo brings up Phoenix and his crush on Frankie, but Frankie brushes it off and doesn't mention her talk with him at the party. Jo shows Frankie pictures that are circulating throughout the school of Bella, Nick's friend, who was drunk, passed out, and had her shirt pulled up at the party. Students are making fun of Bella and calling her a slut. Frankie and Jo go to Bella's house, despite barely knowing her, to check on her. Bella reveals that Andrew, Nick's best friend, was the one who took the pictures and raped her, but no one believes her. Frankie and Jo tell Bella they believe her. Frankie goes home and wakes Nick up to reprimand him about not going to the police because he was the only witness of Bella at the party. Nick brushes off Bella's claim, saying that she was drunk and being dramatic per usual. MJ overhears the conversation and insists that Nick can't come forward as it might ruin his reputation. MJ blames Bella for what happened, saying that this situation is super common, but she is visibly upset by the story and leaves the house to get some air (\\"Wake Up\\"). MJ walks to the church for the first time in a while to pray about her failing marriage, struggling relationship with Frankie, and for help with her addiction. She then reflects on her own memory of being raped in college, but blames herself and feels it was God's plan for her (\\"Forgiven\\"). Act II Steve finally convinces MJ to go to their first marriage counseling session, despite her reluctance (\\"Not the Doctor\\"). Steve reveals that he and MJ have not had sex for over a year. MJ says that they don't need sex since Steve is constantly watching porn. The therapist wonders if MJ's car accident may have triggered memories of past sexual trauma, but MJ insists she does not have any sexual trauma. Steve states that he appreciates MJ for all she does for him and the family, and he tells her that he misses her and the way they used to be. Meanwhile, Frankie and Phoenix sing to each other and end up sleeping together (\\"Head over Feet\\"). Jo walks into the Healy's house uninvited (\\"Your House\\") and walks in on Frankie and Phoenix. Jo gets mad and storms out of the house. On her way out, she runs into MJ and Steve fighting while coming home from therapy. Jo tells them that Frankie just had sex with Phoenix. Phoenix leaves quickly, leaving Frankie alone with her parents. MJ and Steve reprimand her for having sex so young. Frankie comes out to her parents as bisexual, and she gets mad at her parents for being disapproving of her consensual sex while they don't care about Bella's rape. Frankie says that she's not actually their daughter since she was adopted and blames her parents for only seeing her as who they want her to be, not who she really is. Frankie decides to run away to New York City. Steve and MJ get into another fight about Steve not being present during Frankie's childhood. Frankie takes a train alone to New York (\\"Unprodigal Daughter\\"). When she gets lost in the city, Frankie calls Phoenix. She tells him that she loves him and that he should come pick her up. When Phoenix doesn't say 'I love you' back and that he needs to stay at home to help his sister with her malfunctioning feeding tube, Frankie gets angry and feels that Phoenix only wants her for her body. Students are gossiping about Bella and her accusations against Andrew. Bella comes to the Healy's house to talk to Nick, but the only person home is MJ. MJ tries to comfort Bella by telling her she was also raped in college and they need to be strong, but when Bella asks MJ when she started to feel better, MJ becomes upset and is unable to answer. After Bella leaves, Nick tells MJ the entirety of what happened that night. He was in the room when Bella was unconscious and raped, but he did nothing (\\"Predator\\"). Nick tells his mom that he wants to go to the police, but MJ says that it would only ruin his life and not help Bella's. MJ is devastated and furious, but Nick accuses her of only caring about herself and her reputation, and not about Bella. MJ hits him. Jo comes to New York to pick up Frankie after Frankie desperately calls her, lost and out of money. She shows little remorse about sleeping with Phoenix since she didn't think her relationship with Jo was exclusive. She tells Jo that she fell in love with Phoenix. Jo says that Frankie would have told her about Phoenix if she didn't know it was wrong. Jo ends the relationship (\\"You Oughta Know\\"). Frankie gets a call that something is wrong with MJ. At home, MJ overdoses on her pills, and Steve and Nick find her unconscious (\\"Uninvited\\"). When Steve gets to the hospital, he is devastated that he didn't know MJ had an addiction and begins to take care of her, promising her he will be there for her from now on (\\"Mary Jane\\"). They both agree to start to truly try to work on their marriage and help each other heal. When Nick gets to the hospital, MJ tells him that he should go to the police because justice for Bella is more important than her reputation, but Nick already went to the police. Meanwhile, many students attend the rally that Frankie organized for Bella. Bella is mad at Nick since people only believed her once Nick came forward, and her statement wasn't enough (\\"No\\"). A year has passed, and MJ is writing the yearly Healy Christmas letter. She writes about Frankie's passion for social justice and her dedication to helping Bella. MJ opens up about having been a victim of sexual assault as well. Bella is finally going to tell her side of the story in court. MJ and Frankie reconcile after MJ overcomes her addiction. MJ tells Frankie that she wanted her to feel like every other kid and not be treated differently because of her race, but Frankie tells her that she will always be different (\\"Thank U\\"). Nick is taking a year off before college to find himself. MJ discusses that she and Steve are in therapy, both individually and together. She opens up about her overdose and treatment for her addiction to painkillers, but she has learned to see how kind the people in her life truly are. Frankie dares MJ to email the Christmas letter to everyone, and MJ sends it. She decides that this will be her last Christmas letter. Jo and Frankie rekindle their friendship, and Jo has a new girlfriend. Frankie and Phoenix are now just friends (\\"You Learn\\"). == Productions  Cambridge (2018) === Jagged Little Pill ran from May 5 to July 15, 2018, at the Loeb Drama Center, within the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

It began previews at the Broadhurst Theatre on November 3 and opened on December 5, 2019.Peikert, Mark. \\" 'Jagged Little Pill' Announces Broadway Dates\\" Playbill, May 3, 2019 ==Critical reception Cambridge production === The New York Times called the Cambridge production \\"[p]assionate, dramatically compelling, and big- hearted...Jagged Little Pill breaks the jukebox musical mold, and takes on the good work we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about real things.\\" In a New York Times feature story published on May 20, 2018, the show's story, \\"steeped in hot-button issues like opiate addiction, gender identity and sexual assault\\", was described as being \\"very much of the present, and may just be the most woke musical since Hair.\\" Bob Verini of Variety wrote, \\"Not since Rent has a musical invested so many bravura roles with so much individual life...It's a risky business, making a musical not from a story demanding to be told but from a set of songs merely available to be used. Jagged Little Pill triumphantly avoids the pitfalls. Always engaging, often moving and even rousing, the show boasts dramatic interest and integrity on its own theatrical terms, courtesy of director Diane Paulus, first-time librettist Diablo Cody, and that peerless, soulful balladeer of the modern Western condition, Alanis Morissette.\\" === Broadway === The Broadway production of Jagged Little Pill opened to positive reviews. The New York Times described the musical as “redemptive, rousing and real… Jagged Little Pill stands alongside the original musicals that have been sustaining the best hopes of Broadway.” Praising the show's score, Variety wrote, \\"Morissette’s youthful perspective and the rocking-good score make Jagged Little Pill feel very much of the moment.\\" Rolling Stone awarded the production four out of five stars, writing that although the show feels \\"overly 'woke'\\" at times and \\"wears its earnestness on its sleeve,\\" Jagged Little Pill burns with passion...and enthusiastic beauty.” ==Musical numbers== All lyrics by Alanis Morissette.

It was released on May 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch, February 24, 2019 for macOS and Linux, May 10, 2019 for PlayStation 4 in the US, and May 30, 2019 for PlayStation 4 in Europe, Russia and Australia. It was also released on June 30, 2020 for Stadia. In this game, players move a colorful shape to the beat of background music and dodge pink shapes. == Gameplay == Up to four players each control one big shape surviving attacks simply by dodging against a variety of attacks, such as huge beams, bouncing hills, snake-like spirals, and pulsating shapes. These attacks appear, move, and attack in rhythm to the music, with difficulty increasing the further players progress. The rhythm visually manifests on-screen as all manner of objects, of different patterns and sizes, distinguishable by their pink color, that must be dodged until the track ends. Getting struck by one of these attacks causes the player to lose part of their shape, represented by either a cyan square, a yellow triangle, a green pentagon or an orange circle, if there are multiple players. If the shape breaks entirely, the game rewinds to the previous checkpoint. Three breaks within a single level results in a Game Over screen, with the text stating \\"It's Over\\" and the cyan square breaking down to pieces. Tapping Enter (PC/Steam), A (Switch), or the Cross button (PS4) multiple times causes the square to fix itself and changes the screen's text to read \\"It's NOT Over\\", allowing the player to continue from the beginning of the level. Hardcore mode was added in 2019, which adds the harder versions of all available levels. Just Shapes & Beats offers multiple modes that feature variations on the basic gameplay, such as party mode, playlist, challenge run, and a story mode. == Development == The first demo of the game was revealed at PAX 2016 and was supposed to be released that summer. During the event, release date was delayed from late 2016 to early 2017. The game was eventually delayed again, with a launch date of summer 2018. On March 20, 2018, it was announced that the game would also receive a release on the Nintendo Switch. == Reception == On review aggregator Metacritic, Just Shapes & Beats has received 83/100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" === Accolades=== * PAX Prime, 2014 ** Indie Megabooth Alumni * PAX East, 2015 ** Indie Megabooth Alumni ** SideQuesting Team Choice Award ** Destructoid Best of PAX * Golden Joystick Awards, 2018 ** Best Audio Design ** Best Indie Game * Independent Games Festival Awards, 2018 ** Excellence in Visual Art == References == Category:Action video games Category:2018 video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games Category:Mac OS games Category:Linux games Category:Music video games Category:Indie video games Category:Stadia games ","title":"Just Shapes &amp; Beats"},{"id":"56893591","text":"Dilbar Abdurahmonova (1 May 1936 – 20 March 2018) was a Russian-born Uzbekistani violinist and conductor.

Gameplay involved a player draft (not to be confused with the drafting format of CCGs) and chose one of eight offensive or defensive plays. Each player would then draw a card and the color denoted on that card would determine the final result of the play. The game was criticized for being \\"tedious and repetitive, and the actual players you used only rarely made a difference.\\" Once you had players with high ratings there was no reason to use players with lower ratings, except in your play deck. ==References== Category:Collectible card games Category:Card games introduced in 1995 ","title":"Red Zone (card game)"},{"id":"56893725","text":"Victor Hugo Ascarrunz Jr. (born 22 December 1960) is a Bolivian alpine skier.

This document made clear that \\"legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour... but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity.\\" Catholic legislators were instructed that supporting such recognition would be \\"gravely immoral,\\" and that they must do all they could do actively oppose it, bearing in mind that \\"the approval or legalisation of evil is something far different from the toleration of evil\\". The document said that allowing children to be adopted by people living in homosexual union would actually mean doing violence to them, and stated: \\"There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family. Marriage is holy, while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law.\\" In October 2015, bishops attending the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome agreed a final document which reiterated that while homosexuals should not be discriminated against unjustly, the Church was clear that same-sex marriage is \\"not even remotely analogous\\" to heterosexual marriage. They also argued that local churches should not face pressure to recognise or support legislation that introduces same-sex marriage, nor should international bodies put conditions on financial aid to developing countries to force the introduction of laws that establish same-sex marriage. ==North AmericaCanada=== In July 2003, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Canada, the country's plurality religion, protested the Chrétien government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. The church criticisms were accompanied by Vatican claims that Catholic politicians should vote according to their personal beliefs rather than the policy of the government. In late 2004, Frederick Henry, Bishop of Calgary, wrote a pastoral letter saying \\"Since homosexuality, adultery, prostitution and pornography undermine the foundations of the family, the basis of society, then the State must use its coercive power to proscribe or curtail them in the interests of the common good.\\" ===United States=== In the United States, the leadership of the Catholic Church has taken an active and financial role in political campaigns across all states regarding same-sex marriage. Human Rights Campaign said that the church spent nearly $2 million in 2012 toward unsuccessful campaigns against gay marriage in four states, representing a significant share of the contributions used to fund anti-gay marriage campaigns. A 2012 Pew Research Center poll indicated that Catholics in the United States who generally support gay marriage outnumber those who oppose it at 52 percent to 37 percent. In 2004, George Hugh Niederauer, as Bishop of Salt Lake City, who opposed same-sex marriage, spoke against a proposal to include a ban against it in the Utah state constitution, saying that prohibition by law was sufficient. But in 2008, as Archbishop of San Francisco, he campaigned in favor of California's Proposition 8, a ballot measure to constitutionally recognize heterosexual marriage as the only valid marriage within California. Campaign finance records show he personally gave at least $6,000 to back the voter-approved ban and was instrumental in raising $1.5 million to put the proposition on the ballot. Subsequently, he called for an amendment to the US Constitution as \\"the only remedy in law against judicial activism\\" following the striking down of a number of state same-sex marriage bans by federal judges. In 2012, Catholic bishops in Washington state issued pastoral statements and DVDs articulating the Catholic vision of marriage and urging parishioners to support efforts to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman in Referendum 74. In 2010, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) clarified the criteria for the funding of community development programs by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development. One criterion was exclusion of organizations advancing activities that run counter to Catholic teaching, examples of which included those that support or promote same-sex marriage. In 2016, the President of the national bishops' conference denounced US Vice President Joe Biden for officiating at the wedding of a same-sex couple, arguing that Catholic politicians should only do what is expressly in line with Catholic Church teaching. Thomas Paprocki, Bishop of Springfield, Illinois, said Catholic politicians who have been involved in making gay marriage legal should not present themselves for Holy Communion until they go to confession. He also said that there should be no Communion for people in a same-sex union. Paprocki and Bishop Robert Morlino of Madison, Wisconsin, have instructed priests not to allow church funerals for those in same-sex marriages or unions to avoid giving the appearance that the Church approved of such unions. ==Europe== The First same-sex marriage in Spain officially took place in 1901 between Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa Sanchez Loriga and was held in the Catholic Church of St.Jorge; but without the evident awareness of the priest. Catholic Church figures have also criticized attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in Europe. Pope John Paul II criticized same-sex marriage when it was introduced in the Netherlands in 2001. In Spain and Portugal, Catholic leaders led the opposition to same-sex marriage, urging their followers to vote against it or to refuse to implement the marriages should they become legal. In May 2010, during an official visit to Portugal four days before the ratification of the law, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed his opposition by describing it as \\"insidious and dangerous.\\" In 2010 in Ireland, Sean Brady, the Archbishop of Armagh, unsuccessfully asked Irish Catholics to resist government proposals for same-sex civil partnerships, and the Irish episcopal conference said that they discriminated against people in non-sexual relationships. In April 2013, when the legalization of same-sex marriage was being discussed, the Irish Bishops Conference stated in their submission to a constitutional convention that, if the civil definition of marriage was changed to include same-sex marriage, so that it differed from the church's own definition, they could no longer perform civil functions at weddings. In the predominantly Catholic countries of Italy and Croatia, the Catholic Church has been the main opponent to either the introduction of civil unions or marriage for same-sex-couples. In July 2013, 750,000 petition signatures were collected by the conservative group \\"In the Name of the Family\\", strongly supported by Catholic church leaders. This directly led to the 2013 referendum whereby the constitution was amended to state that marriage is only a union between a man and a woman. In February 2016 the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, rejected the Catholic Church's interference in a parliamentary debate to introduce civil unions and adoption rights for same-sex partners. This followed Bagnasco's (Archbishop of Genoa) attempt to get the Italian Senate to carry out a secret ballot in the hope it would make it easier for lawmakers to follow their conscience, rather than the party line. Bagnasco had compared the idea of recognizing same-sex unions directly with state recognition for incest and pedophilia. Likewise in Slovenia, the Archbishop of Ljubljana, Stanislav Zore, publicly gave his support to establish a referendum vote aimed at changing the country's constitution so that marriage would be defined as being between a man and a woman. The referendum was subsequently passed and the earlier legislative vote to legalise same-sex marriage was nullified. In January 2013, Catholic bishops publicly thanked members of parliament in Poland for voting down a bill which would have permitted same-sex civil partnerships. In response to the legalisation of gay marriage in Austria in 2017, the president of the Austrian bishop's conference, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn denounced the move, arguing that marriage is a male-female relationship intended for \\"producing, nurturing and raising children, thus ensuring the succession of generations.\\" ==South America== In response to efforts to introduce same-sex marriage in Uruguay in 2013, Pablo Galimberti, the Bishop of Salto, on behalf of the Uruguayan Bishops Council, said that marriage was \\"an institution that is already so injured\\" and that the proposed law would \\"confuse more than clarify\\". The proposal nevertheless became law, with strong public support. ==Africa== In Cameroon, Victor Tonye Bakot, the Archbishop of Yaounde, reflected a particularly hostile attitude by the Church in Cameroon, with such interventions prompting the national press to allege the existence of a homosexual \\"mafia\\" with a witch-hunt against prominent individuals. In 2013 and 2016, the National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon followed this up by issuing a public statement urging \\"all believers and people of good will\\" to oppose gay marriage and the decriminalization of homosexuality. In 2014, the Catholic Bishops Conference in Nigeria welcomed legislation passed by the government to make participation in a same-sex marriage a crime punishable by 14 years imprisonment. It noted the move as a \\"courageous act\\" and a \\"step in the right direction\\". The Archbishop of Jos, Ignatius Ayau Kaigama, argued that the action was \\"in line with the moral and ethical values of the Nigerian and African cultures\\", and blessed President Goodluck Jonathan in not bowing to international pressure.Catholic church also had a strong opposition against lgbt rights in many christian majority countries like Kenya, Zambia, Angola, Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, and the Central African Republic. ==Asia== In the Philippines, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines has been increasingly vocal in its opposition to legal recognition of same-sex relationships, coinciding with a legal challenge to the ban on same-sex marriage in the Family Code being raised in the Philippines Supreme Court. In August 2015, Archbishop Socrates Villegas told Filipino Catholics that they \\"cannot participate in any way or even attend religious or legal ceremonies that celebrate and legitimize homosexual unions\\". In Hong Kong, Cardinal John Tong Hon, has used pastoral letters on two occasions to criticise proposals to legislate for same-sex marriage, most recently in 2015. He urged Catholics to consider this when voting in the district council elections. Several pan- democratic parties criticised Tong's remarks. ==Australia== In 2015, the Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, with the support of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference distributed a booklet to 12,000 families with children in Catholic schools across Tasmania entitled \\"Don't Mess With Marriage\\" - describing relationships between gay couples as \\"pretended marriage\\". Porteous was subsequently referred to the Australian Anti- Discrimination Commissioner. The complaint was withdrawn without a finding. Several Australian bishops publicly supported the \\"no\\" vote in the referendum on gay marriage. In August 2017, Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher argued that religious schools, charities, and hospitals could be coerced to comply with the \\"new view of marriage\\" if the majority of Australians opted for a change in legislation, raising fears that teachers would not be free to follow the traditional church teaching on marriage, but instead be forced to teach a more 'politically correct' curriculum. He went on to claim that religious believers would be vulnerable to discrimination suits and could even lose their jobs if same-sex marriage were to be legalised. The Archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, also intervened in the referendum debate to say that the state should be allowed to restrict who can marry, such as prohibitions on incest. He said that like love shared between family members, love shared between gay people \\"is love and it is valuable but it’s not and it can’t be the kind of love that we call marriage.\\" ==Civil unions== Former Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Carlo Maria Martini said: \\"I disagree with the positions of those in the Church, that take issue with civil unions ...[but] the homosexual couple, as such, can never be totally equated to a marriage.\\" There has been some dissent expressed in recent years by senior and notable figures in the Catholic Church on whether support should be given for homosexual civil unions. The insistence of Bishop Jacques Gaillot to preach a message about homosexuality contrary to that of the official church teaching is largely considered to be one of the factors that led to him being removed from his See of Evraux, France, in 1995. While bishop he had blessed a homosexual union in a \\"service of welcoming\\", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS. In his book Credere e conoscere, published shortly before his death, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the former Archbishop of Milan, supported civil unions, though stated they could not be considered the equivalent of heterosexual marriages. He also said he understood the need for gay self-affirmation. Cardinal Ruben Salazar Gomez of Bogota and Archbishop Piero Marini have both expressed support for civil unions. German cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode have both opined that the blessing of same-sex unions would be possible in Catholic churches in Germany. In Austria the blessing of same sex unions are allowed in at least two churches, both located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz. In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen in Germany, five same-sex unions received a blessing from the local priest in the German town of Mönchengladbach. Additionally, in 2007, one same-sex union received a blessing in the German town of Wetzlar in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. A blessing of a same-sex union, equivalent to marriage except name, was made by a Catholic Dominican priest in Malta in 2015. He was not publicly censured by his local bishop. Cardinal Rainer Woelki, the Archbishop of Berlin, and the Archbishop of Hamburg, Stefan Heße, have both noted the values of fidelity and reliability found in gay relationships. At the 2015 Synod of Bishops in Rome, Cardinal Reinhard Marx urged his fellow bishops that \\"We must make it clear that we do not only judge people according to their sexual orientation ... If a same-sex couple are faithful, care for one another and intend to stay together for life God won't say 'All that doesn't interest me, I'm only interested in your sexual orientation. Over 260 Catholic theologians, particularly from Germany, Switzerland and Austria, signed in January and February 2011 a memorandum, called Church 2011, which said that the Church's esteem for marriage and celibacy \\"does not require the exclusion of people who responsibly live out love, faithfulness, and mutual care in same-sex partnerships or in a remarriage after divorce\\". ==References== Category:Criticism of the Catholic Church Category:Catholic theology of the body Category:Same-sex marriage ","title":"Catholic Church and gay marriage"},{"id":"56893885","text":"Ricardo Klenk (born 29 September 1961) is an Argentine alpine skier.

In 1954, he became its secretary-treasurer. ==Union activities== Under Bramlet's leadership, the Culinary Workers Union Local grew from 1,500 members to 22,000 at the time of his death. Bramlet was known for his aggressive efforts in organizing workers. In 1958, he tried to get the owner of the Alpine Village Restaurant to let the workers unionize. When the owner refused, the union picketed the restaurant for almost twenty years. The Culinary Workers Union initiated a strike against Downtown Las Vegas hotel-casino owners in 1967, which closed 12 hotels and lasted for six days. A strike against hotels on the Las Vegas Strip in 1970 lasted for four days. In 1976, the Culinary Workers Union, along with three other unions, held a strike lasting 15 days against 15 large hotel-casinos in Las Vegas. Twelve of the hotel-casinos closed down during the strike. Bramlet had various disputes with the parent union, Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE), which had connections with the Chicago Outfit.Edward Hanley, 67, Longtime Labor Leader New York Times January 16, 2000 Edward T. Hanley, president of HERE, tried to get control of the local's union health and welfare funds.

UPI September 27, 1982 Spilotro also tried to get the union to enroll in a mob-controlled dental plan. In December 1975, two bombs exploded on the roof of the Alpine Village Restaurant. In January 1976, a bomb exploded at David's Place, a nonunion restaurant in Las Vegas. In January 1977, unexploded bombs were discovered in cars outside the Village Pub and the Starboard Tack restaurant. ==Death== On February 24, 1977, Bramlet was kidnapped at McCarran International Airport by Tom Hanley, his son Gramby Hanley, and Clem Eugene Vaughn. Three weeks after Bramlet disappeared, two hikers discovered Bramlet's body in the desert near Potosi Mountain (Nevada). He had been shot six times, including once in each ear. Gramby Hanley and Tom Hanley were arrested and pleaded guilty to Bramlet's murder and received life sentences. Clem Eugene Vaughn testified against the Hanleys and received a lesser sentence. The Hanleys said that Bramlet had refused to pay them a $10,000 fee for the attempted bombings of the Village Pub and the Starboard Tack restaurant because the bombs had failed to go off. While they kidnapped Bramlet, they tried to get him to send $10,000 to Binion's Horseshoe Casino; however, the money was never picked up. Tom Hanley died in 1979 while in federal custody. Gramby Hanley entered the United States Federal Witness Protection Program in prison, after giving testimony regarding the bombings and union activities. ==Afterwards== In March 1977, the United States Department of Labor took control away from the trustees of the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust, which was the pension fund for Culinary Workers Local 226 and the local bartenders union. The Department of Labor said that this was because the pension fund had made unsafe loans, primarily to Morris Shenker, totaling over 60% of the fund's assets.Labor Dept.

The type and only species, Tratayenia rosalesi, was described in March 2018. Tratayenia can be distinguished from other megaraptorans on the basis of three autapomorphies (unique derived features) of the front portion of each dorsal vertebra, as well as a single autapomorphy of the sacrum. Tratayenia is the youngest known genus of megaraptoran, having lived only about 83 million years ago. ==Discovery and naming== The holotype consists of a well-preserved partial skeleton, MUCPv 1162, which includes several articulated portions of the backbone. One portion of the skeleton is a string of five dorsal vertebrae, likely the seventh to eleventh dorsals. The largest articulated portion of the skeleton is a string of vertebrae including the last two dorsals as well as the five sacrals and much of the right ilium. Other preserved bones include two partial dorsal ribs and fragments of the pubis and ischium. This skeleton was first discovered in 2006 at a Bajo de la Carpa Formation fossil site by Universidad Nacional del Comahue technician Diego Rosales. Shortly thereafter it was excavated by UNC paleontologist Juan D. Porfifi. Porfiri and his colleagues published a preliminary report on the new dinosaur in a 2008 abstract, and suggested that it may have been a relative of Carcharodontosauridae. In 2018, the new taxon was described with the generic name Tratayenia, named after Tratayén, the fossil site at which it was excavated. The specific name Tratayenia rosalesi honors Diego Rosales. ==Description== Tratayenia was a medium-sized megaraptoran, growing up to long. It was closely related to genera such as Megaraptor, Australovenator, and Murusraptor. Like most other megaraptorans, it probably had large claws on its hands for use in hunting prey. Analysis of the Baja de la Carpa indicates that Tratayenia may have been geologically the youngest megaraptoran yet discovered. Tratayenia is also the largest-bodied carnivorous animal named from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation, reinforcing the hypothesis that megaraptorids were apex predators in southern South America from the Turonian through the Santonian or early Campanian, following the extinction of carcharodontosaurids. === Dorsal vertebrae === The dorsal vertebrae were tall and narrow, with large pits known as pleurocoels on the side of their centra (spool-shaped main portion). These features are common in the vertebrae of large carnivorous theropods. Some of the vertebrae had fragments of bone in the pleurocoels, which were likely remnants of thin bony walls known as septa which divided the pits. Septa are also known in other megaraptorans and carcharodontosaurids. The neural arches of the vertebrae are taller and narrower in Tratayenia than in most other theropods. The tubular transverse processes (rib facets) project upwards and to the side. A large and deep excavation is located directly below each transverse process, bounded from the front and rear by thin laminae (ridges). The front edge is formed by the paradiapophyseal lamina and the rear edge is formed by the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina. These features are also known in the megaraptoran Murusraptor. The prezygapophyses (front vertebral joint plates) are rectangular when see from the side, with the front and lower edges converging at nearly a right angle. This is an autapomorphy (unique adaptation) of Tratayenia. A ridge known as a prezygodiapophyseal lamina connects the prezygapophyses to the transverse processes. Another autapomorphy of Tratayenia is that the prezygodiapophyseal lamina is parallel to the paradiapophyseal lamina. Other theropods either have a weakly developed (or absent) paradiapophyseal lamina, or one which is angled relative to the prezygodiapophyseal lamina. The front edge of each vertebra has a third autapomorphy, related to two pairs of laminae (four total) connecting the prezygapophyses to the neural spines. At the base of the neural spines, the two laminae comprising each pair are very close together. But as the laminae get closer to the prezygapophyses, they diverge into a shape akin to an inverted Y. There are two of these inverted Y-like structures visible from the front, for both the left and right sides of a vertebra. The postzygapophyses (rear vertebral joint plates) are more typical in shape, and the rear edge of each vertebra has a small, blade-like hyposphene which splits into three ridges from below. The neural spines are tall and rectangular when seen from the side, and uniformly thin when seen from the front. Most are completely vertically, but one of the dorsal vertebrae preserved near the hip slightly inclines forward as in various allosauroids. Preserved rib fragments are curved and hollow. They connected to the vertebrae by means of two distinct condyles, separated by a large opening which may have been continuous with the inner cavity. === Sacrum and hip === Tratayenia has five sacral (hip) vertebrae, as is the norm for theropods. They are very similar to the dorsal vertebrae in various aspects, such as the presence of large pleurocoels, tall and narrow centra, and laminae-bound excavations below the transverse processes. However, they only have a single autapomorphy: the anteroposterior (front-to-back) width of the neural spine increases drastically in the second to fifth sacral vertebrae compared to the first vertebra. In fact, the fifth sacral's neural spine is twice as long anteroposteriorly than that of the first. This trait has also been observed in Tyrannosaurus and an unnamed megaraptoran sacrum (SNMS 58023) from the Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation in Brazil, so its status as an autapomorphy of Tratayenia is not concrete. Some of the sacral vertebrae have neural spines which are fused together, and the last three curve backwards. The fourth sacral has a shape similar to those of the Santana Formation sacrum. The ilium (upper blade of the hip) was heavily pneumatized, meaning that it was filled with air pockets. Pneumatization of the ilium is most common in megaraptorans among theropods, as seen in taxa such as Aerosteon and Murusraptor. The outer surface of the ilium is perforated by several pneumatic pores, similar to that of Aerosteon, but the upper edge of the bone is straight, in contrast with the curved ilium of Aerosteon. A bone identified as the pubic boot (expanded tip of the pubis) has been found in the holotype, as well as fragments of the ischium, which has the form of a long, thin shaft covered in grooves. ==Classification== Megaraptorans have very controversial relations to other theropods. The first mainstream hypothesis is that they are carnosaurs, distantly related to Allosaurus and more closely related to Neovenator and carcharodontosaurids. The second popular hypothesis considers them to be basal tyrannosauroids, part of the coelurosaur lineage which includes the crested proceratosaurids as well as the famous tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus. A third hypothesis also considers them to be coelurosaurs, but outside Tyrannosauroidea and basal to practically all other groups of Coelurosauria. Porfiri et al.'s description of Tratayenia prefers this third hypothesis. The cladogram below follows the strict consensus (average result) of the 12 most parsimonious trees (the simplest evolutionary paths, in terms of the total amount of sampled features evolved or lost between sampled taxa) found by Porfiri et al. (2018)'s phylogenetic analysis. Although the results are different, the methodology analysis was practically identical to that of Apesteguia et al. (2016), only differing in the fact that it incorporated Tratayenia and Murusraptor, two megaraptorans not sampled in the analysis of Apesteguia et al. ==Paleoecology== Tratayenia lived in the Bajo de la Carpa Formation alongside many lizards and turtles, the snake species Dinilysia patagonica, many birds such as Patagopteryx deferrariisi, a diverse amount of crocodylomorphs and many dinosaurs such as Viavenator exxoni and Traukutitan eocaudata. ==See also== *2018 in paleontology ==References== Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of South America Category:Megaraptorans Category:Fossil taxa described in 2018 ","title":"Tratayenia"},{"id":"56893993","text":"Marios Lomis (born 24 January 1995) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a forward for North Carolina FC in the USL Championship. ==CareerCollege & youth=== Lomis started playing football in his native Netherlands with Koninklijke HFC, ADO '20 and VV Noordwijk, where he scored 13 goals in his final season with the Hoofdklasse club before moving to the United States to play college soccer at Creighton University in their 2017 season.

Other settlers of his generation included Stephen Ashley, Benjamin Covell, Samuel Gale, Benjamin Smith, Philip Heartt, Anthony Goodspeed, Mahlon Taylor, Ephraim Morgan, and Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson. As one writer later reminisced of these pioneers, “they were few in number, and possessed but little substance; but they were men of courage and activity…. They were men of shrewd minds.

In 1951 he graduated from Bartłomiej Nowodworski high school in Kraków and began geology studies at the AGH University of Science and Technology. He obtained his master's diploma in 1956 and in the same year he was accepted as an assistant at the Department of Non-metallic Ore Deposits headed by prof. Marian Kamieński. In 1959 he became a senior assistant. A year later, after completing supplementary studies, he obtained a master's engineer’s degree in geology of solid mineral deposits. In 1963 he obtained a doctorate in technical sciences based on the work \\"Litological development and usage significance of the Senon area of Miechów\\" and became an adjunct. Jacek Rutkowski obtained his habilitation in the field of deposit geology in 1976, in 1987 he became an associate professor, in 1995 he became a full professor. In 1979 he moved to the Department of Geological Cartography (currently Department of Environmental Analyses, Cartography and Economic Geology) at his home faculty. Between 1979 and 1989 he was the head of the Department. He died in 2016, he was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery in Kraków. ==Work== Professor Rutkowski dealt with both basic and application research. In the first period of his scientific career he mainly studied petrography, sedimentation and physical properties of carbonate rocks, sandstones, gravels and mineral resources. After his transfer to the Department of Geological Cartography, his research interests extended to issues of Quaternary geology, geomorphology, as well as geological mapping. His greatest achievements included research into the lithology of the Niecka Niedziańska chalk, conditions of sedimentation and lithology of Sarmatian limestones from the south-western Świętokrzyskie Mountains, tectonics and Quaternary deposits around Kraków, as well as the environment of Wigry Lake. In addition, he developed his own, currently widely used, Quaternary gravel research method, he was a pioneer in Poland of universal use of aerial and satellite images for geological and geomorphological cartography, as well as the use of high-resolution seismics for lake sediment research. He developed his own gravitational core probe for collecting sediments from the lake bottom. Together with Prof. Elżbieta Mycielska-Dowgiałło he co-edited and contributed to two books: “Researches of Quaternary sediments, some methods and interpretation of the results” (1995) and another one on studies of textural features of Quaternary sediments and some methods of their dating (2007). At his Alma Mater, Jacek Rutkowski lectured geomorphology, Quaternary geology, geological mapping and structural geology. He conveyed his scientific passion to students, first and foremost, during field courses and field research. Prof. Rutkowski devoted last 20 years of his life to studies of the Lake Wigry in Podlasie. His unique achievement was organization of an informal, interdisciplinary team of scientists from all over Poland, from students to renowned professors. The group members, drawn by the authority and personality of the professor, under his leadership, devoted themselves (free of charge) to the environmental research of the lake and its surroundings. Beginning with the study of lithology of gravels from the bottom of Wigry, with time, the scope of research was extended to geology, hydrochemistry, hydrobiology, sediment dating and study of the evolution of the Wigry lake environment and neighbouring lakes (mainly dystrophic ones, called “suchar”). A measurable effect of this group's activity, was a hundred dozen scientific publications, several dozen graduation theses and a monograph entitled \\"Lake Wigry. History of the Lake in the Light of Geological and Palaeoecological Research\\" published in 2009. Jacek Rutkowski was the author or co-author of around 250 scientific papers, including \\"Krakow\\" and \\"Miechów\\" sheets of the Detailed Geological Map of Poland 1: 50000, promoter of 6 doctoral dissertations and reviewer of many doctoral and habilitation dissertations. He was an honorary member of the Polish Geological Society, a founding member of the Polish Limnological Society, and a member of, among others, of the Commission on Quaternary Palaeogeography of the Polish Academy of Science and Art and the Committee of Quaternary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. ==Awards and decorations== Winner of numerous awards and distinctions: the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1987), the Golden Cross of Merit (1976) and the Medal of the National Education Commission (1994), the prestigious Ludwik Zejszner scientific prize awarded by the Polish Geological Society (1965), Honorary Badge of the Podlasie Voivodship (2014) awarded for outstanding research achievements in the Wigry National Park and numerous other prizes. ==See also== * Geology of Poland ==References== Category:1934 births Category:Polish geologists Category:20th- century Polish scientists Category:AGH University of Science and Technology faculty Category:Knights of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Recipients of the Gold Cross of Merit (Poland) Category:2016 deaths Category:Burials at Rakowicki Cemetery Category:People from Zamość ","title":"Jacek Rutkowski"},{"id":"56894161","text":"The 1983 World Table Tennis Championships – Women's Doubles was the 36th edition of the women's doubles championship.

Her first language was Telugu. She did not attend school and grew up illiterate; she married her husband, Anjinappa, at the age of 12. She had 12 children, although four died when young, and 36 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She learnt her midwifery skills from her grandmother, Marigemma, a midwife who also helped to deliver five of Narasamma's own babies. In 1940, at the age of 20, Narasamma assisted at her first birth when she helped with the delivery of her aunt's baby. Narasamma had the opportunity to keep practice her midwifery skills whenever nomadic tribes arrived at her village. She also learned the art of preparing natural medicine for pregnant women and soon became competent in checking the health and position of the baby. She was also reportedly able to detect the pulse of the foetus while in the womb, without the use of any instruments. By 2018, and at the age of 97 years old, Narasamma had helped to deliver more than 15,000 babies, and has been described as 'the go-to midwife of Krishnapura'. ==Awards and honors== Narasamma received the following awards and citations: *2012: Karnataka state government's D. Devaraj Urs award *2013: Kitturu Rani Chennamma award *2013: Karnataka Rajyotsava award *2013: National Citizen award of India *2014: Honorary doctorate from Tumkur University *2018: Padma Shri ==Death== Narasamma was admitted to the Siddaganga Hospital and Research Centre in November 2018 and was later referred to BGS Hospitals on November 29, 2018. She died at BGS Gleneagles Global Hospitals in Kengeri, Bengaluru, Karnataka, on 25 December 2018 at the age of 98 of chronic lung disease. On 25 December 2018, Narasamma's body was kept at Glass House in Tumakuru for the public to pay tributes. Several Ministers, former Ministers and thousands of people from different walks of life also paid their tributes to the departed soul. On 26 December 2018, Narasamma was laid to rest with full state honours at Gangasandra village on the outskirts of the Tumakuru city. Half acre of the one-acre plot was set aside for a memorial. ==References *#PeoplesPadma: President of India Confers Padma Awards 2018 *Story of Dr. Sulagatti Narasamma, Janani Amma –- Padma Awardee 2018 in Social Work Category:Indian women social workers Category:1920 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from Bangalore Category:People from Tumkur district Category:Women from Karnataka Category:20th-century Indian women Category:Indian midwives Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in social work Category:Recipients of the Rajyotsava Award 2013 ","title":"Sulagitti Narasamma"},{"id":"56894251","text":"Yeongyang Gim clan () was one of the Korean clans.

After the Portuguese conducted a large-scale naval expedition to Suez in 1541, the Ottoman Empire dedicated greater resources into protecting the Red Sea from Portuguese intrusion. To such effect, about 25 galleys were armed and stationed at Aden.

He played for the school's baseball team, but suffered a torn labrum in 2011, his senior year. He enrolled at the University of Florida and played college baseball for the Florida Gators from 2012 through 2015. While at Florida, he pursued a degree in finance. In 2013 and 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League. ==Professional career== The Boston Red Sox selected Poyner in the 14th round, with the 411th overall selection, of the 2015 MLB draft. After he signed, he made his professional debut with the Lowell Spinners of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League, and spent the whole season there, pitching to a 1–2 record and 2.28 ERA in 17 relief appearances. Poyner began the 2016 season with the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, and was promoted in June to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. In innings pitched between the two teams, he compiled a 3–1 record and 3.15 ERA.

He was also trained in Hindi language from his father. Azhakathu Padmanabhan Kurup became great devotee of Rama after reading Ramacharitamanasa of Tulasidas . His devotion influenced him to compose the epic Ramachandravilasam. Ramachandravilasam is the first epic in Malayalam that strictly adheres to all the rules of composition, which has 21 sargas, 1832 slokas and 'chitrasargam'. The theme of the poem is based on Ramayana, except the part called 'utharakandam', which has been omitted in the epic poetry. Ramachandravilasam became a milestone in Malayalam literature, especially in Mahakavya, for this author has made a maiden attempt. Till then Mahakavya were written in Sanskrit on the belief that Malayalam doesn't have the essence for epic composition. Azhakathu started this work in 1894 but took few years to complete it. During the composition, in order to understand the opinion of readers on an entirely new piece of work, he published his initial draft of Ramachandravilasam, which had 8 sargas, anonymously on a famous newspaper 'Malayalee' of that time. Disappointingly, he didn't receive any response from the readers. So Azhakathu send a letter to Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran seeking his opinion and also informed that Ramachandravilasam that was published on the newspaper is composed by him. Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran responded by appreciating his work and also encouraged Azhakathu to complete his remaining work as it would be a turning point in Malayalam literature. In 1905, Azhakathu completed the composition of Ramchandravilasam and published it on 'Malayalee' newspaper. He then approached his well-wisher A. R. Raja Raja Varma to review his work and provide suggestions. After including the suggestions from A. R. Raja Raja Varma, the final draft of Ramachandravilasam was published in 'Avatharika' in 1907. Ramachandravilasam has all the features of a neo- classical epic. In the preface to the poem, the poet has declared Bhojachambu as his model. He has also stated that the ideas of many Sanskrit scholars have been adapted by him. Nevertheless, Ramchandravilasam has its own place in the history of Malayalam literature. Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup has also made notable contributions in Aattakatha, drama, Kilippattu, Khandakavyam and Balasahityam. Some of his best known works were 'Gandharvavijayam' (Aattakatha), 'Meenakethana Charitham' (Drama), 'Prabhushakthi' (Khandakavyam), kuvalayaasweeyam' (Kilippattu). He has also made translations of Sanskrit classics into Malayalam. In 1894 Azhakathu married 'Pallickal Puthiyaveethil Bhaageeradhi Kunjamma' and the couple had 8 children. He was a Sanskrit teacher in Chavara Govt. High School, Kollam and later retired as 'Munshi' from service. Even though his work was notable in Malayalam literature unfortunately there aren't much details recorded in history about the life of this poet. ==References== *Biographical sketch, Portrait, Handwriting and Books of Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup- Kerala Sahitya Akademi * Category:1869 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Scholars from Kerala Category:19th-century Indian poets Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:19th-century Indian translators Category:20th-century Indian translators Category:Poets from Kerala Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars Category:Malayalam-language writers Category:People of the Kingdom of Travancore Category:People from Kollam district ","title":"Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup"},{"id":"56894767","text":"Eswatini Bank, is a development finance institution, which doubles as a commercial bank in Eswatini.

It is lethal because it inhibits acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition causes an overly high accumulation of acetylcholine between the nerve and muscle cells. This paralyzes the muscles by preventing their relaxation. The paralyzed muscles includes the muscles used for breathing. Patent assigned to US army for EA-3990 among other similar nerve agents was filed in December 7, 1967. == Lethality == EA-3990 lethality in humans is unknown but estimates have been made. Carbamates like EA-3990 are well absorbed by the lungs, gastrointestinal tracts, and the skin. Signs and symptoms from exposure to such carbamates are similar to other nerve agents. In general their penetration through the blood-brain barrier is difficult due to quaternary nitrogens in these molecules. Despite of this, EA-3990 is claimed to be about three times more toxic than VX (another nerve agent). For VX, the median lethal dose (LD50) for 70 kg men via exposure to the skin is estimated to be 10 mg, and the lethal concentration time (LCt50), measuring the concentration of the vapor per length of time exposed, is estimated to be 30–50 mg·min/m3. These values for EA-3990 can be estimated to be 3.3 mg and 10–16.7 mg·min/m3 by division. Intravenous LD50 for EA-3990 is 0.0063 mg/kg for mice and 0.0026 mg/kg for rabbits. == Properties == EA-3990's CAS is 110913-95-6, mass 718.7 g/mol, melting point 190–191 °C, density 1.33 g/cm3, vapor pressure is negligible, and it is soluble in alcohols, acetic acid and chloroform. It is a white, odorless crystalline solid. EA-3990 evaporates slowly in to the air; thus it can be classified as being extremely persistent in the environment if any possible effects of external factors like sun light and water (air humidity) upon it are neglected. Various other salts than just bromine salts have been reported. == Synthesis == Two methods have been described for synthesizing EA-3990 along with similar nerve agents. 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine precursor is prepared. It is made via Mannich reaction by using 3-pyridol (CAS 109-00-2), dimethylamine and formaldehyde. Resulting 2-((Dimethylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol (CAS 2168-13-0) is then carbamoylated with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride. For a different product other secondary amines than dimethylamine can be used; such as those containing methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and benzyl groups. In the first method 2 moles of 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine and app. 1 mol α,ω-dihaloalkane (e.g. 1,8-dibromooctane in this case) in acetonitrile is heated on a steam bath for 6 hours. It is then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The crystalline product is collected by filtration. In the second method 2 mol and 1 mol of the previous reagents used in the first method are added together, but also a catalytic amount of sodium iodide in acetonitrile is added to the solution, which is then allowed to stand for 6 days. Crystalline material is usually formed during this period and it is then collected by filtration. In both methods, after filtration, the crystalline product is triturated with acetone. If no solid separates, ethyl acetate is added to precipitate the crude product. The product is then dissolved in hot ethanol and treated with decolorizing charcoal. Ethyl acetate is added to the filtered solution to precipitate the crystalline product. E-3990 is then collected and dried. Yield is 63%. Other stable salts of EA-3990 than bromide can be made such as sulfate, nitrate, hydrogen, oxalate and perchlorate. Other α,ω-dihaloalkanes can be used to obtain similar molecules with different carbon chain lengths. == See also == * EA-3966 * EA-4056 * T-1123 == References == Category:Carbamate nerve agents Category:Pyridines Category:Quaternary ammonium compounds Category:Bromides Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Biscarbamates Category:Bisquaternary anticholinesterases Category:Aromatic carbamates ","title":"EA-3990"},{"id":"56894853","text":"Maharram Ali oghlu Mammadyarov (; born October 17, 1924) is an Azerbaijani scientist, doctor of chemistry, real member of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. ==Biography== Maharram Mammadyarov was born in Yayji, Julfa, Nakhichivan ASSR.

Its summit forms the highest point of a rather rarely visited ridge between the village of Kirchdorf im Wald, Rinchnach and Frauenau (all in the county of Regen) as well as Klingenbrunn (in the neighbouring county of Freyung-Grafenau). On its southern flank is the rock formation of Habichtstein (863 m). == Description == A waymarked footpath runs around Eschenberg. At the summit of the mostly wooded mountain the view is very restricted. For many years there was a military observation post, Fox 2, operated by the Low-Flying Aircraft Reporting and Control Service (Tieffliegermelde- und Leitdienst) of the Bundeswehr with a transmission mast that was visible from a long way off. After it had been given up the municipality of Kirchdorf planned to renaturalise the 11,500 square metre area, but it was sold in 2003. Eventually the village council agreed a plan to build an observatory on the mountain.

In the same style as the rest of the titles in the series, it tells much of its story through live-action full-motion video sequences, coupled with fully explorable 3D first-person environments during gameplay. ==Gameplay== The Poisoned Pawn's gameplay is very similar to that of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, where the player assumes the role of Tex Murphy, exploring rich 3D environments from a first-person perspective, hunting for clues and solving various environmental puzzles. In addition to the 3D exploration, the game features full motion video cutscenes and video sequences to advance the story and characters. ==Plot== In this cyberpunk, film noir, dystopian sci-fi adventure, the player controls Tex Murphy, a typical 1940's gumshoe detective. Except, it's the 2050s. A post-apocalyptic world has risen from the ashes of World War III and stands divided. New San Francisco sits atop the rubble of the old city. It's a city of glitz and glamour hiding a sinister undertone: a population segregated between those immune to the nuclear fallout (Norms) and those less fortunate (Mutants). Just outside the new city lies Old San Francisco, a vastly ignored reminder of a dark past, and home to the mutant population, and Tex himself. In this latest adventure, the year is 2050. Shortly after the events of Tesla Effect, Tex Murphy (Chris Jones), with the guidance of St. Germaine (Jason Tatom), must revisit some of his most gripping cases in order to decipher his true past, and prepare him for an uncertain future. ==DevelopmentBackground=== The game originally began as a fan-made remake of the 5th title in the Tex Murphy series Tex Murphy: Overseer, and its development was sanctioned by Big Finish Games in early 2015. However, due to increased traction in the game's development, as well as significant technological advancements, the project evolved into an official canon continuation of the Tex Murphy series. The development team was streamlined and partnered with the series' owner (Big Finish Games). Aaron Conners (series writer) has come on board, writing all- new content for the game that continues directly after the events of Tesla Effect, and taking place in the year 2050. While the foundation of the games' story is still centered around the Overseer plot, Tex (with the assistance of St. Germaine) revisits various parts of all of his prior cases. The Poisoned Pawn refers to the original title that was given to Overseer, before a name change was decided internally prior to its 1998 release. ===Design=== The development team for The Poisoned Pawn (under the name Chaotic Fusion) is made up of only four people. The game is developed using the Unity engine, with updated graphics from to its predecessor Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure. In addition to updates to the real-time 3D engine, the developers have announced the game would feature 4K resolution full motion video sequences, and full Oculus Rift support. While no official announcements about other VR platforms have been made yet (like the HTC Vive), the developers are confident that it could make it to those platforms provided there is sufficient time and access to those development kits. On May 29th, 2019, the development team revealed the poster design and tagline (\\"Someone's been playing you from the beginning...\\") for the game via social media. The design shows images of Tex Murphy from most of the series' previous titles facing off against each titles' primary adversary. ===Platforms and release date=== The development team originally estimated late 2019 for the release of the title. In addition to the desktop release, The Poisoned Pawn marks the first solid attempt to bring Tex Murphy to the latest generation consoles and virtual reality. The game failed to make that timeframe, with a new release date to be determined. ==ReferencesThe Poisoned Pawn at Big Finish Games Category:Detective video games Category:MacOS games Category:Single-player video games Category:Tex Murphy Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Upcoming video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the 2050s Category:Windows games ","title":"The Poisoned Pawn"},{"id":"56895571","text":"Amitermes atlanticus (also known as Black Mound Termites) is a species of termite found in the Western Cape region of South Africa and are endemic to the region's fynbos ecosystem.

The exterior consists of irregular chambers that are interconnected with other cells through small circular openings. The interior of the mounds have larger chambers with thinner walls. There is no royal cell in the mound instead breading termites move freely though the network of cells at the centre of the mound. The species is not a fungus grower and as such there are no fungus gardens in the mound. The mounds tend to be as high as they are wide and can reach up to 50 centimeters in height and width. Workers expand the size of the mound from the mound's interior by making small holes in the mound service from inside and pushing the building material up from the interior. ==Description== Workers range in size from 4mm to 4.5mm in length and have relatively large white heads. Workers can live relatively long lives exceeding nine months. They tend to harvest humus and dead damp organic plant matter for consumption whilst underground. Meaning that the species rarely needs to move on the surface for food. Soldiers are larger and range in size from 5mm to 5.5mm in length and have larger heads that are yellow or red in colour. A large part of the head is taken up by a frontal gland that excretes a colourless, sticky fluid that has a strong irritant effect on other insects. There tends to be one soldier for every twenty to thirty workers relaying on workers to feed them. White nymphs emerge from mature mounds older than two or three years old in late autumn (April or May) after the first autumn rains. Queens can reach a length of 15mm and freely move about the centre of the mound. Each mound has multiple kings and queens with up to thirty five queens in a mound. ==Ecology== A. Atlanticus has relatively few parasites. Most parasites are mites such as Termitacarus cuneiformis Tragardh and Cosrnogyphus kramerii. Another species of termite, Termes winifredue Snyder and Emerson, often cohabits in very close proximity to A. Atlanticus as an inquiline. Termes numbers tend to be small in number and pose little threat to A. Atlanticus with the two species rarely mixing even though their tunnels and chambers might run parallel to each other. Should one of the two species break into the other's colony they will fight with A. Atlanticus tending to beat back Termes. A species of collembola is also known to be a common inhabit of A. Atlanticus nests. Larger animals such as Aardvarks and lizards such as Rock Agamas are known to eat A. Atlanticus in addition to other termite species. ==References== Category:Insects of South Africa Category:Termites Category:Fynbos ","title":"Amitermes atlanticus"},{"id":"56895610","text":" The Sido S.1 was a Polish two seat, parasol wing trainer aircraft, first flown in 1930. ==Design and development== In the late 1920s the LOPP issued a requirement for a low cost, club trainer. In 1929 the Sido S.1 was designed in response by the amateur Józef Sido, who was a student at the Mining Academy in Kraków. Positive reactions from both LOPP and the Kraków Academic Aeroclub led to the parallel construction of three airframes in the workshops of the local Air Regiment, differing primarily in their engines. The first, powered by a Cirrus III inline, flew for the first time on ether 21 or 28 July 1930.. The second airframe flew in September 1930, initially known as the S.2 and fitted with a Avia W.Z.7, a Polish seven cylinder radial engine. The third, initially known as the S.3, had the Cirrus engine but had modified the wing bracing struts and undercarriage. In the late summer of 1931 the two later aircraft were modified to the standards and engine of the S.1 and were referred to by that designation. The wooden parasol wing of the Sido S.1 was built in two parts. Each had two spars, plywood skinned leading edges and was fabric covered. In plan the wing was straight tapered and its section varied outboard from S.T.Ae 74 to Göttingen Gö 398. Each halfwing was joined to the lower fuselage longerons with V-struts to the spars and the centre section, formed from the fuel tank, was held well above the fuselage on steel tube struts to the upper fuselage. Its flat-sided fuselage was built around a steel tube structure and fabric covered apart from plywood decking. There were two open, tandem cockpits equipped with dual control. The upward field of view from the rear cockpit was improved with a wide, rounded, trailing edge cut-out and access to the front cockpit with a starboard-side door. The S.1 had a triangular fin and a large rudder with a leading edge that extended the straight edge of the fin but with a full, rounded trailing edge down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, strut braced from below, and the elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement. The S.1 had conventional, fixed landing gear. Each maninwheel was on a half-axle hinged from the lower fuselage longeron, as was the radius arm. The landing leg, which incorporated a compressed rubber shock absorber, was hinged from the upper longeron. ==Operational history== The Polish military aviation authorities considered the S.1 alongside the PZL.5 and the M.N.5 for their trainer requirements. Despite its good performance, the lack of an established manufacturing facility for this amateur design prevented its military adoption. There was more enthusiasm from the civilian aeroclubs and a series of five airframes, designated S.1bis Z, powered by the Avia engine in a Townend ring cowling and fitted with streamlined wing struts, was begun in the newly established Central Aeroclubs' Workshops (C.W.A.). C.W.A went bankrupt after producing only three, the last of which had a Siemens-Halske Sh 11 radial. The S.1s was a frequent competitor in Polish meetings, including the National Lightplane Contests and many local and regional meetings and rallies through the early 1930s, though without major successes. It also served as a reliable and forgiving club trainer, the small production numbers reflecting the failure to find an established constructor for the aircraft rather than its qualities. One remained in use until 1939 and may have been evacuated to Romania. ==Variants== ;S.1: First prototype, Cirrus engine. ;S.2: Second prototype, Avia engine. Later re-engined with Cirrus and re-designate S.1. ;S.3: Third prototype, Cirrus engine. Later re-designated S.1. ;S.1 bis Z: Three built, the first two with Avia engines and the last with a Siemens. ==Specifications (S.1)References== Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:1930s Polish civil trainer aircraft ","title":"Sido S.1"},{"id":"56895620","text":"Gray's pipefish, also known as the mud pipefish or spiny pipefish (Halicampus grayi) is a species of marine fish of the family Syngnathidae.Dawson, C.E., 1985.

A young married society woman, Madame de Listomère briefly meets Eugène de Rastignac at a social gathering. The next day he writes a letter to his lover, Madame de Nucingen, but mistakenly addresses it to Madame de Listomère. When Madame de Listomère reads this letter she is scandalised. Rastignac only realises his mistake four days later, and it is confirmed to him by his friend, Horace Bianchon, who saw him writing the letter when he was visiting him. Rastignac visits Madame de Listomère to try to clear the mistake. He is initially told that Madame is not home, but is let in by her husband when he arrives. Rastignac discovers that Madame de Listomère actually is at home and speaks to her. By this time, she has become convinced that he is genuinely attracted to her, but he tells her that the letter was actually for Madame de Nucingen. Rastignac leaves feeling embarrassed. For the next few days Madame de Listomère does not attend any social events, and Bianchon closes the story saying that he has been treating her for a slight attack of nerves, which she has been using as an excuse to stay home. ==Recurring characters== Rastignac and Bianchon appear in several novels and stories of La Comédie humaine, especially Le Père Goriot in which Rastignac is the main character.Raphael, Sylvia. \\"Introduction\\".

While Olive Jeanette wreck was located in over of water about off the Huron Islands in the 1990s, Iosco wreck has not yet been found. ==History== Iosco built by the West Bay City Shipbuilding Company (F.W. Wheeler Shipyards) of West Bay City, Michigan. She was named after Iosco County, which is a county in Michigan. She was one of three almost identical wooden ships including , , , and . She was launched on April 25, 1891, as hull number #80. She had a large white oak hull. At an overall length of , Iosco was one of the largest wooden ships ever built. Her hull was between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide, and her cargo hold was deep. Because of her enormous size Iosco needed several steel arches, a steel keelson, steel cross bracing and several steel plates to increase her strength. Iosco had a three- cylinder triple expansion steam engine that was built by the Frontier Engine Works Company of Detroit, Michigan. Her massive triple expansion steam engine was capable of generating , her engine had cylinders of , each with a stroke. She had two coal burning Scotch marine boilers that were high and wide. They also had a steam pressure of ; her boilers were built by the Wickes Brothers of Saginaw, Michigan. ==Sinking== A September 6, 1905 issue of the Daily News Marshall, Michigan wrote an article about the foundering of Iosco and Olive Jeanette: :\\"Pequaming, Mich., Sept. 6. -- The steamer Iosco will have to be added to the list of ships which foundered on Lake Superior in the great gale last Sunday, if the story told be the wreckage through which the tug D.L. Hebard passed Tuesday is well founded. Life preservers marked Iosco and much other wreckage were found near Huron Island. The stem of a schooner had been thrown up on the end of Point Abbaye. The body of a sailor was found ten miles this side of Point Abbaye. Olive Jeanette underway It is now believed that both the Iosco and the schooner Olive Jeannette, which the Iosco had in tow, foundered in the vicinity where the wreckage had been sighted. It is certain that the Olive Jeanette is lost. The lighthouse keeper on Huron Island plainly saw a big schooner founder four miles north of the light at 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon. No steamer was in sight at the time. The schooner when first sighted had jib and foresail set, and was nearly waterlogged. Not long afterward the ship went down. The lighthouse keeper had no means of rendering assistance in the tremendous sea running. The three days which have elapsed since the Olive Jeannette foundered would have brought news from the Iosco were that boat still afloat, but the owners at Cleveland last night gave up hope. The Iosco carried a crew of nineteen men. The Olive Jeannette carried a crew of seven men. The Iosco and Jeannette, laden with iron ore, left Duluth at noon last Thursday bound for Lake Erie. They were caught by the storm when halfway down Lake Superior, and must have been driven back with the hope of finding shelter among the islands east of Keweenaw Peninsula. The Iosco was commanded by Captain Nelson Gonyaw.\\" ==References * Historical images of the Iosco Category:1891 ships Category:Ships built in Bay City, Michigan Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1905 Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Missing ships Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior ","title":"SS Iosco"},{"id":"56895798","text":"Bukovica is a village in central Croatia, in the municipality of Topusko, Sisak-Moslavina County. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census, the village of Bukovica has 2 inhabitants.

Slauerhoff, first published in 1929. Some are poems originally written in French, others are French translations by the poet of his originally Dutch poems. ==Publication history and content== The first edition was printed by A. A. M. Stols in Brussels. Stols was a prolific publisher in the 1920s, and E. du Perron worked for him in the late 1920s. Du Perron was interested in becoming a publisher of poetry in limited editions via subscriptions, and he edited and then published the second edition of Fleurs in the same year, with \\"Chaumont-Gistoux\\" listed as the publisher--Gistoux is the name of the Belgian town where du Perron lived, and in 1929 Slauerhoff stayed there with him. This edition was published as Fleurs de marécage. Poèmes de J. Slauerhoff. Précédés d'une lettre de Franz Hellens. The third was published in 1934, again by Stols, now in Maastricht. The fourth edition, published by Nijgh & Van Ditmar in The Hague in 1986, contained the Dutch originals for those poems translated into French by Slauerhoff, and translations of his original French poems by Hans van Straten. Seven of the original French poems with translations by van Straten were published in 1986 in the Dutch literary magazine De Tweede Ronde. One poem (\\"Le galérien\\") was translated into Dutch by Slauerhoff himself (as \\"Op de galeien\\"), and one (\\"Imprudence\\") is a translation/adaptation into French by Slauerhoff of \\"The Mermaid\\", a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats. ==Themes== According to Johann Lodewyk Marais, the importance of French symbolism became especially prominent in Slauerhoff's with the publication of Fleurs de Marécage, a collection which leans on that symbolism and particularly on Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. Marais cites a study by Van der Paardt, who argues that Slauerhoff has a profound distaste of visible, rationally comprehensible reality and attempts to seek the more absolute, ideal reality behind the visible one: Slauerhoff attempts to escape earthly limitations of time and space, and to develop a symbolic poetic which expresses the inexpressible. A recurring theme in Slauerhoff's work is Macau; it is the setting of his 1931 novel Het verboden rijk, in which Luís de Camões was one of the two protagonists. Oost-Aziës Macao section is dedicated to Constâncio José da Silva, an important Macanese newspaper editor. From that collection, Slauerhoff translated two of those Macao poems, and a poem about a Portuguese fort in Asia, for Fleurs de Marécage. ==References *Seven French poems from Fleurs de Marécage, with translations by Hans van Straten Category:Dutch poetry collections Category:1929 poetry books ","title":"Fleurs de Marécage"},{"id":"56895914","text":"Dana Awartani (born 1987) is a Palestinian-Saudi artist born and raised in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where she lives and works today. == Education == Awartani graduated with a bachelor's degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins, London. She then received a Master's in Traditional Arts from The Prince's School, London. At The Prince’s School she learned how to work in stained glass, miniature painting, and gilding - various traditional techniques from cultures all over the world. However, she couldn’t gain a degree in the traditional illumination of texts there, so she found an instructor in Turkey to help her to master this discipline. == Work == Awartani employs a variety of media in her work, including painting, video and sand mosaics. Her work is unique in that it seeks to incorporate the traditional methods of Islamic art into a contemporary world. Rich in geometric patterning and the most intricate of details, Dana’s work often integrates the patterning styles of Islamic art. Specialising in geometry as well as illumination, tile-work and parquetry, Awartani's work explores the relationship between geometry and nature, as well as how truths can be translated through art using geometric principles, visualising a sacred language through a symbolic and multi-layered aesthetic. Her method that emerged over 1,000 years ago as a substitute for the forbidden depiction of divine figures. It is still being practiced, although less and less, today, by specialists such as Dana. On Arabs and art Dana said: ″As Arabs we’re raised around this fine art, we’re surrounded by it in every corner but we’re not aware of it. You can see geometry all around you like in mosques for example. I was looking for a track to follow and looking deep down inside I felt a yearning for it until I’ve discovered it. There is an inner and outer beauty behind it telling a story behind every structured piece, there is no randomness when it comes to creating such pieces.″ On the Islamic art, she said: ″Islamic Art is firstly not made for the sake of making art. It is a sacred spiritual practice that is used as a way to worship God and for God. It teaches one sabr (patience) and respect and as an Islamic artist, my work is a form of prayer and dhikr (remembrance). I need to be 100% focused and in a good mood to be able to do it, otherwise it doesn’t work.\\" == References  External links == *Official Website Category:Palestinian women artists Category:Palestinian artists Category:Saudi Arabian women artists Category:Saudi Arabian artists Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Central Saint Martins Category:21st-century women artists ","title":"Dana Awartani"},{"id":"56895932","text":"36th Street is a light rail station on the LYNX Blue Line in the NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.

Born and raised in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York, her novel also takes place in Brooklyn where topics like gentrification, racial and cultural identity are addressed. Coster is the recipient of numerous awards including a Pushcart Prize nomination. A former editor of CURA and a former mentor of Girls Write Now, Coster is also a proud alumna of Prep for Prep, the leadership development program in New York City aiding high-potential minority students in public, charter, and parochial schools. == Life == Born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY, Naima Coster holds an MFA in Fiction from Columbia University, an MA in English and Creative Writing from Fordham University, and a BA in English and African American studies from Yale University. Her writing has appeared in publications including The New York Times, The Rumpus, Arts & Letters, Kweli, and Guernica. She is a proud alumna of Prep for Prep, a leadership development program in New York City. She has taught writing to students in jail, youth programs, and universities. She also writes the newsletter, Bloom How You Must. She currently teaches writing in North Carolina, where she lives with her family. == Literary contributions == Naima Coster is a rising literary figure that writes and talks about universally relatable themes like family relationships, racial and cultural identity, and gentrification. Not only is her novel, Halsey Street about the strange losses and intimacies created by gentrification, it is also about one woman's homecoming to a changed Brooklyn neighborhood and her reckoning with her difficult familial past. Perhaps one of the most significant aspects of her novel is that it was edited by Morgan Parker, a female African American editor that has made her way into the white world of publishing. She wrote her first novel, Halsey Street, because she was worried about the appropriation and reconfiguration of Brooklyn cool, its popular image morphing from working class, industrial, multiethnic, and en epicenter of hip-hop, to the hipster Brooklyn of Girls. She worried, too, about the real, material losses of gentrification - displacement from homes, the closing of businesses, the targeting by police of residents who are viewed by newcomers as dangerous. However, it wasn't all valor or moral conviction that drove Coster to write Halsey Street. She wanted a record of her own losses, too. As a scholarship student at an elite private school, she had moved between the Upper East Side and Fort Greene, Brooklyn, a neighborhood of comparatively little value, although certainly not to her or her family. Gentrification meant the part of her life that had been undervalued was becoming valuable as it was remade to resemble her other life of affluence, whiteness, and prestige. She was hurt and angry at this racist system of valuation. She wanted to push back. == Works  Novels === *Halsey Street. Amazon Publishing, 2017. . === Essays === * Brooklyn Born, Paris Review Daily.

After four years working at the club, and developing contacts in the entertainment business, he set up as an independent press agent. In early 1957 he saw Dave Guard and his informal group the Calypsonians perform at the Cracked Pot club in Redwood City, and decided to work with them. Changes in personnel left a trio of Guard, Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane, with Werber as their manager and effective fourth member. Marti Childs, Jeff March, Where Have All the Pop Stars Gone?, EditPros LLC, 2011, pp.96-117 Werber professionalized the group, and improved their stage presentation. The group grew in popularity, signing to Capitol Records, and began a succession of best-selling recordings. Werber closely managed their career and their investments through various personnel changes, until the Trio split up in 1967. As the Kingston Trio's manager, Werber is credited with designing the basic hospitality rider concerning the environment in which musicians perform; and also with transforming \\"what had been the college lecture circuit and turned it into the college concert circuit\\".

He set up Trident Productions; developed a recording studio, Columbus Studios, in the Columbus Tower; and established the successful restaurant, The Trident, described as \\"a psychedelic health food restaurant with hanging plants and handmade candles where rock musicians hung out and ogled braless waitresses\\", in Sausalito. In 1967 he gave up his music business interests to concentrate on the restaurant and other investments. The following year federal agents raided his home and seized 258 pounds of marijuana, which he was accused of conspiring to transport. He was found not guilty, but was then tried for possession and cultivation of marijuana, for which he was found guilty and served a short jail sentence. In 1974 he started to give up most of his San Francisco business interests, moved for a time to Hawaii and then retired to a ranch in Silver City, New Mexico.

The Battle of the Strait of Hormuz was fought in August 1553 between an Ottoman fleet, commanded by Admiral Murat Reis, against a Portuguese fleet of Dom Diogo de Noronha. The Turks were forced to retreat after clashing with the Portuguese. ==Background== After Piri Reis was executed in late 1552, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent had him replaced by Murat Reis, as Ottoman \\"admiral of the Indian Ocean fleet\\".Saturnino Monteiro (2011) Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume III - From Brazil to Japan 1539-1579 p.169 His mission was to transfer 15 galleys stationed at Basra to the Red Sea, to firmly secure it against Portuguese incursions.Monteiro (2011) p.168 Such a task however, demanded sailing through the Persian Gulf, closely watched and heavily guarded by the Portuguese from their base at Hormuz. Piri Reis' attack on Muscat and Hormuz the previous year had triggered a Portuguese response from Goa, in the form of 30 galleons and caravels, 70 oar ships, and 3,000 soldiers commanded by the Viceroy himself, Dom Afonso de Noronha. These forces were eventually not needed, but nonetheless, significant reinforcements were detached to secure Hormuz against possible Ottoman attacks in the near future.Monteiro (2011) p.155 The Portuguese captain of Hormuz was then Dom António de Noronha, while the sea-captain of Hormuz was Dom Diogo de Noronha. Dom Diogo was joined by the flotilla of Dom Pedro de Ataíde, who had just returned from blockading the mouth of the Red Sea that year.Monteiro (2011) p.169 In May 1553, Dom Diogo set out to sea to patrol the vicinity of Cape Musandam with his main force, while two small craft were dispatched to scout the Shatt al-Arab for Ottoman movements. A few months later, the two craft returned, with information that Murat Reis had departed Basra with 16 vessels and followed close behind, on his way towards the Strait of Hormuz.Monteiro (2011) p.169 ==The battle== 308x308px The Turks sailed in a column close to shore, and as soon as they spotted the Portuguese fleet, attempted to circle it around the north.Monteiro (2011) p.170 To allow the galleons and war-caravels to fire broadsides, the Portuguese formed a line – a tactic that in the future would become standard in naval warfare.Monteiro (2011) p.170 Murat Reis proved just as skilful commanding his galleys: lacking broadside artillery, he instead would order all his galleys to veer to starboard at the same time, to allow the bow guns to fire at the Portuguese, before resuming course.Monteiro (2011) p.170 One Turkish cannonball pierced the Portuguese flagship below the waterline; at this critical moment, the ship-master performed a risky manoeuvre: shifting direction towards the wind, the galleon tilted, bringing the hole above the waterline and allowing the carpenters to plug it mid-battle.Monteiro (2011) p.170 Towards the end of the morning wind fell, leaving the Portuguese and Ottoman sail vessels immobile, but not the galleys. Possessing himself a carrack which he could not leave behind, Murat Reis took the opportunity to surround an isolated Portuguese galleon, commanded by Gonçalo Pereira Marramaque.Monteiro (2011) p.171 For the following six hours, the galleon crew withstood a continuous bombardment, felling its masts and tearing down its fore and aft castles. Yet the Turks were unable to sink it through gunfire alone, or close in for the grapple.Monteiro (2011) p.172 At the same time, the Turkish galleys were harassed by the Portuguese foists, which being lighter, did not press with the attack.Monteiro (2011) p.171 As the wind picked up, the Portuguese galleons and war-caravels once more closed in on the Turkish galleys, and Murat Reis finally disengaged, taking the route back to Basra along the Persian coast.Monteiro (2011) p.172 ==Aftermath== Coming aboard the battered galleon, Dom Diogo de Noronha applauded its crew for their brave resistance – congratulating the commanding officers last, declaring that they had not but done their duty as expected of nobility of their rank.Monteiro (2011) p.172 Gonçalo Pereira Marramaque was towed back to Hormuz by a few oarships, while Dom Diogo de Noronha set out in pursuit of the Turkish galleys. Since wind blew weak, Murat Reis gained a considerable lead and managed to reach Basra safely within seven days, and Dom Diogo likewise returned to Hormuz and Goa, leaving just a few craft keeping watch at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab.Monteiro (2011) p.172 Following this setback, Murat Reis was dismissed of his command, and replaced with Seydi Ali Reis, who would likewise attempt an incursion across the Persian Gulf the following year. ==See also== *Battle of the Gulf of Oman == References == Category:Naval battles involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Naval battles of the Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts Category:Naval battles involving Portugal Category:Conflicts in 1553 Category:1553 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Battle of the Strait of Hormuz (1553)"},{"id":"56896056","text":"Old Concord Road is a light rail station on the LYNX Blue Line in the Eastway neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.

The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 786–788 in its catalogues. ==Plot== In his ramshackle lodgings, decorated with designs of famous airships of the past, the inventor Crazybrains dances with glee at having designed a new dirigible. When he takes a nap, impish figures appear in his room, gleefully wreaking havoc with his papers before giving way to a vision of Crazybrains's new airship rising aloft above the rooftops. The airship travels through the clouds, and women reclining in painterly positions appear in the sky. Suddenly a fireball strikes the airship, and it explodes with much fire and smoke as the impish figures reappear. Crazybrains, waking up from his nightmare, tears around his room in a frenzy, knocking the plans for the airship down to the floor. ==Themes== Le Dirigeable fantastique is one of numerous Méliès films, like A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage, featuring a comically eccentric scientist. As featured by Méliès, the character is connected both to the Faust legend (a favourite theme of the filmmaker's) as well as to the long-lasting film tradition of the mad scientist figure. Similarly parodic depictions of scientific practitioners also feature in other early films, such as the Edison Manufacturing Company's 1910 A Trip to Mars. ==Release and survival== A hand-coloured print of the film, probably from Elisabeth Thuillier's colouring laboratory, survives at the EYE Film Institute Netherlands. It was given a restoration in 1991. ==References * Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:French films Category:French black-and-white films Category:French silent short films ","title":"The Inventor Crazybrains and His Wonderful Airship"},{"id":"56896078","text":"This is Love is a podcast created by Phoebe Judge, Lauren Spohrer, and Nadia Wilson, producers of Criminal.

Its most famous product is the Chatham Blanket. It was the largest blanket manufacturer in the world at its height.https://www.ncpedia.org/chatham-manufacturing-company ==History== Alexander Chatham An engraving of the original Elkin Valley Woolen Mill, later Chatham Manufacturing Mill in the 1800s. The Elkin Valley Woolen Mill in 1877 Alexander Chatham went to work as a clerk at the Gwyn Mill in 1858. Richard Gwyn built the grist mill along the Elkin Creek in Elkin North Carolina. It was powered by water from the creek and local farmers brought their corn to him to be ground into flour. The mill had a store and was a focal point for trade in the area. Cash was scarce in the area after the Civil War and sheep were abundant, so wool became the most common currency in the local barter economy. The Gwyn Mill had to accept wool in trade, cart it 60 miles away in order to sell the raw fiber which was then sent by rail to distant mills. The amount of wool being traded continued to increase so much that in the 1870s, the company bought a wool carding machine in order to process the wool. It was installed in the grist mill and powered by the same water wheel. This, in turn, brought in more wool from the mountains of North Carolina and the surrounding area. In 1877, Richard Gwyn and Alexander Chatham took over operation of the mill. They added a textile mill to the grist and carding mill and named the operation the “Elkin Valley Woolen Mill”. In the first years of the woolen mill operation, it employed only four people. In 1878, Gwyn and Chatham travelled to Philadelphia and recruited a machinist, Gilvin T Roth. In 1890 the railroad arrived in Elkin. The North Carolina Railroad ran along the Yadkin River, and Gwyn and Chatham quickly made plans to move their factory to be alongside it. That same year, Thomas Gwyn sold his interest to Alexander Chatham and the company was renamed the Chatham Manufacturing Company. The new mill no longer needed water power, but instead used steam engines to power generators. The mill made only yarn until 1893 when they began to produce fabrics as well. That was the year that they made the first Chatham Blanket. In 1895 the company started making wool suiting fabric and brought a tailor from New York to make suits. In 1907 the Chatham Manufacturing company reorganized. They built another factory in Winston- Salem. Alexander's son, Hugh Gwyn Chatham became the president, with R J Reynolds as the vice president. leftIn 1916 Elkin flooded, including the Chatham Manufacturing Company. The flood was devastating to the mill, and the company began work on a new mill on higher ground above the old one. USS Phoenix in 1939 In 1929, Richard Thurmond Chatham took over the company from his father, Hugh Gwyn Chatham. He entered Chatham Manufacturing into the automotive upholstery business in 1936 with interiors for Packard. In 1939 the company moved its Winston-Salem Factory to Elkin to have everything in a single Place. Richard Thurmond Chatham was a naval officer and commanded a cruiser, the USS Phoenix, during World War 2. While he was at sea, the company produced blankets for the armed forces and was awarded the Army/ Navy Award of Excellence for wartime production. ==Chatham Blankets== In 1893 Chatham wove its first blanket. The first dozen were bound on a sewing machine by Mrs RL Hubbard. Although Chatham manufactured fabrics for many applications, Chatham Blankets were the only product with the name \\"Chatham\\" on them and the thing that the company would be most known for. During the first part of the 19th century, the primary focus of company sales were wool blankets. The Chatham Blanket became famous all over the United States. Wool blankets are soft, warm and naturally moisture wicking. The Chatham blanket process started with local, North Carolina Wool. The raw wool was washed in water from the Yadkin River and then carded to align the fibers. The carded wool was spun into threads and dyed. The wool threads were then warped and woven into cloth. The cloth was then napped and washed, then cut to size and bound. The finished blankets were warm in winter, breathable in summer, moisture wicking and self cleaning. A Chatham Army Blanket Around 1910, Chatham was the largest blanket manufacturer in the South, and by the 1940s and 1950s, they were the largest blanket manufacturer in the world. They manufactured millions of blankets for all branches of the armed forces in both world wars. The company was awarded the Army/ Navy Award of Excellence for wartime production for its military blankets. ==Automotive Upholstery== In the 1930s the company started producing automotive upholstery. Studebaker, Packard, and Ford were among their automotive clients. The company built a finishing plant for Upholstery in Winston-Salem, NC but eventually moved it to Elkin to adjoin their main plant. Chatham designed the interior of the 1947 Studebaker Starlight designed by Raymond Loewy. They worked with famed textile designer Marianne Strengell on designs for automotive textiles. ==Chatham Blanketeers== Chatham Manufacturing organized a semi-professional baseball team called the Chatham Blanketeers. They represented North Carolina at The National Semi-Pro Baseball Tournament in Wichita, Kan., in 1937. The team won the North Carolina semi-pro championship in Asheboro in 1948https://www.mtairynews.com/archive/20017/view- full_story-16174094-article- minor_league_blanketeers_to_enter_surry_hall_of_fame and in 1949 they went to the National Baseball Congress World Series.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Elkin_Blanketeers == Turmoil == In the late 1980s, Chatham Manufacturing owned plants in Elkin, Eden, and Charlotte. About two- thirds of the company's more than $125 million in sales in 1987 derived from upholstery products, while most of the rest of the company's revenues were from the sale of bedding products, including blankets. A majority of the company's stock was still owned by descendants of Alexander Chatham. However, in 1988, Northern Feather, Ltd., a Danish textile maker, outbid family members and senior management for control of Chatham Manufacturing and purchased the blanket-maker for more than $92 million. This ended the company's more than 110 years of North Carolina ownership. Northern Feather went bankrupt within four years, however, and Chatham Manufacturing was sold to CMI Industries of Columbia, S.C., in 1992. In 2000 Atlanta-based Interface, Inc., acquired the firm from CMI Industries, and, as Chatham, Inc., it became part of the Interface Fabrics Group, with a focus on upholstery for commercial and residential uses. ==Ownership== The brand is now managed by Alex Chatham, Industrial Designer and the great-great-grandson of the original founder. ==References *Powell, William S., The North Carolina Gazetteer: A Dictionary of Tar Heel Places, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, *Powell, William S., Encyclopedia of North Carolina, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, *https://www.chathammfg.com/ Category:Textile companies of the United States Category:Companies based in North Carolina Category:Surry County, North Carolina Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1907 Category:Buildings and structures in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Winston-Salem, North Carolina ","title":"Chatham Manufacturing Company"},{"id":"56896267","text":"Leopoldo González González (born October 31, 1950) is the current Archbishop of Acapulco, Mexico.

Abby, Rebecca and four of their friends, whom they have known since they were young waitresses, decide to spend the weekend together in Napa. Rather than allow the women to relax and drink Abby wants them to adhere to a strict schedule, a way of seizing control as, unbeknownst to the rest of her friends, she has recently lost her job. All the other friends are struggling with problems of their own: Rebecca is in denial that her husband is inattentive and her friends hate him, Naomi (Maya Rudolph) is afraid of receiving test results from her doctor, successful business woman Catherine (Ana Gasteyer) feels that the rest of the friends are cutting her out, Val (Paula Pell) is looking for love and Jenny (Emily Spivey) a depressive writer, is simply miserable in life. On Friday the friends eat at an expensive restaurant where Val flirts with their waitress, Jade. The following morning the women have a sinister tarot reading from a woman called Lady Sunshine. Afterwards they go day drinking around Napa. Near the end of their tour there is tension when Abby snaps at the other women for not adhering to their schedule. When Rebecca goes to talk to her about her attitude Abby reveals that she lost her job. In anger Abby throws out her schedule and the women decide to go to Jade's art gallery opening. They are shocked that Jade's art is all related to The Nanny. During a Q&A; Abby rants on how younger generations have it too easy but ends her speech by saying that they are Fran Fine (in reference to Fran Drescher's character on the show The Nanny) causing the art goers to believe she is a part of the exhibit. Val stays behind to flirt with Jade but when she tries to ask her out Jade assumes she is trying to buy a painting and humiliated, Val agrees to buy it. Returning home drunk and miserable Abby is propositioned by Devon the housekeeper (Jason Schwartzman) and has sex with him. The next morning Naomi goes to wish Rebecca a happy birthday and finds her on the floor having thrown out her back. Rebecca reveals that spending the night on the floor led to the epiphany that she hates her life. She agrees to adhere to Abby's schedule and all the women, except Catherine who they can't find, go to brunch. Catherine eventually arrives and accuses the other women of trying to cut her out. Naomi tells her she is locked in a self-fulfilling prophecy as work means she has no time for her friends and not spending more time with her friends makes her work harder. Naomi then reveals she also has problems as she is waiting on the results of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 test and then storms out of the restaurant. After Rebecca tells Abby that the birthday weekend is more for her than for Rebecca, Abby storms out as well. Naomi and Abby are pursued by the rest of the women in a golf cart. Naomi is bitten on the ankle by a snake and as they can't get cell phone reception Val decides to run down the side of the steep hill they are on to get help. One by one the other women follow Val down the side of the hill. Catherine is the last one to go and gives an emotional speech at the top of the hill about why she is planning to turn down a lucrative job opportunity to spend more time with her friends, a speech that they don't hear. Arriving at the hospital, they learn that Naomi is fine. Catherine also calls the doctor for her and learns Naomi's blood tests came back negative.

He married Catherine Moneypenny, daughter of Anthony Compton. They had at least one child: Katherine Isabella. ==Political career== The then-Hodgson was elected a protectionist Conservative MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1837. He held the seat until 1847 when he stood down in order to contest Newcastle upon Tyne, a seat his brother, John Hodgson, was retiring from; he was unsuccessful. Hodgson returned to Berwick-upon-Tweed to contest the 1852 general election and by-elections in 1853 and 1859 but failed to recapture the seat. He later returned to parliament for Tynemouth and North Shields, elected at the by-election in 1861 and holding the seat until 1865 when he was defeated. ==Railways== From 1855 to 1866, Hodgson-Huntley was the chairman of the North British Railway Board of Directors. He joined at a time of particular financial discordance, after former chairman John Learmonth had invested heavily in subscriptions to other railways, with huge sums being written off in failed ventures, and similar sized sums were being sought for new ones.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Hodgson-Huntley's reign saw the company's financial position significantly improved and, within one year of his chairmanship beginning, operating expenses were cut to 44% and he announced the company was free from debt, and a dividend of 2.5% to shareholders. Although the company's dividends varied during his chairmanship – such as in 1862 when capital commitments again swamped the company's financial resources – they regularly hit up to 3%. Yet, twice in 1866, he proposed a 3% dividend on ordinary shares, only for the share price to decline. On the second occasion, a new company secretary, John Walker, alerted the finance committee to poor company finances. A new preference share issue had been flopped, and it was impossible to pay debenture interest and preference share-guaranteed dividends. This revelation saw ordinary shares fall in value by 8% overnight, and widespread financial impropriety and falsification accounts were blamed on Hodgson, causing a special general meeting on 14 November 1866. Hodgson decided not to attend, instead tendering his resignation from the board, while blaming his non-attendance on a headache. ==Other activities== He also chaired the Tweed Commissions, and a Justice of the Peace for Northumberland. In 1877, until his death, he was High Sheriff of Northumberland. ==References * Category:UK MPs 1837–1841 Category:UK MPs 1841–1847 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:1812 births Category:1877 deaths Category:High Sheriffs of Northumberland Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies ","title":"Richard Hodgson-Huntley"},{"id":"56896467","text":"McLoughlin v. Raphael Tuck & Sons Co., 191 U.S. 267 (1903), was a United States Supreme Court ruling dealing with copyright. It dealt with the interpretation of Section 4963 of the Revised Statutes of the United States before and after the pertinent section's amendment in 1897. ==Background== Originally, Section 4963 forbade any person from stamping a work as copyrighted while not holding the pertinent copyright. The section included a $50 bounty for the person who identified the illicit article and sued, with another $50 going to the government, paid by the printer of the material. On 3 March 1897, the section was amended to also specifically forbid knowingly selling or importing articles falsely stamped as copyrighted in the United States, whether or not the article was subject to copyright in the United States at all. Importantly, the amendment also noted that these new rules did not apply to articles brought into the country before the amendment's adoption, preventing ex post facto law and observing Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution. The case dealt with 83 books and pamphlets with false copyright marks that had been printed outside the United States, identified by the plaintiff, James McLoughlin. McLoughlin was suing for Section 4963's bounty. The defendants, Raphael Tuck and Sons Co., admitted that the marks were false, but proved that the articles in question had been imported before the 1897 amendment to Section 4963. Because the amendment provided immunity to articles imported before its inaction, the lower courts ruled in the defendants' favor. Appeals eventually moved the case to the Supreme Court. ==Opinion of the Court== The lower court's rulings in favor of the defendant were affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Court questioned the quality of certain testimony in the case, but did not consider that relevant to the statutory question. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. did not hear this argument and was not party to the decision.. ==References * Category:1903 in United States case law Category:United States copyright case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court ","title":"McLoughlin v.

He was noted for his fashion photography for the French edition of Vogue magazine in the 1950s, and subsequently for his assignments for American magazines such as Glamour, Seventeen, Look, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan. ==Early life== Randall was born in Miracle Mile, Los Angeles in 1918, the elder son of Robert Shelby Randall (Senior) and Bernadette Fitzgerald. He attended Beverly Hills High School. ==Career== After graduating from high school, Randall worked in the photography studios of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and is reported to have appeared as an extra in some of the films of John Ford. During the Second World War he served as a US Navy photographer, and was trained by Life magazine to take combat pictures. He attained the rank of Photographer's Mate 1st Class Petty Officer. After the war, he moved to Paris, France, where he secured a job at Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue magazine, with whom he was employed for seven years. In the early 1950s, he became noted for his fashion photography for the French edition of Vogue. His Los Angeles Times obituary would later remark that \\"photographing his models in the back streets of war-torn Paris, against centuries-old facades, Randall brought a new look to high fashion and created celebrities of the models.\\" After seven years in Paris, he returned to the United States and was based in New York City for 15 years, where he had his own studio on Park Avenue. In 1968, he moved from New York to Laguna Beach, California, where he worked on a semi-retired basis. In the 1970s, exhibitions of his work were held at the Edward-Dean Museum of Decorative Arts and the Laguna Beach Museum of Art. According to newspaper interviews at the time, he was preparing a book of photographs of Laguna residents; however, it appears this projected work was never published. In 1975, he started teaching photography courses through the University of California, Irvine, and at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. In 1977, the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Randall probably took more pictures of celebrities before they became celebrities than just about anybody.\\" His subjects included Brigitte Bardot, Pablo Picasso, Bernard Buffet, Jane Fonda, and Lauren Hutton. He photographed Ali MacGraw and Lynda Day George for Seventeen magazine. His fashion and advertising work also appeared in Glamour, Look, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan. In 1984, Prentice-Hall published his book Fashion Photography: A Guide for the Beginner. ==Death== Randall died aged 65 in La Jolla's University Hospital on September 19, 1984, as a result of complications following heart bypass surgery. He had suffered a mild stroke some time earlier. He was survived by a brother, nephew, and cousin. He was interred at San Diego's Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. ==Bibliography== * ==Notes References  External links == * * Category:1918 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Fashion photographers Category:20th-century American photographers Category:War photographers Category:Photographers from California Category:People from Los Angeles Category:American expatriates in France Category:Photographers from New York City Category:Beverly Hills High School alumni Category:Burials at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery ","title":"Robert Randall (photographer)"},{"id":"56896487","text":" The Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer (also previously known as the Aero Electric Aircraft Corporation Sun Flyer) is an electric aircraft that was developed from the PC-Aero Elektra One by Bye Aerospace's Aero Electric Aircraft Corporation division of Denver, Colorado, United States, introduced in 2015. The company had a license agreement and engineering contract for the design with Calin Gologan, the Elektra One's designer. ==Design and development== The aircraft features composite construction, a cantilever low-wing, a single- seat, enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single electric motor in tractor configuration. The Sun Flyer differed from the PC-Aero Elektra One by incorporating new landing gear, propeller and instruments. It provided a prototype for a proposed two-seater that was to have four Panasonic lithium-ion batteries, along with solar panels installed on the wings, horizontal tail and on the fuselage behind the canopy. This two-seater was intended to be certified for day and night Visual Flight Rules. The proposed two-seat version of the Sun Flyer eventually led to a new design, the Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 2 instead. The Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology had reserved the first 20 two-seat models that were to be produced. ==Specifications (Sun Flyer) See also== *List of electric aircraft ==References Sun Flyer Category:2010s United States sport aircraft Category:2010s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Electric aircraft ","title":"Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer"},{"id":"56896493","text":"This is a list of Sites of Community Importance in Castilla–La Mancha. == See also == * List of Sites of Community Importance in Spain == References == * Lisf of sites of community importance in Castile-La Mancha Category:Castilla–La Mancha ","title":"List of Sites of Community Importance in Castilla–La Mancha"},{"id":"56896496","text":"This is a list of Sites of Community Importance in the Canary Islands. == See also == * List of Sites of Community Importance in Spain == References == * Lisf of sites of community importance in Canary Islands Category:Canary Islands ","title":"List of Sites of Community Importance in the Canary Islands"},{"id":"56896497","text":"Ferry Weiss was a male Austrian international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won two bronze medals at the 1933 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1935 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event).

It was published by Bohemia Interactive. == Development == The game is heavily inspired by the 1964 Soviet Union fairy- tale movie Jack Frost (Морозко). The authors of the game read over 1,000 original Russian and Czech fairy tales and legends to gain inspiration. The design style is hand-drawn animation, which were then modeled into the computer as 3D images. The game was meant to be released in October 2000, but this was postponed until mid-December with the final few weeks being spent finishing the dubbing. In cooperation with Bohemia Interactive, Bonusweb launched two competitions where entrants could win one of ten copies of the game. Due to the popularity of the game's soundtrack, four songs were released on Bonusweb in Mp3 format. Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya was included for free with the January 2009 issue of Počítač pro každého. == Critical reception == Games.cz felt the game would appeal to children because it was simple, clear, nice, and interesting. Just Adventure felt the title would appeal to players who looked for mild cartoon violence and minimal stress in their adventure games. Gry Online felt the developers had crafted an eye-catching, cartoonish visual setting. Bonusweb deemed it the best Czech adventure game ever created, and the most technologically advanced adventure ever. Adventure Gamers disliked the repetitive fetch quests and one-note characters.

She is known for her work on infertility in dairy cattle. As of 2018, she is a professor of veterinary reproduction at the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield. ==Education and career== Wathes gained a BSc in zoology from the University of Birmingham in 1974. Her PhD on fertility in dairy cattle was from the University of Nottingham in 1978, under the supervision of Eric Lamming; her thesis was entitled \\"Progesterone levels and fertility of lactating cows\\".GE Lamming. \\"Reproduction during lactation\\", pp 335–53, in Control of Ovulation, DB Crighton, GR Foxcroft, NB Haynes, eds, (Butterworth-Heinemann; 2013) ( In 1990, she was awarded a DSc by the University of Bristol. Her first postdoctoral post was at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge. From 1979 to 1990, she worked in the University of Bristol's Department of Anatomy, holding positions successively as lecturer and reader, before rejoining the Babraham Institute as a project leader (1990–94). She has been professor of veterinary reproduction at the Royal Veterinary College since 1994, leading the college's Reproduction and Development Group from 1995 to 2007. She also holds a guest professorship at Huazhong Agricultural University in China (since 2009). From 2000 to 2008, Wathes chaired \\"ARK-Genomics\\", the steering committee of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Investigating Gene Function Initiative for livestock, which aimed to facilitate genomics research across the UK. She became the first director of the Farm Animal Genetics and Genomics Faraday Partnership in 2002, and she continues to serve on a committee of its successor body, the Knowledge Transfer Network. She also served on the veterinary advisory committee of the Horserace Betting Levy Board (from 1997 until 2006 or 2008). ==Research== The long-term focus of Wathes' research has been reproduction in domestic ruminants, including cattle and sheep. Fertility in dairy cattle, and the problem of infertility, have formed an important part of her work from the outset. In her early research in Nottingham, with Lamming and others, she developed a method to diagnose and monitor low fertility in cows by measuring levels of the progesterone hormone in their milk. Her subsequent research at the Royal Veterinary College has investigated what causes cows to have low fertility, including their genetic background, nutrition and metabolic status, as well as bacterial infection of the uterus after calving. She has shown that lack of sufficient nutrients is an important cause of infertility. While working at Bristol she showed, with Ray Swann, that the oxytocin hormone is produced in the corpus luteum of the ovary in sheep and other ruminants, as well as in the neurohypophysis.RB Heap, APF Flint. \\"Pregnancy\\", pp. 153–59, in Hormonal Control of Reproduction, CR Austin, RV Short, eds, 2nd edn (Cambridge University Press; 1984) () This might form part of the mechanism by which female ruminants detect whether or not they have conceived. She has subsequently studied how hormonal and other factors regulate the oestrus cycle and the birthing process in sheep and cows. ==Awards and societies== Wathes is an elected fellow of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) and the Royal Society of Biology. She has served on the council of the Royal Society of Biology since 2017, and has also held roles on the committees of several other learned societies, including the European Society of Domestic Animal Reproduction, the Society for Endocrinology and the Society for Reproduction and Fertility. Her awards include RASE's Research Medal (2006) for her work on fertility in dairy cattle, and the Society for Reproduction and Fertility's Marshall Medal (2015). ==Personal life== She was married to Christopher Wathes, also a veterinary researcher; he died in 2016. ==Selected publications== *DC Bulman, GE Lamming (1978).

From the early 1990s Oakes' companies, operating under succession of names, were involved in influencing elections in developing countries, and with the onset of the War on Terror they were also contracted by the British military. Oakes first became known as the boyfriend of Lady Helen Windsor in the 1980s. ==Early life== Whichford House, a grade II* listed house bought by his father John Waddington Oakes in the 1980s Nigel Oakes was born in July 1962, the son of Major John Waddington Oakes, who was High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1996.

The family belonged to the English landed gentry. He attended Eton College. He claimed on the now defunct SCL website to have studied psychology at University College London (UCL), but a university spokesman said they have no record of this, and Alexander Nix (a director of SCL) said Oakes attended UCL \\"in a private capacity.\\" Nigel Oakes' brother Alexander Waddington Oakes was also an executive with SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica. ==Career== Oakes ran a mobile disco, before working in advertising for Saatchi & Saatchi.

During his years as a faculty member in city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, he gained recognition for his work in the sphere of urban transportation and land-use planning. His research has spanned the topics of induced demand, transit-oriented development (TOD), transit villages, paratransit, car sharing, and suburban growth. == Academic and professional life == Currently professor emeritus of City and Regional Planning, Cervero twice chaired Berkeley's urban planning department and also served as director of two research units: the University of California Transportation Center (UCTC, 2009-2017) and the Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD, 2009-2014). He held Berkeley planning department's first distinguished chair appointment, the Carmel P. Friesen Chair in Urban Studies from 2011 to 2016. Among his books are Beyond Mobility (2017), Transforming Cities with Transit (2013), Informal Transport in the Developing World (2001), The Transit Metropolis (1998), Transit Villages in the 21st Century (1997), Paratransit in America (1997), America's Suburban Centers (1989) and Suburban Gridlock (1986). His research earned him the first-ever Dale Prize for Excellence in Urban Planning Research and the Hsue-shen Tsien Gold Medal award for the translated version of The Transit Metropolis. In 2013, UMB's Future Cities ranked him among the top 100 City Innovators Worldwide. Cervero twice received the Article of the Year Award from the Journal of the American Planning Association . The work of Robert Cervero and others researching the link between transportation and urban form has not been without controversy. Most contentious has been the debate over whether built environments meaningfully influence travel behavior. Findings from a study led by Cervero on the influence of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system on the San Francisco Bay Area's urban development patterns were challenged on the grounds that BART provided few accessibility gains and built environments are largely unmalleable. Charging motorists more to reflect the environmental and congestion costs they imposed, it was countered, would significantly increase the land-use impacts of metro-rail investments like BART. Cervero has been credited with \\"pioneering the use of the now-ubiquitous 'D' variables—density, diversity, and design—in explaining travel behavior.\\" Research showing compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly developments — e.g., neo-traditional and transit-oriented communities — are associated with automobile travel has been tempered by studies showing this is partly explained by self-selection (i.e., the predisposition of some residents moving into walkable, transit- oriented neighborhoods to drive less for lifestyle reasons). Disagreement exists over the relative importance of self-selection vis-à-vis built environments in explaining travel behavior. Methodological challenges in linking compact development to driving has further muddied the waters. Transit-oriented development is yet another domain where scholars disagree about its transportation impacts. A 2016 issue of Planning magazine referred to Robert Cervero as \\"the world's top expert on transit-oriented development\\". Research by him and others has linked TOD to reduced car ownership and usage, and correspondingly high ridership levels among those living and working near transit. Paul Mees, among others, has argued that the quality of transit services is more important in drawing people out of cars and into trains and buses than the location or density of development. Such debates aside, others point to other reasons for advancing TOD including increasing housing choices, physical activity, and social interaction. While UC Berkeley was home for much of his academic life, Cervero has had visiting academic and research appointments at a number of other universities and institutions, including: University of Cambridge (Churchill College, Overseas Fellow); Nanyang Technological University (SMRT Visiting Professor); NYU-Abu Dhabi (Visiting Professor); University College London (Visiting Professor); University of Pennsylvania (Faculty Fellow); King Saud University (Academic Expert); Tongji University; University of Melbourne; Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro; Institute of Technology Bandung; Korean Research Institute for Human Settlements; Harvard Institute for International Development; Dortmund University; and Urban Land Institute (Fellow). He has also chaired the International Association of Urban Environments, served on the Advisory Board of the World Economic Forum's Future of Urban Development and was a contributing author to the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) Fifth Assessment (2014) and UN-Habitat's Global Report on Sustainable Urban Mobility (2013). == Personal life == Cervero is married to Sophia Cervero and they have three children: Kristen, Christopher, and Alexandria. A guitarist and mellotronist, Cervero has chronicled the music of the prog-rock band King Crimson as a collector of rare live recordings, anniversary parties, and listening parties of unreleased music (posted on Elephant Talk), and a tribute to mellotrons. In the early 2000s, Cervero got involved with the Active Living movement, serving as chair of the National Advisory Committee of the Active Living Research (ALR) program for more than decade. This affiliation with active-living research prompted him to become more physically active himself. In his fifties to mid-sixties, he averaged a marathon or ultramarathon a month, run mostly on trails. Running and active living extended into his transportation research as well, including involvement in several National Academy projects and research on \\"Running to Work\\". == Books == * Beyond Mobility: Planning Cities for People and Places.

The game was programmed by Diane Landais. In September 2017, a spiritual sequel to the game was released, entitled Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story. The games explore themes of LGBT identity and domestic abuse by asking the player to investigate the phone of a stranger. == Development == Originally developed during a game jam, the team would retrospectively identify design mistakes that were rectified in the sequel. == Gameplay == Both games are played entirely as a simulation of a cell phone. In each game, the player is tasked with voyeuristically searching through a lost cell phone, in order to discover what happened to its owner. Each game features puzzles where the player will have to use clues inferred from one part of the phone to unlock another, such as figuring out a character's birth year which is used as a password for one app by inferring this information from another part of the app. == Plot  A Normal Lost Phone === The player investigates the phone of a person named Sam living in the fictional city of Melren, thereby discovering bits about their life. As the game progresses the player discovers several major secrets and events, such as the attempted rape of a friend by another of Sam's acquaintances. The player also learns that Sam is a bisexual transgender woman named Samira and has been hiding this from multiple people in her life, to whom she presented as a straight male. The player will eventually discover Sam's dating profiles, one where she presents as male and another as female, and a forum for transgender persons, where Sam comes to terms with her true gender. She eventually decides to come out to an acquaintance of hers named Lola, only to be met with hostility, which greatly depresses her. To make matters worse, she discovers that her parents and girlfriend Melissa are very bigoted towards the LGBT community, leading to Sam breaking up with Melissa. Sam eventually gains enough courage to come out to her friend Alice, who accepts her warmly. She's heartbroken when she realizes that Alice will be leaving town to attend college in another area, which will rob her of what Sam sees as the only positive person in her life, especially as she learns that her family has a history of disowning gay relatives. Ultimately, Sam chooses to leave home to reinvent herself in another town after her father gifts her a motorbike for her 18th birthday and throws away her phone, aware that someone may find it and sift through her information. The only person she tells is Alice, who congratulates Sam on taking charge of her own life and comforts her by saying that anyone who finds her phone will likely erase the phone's data, especially if they have read all of the information and realized that this is what Sam would want. The game ends when the player erases the phone's data per Alice's message. === Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story === This game tasks the player with investigating the discarded cell phone of a woman named Laura. A preliminary investigation of the phone presents Laura's life as idyllic; she is head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend, Ben. The player eventually learns that Laura has suffered a stressful ordeal at work; an unknown person created a fake email account in her name, and forwarded a private, erotic video of her to all of her work contacts, which not only compromised her employment but also her company's relationship with other organizations. The event opened up Laura to sexual harassment and culminated in her having to work from home. Laura initially suspected her ex-boyfriend Alex, the one she originally sent the video to years ago, to have sent the video out as an act of jealousy; but Alex convinces her of his innocence. Laura is contacted by a woman named Claire (who initially uses the pseudonym of Amanda), who warns Laura that Ben is manipulative and was responsible for this event; however, as Ben had previously warned Laura of Claire (saying that she was jealous of him in the past and tried to sabotage his past relationships), Laura doesn't believe her. Laura also begins experiencing symptoms that suggest she is pregnant, and she feels she isn't ready to have a child with him. It eventually becomes clear that Laura is actually in an abusive relationship with Ben; at the suggestion of her colleague and friend Charlotte, Laura attends a domestic violence seminar and learns about the cycle of abuse, and notes the similarities between the cycle and her relationship with Ben. Slowly, Charlotte is able to wake Laura up to the realization that Ben is manipulating her. Claire, now believed by Laura, reveals that Ben was once physically violent to a previous girlfriend of his, and wanting to avoid a repeat situation is what drove Claire to contact Laura. Laura is able to secure a different job for her company in a different city, so she discards her phone, and requests to the phone's founder (the player) that they enable the GPS service to lead Ben down a false trail (to stop him from harassing Laura's friends and family about her disappearance), and then erase the phone's data. The game ends when the player does so, and the ending reveals that Laura was never pregnant and is enjoying her new life away from her abusive ex-partner. == Reception and accolades == On Metacritic, the game has a score of 83/100 on iOS, 71/100 on PC, and 73/100 on Switch. It was nominated for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" and \\"Best Screenplay\\", and won the \\"Special Jury Prize\\" with Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story at the 2017 Ping Awards; it was also nominated for the A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game at the New York Game Awards 2018; and for \\"Best Emotional Mobile and Handheld Game\\" and \\"Best Emotional Indie Game\\" at the Emotional Games Awards 2018. == References  External links == * Category:2017 video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Indie video games Category:LGBT-related video games Category:Transgender-related video games Category:Video games developed in France ","title":"A Normal Lost Phone"},{"id":"56896970","text":"The following is a timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump during the second quarter of 2018.

He spent his entire career, from 1974 to 2016, with Sotheby's where he was a Vice-Chairman and was Sotheby's longest serving auctioneer. He has also chaired the boards of several American and British preservation and educational organizations. ==Early life== David N. Redden was born in 1949 in the Canton, China (now named Guangzhou), where his father served as an American Consul for the US State Department. Nine months later he and his parents were withdrawn by the State Department as the Red Army advanced on Canton and transferred to Haifa, Israel. His father eventually became American Consul General in London and Rome, where Redden spent much of his youth and education, receiving his high school diploma from St. Stephen's School in Rome. He later graduated from the Art History program at Wesleyan University, where he actively participated in anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. ==Auction career== Redden began his auction career as a catalog trainee at Sotheby's in 1974. He initially joined with the company in order to learn more about his passion, collecting. By 1975 he was an auctioneer. Between his start at Sotheby's and the mid-1990s, Redden created numerous new auction categories for the company, including the specialty categories such as “space-memorabilia”, “baseball memorabilia, comic books, arcade machines, and computerized animation art.” Early in his career, in the late 1970s, he was appointed the director of PB-84, Sotheby's satellite auction house that focused on lower-priced items and unusual collecting categories. He later also became credited with developing the Internet strategy for Sotheby's in the late 1990s when he became chairman of Sothebys.com. Redden is best known as the manager and auctioneer for many of Sotheby's most celebrated live auctions. Redden served as a Vice-Chairman of Sotheby's from February 2000 to 2016, when he retired. He was also the Worldwide Chairman of Sotheby's Books and Manuscripts. As an auctioneer Redden's sales included two first printings of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the Collections of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the Empress Josephine's copy of Redoute's Les Liliacees containing the original watercolors, the Estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; a series of popular auctions for the Walt Disney Company; the largest, most complete, and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex fossil ever recovered known as “Sue”; the most valuable coin ever sold, the 1933 Double Eagle; the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in America; the world's most valuable stamp, the British Guiana 1¢ Magenta; Albert Einstein's manuscript on Special Relativity, a moon lander (still on the moon), three returned space capsules, and the first sale of luna rocks brought back from the Moon; the manuscript of the Magna Carta now in the National Archives; two of the greatest book sales of the 20th century, the library of H. Bradley Martin and the Garden Ltd. Collection; the Nelson Bunker Hunt sale of Ancient Coins, the Four Battleflags of the Revolution, the George Catlin Native American portraits collected in the 19th century by Benjamin O'Fallon, and the Bomberg Talmud from the Valmadonna Library. Several books have been written about his sales including Tyrannosaurus Sue by Steve Fiffer, Illegal Tender by David Tripp, and The One-Cent Magenta by James Barron. Other notable auctions include: The Barry Halper Collection of Baseball Memorabilia, The Washington-Lafayette Cincinnati Medal, James Naismith's manuscript for The Rules of Basketball, The Guidon (flag) from the Battle of Little Bighorn, Robert Kennedy's copy of The Emancipation Proclamation signed by Lincoln, and Treasure from the SS Central America. Privately, Redden sold Gilbert Stuart's Lansdowne Portrait of George Washington to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the papers of Martin Luther King Jr. to the city of Atlanta and the nine Forbes family Fabergé Imperial Easter Eggs. He was also involved in the discovery of the missing first half on the manuscript for Huckleberry Finn. Upon his retirement, Redden was the longest-serving auctioneer in Sotheby's history. == Collusion Scandal == In the 1990s Sotheby's and Christie's colluded on auction commissions and other business practices. Redden, who had no prior knowledge of the crime, was the first staff member at either Christie's or Sotheby's to speak out publicly decrying the criminal activities of the leadership of the two firms. == Acting == Redden performed in the following films: * Jane Austen in Manhattan * Gossip Girl: Season 3, Episode 3 \\"The Lost Boy\\" * A Late Quartet * W.E. ==Boards and Philanthropy== Redden has served as chairman of the following boards: Scenic Hudson, Black Rock Forest, which has created the David Redden Science Conservation Fund which awards grants to scientists of all ages and supports lectures and seminars; The Olana Partnership, the Hudson Highlands Nature Museum, the American Trust for the British Library, and St. Stephen's School in Rome, Italy. He also served on the boards of the Hudson Highlands Land Trust, the Chelsea Square Conservancy, Friends of Hudson River Park, Madison Square Boys & Girls Club, and the Theater Institute at Storm King. While serving as Chairman of Scenic Hudson, he led $50 million in preservation efforts and land acquisitions. He and his wife have donated conservation easements over a portion of their Storm King Mountain property to the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. For many years he was a sought-after auctioneer for charity benefits. == ALS == In 2017 Redden was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The physical decline associated with ALS allowed Redden to devote his time to the editing of his very extensive Private Diary of a Sotheby’s Auctioneer. In 2019 his family created the David Redden ALS Fund to benefit ALS research and treatment. == Personal life == In 1978 Redden married Jeannette, currently a Commissioner of the Palisades Interstate Park. They have two children, Stephen and Clare. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Guangzhou Category:Sotheby's people Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:American auctioneers Category:American philanthropists Category:1949 births ","title":"David Redden"},{"id":"56896997","text":"Hồ Tấn Tài (born 6 November 1997) is a Vietnamese footballer who plays as a defender for V-League (Vietnam) club Becamex Bình Dương and the Vietnam national football team.

Cuq, S. Mandato, R. Jeantet, K. Saleh and T. Ruiz, 7 - Agglomeration/granulation in food powder production, In Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition, Woodhead Publishing, 2013, Pages 150-177, Handbook of Food Powders. Agglomeration can be achieved through processes that use liquid as a binder (wet methods) or methods that do not involve any binder (dry methods). ==Description== The liquid used in wet methods can be added directly to the product or via a humid environment. Using a fluidized bed dryer and multiple step spray drying are two examples of wet methods while roller compacting and extrusion are two examples of dry methods. Advantages of agglomeration for food include: # Dust reduction: Dust reduction is achieved when the smallest particles (or \\"fines\\") in the product are combined into larger particles. # Improved flow: Flow improvement occurs as the larger, and sometimes more spherical, particles more easily pass over each other than the smaller or more irregularly-shaped particles in the original material. # Improved dispersion and/or solubility: Improved dispersion and solubility is sometimes achieved with instantization, in which the solubility of a product allows it to instantly dissolve upon its addition to water. For a powder to be considered instant it should go through wettability, sinkability, dispersibility, and solubility within a few seconds.Fellows, Peter. Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practice. Second ed., CRC Press, 2009. Non-fat dry milk and high quality protein powders are good examples of instant powders. # Optimized bulk density: Consistent bulk density is important in accurate and consistent filling of packaging. # Improved product characteristicsFeeco International. \\"The Agglomeration Handbook.\\" http://go.feeco.com/acton/attachment/12345/f-00b2/1/-/-/-/-/Agglomeration- Handbook.pdf # Increased homogeneity of the finished product, reducing segregation of fine particles (such as powdered vitamins or spray-dried flavors) from larger particles (such as granulated sugars or acids). As a powder is agitated, smaller particles will fall to the bottom, and larger raise to the top. Agglomeration can reduce the range of particle sizes present in the product, reducing segregation. Disadvantages of food agglomeration: # Extra cost. The benefits of handling an agglomerate often outweigh the extra cost involved in processing. # Additional processing time. Agglomeration of a finished blend is an additional step after blending. Particle size distribution is an important parameter to monitor in agglomerated food products. In both wet and dry agglomeration, particles of undesired sizes must be removed to ensure the best possible finished product performance. High- powered cyclones are the most common way to separate undesired fine particles (or \\"fines\\") from larger agglomerates (or \\"overs\\"). Cyclones utilize the combination of wind power and the different densities of the two products to pull the fines out of the mix. The fines can then be reworked through the agglomeration process to reduce yield loss. In contrast, shaker screens are often used to separate out the overs from the rest of the product. The overs can be reworked into the process by first being broken into smaller particles. == Wet agglomeration methods== Wet agglomeration is a process that introduces a liquid binder to develop adhesion forces between the dry particles to be agglomerated. Mixing disperses the liquid over the particles evenly and promotes growth of the aggregate to the desired size. A final drying step is required to stabilize the agglomerates. In all wet agglomeration methods, the first step is wetting the particles. This initiates adhesion forces between the particles. The next step, nucleation, is the process by which the native particles come together and are held with liquid bridges and capillary forces. Then, through coalescence or the growth phase, these small groups of particles come together to create larger particles until the particles are the desired size. Consolidation occurs as the agglomerates increase in density and strength through drying and collisions with other particles. Mixing as the powder dries also causes some particles to break and erode, creating smaller particles and fines. To achieve the correct particle size, erosion and growth must be balanced. The last step in wet agglomeration is the final stabilization through drying. The agglomerated particles are dried to less than 5% water content, and cooled to below their glass transition temperature. Wet agglomeration falls into two categories based on method of agitation: Mechanical mixing and pneumatic mixing. === Pneumatic mixing === Visual Representation of Agglomeration with pneumatic mixing # Steam-jet agglomeration: A continuous process wherein fine powders are exposed to steam to provide the necessary adhesion properties. Agglomeration is controlled by particle size distribution in the raw materials, gas and steam flow conditions and the adhesion forces between the particles. After the steam section the particles are exposed to warm air flowing upwards and countercurrent to the particles, which solidifies the liquid bridges formed between the particles. Advantages: used for many years in the food industry, a continuous process #Spray drying: Spray drying starts with a liquid raw material which is sprayed as fine droplets into heated air which causes the droplets to dry into fine particles. To agglomerate, fully dried particles (collected from the dry air outlet) are re-introduced at the point where the particles are partly dried and still sticky, to collide and create porous agglomerates. Spray drying agglomeration creates irregularly shaped, highly porous particles with excellent instant properties. #Fluid bed agglomeration uses an air stream to both agitate the particles and to dry the agglomerates. Fluidized bed dryers are hot-air driers in which the air is forced up through a layer of product. The air is evenly distributed along the chamber to maintain a uniform velocity and prevent areas of higher velocities. These dryers can either be batch or continuous. Batch processing methods tend to have more uniform moisture content throughout the product after drying whereas continuous driers vary more throughout the process and may require a finishing set. When used for agglomeration, fluidized bed dryers have spray nozzles located at various heights within the chamber, allowing a spray of water or a solution of other ingredients (the binding solution) to be sprayed on the particles as they are fluidized. This encourages the particles to stick together, and can impart other properties to the finished product. Examples of binding solutions are a water/sugar solution, or lecithin. In this method, particle wetting, growth, consolidation, erosion and drying all occur at the same time.Basic diagram that describes the process of creating agglomerated particles via spray dry principles.Diagram of a Fluid Bed Agglomerator === Mechanical mixing === Visual Representation of the Wet Granulation Process in Mechanical Mixing # Pan or disk agglomerators (rarely used for food powders): Pan or disk agglomerators use the rotation of a disk or bowl to agitate the powder as it is sprayed with water. This type of agglomeration creates agglomerates with higher density than agglomerates produced in fluidized beds. # Drum agglomerators: use a drum to agitate the powder as liquid is added via spraying along the drum. This is a continuous process, and the agglomerates are spherical due to the rotation of the drum. Advantages: can successfully agglomerate powders with a wide particle size distribution, and have lower energy needs than fluidized bed agglomerators. Drum agglomerators can handle very large capacities, but this is not an advantage in the food industry. Disadvantage: broad particle size distribution.Le Capitaine, Shane, and Craig Peppin. “Rotary Dryer or Fluid Bed Dryer.” FEECO International Inc., 19 July 2017, feeco.com/rotary-dryer-or-fluid-bed-dryer/. # Mixer agglomeration: Mixer agglomerators agitate the powder with the use of a blade inside a bowl. The geometry of mixer agglomerators vary widely. The blade can be oriented vertically, horizontally or obliquely. Shear is variable, and the wetting solution is sprayed over the bulk of the powder as it is mixing. Advantages: can work with powders of large particle size distribution, and allow for good distribution of viscous liquids. Equipment is straight forward and common. This type of agglomeration results in relatively dense and spherical agglomerates. == Dry agglomeration methods == Dry agglomeration is agglomeration performed without water or binding liquids, instead using compression only. === Roller compaction === Schematic of a Roller Compactor, Patent US7998505B2, Figure 3Roller compaction is a process in which powders are forced between two rolls, which compress the powders into dense sticks or sheets. These sticks or sheets are then ground into granules. Material properties will affect the mechanical properties of the resulting granules. Food particles with crystalline structures will deform plastically under pressure, and amorphous materials will deform viscoelastically. Roller compaction is more commonly used on individual ingredients of a finished powdered food product, than on a blend of ingredients producing a granulated finished product. Some advantages of roller compaction are # No need for binding solution # Dust-free powders are possible # Consistent granule size and bulk density. # Good option for moisture and heat-sensitive materials, as no drying is required.http://www.welchdry.com/rollercompaction.html Disadvantages: # May not be easily soluble in cold water due to high density and low porosity # High amount of fines which need to be re-worked may be produced # Specialized equipment is required, typically with large batch sizes (> 3k pounds) Examples of agglomerated food powders: Sucrose, sodium chloride, monosodium glutamate and fibers. Roller-compacted sheets and powder after milling === Extrusion === Extrusion is executed by mixing the powder with liquid, additives, or dispersants and then compressing the mixture and forcing it through a die. The product is then dried and broken down to the desired particle size.Dhanalakshmi, K., et al. “Agglomeration of Food Powder and Applications.” Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, vol. 51, no. 5, 2011, pp. 432–441., doi:10.1080/10408391003646270. Extruded powders are dense. Extrusion is typically used for ingredients such as minerals and highly- hygroscopic products which benefit from reduced surface area, as well as products that are subject to oxidation. Extrusion for agglomeration should not be confused with the more common food extrusion process that involves creating a dough that is cooked and expands as it passes through the die. == See also == * Granulation (process) * Particle size * Particle-size distribution * Pelletizing == References  External links == * Welchdry.com Roller Compaction * www.glatt.com Spray Agglomeration * Patent US7998505B2 Category:Food science Category:Particle technology Category:Dried foods ","title":"Agglomerated food powder"},{"id":"56897110","text":"Photocrime is an American television crime drama that was broadcast on ABC from September 28, 1949, until December 14, 1949. The program was also known as Look Photocrime. The program's title and premise -- \\"that photographs often possess clues that are often overlooked\\" initially -- came from an illustrated fictional crime series that ran in Look magazine, and the program was produced in association with Look. However, the concept of an illustrated mystery began with Denis Horton, an insurance clerk in England. The Weekly Illustrated published the first Photocrime in 1935. By 1937, Photocrime was also printed in a number of American newspapers. Chuck Webster portrayed police inspector Hannibal Cobb. Murray Burnett was the producer and writer. Babette Henry was the director. Lack of a sponsor brought the program to an end after 13 weeks. ==Critical reaction== In a review in the trade publication Billboard, Leon Morse wrote that the program's premiere episode \\"represented a measure of noticeable but not spectacular progress in bringing mysteries to the video screen.\\" The \\"Television Daily\\" section of the trade publication Radio Daily welcomed the program's main character as \\"a near-anomaly, a quiet police detective with enough ability and intelligence to get his man.\\" ==Other versions== An unsuccessful pilot episode of a program dramatizing material from the Photocrimes in Look was broadcast on CBS on October 2, 1945.

It was one of the earliest-opened banks in the United States, becoming an official bank in 1819. ==History== The Bank for Savings in the City of New- York was the fourth bank to be opened in the United States and the first savings bank in Manhattan. It was founded in 1816, although it was not incorporated by the NY State Legislature until March 16, 1819. First publicly advertised as \\"A BANK FOR THE POOR\\", it was modeled after similar institutions in Europe; its stated purpose was to \\"effect a secure place of deposit for the earnings of the laboring part of the community: and at the same time to give them the benefit of an accumulation of interest\\". \\" One of the bank's founders, Thomas Eddy, further explained the charitable impetus behind the entity's formation, \\"Among the many philanthropic institutions with which your country abounds, there is none that appears to me more likely to be useful than Savings Banks. They are certainly most admirably calculated to be beneficial to the poor, by promoting among them a spirit of independence, economy and industry.\\" The bank's first location was at Chambers Street. The site became equally famous for being the venue where the first Egyptian mummy was displayed in the United States in 1824. The bank then moved to Bleecker Street (April 10, 1856), at which time it became familiarly called the Bleecker Street Savings Bank. During the Civil War, the bank was reputed to be a bellwether of the nation's prosperity with the bank holding over eleven million dollars but also boasting the largest number of depositors from the working class in New York State. Following a fire that badly damaged the building, the bank moved from Bleecker to 280 Fourth Avenue at Twenty-second Street on August 15, 1894. A large white marble Romanesque structure was designed by Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz. Later headquarters were located on Park Avenue South. ==Notable Directors== Among its founders and first directors were Thomas Eddy, William Bayard Jr., DeWitt Clinton, Archibald Gracie, Cadwallader D. Colden, John Pintard, Matthew Clarkson, Peter Augustus Jay and Brockholst Livingston. Although many credit Eddy with founding the institution, Bayard, who was also a director of the Bank of America founded by Amadeo Giannini, served as the bank's first president. Other famous directors included Frederic James de Peyster, a prominent soldier and philanthropist as well as politician Hamilton Fish who stepped down from the board when he became US Secretary of State. ==Demise== It later merged with the Buffalo Savings Bank in 1982 and its name was subsequently changed to Goldome. It failed in 1991 along with a number of other banks.

Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing and rejected suggestions he was a Libyan agent of influence during his tenure as president of France. He has since officially been charged for corruption on March 21, 2018. ==Background2007 election=== In May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France in a six-point victory over Ségolène Royal. Sarkozy officially spent €21 million on his campaign. The size of the campaign spend, relative to those seen in United States elections, prompted French scholar Sophie Meunier to later declare that \\"French politicians are, therefore, not enslaved to special interests or Super-PACs as they are in the U.S.\\" During the 2007 French election, candidates were limited to spending no more than €21 million, and no single person could donate in excess of €7500 to a candidate. In addition, the sources of donations had to be publicly declared and contributions from foreign nationals were prohibited. ===Libyan détente and later reversal=== In December 2007, following Sarkozy's inauguration as President of France, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi visited the country on Sarkozy's invitation but over the objections of both the political opposition and members of Sarkozy's own government. The visit marked the first time Gaddafi had been to France in more than 35 years and, during the visit, France agreed to sell Libya 21 Airbus aircraft and signed a nuclear cooperation agreement. Negotiations for the purchase of more than a dozen Dassault Rafale fighter jets, plus military helicopters, were also initiated during the trip. In 2011, France, under Sarkozy, voted for international military intervention in the Libyan Civil War against the Gaddafi government in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 and, subsequently, attacked Libyan government forces in Opération Harmattan, in support of the National Transitional Council. France stated the move was to protect Libyan civilians. ==Allegations== The same month French forces were committed to the Libyan conflict, Saif-al-Islam Gaddafi, a son of Muammar Gaddafi, gave an interview to euronews in which he first publicly claimed that the Libyan state had donated €50 million to Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for access and favors by Sarkozy. Sarkozy rejected the claim by Gaddafi. The sale of two Andries van Eertvelt (pictured) paintings by Claude Guéant has become a central question in the investigation. The following October, the claim of Libyan funding of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign was repeated by former Libyan prime minister Baghdadi Mahmudi. Investigative website Mediapart subsequently published several documents appearing to prove a payment of €50 million, and also published a claim by Ziad Takieddine that he had personally handed three briefcases stuffed with cash to Sarkozy. French magistrates later acquired diaries of former Libyan oil minister Shukri Ghanem in which payments to Sarkozy were mentioned. Shortly thereafter, however, Ghanem was found dead, floating in the Danube in Austria and thereby preventing his corroboration of the diaries. In 2014, television station France 3 released an audio recording made by Delphine Minoui on March 16, 2011, during which Minoui interviewed Muammar Gaddafi. In the recording, Gaddafi tells Minoui that Sarkozy had approached him seeking funds for his presidential election campaign while still serving as French interior minister. In February 2018 Asharq Al-Awsat quoted a source who alleged Sarkozy had promised Libyan representatives improved relations between France and Libya should he be elected president, and that he would wrap-up the matter of the bombing of UTA Flight 772. As recently as 2018, Saif al-Islam reiterated his 2011 claim, and has since also added that a former officer of the Libyan intelligence service was at that time in possession of a recording of a meeting between Muammar Gaddafi and Sarkozy that occurred in Tripoli in 2007 and at which payments were discussed. ==Investigation== In 2013 the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) officially opened an investigation into the allegations of Libyan funding of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. In March 2018, Sarkozy-era interior minister Brice Hortefeux voluntarily appeared before French police for questioning. Several arrests have been made in relation to the inquiry. ===Arrests and charges=== {  - ! Name !! Arrested? !! Charged? !! Background and status -  100px Claude Guéant  March 6, 2015 March 7, 2015  Guéant, the former chief of staff to Sarkozy, was arrested and charged in March 2015 with money laundering and forgery in relation to the alleged Libyan funding affair. According to investigators, Guéant helped facilitate the transfer of Libyan funds and may have received $500,000 for his efforts, however, Guéant has claimed the money came from his sale of two Andries van Eertvelt paintings to a Malaysian attorney, with the sale arranged by Saudi businessman Khalid Bugshan. Authorities allege the transfer of the paintings, which were competitively valued at $35,000, was organized by Bugshan as a means of laundering the purported Libyan payment. -  Khalid Ali Bugshan  March 6, 2015  Saudi businessman Khalid Ali Bugshan was taken into police custody for questioning the same day as Claude Guéant. -  François Guéant  March 30, 2015  François Guéant, the son of Claude Guéant, was taken into police custody in March 2015 for questioning over the alleged affair in a matter separate from his father's sale of van Eertvelt paintings. -  Alexandre Djouhri  January 9, 2018   Djouhri was arrested by British police at Heathrow Airport on a European Arrest Warrant which had been issued after he refused to appear at a court in Paris for questioning over the Libyan affair. Djouhri resisted extradition to France, with attorneys claiming the inquiry was politically motivated and expressing concern about French prison conditions. He was released on $1.4 million bail pending the outcome of his appeal of the arrest warrant, but was ultimately returned to France and placed in pre-trial detention in advance of a hearing scheduled for March 28, 2018 Djouhri, a French citizen of Algerian heritage who resides in Switzerland, is alleged to have sold a €4.4 million villa in the south of France to the Bashir Saleh Bashir-managed Libya Africa Investment Portfolio for €10 million. The overpayment was purportedly used to launder funds to Sarkozy. -  100px Nicolas Sarkozy  March 20, 2018 March 21, 2018  Sarkozy was detained by French police for questioning in March 2018, during which he was held at the Nanterre station of the DCPJ, west of Paris. On March 21 he was charged with corruption. Officially, Sarkozy is under formal investigation, meaning judicial authorities have been presented with sufficient evidence by police to begin a full inquiry by an investigating magistrate, which would possibly lead to a trial. } ==Reaction== Sarkozy's political party, The Republicans, issued a statement following his arrest in which it said the former president had the party's full support. Spokesman Christian Jacob later suggested that the accusations against Sarkozy were politically motivated. Following Sarkozy's arrest, Eric Ciotti expressed confidence the former president would be exonerated. ==See also== * Bettencourt affair * France–Libya relations * London School of Economics Gaddafi links ==NotesReferences== Category:2018 in French politics Category:2018 scandals Category:Foreign electoral intervention Category:France–Libya relations Category:2007 French presidential election Category:Muammar Gaddafi Category:Nicolas Sarkozy Category:Political scandals in France Category:March 2018 events in France Category:Allegations ","title":"Alleged Libyan financing in the 2007 French presidential election"},{"id":"56897245","text":"The Ministry of Culture and Tourism, abbreviated as MCT () is a ministry responsible for formulating cultural and tourism policies of Mainland China.

It succeeded Windows Server 2016, announced on March 20, 2018 and being officially released to the public on October 2, 2018. == Development and release == Windows Server 2019 was announced on March 20, 2018, and the first Windows Insider preview version was released on the same day. It was released for general availability on October 2 of the same year. On October 6, 2018, distribution of Windows version 1809 (build 17763) was paused while Microsoft investigated an issue with user data being deleted during an in-place upgrade. It affected systems where a user profile folder (e.g. Documents, Music or Pictures) had been moved to another location, but data was left in the original location. As Windows Server 2019 is based on the Windows version 1809 codebase, it too was removed from distribution at the time, but was re-released on November 13, 2018.

Movie World in Gold Coast, Queensland Australia. The term incident refers to major injury, injuries, deaths, and significant crimes. While these incidents are required to be reported to regulatory authorities for investigation, attraction-related incidents usually fall into one of these following categories: * Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance. * Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules. * The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues. * Act of God or a generic accident (e.g. slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action on anyone's part. ==Arkham Asylum – Shock Therapy== *On 10 January 2017, around noon, the coaster's lift chain malfunctioned, leaving 19 women and one man stuck on top of the lift hill for 40 minutes. Firefighters used a cherry picker to rescue four of the patrons while the rest descended via a staircase on the lift. ==DC Rivals HyperCoaster== *On 29 July 2019, a 10-year-old girl was struck in the face by a bird while riding the coaster. Fortunately, she did not suffer any serious injuries. ==Doomsday Destroyer== *On 31 January 2018, the ride safety operating system automatically engaged trapping guests upside down for three minutes. No firefighters or paramedics were called. The ride was due for maintenance in August 2018. ==Guest Altercations== *In December 2008, 14-year-old Corey Cross was on a field-trip to Movie World when he was knocked down in a crowd, resulting in a broken wrist. He took the park to court, suing them for lost wages, due to him being unable to work as a paperboy with a broken wrist. The park settled out of court in 2010. ==Green Lantern Coaster== *On 8 January 2013, the coaster stopped on the tracks twice. Before noon, eight teenagers were stuck on the ride for 70 minutes due to a minor wiring issue. Later, eight more teenagers were stuck on the ride for half an hour while the problem was identified and fixed. *On 15 March 2015, one car of a train became detached from rails when a wheel mechanism broke. A Queensland Fire Service Inspector described it as \\"a fairly catastrophic failure of the carriage\\" that was the \\"first time we'd ever seen the actual failure of the machinery\\". An investigation revealed that there was a design flaw in the wheel assembly dealing with a bolted joint, and that there was \\"really nothing that Movie World could have done to prevent it. S&S; Worldwide redesigned the flawed components, and tested the ride, before it reopened to the public on December 16, 2015. *On 19 November 2016, the coaster stopped on the tracks for 30 minutes due to a \\"computer fault\\", leaving sixteen guests stuck on the ride. ==Police Academy Stunt Show== *On 5 February 2003, three experienced pyrotechnic workers suffered serious burns to their faces, bodies and hands in a powerful explosion at the Warner Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast. ==See also== * Incidents at Warner Bros. parks * Amusement park accidents ==References== Category:Warner Bros.

This bay extends into the cantons of Nevers (northern part), Delage (southern part) and Leblanc (eastern part). Following the erection completed in 1948 of the dam Gouin, the current form of \\"Baie Bouzanquet\\" was shaped by the raising of the waters of Gouin reservoir. Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second. The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the southern part of Bouzanquet Bay, as well as the river valleys Jean-Pierre and Leblanc; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities. The surface of Baie Bouzanquet is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March. == Geography Toponymy== This toponym evokes the work of life of Gaston Bouzanquet, officer of the Legion of Honor and corresponding member of the Society of Geography of Quebec. Bouzanquet published in the Bulletin of the latter (volume 22, numbers 1 and 2, 1928), a text dedicated to the history of New France and to Monsieur de Montcalm in particular. Bouzanquet served as delegate of the committee of Vauvert at the inauguration of the monument of Montcalm, in 1911, in Quebec City.

Michael McFaul, as part of an investigation into financial crimes that the Russian government alleges against American hedge-fund manager Bill Browder. Trump did not immediately decline the request, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that Trump is \\"gonna meet with his team\\" regarding the request.  President Trump replies \\"no\\". -  Thursday, July 19  *After a non-binding resolution to oppose permitting Russian investigators to interrogate any American citizen passes in the United States Senate by a vote of 98–0, the Trump administration issues a statement that the request \\"was made in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it\\". *Trump invites Russian President Vladimir Putin to Washington, D.C., in the fall, according to a tweet from Sarah Huckabee Sanders. *Dan Coats (the Director of National Intelligence) reacts to the news of the Putin invitation in a manner deemed by White House officials to be \\"laughing at the president\\", and a senior White House official anonymously says to The Washington Post that \\"Coats has gone rogue\\".  -  Friday, July 20  *The New York Times reports that Trump's long-time lawyer, Michael Cohen, secretly recorded a phone call in which Trump and Cohen discuss a September 2016 payment, in the amount of $150,000, by American Media, Inc. (the owner of the National Enquirer) to Playboy model Karen McDougal in order to acquire the exclusive rights to her story of her 2006 affair with Trump. The National Enquirer never planned on publishing McDougal's story, so the payment (termed a \\"catch and kill\\" payment) effectively silenced McDougal's story for the duration of the 2016 presidential campaign. The Times also reported that the tape contains a discussion of a back-payment from Trump to American Media, Inc.; the reporting directly contradicted Trump's long-standing claim that he had no knowledge of the payment to either McDougal or American Media, Inc. *Rudy Giuliani, Trump's legal adviser, comments that the tape is, in fact, \\"powerful exculpatory evidence\\". Some commentators conclude that Trump's legal team, not Cohen's legal team, had leaked the tape to the media; the tape had originally been shielded from prosecutors due to attorney–client privilege, which was waived by Trump's legal team. Some commentators speculate that Trump's legal team released the tape partly to deny Cohen a bargaining device in potential plea negotiations involving cooperation with federal investigations. *Special counsel Robert Mueller moves to subpoena Kristin Davis, the prostitution mogul known as the \\"Manhattan Madam\\". Davis had been best known for her role in the 2008 prostitution scandal involving then-Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York, but she was also a former employee of Roger Stone, a Republican political operative and strategist for Trump.  -  Saturday, July 21  *  -  Sunday, July 22  *Trump tweets that Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections is \\"all a big hoax\\", appearing to reverse his position yet again on whether the Russian government interfered (and continues to attempt to interfere) in U.S. elections. *Trump tweets a threat to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani: > NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES > THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE > NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & > DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS! The threat was the culmination of a weekend of intense rhetorical exchange between the Trump administration and the Rouhani administration. Trump's tweet was in response to Rouhani's message that war with Iran would be \\"the mother of all wars\\"; Rouhani also warned Trump to \\"not play with the lion's tail, because you will regret it eternally\\". Rouhani's message was, in turn, in response to a scathing speech made by Mike Pompeo (the U.S. Secretary of State), which included an allegation that Rouhani owns a $95 billion hedge fund; Pompeo also stated that \\"to the [Iranian] regime, prosperity, security, and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill the Revolution\\", and that \\"the level of corruption and wealth among regime leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government\\".  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 79 -  Monday, July 23  *President Trump publicly considers revoking security clearances for former top-level officials (including John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, and Michael Hayden); Trump claims that the former officials' public comments about the Special Counsel investigation are \\"inappropriate\\", and Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the former officials of \\"politicizing and... monetizing their public service\\". *The Senate confirms Robert Wilkie as the 10th U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs in a vote of 86–9; Wilkie served as an under-secretary in the U.S. Department of Defense since November 2017 (and previously from 2006 to 2009 under President George W. Bush) and also served as acting Veterans' Affairs secretary from March 2018 to May 2018 following David Shulkin's resignation. *President Trump launches \\"Made in America Week\\" at the White House by showcasing products made in all 50 states.  President Trump at the White House Made in America showcase. -  Tuesday, July 24  *At a speech to the annual convention of a veterans' organization (Veterans of Foreign Wars) in Kansas City, Trump says that \\"what you're seeing and what you're reading [in the media] is not what's happening\\". Some observers describe this quote as \\"Orwellian\\". *The September 2016 tape, the existence of which was revealed on July 20, is published by CNN on its 9:00p.m. show, Cuomo Prime Time. The three-minute recording proves that Trump and his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, did discuss the $150,000 payment to American Media, Inc., as claimed on July 20. Moreover, Trump and Cohen can be heard discussing whether to make the payment in cash; on the recording, Trump appears to suggest a cash payment, and Cohen appears to dismiss the suggestion. According to The New York Times, the salient portion of the \\"sometimes muddled\\" recording reads as follows: > Mr. Cohen is heard telling Mr. Trump that he will need to set up a company > to arrange the payments. Mr. Trump then asked, \\"What financing?\\" \\"We'll have > to pay,\\" Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Trump then appears to say, \\"Pay with cash.\\" Mr. > Cohen then says, \\"No, no.\\" The word \\"check\\" is uttered, but it is not clear > by whom, and the audio is then cut off. However, Trump's legal team disputes this.  -  Wednesday, July 25  *Eleven Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee (all members of the House Freedom Caucus) file an impeachment resolution against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, claiming that Rosenstein in his role as overseer of the Special Counsel investigation committed \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" in refusing to turn over information relating to the ongoing investigation to the House Judiciary Committee. *President Trump holds a bilateral meeting and joint press conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House. President Trump and European Commission President Jean- Claude Juncker -  Thursday, July 26  *The House Republicans who filed an impeachment resolution against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on July 26 back down, deciding not to continue with impeachment proceedings. This decision comes after many high-profile Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, criticize the impeachment resolution and express support for Rosenstein. *Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claims that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials (including Trump's son, Don Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner) and Russian lobbyists, where the Trump campaign was promised \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton. While Trump has repeatedly denied that he knew that this meeting took place, Cohen claims that he is prepared to testify to the Special Counsel investigation that Trump knew in advance of the meeting. Commentators note that \\"this revelation, if true, would directly implicate Trump himself in an effort to conspire with a foreign power to tip the election to him, and a subsequent effort to cover that up.\\" Trump tweets in his denial that \\"[it] sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?).\\" *The deadline (imposed on June 26 by Dana Sabraw, a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of California)Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Classwide Preliminary Injunction, Ms. L., et al. v. U.S. immigration & Customs Enforcement, et al., Case No. 18-cv-0428 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018). elapses to reunite all migrant families separated by the Trump administration. The government claims that the deadline has been met, but its court filing shows that 711 children (about a third of the 2,551 children separated from their families), whom the government has deemed \\"ineligible for reunification\\", are still in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.  -  Friday, July 27  *  -  Saturday, July 28  *  -  Sunday, July 29  *Trump tweets a threat to support a government shutdown if Democratic lawmakers do not vote for \\"Border Security, which includes the Wall!\\"  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 80 -  Monday, July 30  *President Trump holds a bilateral meeting and joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House. *After President Trump has claimed \\"no collusion\\" for months, his legal adviser Rudy Giuliani says that \\"I don't even know if [colluding with Russia] is a crime\\". Another Trump adviser, former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, echoes the sentiment, saying that \\"collusion is not a crime\\". While there technically is no crime called 'collusion' in the U.S. Code, legal experts agree that 'collusion' is an informal shorthand for a number of similar charges, especially conspiracy, which are in the Code, and that the difference between 'collusion' and 'conspiracy' is \\"just a word choice\\". Giuliani's and Christie's claims come on the eve of the trial of former Trump campaign chair, Paul Manafort. *Giuliani also claimed the existence of a previously-unknown June 7, 2016, meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian lobbyists preceding the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016; however, Giuliani later said that the meeting \\"never happened\\". Asked how he could be sure that the July 26 claim by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen (that Trump had advance knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting) was false, Giuliani replied, \\"Nobody can be sure of anything\\". *President Trump offers to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with \\"no preconditions\\". This follows a heated exchange between the Trump administration and Rouhani on July 21 and July 22. *Robert Wilkie is sworn in as the 10th U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs. *According to U.S. intelligence agencies, North Korea continues to construct nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States, despite peace talks at the June 12 summit between Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un.  -  Tuesday, July 31  *The trial of former Trump campaign chair, Paul Manafort, begins in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. *Anthony Kennedy retires as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, formalizing a decision announced on June 27. *During a rally in Florida, President Trump defends strict \\"voter ID\\" laws by claiming that Americans are required to show identification to purchase groceries.  } ===August 2018=== {  - !

Many observers note that this tweet raises concerns about possible obstruction of justice, while Rudy Giuliani (Trump's legal adviser) claims that Trump intentionally chose the word \\"should\\" because he was expressing an opinion rather than issuing an order to Sessions; Sarah Huckabee Sanders (the White House Press Secretary) echoes Giuliani's sentiments, saying, \\"It's not an order. It's the president's opinion.\\"  -  Thursday, August 2  *Sarah Huckabee Sanders (the White House Press Secretary) calls the press the \\"enemy of the people\\". *At a press conference, top national security officials (Dan Coats, Kirstjen Nielsen, John Bolton, Christopher Wray, and Paul Nakasone) announce that the administration will \\"make the matter of election meddling and securing our election process a top priority\\". The officials also affirm that the Russian government is attempting to interfere in the U.S. midterm elections, specifically with \\"a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States\\".  -  Friday, August 3  *A Justice Department filing on a case against the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) regarding reunification of separated migrant families argues that it is the responsibility of the plaintiffs (i.e., the ACLU), not the government, to use its \\"considerable resources\\" to find parents of separated children whom the government has already deported. The judge who requested the government filing (Dana Sabraw, a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of California appointed by President George W. Bush) calls the government's slow pace in reuniting the separated families \\"unacceptable\\", and rejects \\"100%\\" the argument that the responsibility is on the ACLU to reunite the families.  -  Saturday, August 4  *  -  Sunday, August 5  *  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 81 -  Monday, August 6  *  -  Tuesday, August 7  *  -  Wednesday, August 8  *  -  Thursday, August 9  *The White House director of strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp, confirms with Univision that Helen Aguirre Ferré, the White House director of media affairs for Latino and African-American news outlets, has resigned from the White House.  -  Friday, August 10  *  -  Saturday, August 11  *  -  Sunday, August 12  *Two days before her memoir (Unhinged) is released, Omarosa Manigault, a former White House aide to Trump primarily known for her prior appearances on The Apprentice, a reality television show formerly hosted by Trump, releases audio recordings of Trump and John Kelly (Trump's White House Chief of Staff) regarding her January 2018 dismissal. Manigault claims that \\"there are tapes of [Trump] using the N-word repeatedly while filming The Apprentice reality series\\".  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 82 -  Monday, August 13  *In a flurry of early-morning tweets, President Trump describes Omarosa Manigault as \\"wacky\\", \\"vicious\\", \\"not smart\\", \\"nasty\\", \\"a loser\\", and \\"a lowlife\\", and claims that she \\"begged [Trump] for a job, tears in her eyes\\". *Prosecutors from the Special Counsel investigation rest their case in the trial of Paul Manafort. *Peter Strzok, an FBI agent and Chief of the Counter-espionage Section who was removed from Mueller's Special Counsel investigation upon the discovery of his anti-Trump texts, is dismissed from the FBI by Deputy Director David Bowdich. Strzok is notorious amongst right-wing legislators and media figures who leaked and scrutinized the text messages which he exchanged with fellow agent Lisa Page and which were falsely alleged to demonstrate anti-Trump bias that would have undermined Strzok's apolitical role as a leading investigator of the Russian government's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. *President Trump signs legislation named the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act while not mentioning the Senator's name.  -  Tuesday, August 14  *President Trump tweets that Omarosa Manigault had been \\"a crazed, crying lowlife\\" when he gave her a job at the White House, describing the appointment as Trump giving Manigault \\"a break\\"; in the same tweet, Trump called Manigault a \\"dog\\". Some commentators express concern that Manigault, whose official title had been Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison, carrying a taxpayer-funded annual salary of $180,000, had been hired out of pity as Trump admits to knowing at the time that she was unqualified for the position.  -  Wednesday, August 15  *President Trump unilaterally revokes the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, citing what Trump alleges to be Brennan's \\"erratic\\" behavior, \\"increasingly frenzied commentary\\", and his \\"series of unfounded and outrageous allegations\\"; many observers agree that this action appears to be retaliation for Brennan's outspokenness on the possible collusion to interfere in the 2016 elections by the Trump campaign and the Russian government being investigated the Special Counsel investigation, especially because Trump did not make an allegation that Brennan mis-handled or mis-used classified information that would have warranted the revocation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump directly connected the revocation of Brennan's security clearance with his frustration at the ongoing Special Counsel investigation.  -  Thursday, August 16  *Former CIA Director John Brennan responds to Trump's unilateral revocation of his security clearance, contending in a New York Times opinion-editorial, that \\"Trump's 'no collusion' claims are hogwash\\", and that Trump \\"revoked [Brennan's] security clearance to try to silence anyone who would dare challenge him\\". In addition, William McRaven, a navy admiral best known for his role as special operations commander overseeing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, publicly expresses a political position by authoring an opinion-editorial in The Washington Post in defense of Brennan; McRaven dares Trump to also revoke his security clearance, writing: > I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as > well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up > against your presidency. In response, President Trump threatens to revoke the security clearances of more former top-level intelligence officials. Observers draw comparisons between Trump's list of officials whose security clearances he threatens to revoke (which includes James Clapper, James Comey, Michael Hayden, Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr) and Richard Nixon's Enemies List. *Hundreds of newspapers across the United States publish editorials emphasizing the importance of the freedom of the press, a right which is guaranteed by the First Amendment. (The newspapers coordinated the publication date of the editorials, but each wrote an editorial independently.) The effort is in response to recent attacks by the Trump administration on the press, especially to combat the appellation, \\"enemy of the people\\".  -  Friday, August 17  *President Trump tweets that the military parade scheduled for November 2018 will be postponed due to cost. Trump blames \\"the local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly)\\" of price gouging in reporting the estimated cost of the parade as $92 million, which covers $50 million for military equipment and aircraft, and $42 million for municipal costs such as security. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis accuses the individual writing the report asserting the $92 million figure of \\"probably smoking something that is legal in my state but not in most\\". Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser responds by tweeting: > Yup, I'm Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington DC, the local politician who > finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities > ($21.6M) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad). OMB Director Mick Mulvaney says that there were other non-monetary considerations that factored into the decision to postpone the parade; Mulvaney would not specify the other \\"contributing factors\\".  -  Saturday, August 18  *The New York Times reports that the White House Counsel, Don McGahn, has testified for nearly thirty hours in three voluntary interviews with investigators working on the Special Counsel investigation. According to the report, Trump and his lawyers allowed McGahn to testify, and did not ask for a de-briefing of the content of his testimony, which included the manner in which FBI Director James Comey was dismissed, as well as other personnel- related matters, including Trump's \\"obsession with putting a loyalist in charge of the [Special Counsel] inquiry\\". In response to the report, Trump tweets that \\"disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Counsel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.\\"  -  Sunday, August 19  *In an interview on Meet the Press, a news program on NBC hosted by Chuck Todd, Trump's legal adviser Rudy Giuliani says that \\"truth isn't truth\\". Giuliani later clarified that he was \\"referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements, the classic 'he said, she said' puzzle\\". Many observers, noting that this is the latest in a sequence of unusual statements, including Kellyanne Conway's \\"alternative facts\\", Trump's \\"fake news\\", and Trump's recent claim that \\"what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening\\", draw comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984.  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 83 -  Monday, August 20  *President Trump attacks Bruce Ohr, a current senior Justice Department official, asking whether he will \\"ever be fired\\". Trump has attacked Ohr numerous times since August 11, alleging that he and his wife, Nellie, had been involved both in gathering information for the \\"Steele dossier\\" and in starting the FBI investigation into the Russian government's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, the firm which commissioned the dossier, and Bruce Ohr had contact with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, throughout its production. However, there is no evidence that Ohr had any involvement with either the FBI investigation or the Special Counsel investigation. *The New York Times reports that Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is under investigation for bank fraud and tax evasion relating to loans amounting to $20 million, taken for Cohen's taxi medallion venture.  -  Tuesday, August 21  *The first trial of Paul Manafort, former chair of the Trump campaign, concludes, with the jury finding Manafort guilty on five counts of tax evasion, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account; Manafort is acquitted on zero counts, and the judge, senior judge T. S. Ellis III of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, declares a mis-trial on the remaining ten counts. *Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, pleads guilty to five counts of tax evasion, two counts of campaign finance violations, and one count of bank fraud. The campaign finance violations relate to Cohen's arrangement of payments in 2016 with American Media, Inc. to purchase the exclusive rights to the stories of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, regarding their affairs with then-candidate Trump; these are regarded as \\"in-kind contributions\\" to Trump's campaign, and exceeded the maximum amount allowable by U.S. campaign finance law. In the court proceedings, Cohen makes a prepared statement on the charges, describing the counts in his own words; Cohen implicates Trump on the two counts of campaign finance violations, saying under oath, and under penalty of perjury, that he made the illegal campaign contributions \\"in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office [Trump]\\". Trump denies that he directed Cohen to make the payments.  Trump comments about Manafort conviction -  Wednesday, August 22  *President Trump makes a video statement on the death of Mollie Tibbetts. *The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance issues a subpoena to Michael Cohen (Trump's former personal attorney), as part of its ongoing investigation into whether the Donald J. Trump Foundation violated New York tax law. (Note that this is a separate investigation from the lawsuit filed in June 2018 by the office of the N.Y. Attorney General, Barbara Underwood, alleging that the Trump Foundation, which is subject to laws concerning charitable organizations, functioned as \\"little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his business to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality\\".)

A report by the Associated Press indicates that, during the 2016 election, the National Enquirer hid stories to which it had gained exclusive rights, but which were damaging to Trump, in a safe, as a form of 'friendly blackmail'; a National Enquirer reporter told the Associated Press, \\"It's 'I did this for you, now what can you do for me'... they [the National Enquirer] always got something in return.\\"  -  Friday, August 24  *  -  Saturday, August 25  *  -  Sunday, August 26  *  - style=\\"background:white;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  Week 84 -  Monday, August 27  *President Trump holds a bilateral meeting with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House.

He first gained recognition in 2017, when his songs \\"Mr. Clean\\" and \\"1 Thot 2 Thot Red Thot Blue Thot\\" gained traction on SoundCloud, the former of which is now RIAA certified Platinum and the latter of which is now RIAA certified Gold. Since 2017, Yung Gravy has completed seven international tours and has released one mixtape, three albums, and four EPs. Yung Gravy is often associated with fellow artists Chief Keef , Lil Baby, and bbno$, as well as producers Y2K, Jason Rich, and Engelwood. ==Early life== Matthew Hauri was born in Rochester, Minnesota. He attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, and earned his degree in marketing in December 2017. While attending college, he began rapping for fun and started his career on SoundCloud after being inspired by the rise of rappers Lil Yachty and Lil Peep. In 2016, he quit his job and dedicated himself to making music, spending months self-recording songs. ==Style== Yung Gravy's musical style is a blend of modern trap music with themes inspired by the soul and oldies movements of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as 1970s and 1980s soul and funk music. For example, his song \\"Gravy Train\\" samples Maxine Nightingale's the 1976 song \\"Right Back Where We Started From\\", and his breakout hit \\"Mr. Clean\\" samples the popular 1954 song \\"Mr. Sandman\\" by The Chordettes. His musical style has been described as humorous, satirical, and groovy. Yung Gravy has cited musicians from multiple genres as inspirations. They include hip-hop acts such as OutKast and Three 6 Mafia, and soul acts ranging from Smokey Robinson to The Blackbyrds. ==DiscographyAlbums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of albums, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"  Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" US - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Sensational  *Released: May 31, 2019 *Label: Republic *Formats: Digital download, streaming, vinyl  52 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Baby Gravy 2 (with bbno$)  *Released: February 14, 2020 *Label: Republic *Formats: Digital download, streaming, vinyl  188 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gasanova  *Released: October 2, 2020 *Label: Republic *Formats: Digital download, streaming  52 } ===Extended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of extended plays, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Mr. Clean  *Released: September 8, 2016 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Yung Gravity  *Released: April 20, 2017 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Baby Gravy (with bbno$)  *Released: October 11, 2017 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Snow Cougar  *Released: May 4, 2018 *Label: Republic *Format: Digital download } ===Mixtapes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of mixtapes, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Thanksgiving's Eve  *Released: December 23, 2016 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of singles as lead artist, with showing year released and album name ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year !Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" NZ Hot - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Mr. Clean\\"  2016 —  * RIAA: Platinum Mr. Clean and Snow Cougar - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Cheryl\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2017 —   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"1 Thot 2 Thot Red Thot Blue Thot\\" —  * RIAA: Gold  Snow Cougar and Sensational - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Knockout\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2018 —  Snow Cougar - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Pizzazz\\" —   rowspan=\\"4\\" Sensational - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Alley Oop\\" —  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Magic\\"  rowspan=\\"5\\"  2019 —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Buttered Up\\" —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Tampa Bay Bustdown\\" —   - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Shining on My Ex\\" (with bbno$) 25  I Don’t Care at All and Baby Gravy 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"iunno\\" (with bbno$) 21   rowspan=\\"3\\" Baby Gravy 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Welcome to Chilis\\" (with bbno$)  rowspan=\\"5\\" 2020 40  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Off the Goop\\" (with bbno$ featuring Cuco) —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Jack Money Bean\\" (with bbno$ and Lentra)  —   rowspan=\\"3\\" Gasanova - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"yup!\\" —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Gas Money\\" —  } == References == Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Midwest hip hop musicians Category:People from Rochester, Minnesota Category:Rappers from Minnesota Category:Songwriters from Minnesota Category:21st-century American rappers ","title":"Yung Gravy"},{"id":"56897596","text":"The 2018 GEICO 500 was a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race held on April 29, 2018, at Talladega Superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama.

The practice was marred by a three-car crash on the back-straightaway that resulted in McMurray barrel rolling several times into the inside catchfence while Ty Dillon and Ryan Newman were also involved. “When I realized I was going to flip, I actually shut my eyes because I don’t really want to see what’s getting ready to happen,” McMurray said. “And then it just kept, it seemed like forever. I opened my eyes a couple times and I couldn’t, I’m like I don’t know if I’m going up or down or where it’s going to hit next. So I was just thankful when it finally … a couple of times I thought it was going to stop and it just kind of kept going.” McMurray's accident led to NASCAR reducing the restrictor plates from 7/8th to 55/64th of an inch. {  style=\\"font- size:95%\\" - !

He held various positions in the economic and political administration of Brazil after the transfer or the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808, including Deputy of the Royal Chamber of Commerce (Junta do Comércio) and Judge of the House of Supplication (Casa da Suplicação - a court of appeal). Cairu played an important role in encouraging the teaching of political economy in the country, and participated actively in the drafting of the decrees that determined the opening of Brazilian ports (ending the Exclusive Metropolitan Trade, by which Brazil could only trade with Portugal) and the end of the prohibition of manufactures in Brazil. His attitude favorable to the economic development of the United Kingdom of Brazil would end up contributing significantly to the conditions indispensable to the political independence of Brazil in 1822. For his contributions, the Viscount of Cairu figures \\"with place of honor in the pantheon of the heroes of the Brazilian homeland\\". ==Studies== Son of a Portuguese architect, Henrique da Silva Lisboa, and Helena Nunes de Jesus, José studied in Bahia from the age of eight, especially philosophy, music and piano. He completed his studies at the University of Coimbra, where he followed legal and philosophical courses from 1774, graduating in 1778. Bachelor in canons by the University of Coimbra, he was appointed professor of national and moral philosophy for the city of Salvador, Bahia, chair which he held for 19 years, besides having created the chair of Greek language in the city.DA SILVEIRA, Itamar Flávio; DE CARVALHO, Suelem Halim Nardo. Visconde de Cairu. MISES: Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy, Law and Economics, v. 1, n. 1, p. 129-134, 2013. Available at: https://revistamises.org.br/misesjournal/article/download/201/125 ==Public creer== In 1797 he returned to Portugal, obtaining his retirement and the appointment to the place of deputy and secretary of the Inspection Bureau of sugar and Bahia Tobacco (Mesa da Inspeção da Bahia), where he took office in 1798 and stayed until 1808. In 1801 he published his first book Principles of Mercantile Law and Laws of the Navy for the use of the Portuguese youth, which includes maritime insurance, maritime exchange, damages, bills of exchange, merchant contracts, courts and causes of trade (or Princípios do Direito Mercantil e Leis da Marinha para uso da mocidade portuguesa, que compreende o seguro marítimo, o câmbio marítimo, as avarias, as letras de câmbio, os contratos mercantes, os tribunais e as causas de comércio). In 1804 he published his main work, the Principles of Political Economy (Princípios de economia política), the first Portuguese-written book inspired in Adam Smith's work When Dom Joao VI arrived in Bahia in 1808, Cairu drew up a representation of merchants from Salvador, in which they requested the opening of the Brazilian ports to the friendly nations of Portugal, which resulted in the Royal Charter of January 24, 1808. D. João ordered Silva Lisboa to accompany him to Rio de Janeiro, where he arrived on March 7, and in the following April he was appointed judge of the Supreme Court (Desembargo do Paço). In August 1808 he was appointed deputy of the Royal Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation of the State of Brazil; in 1809 he was charged with organizing a code of commerce; and in 1815 he was in charge of the examination of the works for printing. Silva Lisboa tried to reconcile Portugal and Brazil and prevent the separation between them, and for this he founded a newspaper, The Conciliador of the United Kingdom (O Conciliador do Reino Unido), in which he defended the rights of the Prince and pondered the advantages of the continental monarchy. When the hope for conciliation disappeared, and in order not to lose the support of the crown, Lisboa did not hesitate to fight for the independence movement led by the prince regent D. Pedro I. Defender of the centralization of the power, Silva Lisboa fought in the press the revolutionaries of the Confederation of the Equator and polemizou with the Typhis Pernambucano of Frei Caneca. After independence, he continued to hold high positions, receiving honorary distinctions. He was awarded in 1825 with the title of Baron and later in 1826 as Viscount of Cairu, and was later chosen as senator of the Brazilian Empire. In 1832, he began to fight for the creation of a University in Rio de Janeiro, a fact only concretized almost a hundred years later, with the foundation of UFRJ. ==References== Category:1756 births Category:1835 deaths Category:Brazilian economists Category:Brazilian historians Category:Brazilian politicians Category:18th-century Brazilian people Category:19th-century Brazilian people ","title":"José da Silva Lisboa"},{"id":"56897613","text":"Sergio Giavanni Kitchens (born June 14, 1993), known professionally as Gunna, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter.

Gunna was later featured on Young Thug's song \\"Floyd Mayweather\\" in August 2016. The song is from Young Thug's mixtape, Jeffery, and also features vocals from American rappers Travis Scott and Gucci Mane. Also, in October 2016, Gunna released his debut mixtape Drip Season through YSL Records. He released the mixtape Drip Season 2 in May 2017.

Gunna was also featured on Travis Scott's single \\"Yosemite\\", which was considered the most popular song in which he used the word \\"drip\\". The song is from Scott's third studio album, Astroworld, and also features vocals from Nav, whose voice was mixed unusually quietly in the song and was the subject of the memes and jokes. The comments on Nav's vocals got to the point where he even acknowledged them, poking fun at his own vocals on his Instagram. Scott and the song's producer, Mike Dean, turned up his vocals a week after the song's release. Scott's verse in \\"Yosemite\\" mimics Gunna's verse in \\"Sold Out Dates\\". In October 2018, he and Lil Baby released their collaborative album, Drip Harder, which includes the lead single, \\"Drip Too Hard,\\" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Gunna denied the accusations by Tec and commented \\"you better do the history\\" to prove it was not him. Tec also claimed that Young Thug's clothing brand, SPIDER, copied his clothing brand, Spider Nation. Tec believed that it was \\"stealing his image\\". People claimed that the person who said \\"it was him, Officer\\" on Crimestoppers was Gunna. On June 8, 2020 gunshots were fired during the filming of a music video for Gunna and Lil Keed's song \\"Fox 5\\". The shooting resulted in 2 people with non-life-threatening injuries. ===Legal issues=== On June 3, 2018, Gunna and his DJ were en route to Jonesboro, Arkansas to perform at the Diamond Grill. They were lost on the way, and asked a police officer for directions. When the officer went by their grey SUV, he smelled marijuana, ecstasy, and other drugs. He immediately searched the car and found in them an edible marijuana box. Both Gunna and his DJ were arrested. They were released on bond for $2,500 the next day and were due back in court on July 27. == Discography == * Drip or Drown 2 (2019) * Wunna (2020) ==ReferencesWebsite Category:1993 births Category:African-American male rappers Category:Living people Category:Rappers from Atlanta Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:People from College Park, Georgia Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:African-American male singers Category:African-American songwriters Category:Crips Category:Mumble rappers ","title":"Gunna (rapper)"},{"id":"56897620","text":"Richard (Rick) Brook is the most successful boys basketball coach in the history of Sebring McKinley High School (1968–1999); compiling 554 wins over 32 seasons (77%).

After graduating secondary school in 1939 she entered the 1st Moscow State Medical Institute where she studied until the start of the war. Initially she remained a civilian and worked in the construction of defensive fortifications around Moscow. She eventually got word that women were being recruited for aviation units, and non-pilot staff were needed, so she and her friend Khiuaz Dospanova made an appointment to meet with Marina Raskova, who asked met with her if she was willing to become a navigator. == Military career == Upon being accepted into the women's aviation program in October 1941, Sumarokova underwent navigator's training at the Engels Military Aviation School with the rest of the women accepted into the program.

She was the emperor's favorite concubine, but did not become an empress (at least during her life) due to the strong opposition of the emperor's \\"mother\\" Empress Dowager Liu. ==Childhood== Lady Zhang was the daughter of Zhang Yaofeng and Lady Cao and she had two younger sisters. Zhang Yaofeng was a scholar and died early, and Lady Cao wanted to take her daughter to Zhang Yaofeng's brother, Zhang Yaozuo (张尧佐). Zhang Yaozuo stated that the distance for the mother and daughter to travel was too far and refused. Lady Cao eventually became a dancer for the Princess of Jing (荆国大长公主). The Princess of Jing was the daughter of Emperor Taizong and Noble Consort Fang and was known for her similarities to her father. She noticed that Lady Zhang was beautiful, and took her into the palace at the age of 8 along with her sisters. Lady Zhang was raised by Lady Jia, a palace attendant. ==Consort== Lady Zhang was renowned for her beauty, and she attracted the attention of Emperor Renzong at a banquet. She was favored for her dancing and attentiveness to the Emperor. Lady Zhang was his favorite out of all the consorts in the harem. She gave birth to his first daughter Princess Anshou (安壽公主, 1040–1042) and was given the rank of Cairen. Princess Anshou was the Emperor's favorite daughter until her death. Lady Zhang was promoted to the rank of Xiuyuan (修媛). Lady Zhang gave birth to her second daughter Princess Baohe (寶和公主, 1042–1043), but she soon died too. As a result, Lady Zhang was demoted to the title of Meiren. She gave birth to her third daughter Princess Tangguo (唐國公主, 1044–1045), but her last child also died in infancy. https://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95174eefed0834a8ee38036f2afa7499&tn;=SE_baiduxueshu_c1gjeupa&ie;=utf-8&site;=baike Consort Zhang's mother Lady Cao was styled Lady of Qinghe (清河郡夫人) by Emperor Renzong. Her uncle Zhang Yaozuo was appointed as an official at the Southern Court of Xianhui. Zhang Yaozuo was constantly promoted, and went from being a 7th rank to a 6th rank official. This led to the opposition of several officials, such as Bao Zheng. That same year, Consort Zhang received the honorable title of Guifei, one rank from the Empress. She was known to love eating kumquat, and this sparked competition in markets. Noble Consort Zhang passed away at the age of 31, around the new year. Emperor Renzong grieved her for seven days and composed poems for her. He dressed her in the robes of an Empress, which caused the opposition of many officials since Empress Cao was alive. Noble Consort Zhang always wanted to become Empress, and her dream was fulfilled after she died. She was honored as Empress Wencheng, and Emperor Renzong bestowed her mother the title of Lady Qi (齐国夫人) and Zhang Yaozuo the senior advisor. https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BC%A0%E7%9A%87%E5%90%8E/1888780?fromtitle=%E6%B8%A9%E6%88%90%E7%9A%87%E5%90%8E&fromid;=11020302 ==Titles== *Princess of Qinghe (清河郡君) *Cairen (才人) *Xiuyuan (修媛) *Meiren (美人) *Guifei (贵妃) *Empress Wencheng (温成皇后) ==Media== *Noble Consort Zhang is played by Xiao Han in the 2017 Chinese web series Oh My General. *Noble Consort Zhang is played by Wang Churan in the 2020 Chinese television series Serenade of Peaceful Joy.

He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines. He attended Rufus King High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin through his junior year. Then, he transferred to play his senior season for La Lumiere School in La Porte, Indiana. He was 2016 first team All-Wisconsin selection as a junior and a member of the 2017 Dick's National High School Championship winner as a senior. At Michigan he was a member of the 2018 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship 2017–18 team. He is best known for a game- winning buzzer beater three-point shot that he made as a true freshman to help the 2017–18 Wolverines advance to the Sweet Sixteen round of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament as part of their road to the 2018 NCAA Championship Game. ==High school career== As a freshman at Rufus King High School in Wisconsin, Poole once made an amazing game-tying three-point shot from off the bench. Poole visited Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Drake and Marquette as a blue chip high school basketball recruit. Then, he visited Michigan for the September 26 football game between the 2015 Wolverines and BYU, receiving an offer that weekend. He returned to campus on October 17 for the rivalry game against Michigan State. On October 23, 2015, four-star recruit Poole became the first commitment for the Class of 2017 after a home gym visit from head coach John Beilein and assistant coach LaVall Jordan and multiple Michigan campus visits. Poole had several competing offers including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Memphis, Marquette, Virginia Tech and Auburn. At the time of his commitment, he was the 92nd-ranked overall prospect and the 21st-ranked shooting guard in the national class of 2017. As a junior, Poole was a 2016 WBCA All-State Boys Basketball first team selection. On July 1, 2016, Poole announced that he would transfer from Rufus King to the La Lumiere School in Indiana where he would experience a campus lifestyle, play a schedule with several ESPN broadcasts, and be teamed up with then-unsigned class of 2017 prospects Brian Bowen and Jeremiah Tilmon. By the time Poole signed his National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for Michigan as part of a three-scholarship player incoming class with Isaiah Livers and Eli Brooks on November 11, 2016, he was the 90th ranked overall prospect. Poole was a member of the 2017 Dick's National High School Champion La Lumiere team. In the Dick's National Championship game, Poole posted 13 points, 3 steals, 3 rebounds and 4 assists, and shot 3–7 on his three-point shots. The 13 points included a shot clock buzzer beater in the closing seconds of the third quarter. La Lumiere, which included 2017 McDonald's All-Americans Bowen and Jaren Jackson Jr., defeated perennial power Montverde Academy, who was led by Canadian sophomore R. J. Barrett. La Lumiere had lost the 2016 Dick National Championship game prior to Poole's arrival. ==College careerFreshman season=== Poole for the 2017–18 Wolverines On December 2, Michigan defeated Indiana 69–55 in its 2017–18 Big Ten conference season opener with Poole leading the way with a team- and then career-high 19 points in his Big Ten debut. On January 15, Michigan defeated Maryland 68–67. After trailing by 14 points in the first half and 10 points at halftime, Michigan was trailing by 7 points in the second half when they made 7 consecutive three-point shots, including three by Poole whose 11 points made him one of only two double digit scorers for Michigan. For the February 3 contest against Minnesota, the Maize Rage (Michigan's student section) held a \\"Poole party\\" in the stands, but Poole missed all four of his field goal attempts. Poole finished the regular season with three straight double digit scoring efforts, making 9 of 12 three- point shots against (#8 AP Poll/#9 Coaches Poll) Ohio State on February 18, Penn State on February 21, and Maryland on February 24. On March 4, a victory over (#8 AP Poll/#8 Coaches Poll) Purdue gave Michigan its second consecutive Big Ten Tournament championship since the game was the championship game of the 2018 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, even though Poole slumped during the 4-game run, missing all 9 of his three-point shots. Poole for the 2017–18 Wolverines On March 17, 2018, Michigan defeated (#21 AP Poll/#19 Coaches Poll) Houston 64–63 in the second round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament, following a game-winning buzzer beater three-point shot by Poole, giving Michigan its fourth Sweet 16 in six years. The shot was described as nearly identical to the buzzer beater he had made a year earlier in the Dick's National Championship game. Poole finished the game with 8 points and 2 rebounds, but his only field goal attempt in his four minutes of play in the second half was the game-winner. The play began with Michigan trailing by two points with 3.6 seconds remaining in the game and Isaiah Livers passing the ball from under the opposite basket to Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman near midcourt. After two dribbles Abdur-Rahkman threw the ball to Poole with 2 seconds left. The term \\"Poole party\\" was widely used in the press as a play on words to describe the celebration of Poole's heroic shot. In the March 31, 2018 national semifinal against Loyola–Chicago Poole had seven points, including the free throws that put the team the ahead for good after rallying back from a 10-point second half deficit. The team lost in the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game to (#2 Coaches Poll/#2 AP Poll) Villanova. ===Sophomore season=== 2018–19 Wolverines On November 17, 2018, Poole's career-high 22 points helped Michigan defeat George Washington 84–61.

Born in Prussia, he emigrated to the United States and fought in the U.S. Civil War, settling in California around 1870. He apprenticed to lithographer George Baker, where his first job was lithographing colorful cigar box labels. He joined The Wasp, also founded by Prussian immigrants, with its first issue, debuting in August 1876. Some of his work reflected the anti-Chinese and anti- immigrant sentiment of late 19th-Century San Francisco in highly racialized stereotypes, depicting Chinese as rat-like invaders, Irish as Neanderthals, and Jews as hook-nosed moneylenders. Keller's final cartoon was published June 30, 1883, after which he left the San Francisco area \\"and was never heard from again\\".

Ross, an African American inventor, received five U.S. patents for inventions at the turn of the 20th century. The inventions were a runner for stoops (1896), a bag closure device (1898), a wrinkle-preventing trouser stretcher (1899), a garment-hanger (1903), and a holder for brooms and like articles. Ross was a resident of the New York City metropolitan area, who also patented some of the inventions in Canada. == Career Patents=== Ross received a patent August 4, 1896 for a runner to be used on doorsteps and stoops (565,301). Runners were used to prevent slipping and falling on icy walkways. It could be used for private and public places. The basic design was a series of interlocking mats. The runner could be removed as needed and required minimal place for storage. Ross lived in New York City when the patent was filed. The runner was also patented in Canada. On June 7, 1898, Ross was granted a patent for a bag closure device (605,343). The device allowed removal of waste from a home or business without spillage. The mouth of the bag hung open for easy filling. Once filled the bag closure sealed the opening preventing spilling when moved from one location to another. The following year, the bag closure was patented in Canada. The third patent for a trouser support or stretcher (638,068) was issued on November 28, 1899. The invention could be used in a cabinet, closet or wardrobe. It had several hooks that allowed trousers to be hung without being folded over, thereby preventing the clothing from being wrinkled. It could accommodate several pairs of pants and the removal of a single pair of trousers was easy. At the time the patent was filed, Ross was living in Port Chester, New York. Ross then had a garment- hanger (723,031), patented on March 17, 1903, for trousers and skirts. The hanger contains eyes, loops, and arms to fasten the clothing. Ross lived in Manhattan at the time of the patent filing. A patent was filed in Canada for the garment-hanger on January 7, 1904. On February 18, 1913, a patent was issued for a holder for brooms and like articles (1,053,747). The device was made to be attached to the wall and hold a number of articles. Ross was still living in Manhattan at the time of the patent. ===Storefront=== In 1915, Archia L. Ross had a store at 763 Lexington in Manhattan which sold wardrobe fixtures for hanging clothes. The home residence was 818 E. 214th Street. Three years later, the listing was for Archie L. Ross and the business was located at 419 Lexington Avenue, with the same home residence. ==Notes References== Category:19th-century American inventors Category:20th-century American inventors Category:African-American inventors Category:People from Manhattan Category:People from Port Chester, New York Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Archia Ross"},{"id":"56898065","text":" The Greene 1909 Biplane was an American pioneering aircraft. In 1909, at the Morris Park Raceway, Dr. William Greene constructed a biplane that successfully flew for the first time on October 28, 1909. The aircraft was in the Curtiss style with dual forward elevators and dual trailing rudders and a tricycle landing gear. == Design and development == Greene constructed his first successful aircraft during the summer of 1909. Originally equipped with a 29 hp American & British automobile motor, he flew for the first time on October 28, 1909. During this flight he discovered that he had placed the engine, which weighed 320 lbs, too far to the rear and had to attach 80 lbs of sandbags to the front of the plane to balance it. His longest solo flight on this day was 600 ft In November, Greene re-engined the aircraft with a lighter Kimball 2 cycle motor of 40 hp. On November 15 of the same year, he took up a passenger for the first time. After a series of exhibition flights at Morris Park, he sold the plane to Wilbur R. Kimball. He took it to Rahway, New Jersey where he and Frank Boland took the tail off of it and began experimenting with a novel control system that eventually led to the first Boland Brothers 'jibbed' tailless biplane. During his flights at Morris Park in November, Dr. Greene set the world record for shortest take off at 30 ft. == Specifications  References == Category:1900s United States experimental aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Canard aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1909 ","title":"Greene 1909 Biplane"},{"id":"56898080","text":"Khandaker Rashiduzzaman Dudu was a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the Member of Parliament from Kushtia-3. ==Career== Dudu was the vice-President of Kushtia Government College unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League.

Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe making company hiring thousands of workers in Ethiopia, was portrayed in the film as a model of \\"introducing China's experience of prosperity to Africa.\\" According to a report of the Associated Press, though, the company's Ethiopian workers complained about low wages, the lack of safety equipment, forced labor and not being permitted to form a trade union. The documentary ends with a song performed by pop singer Sun Nan. == Production == It was co- produced by the China Central Television and China Film Co., Ltd, and directed by Wei Tie. == Release == The film was released in Mainland China on March 2, 2018, distributed by Alibaba Pictures. It was reported by South China Morning Post that some state companies and government-affiliated organizations required employees to watch the film. On 19 April 2018, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China issued a memo requesting that Chinese websites and cinemas stop showing the film. The film was screened in a theater in Macao from May 9 to May 14, 2018. == Reception == Douban, the leading film review website in China, disabled the commenting and rating functions on the film's page, instead showing a \\"media rating\\" of 8.5/10 and reviews written by state media including Xinhua and the People's Daily. Internationally, it is widely considered to be a propaganda film, and an effort by the Communist Party of China to increase its soft power. The film also is believed to be a significant step towards a personality cult of Xi Jinping by some observers. While Amazing China does demonstrate a new level of sophistication in state propaganda, along with other self-congratulatory representations of China's growth \\"betrays an unshakeable anxiety about the continuing legitimacy of CCP rule.\\" == References  External links == * * Amazing China on YouTube Category:2018 films Category:Chinese films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Chinese propaganda films Category:Chinese documentary films ","title":"Amazing China"},{"id":"56898101","text":"The 1989 Vuelta a Murcia was the fifth edition of the Vuelta a Murcia cycle race and was held on 7 March to 12 March 1989.

He was a talented poet who studied under Ding Wei and received Ding's favors. He also befriended Su Shunqing who introduced him to Ouyang Xiu. He later lived in the Jinluan Monastery (金鑾寺) in Jing Prefecture in modern Hubei. Wenying was fascinated by public affairs, and by the 1070s he had collected works by more than 200 writers since the dynasty began in 960.

Distributed by Petr Vochozka through his company Vochozka Trading in June 1994, it was the first nationally distributed PC game in the country and one of the first Czech games commercially available. A parody of the successful Monkey Island series, the story plays out as if it were a direct sequel to The Secret of Monkey Island, ignoring the continuity of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. == Production  Conception === Jarek Kolář and Petr Vlček began working on the game in 1992 using school computers in the gymnasium of Slovanské náměstí in Brno where they were students. They wanted to use their own game-making tools as well as the ZX Spectrum tools they had been working with. In 1993, Petr Vochozka sold the first-ever Czech commercial adventure game for the Amiga entitled Světák Bob. Later that year, he founded Polička-based Vochozka Trading and released Tajemství Oslího ostrova as the publisher's debut title. === Development === Development took place between 1992 and 1994. In the first year, the developers used their school computer after receiving permission from their computer science teacher. They faced several challenges, as there was limited information on how to make video games available to developers. Visual assets from other adventure games were used, which, years later in 2018, caused the magazine Excalibur to express surprise that there were no licensing issues. However, the game's sound effects were created by the developers themselves using computer speakers. Tajemství Oslího ostrova was also one of the first Czech games to feature developed graphics. === Release === Originally, Kolář and Vlček had no plans to make the game commercially available. They created it to prove that Czech citizens could create a game on par with international productions. They did not care if the game was released commercially or as freeware, but after seeing an advert by Vochozka in Excalibur, the only Czech game magazine at the time, they joined Vochozka under the Pterodon Software brand. The game sold 2,000 copies for 240 crowns each, a considerable increase on Světák Bob, which had sold only a few hundred copies. Vochozka set up an exclusive contract to spread the games of the Pterodon team. The retail version of the game was originally wrapped only in a plastic bag. A paper-box edition was not available until November of the same year, at which point the second Pterodon Software game was released entitled 7 dní a 7 nocí. The game was released only five years after the Velvet Revolution, when only a small fraction of Czech society understood English. By the end of 1996, Vochozka Trading had produced twelve games. == Plot and gameplay == The player takes control of the Guybrush Threepwood parody Gajbraš Trípvůd, who, after an unsuccessful pirate raid, is on the run from LeChuck parody LeGek. == Critical reception and legacy == According to IDNES.cz, the game changed not only Vochozka's life but also the entire Czech gaming scene. The site felt the title had a significant impact in kick-starting the local video game industry. Star-hry gave it a rating of 91%. Objevit felt the game was pioneering, as it was created during a time when few knew Czechs knew how to create computer games and when little documentation or tools were available to teach burgeoning developers. Hernisvet wrote that upon release, the game surprised Czech audiences with its \\"sophisticated play\\" and \\"excellent, completely original themes\\", noting that even in 2005 the game still held value in the Czech freeware scene. Dovus considers Tajemství Oslího ostrova to be one of the major events in gaming prehistory. Gamepark felt the title was filled with \\"brilliant humor, pirate stories and beautiful cartoon graphics and great adventures\\". Gamesite thought that a big drawback to Tajemství Oslího ostrova was the lack of a musical score except in the opening credits. Gamez.cz described it as a simple game that deserves to be buried in the modern era, though noted its success in sales. Bonusweb thought that while the game was \\"hilarious\\", older reviews in magazines like Excalibur, which gave the game a rating of 95%, were greatly exaggerated. The Excalibur review was written by Vochozka, the game's publisher. Bonusweb wrote that despite the game's rough edges, its gameplay, low price, and charm as one of the first Czech games led to players overlooking its weaknesses and making it a hit. Bonusweb argues that the game is the first Czech commercial game for personal computers and a historic milestone in the home gaming scene. == References  * Interview with Jarek Kolář for the game's 29th anniversary * Riki article * Score review * Excalibur review * Riki review * Score article * Score preview * Excalibur article * PC Engine article * PC Engine review * Category:1994 video games Category:Adventure games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Single-player video games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Parody video games ","title":"Tajemství Oslího ostrova"},{"id":"56898306","text":"Ophthalmitis herbidaria is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Achille Guenée in 1858.

According to its website, Wag! services are insured and every pet caregiver passes through a vetting process and extensive background check before being approved to accept work on the platform. The app has been referred to as \\"the Uber for Dogs\\". The company’s tagline is “Wag! creates joy for dogs and those who love them.” Wag! donates a portion of walk proceeds to GreaterGood.org’s Rescue Bank and has, to date, provided more than 10 million meals to shelter dogs in the US. ==History== Wag! was founded in 2015 in Los Angeles, California. In early 2018, Wag! raised $300 million in venture capital funds from Softbank. The company had previously raised $68 million in venture capital. Celebrity users include Mariah Carey, Kendall Jenner, and Chloë Grace Moretz. Actress Olivia Munn serves as an investor and Creative Strategist. In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank sold its entire $300 million stake in Wag Labs back to the company at an investment loss. ==Criticisms and incidents== In June 2017, a Wag! contractor was videotaped allegedly \\"making himself at home\\" in a user's apartment, including resting on a sofa and taking beers. In November 2017, a Wag! contractor was videotaped allegedly stealing packages from a New York City apartment building. The New York Daily News reported on a dog lost by Wag! in September 2017, and later finding the pet weeks later. In February 2020, a Yorkie named Bella was found dead after a Wag! Service. Wag! responded with a statement that included “safety is a company-wide priority for Wag! and incidents of this nature are very rare. In fact, the average service rating on the Wag! platform is 4.97 (on a 5-point scale), and every 8 seconds a service is booked on Wag! – with 90% of Wag! customers booking a service weekly.” ==Response to COVID-19== In March of 2020, Wag! created a new service type called Wag! Now for miscellaneous pet care needs for pet owners in San Francisco. The service was later released to the entire United States and Wag! partnered with GreaterGood.Org to create the #stayhomeandfoster initiative, connecting independent contractors with dog and cat rescues and shelters to deliver supplies and foster pets to foster homes. As part of the initiative, Olivia Munn connected Henry Golding \\"with Wag! and GreaterGood.org. The two groups were able to find Golding the perfect match in Stella, a shelter dog from START Animal Rescue.\\" The last week of February 2020, Wag! made the decision to have all employees begin working from home across all office locations and released communications to pet owners and independent contractors on how best to complete socially distanced walks. According to Adweek, “pet care app Wag sent an email to its users encouraging pet owners to limit interaction with dog walkers by communicating through the in-app chat feature and having the dog’s harness and leash on ahead of time, making for a ‘simple handoff.’ The company also provides small lockboxes to pet owners who request them, making the exchange of household keys a no- contact situation—’essentially, a built-in social distance feature,’ said a Wag spokesperson. According to Wag, nearly 70% of its services are completed with a lockbox or hidden key.” ==Referenceshttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-insights- ideas/resources/small-business-corner-an-interview-with-brendan-rogers-the-co- founder-of-wag Category:2015 establishments in California Category:Dog-related professions and professionals Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Softbank portfolio companies ","title":"Wag (company)"},{"id":"56898460","text":"Kazi Firoz Rashid (born 2 February 1947) is a Jatiya Party politician and the current Member of Parliament from Dhaka-6.

Da share z0ne is known for posting image macros pairing skeleton art and absurdist or ironic captions. Da share z0ne's posts are an elaborate parody of online hyper-masculinity; specifically, da share z0ne's posts mimic \\"tough guy\\" memes with characteristics like macho posturing, poor graphic design, and juvenile fondness for generically \\"cool\\" imagery like skeletons, leather jackets, grim reapers, tombstones, flames, and guns. The creator or creators of da share z0ne operate anonymously. The account is supposedly operated by a fictitious skeleton character known as Admin. All the posts, as well responses to press inquiries, are made in- character as Admin. In ironic contrast to the over-the-top macho aesthetic of the imagery, the Admin character himself is neurotic, emotionally sensitive, \\"woke\\", and preoccupied with mundane aspects of everyday life. The juxtaposition provides much of the satirical effect. Journalists have praised da share z0ne for its distinct, off-kilter brand of humor and the rich characterization of Admin. In 2018, da share z0ne launched an original trading card game called The Devil's Level with the help of artistic collaborators, including fellow Twitter user dril, Drew Fairweather, and numerous comics artists. ==Social media posts== An image macro created by da share z0ne. The caption reads: Da share z0ne began posting in September 2015. The account is best-known for image macros that combine artwork of skeletons, compiled from various Internet sources, with superimposed captions in assorted typefaces. The account is loosely affiliated with the \\"Weird Twitter\\" subculture. The account is an extended parody of a particular style of overtly masculine meme page on social media. In the words of The A.V. Clubs Gabe Worgaftik, the target of its parody is \\"the kind of Facebook page that posts tough-guy memes over pictures of skeletons that your fuck-up cousin shares ... this generation's version of a 'Keep honking, I'm reloading' bumper sticker.\\" Writing for Dazed, Luke O'Neil called da share z0ne a \\"riff on the style of toxic masculinity that can be found on specific corners of the meme-based internet ... where dudes are dudes, motorcycles and guns kick ass, and everything you need to know about a guy can be crammed onto a horribly designed image macro of clashing fonts, unreadable texts, and shoddy looking graphics.\\" In November 2018, The Columbus Dispatch reported that webcomic artist Drew Fairweather runs da share z0ne. In February 2020, Admin posted several tweets endorsing Bernie Sanders for the Democratic primary in 2020. ===Visual aesthetic=== Da share z0ne posts are characterized by purposefully poor graphic design, using multiple tacky fonts in a single image and a different watermark in almost every image. The visual style of da share z0ne was described by Slates Jacob Brogan as a \\"borderline comical gothic aesthetic\\" with a \\"mock-fascination with fatalist cool,\\" but with \\"silly\\" captions that \\"operate in winkingly awkward contradistinction to the pictures.\\" Motherboards Rachel Pick called the account's aesthetic a \\"mash-up of what guys who own Harleys and stoned 14-year-olds think looks cool.\\" According to Zack Boehm of Uloop, a typical da share z0ne meme is a \\"configuration of the following: The gaunt visage of a demonic skeleton (this is a DSZ staple), fire, guns, motorcycles, leather jackets, Viking garb, laptops, and short missives like 'Why do bad people get to have good pets?' or 'Thinkin about getting really into Japan' spelled out in Windows '95 word art.\\" Archer Angel at The Daily Dot compared da share z0ne's format to the approach pioneered by Gangster Popeye, a satirical page likewise \\"inspired by the 'tough guy' memes from pages like KrazyTrain and Check Dis Shit Out—macros that feature text on themes such as being a badass and not taking shit from anyone, superimposed on pictures of skeletons (often holding weapons).\\" Roisin Kiberd of Motherboard connected da share z0ne within a history of repurposing skeleton art in Internet culture—\\"memetic memento mori\\"—dating back to the 1990s. ===\\"Admin\\" character=== Da share z0ne is run by an anonymous person or group of people. The fictional character who purportedly runs da share z0ne is a skeleton named Admin. The creator or creators of da share z0ne respond in- character as Admin to press inquiries, and Admin has given interviews with Herb.co, Dazed, Vice Media's Motherboard, Newsweek, and New York magazine. In his posts and other messages, Admin usually types in all caps with numerous misspellings. Admin has been described as an everyman (or \\"every-skeleton\\") character whose \\"relatable\\" struggles mirror everyday struggles and the impact of Internet culture on his generation. Admin hates his job, enjoys marijuana, and has lowbrow taste. In da share z0ne posts, Admin has complained of irritable bowel syndrome, experiences of social anxiety, and depression. Admin frequently breaks the fourth wall in posts; for example, he describes running da share z0ne itself, boasts about his inflated sense of the account's popularity, references his own computer problems, and accidentally types out and submits web searches as tweets. Miles Klee wrote that the Admin's defining trait is his \\"nerdy white-collar warriorhood.\\" An important aspect of Admin's persona is his social consciousness; Kiberd described Admin as an \\"unlikely—but lovable—social justice hero.\\" The character's usage and love of hyper-masculine imagery ironically contrasts with his actual personality, which is neurotic, unintelligent, awkward, and lonely, yet also deeply sensitive, essentially decent, and even socially conscious. Diverging from the latent racism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia commonly found on the pages that da share z0ne parodies, Admin \\"explicitly performs 'wokeness'\\" with consciousness-raising, albeit \\"deeply campy,\\" slogans in its posts on topics such as gender, immigration, refugees, consent, and safe spaces. Admin's socially conscious posts are, according to Emily Gaudette at Newsweek, \\"like reading the private thoughts of a liberal goth kid whose taste in art hasn't yet caught up to their advanced understanding of mental health and politics.\\" The detailed characterization of Admin—particularly the stark contrast between his character and the \\"cool\\" imagery—supplies much of da share z0ne's ironic humor and satirical content. Boehm notes that the \\"jarring dissonance\\" between Admin's \\"vulnerable, pitiable\\" text and the \\"gothic, biker-horror imagery\\" is crucial to the page's satirical effect, applying the creators' knowledge of \\"the kind of strange macho, anonymously aggressive internet culture that [da share z0ne is] trying to spoof\\" to \\"deftly needle at the hypocritical constructs of masculinity with a gnarled, bony skeleton finger.\\" O'Neil writes that the contrast reveals the subtext of loneliness behind the online \\"tough guy\\" archetype that Admin caricatures. Jay Hathaway at The Daily Dot wrote that a \\"character-driven Twitter account hasn't blended macho attitude and complete personal dysfunction this perfectly\\" since Karl Welzein (@dadboner), a Twitter character written by comedian Mike Burns who is \\"a divorced, middle- aged Detroit dude who loves to rock hard and scope babes, but mainly hangs around the parking lot at Applebee's.\\" ===Popularity and reception=== Vice Media reported that da share z0ne had accumulated almost 88,000 followers on Twitter by January 2018. The account hit 100,000 followers in June 2018. According to Hathaway, da share z0ne has a \\"universal appeal\\" that \\"crosses cliquish social boundaries,\\" as its memes are \\"retweeted by everyone from Weird Twitter chuckleboys to cool, queer, indie gamers to dry and boring media-marketing types.\\" Jacob Brogan of Slate quoted and agreed with Hathaway's assessment of the account's \\"universal appeal,\\" praising the persona of the account for \\"gently making light of the way we all present ourselves on social media—of the way we attempt to show off the best, brightest versions of our lives, only to accidentally reveal just how lame we really are.\\" Luke O'Neil at Dazed praised the sharpness of da share z0ne's satire, as well as its surprising emotional depth and warmth: Will Menaker, a cohost on the political comedy podcast Chapo Trap House, made a tongue-in- cheek call for da share z0ne to receive the MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\" in June 2016. Mic named a post from da share z0ne as one of 101 \\"canonical\\" tweets. In October 2017, Jerry Saltz–senior art critic for New York magazine—replied to a post by da share z0ne to call the account \\"Very late Francis Bacon?\\" In December 2017, Alex Greenberger of ARTnews included da share z0ne in a round- up of the year's best art on screens—including onscreen art installations at galleries and museums, cinema, television, and art \\"on my laptop\\"—saying \\"[i]t's art if I say it is—and da share z0ne is art.\\" Da share z0ne was nominated in the \\"weird\\" category for the 10th Shorty Awards, an annual awards show by Sawhorse Media that recognizes exceptional short-form content on the social web, but it did not place as a finalist. Da Share Z0ne was named one of \\"The 100 best, worst, and weirdest things we saw on the internet in the 2010s\\" in 2019 by the AV Club. ==The Devil's Level card game== The Devil's Level is a trading card game based on da share z0ne. Funded via Kickstarter, The Devil's Level reached its initial fundraising goal of $28,000 within hours of its launch on January 22, 2018. By the campaign's conclusion a month later, the game had reached $227,250 in funding. It is expected to ship in September 2018. The Devil's Level features a core deck of 144 cards, plus three 36-card expansion packs, with cards encased in a foil-embossed skull box designed by Oliver Leach. The game's rules have been compared to Magic: The Gathering and Cards Against Humanity. ===Guest artists=== Admin claimed responsibility for \\"most\\" of the card artwork and credited the following guest artists (listed with their Twitter handles, as they are on the Kickstarter page) for making contributions: * Natalie Dee (@nataliedee) — known as a co-creator of the webcomic Married to the Sea * Drew Toothpaste (@drewtoothpaste) — known for the webcomic Toothpaste for Dinner and as a co-creator of Married to the Sea) * dril * KC Green (@kcgreenn) — known for the webcomic Gunshow * Oliver Leach (@bakkooonn) * Will Laren (@larenwill) * Greg Pollock (@weedguy420boner) ==See also== * Twitterature * dril * Married to the Sea * Toothpaste for Dinner * Natalie Dee * Skeleton (undead) * Death (personification) ==NotesReferences * dasharez0ne.com * @dasharez0ne on Twitter * Da motha fuckin share z0ne on Facebook * The Devil's Level card game at Kickstarter Category:Twitter accounts Category:Internet humor Category:Parody social media accounts Category:Fictional skeletons Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:American satirists Category:Electronic literature Category:Computer-related introductions in 2015 Category:Collectible card games Category:Card games introduced in 2018 Category:Weird Twitter ","title":"Da share z0ne"},{"id":"56898534","text":"Events from the year 1900 in Taiwan, Empire of Japan. ==IncumbentsEventsBirthReferences== Category:Years of the 19th century in Taiwan ","title":"1900 in Taiwan"},{"id":"56898538","text":"7 dní a 7 nocí (aka Sedm dní a sedm nocí; English: 7 Days and 7 Nights) is a 1994 Czech adventure game released on Windows through Petr Vochozka's Vochozka Trading brand, and published by Pterodon Software. == Gameplay and plot == This is a creepy erotic comedy inspired by the Leisure Suit Larry series. Jarek Kolář addressed the connections between his game and Leisure Suit Larry by asserting that while Larry acts like an unsuccessful sexual loudmouth, Venca is a self-confident village idiot. ==DevelopmentCreation=== Originally, the developers had planned to follow Tajemství Oslího ostrova (The Secret of the Donkey Island) with an adventure/RPG set at the time of the colonization of Latin America in the vein of the Quest for Glory series. However the project was shelved when Vochozka requested a game with ready-made graphics. The team built an adventure game editor with ready-made graphics and agreed to switch over projects, and they worked on the project while attending school. ===Release=== Vochozka originally planned the game to be released for the Amiga in 1993, and Pterodon completed the PC version in just six months. The game was released in November 1994, the same year as Tajemství Oslího ostrova, and became the first Czech adventure video game to play digital music and sounds through Sound Blaster. One popular highlight of the game was an erotic action scene that saw the player press the two mouse buttons alternately to have protagonist Vency Pokyba make the daughters of Mr. Smihta reach climax.

She is the CEO and owner of Frey Farms, which she founded at age sixteen. Frey Farms is the largest H-2A visa employer in Illinois as well as the largest grower of pumpkins in the United States. ==Early life and education== Frey was born July 24, 1976, to Harold and Elizabeth Frey. Both had been previously married. Her father was a steelworker and a farmer and for a time part owner of the Dixie Feed franchise in St. Louis, but her parents fled to Tennessee to escape what Frey calls \\"a perfect storm\\" of bad decision-making by her father, who staged an accident to make it look as if he'd died. The couple's first child, a girl, was killed as a toddler in a farm accident; the couple left Tennessee for Illinois shortly thereafter. Frey has four older full brothers, thirteen half- siblings from her father's first marriage, and two from her mother's first marriage; counting her half siblings she is the youngest of 21. The family's original 80-acre farm, which they called the Hill, is five miles from Orchardville and thirty miles from Mount Vernon in southern Illinois. The family's home did not have indoor plumbing until Frey was five years old. It was heated by a woodstove. The family survived mostly on food raised on the farm or hunted and fished for, sometimes resorting to poaching. Frey wrote in her memoir, The Growing Season, that \\"I never remember going to bed without eating anything, but sometimes our meals were just a bowl of mush.\\" In her memoir she describes learning to drive by the age of five, writing, \\"There were vehicles everywhere with the keys in the ignition. Starting when I was four or five, whenever my parents took the truck into town and left me alone at the farm, I'd hop into their old two-door Mercury Grand Marquis. I would hot-lap around the farm, driving in circles\\". In her memoir Frey wrote that at age seven she was sexually abused by a farmhand, and when she told her father, he told her mother to keep a closer eye on Frey. She wrote that only after she'd discovered a peephole the farmhand had drilled between her bedroom and his and showed it to her mother did her parents send him away. Her mother had a \\"melon route\\", purchasing melons from neighboring farms and delivering them to local grocery stores, which Frey helped with from the time she was 8. At 15, she moved out of her parents' house. Frey attended Frontier Community College while also attending high school. ==Career== At 16, she borrowed $10,000 to buy a used truck and took over distribution of the melon route, quickly increasing the farm's client list from 12 to 150. Her parents' financial situation had become dire. Her parents, who had falsely presented themselves as married for thirty year, were separating. The farm was being foreclosed on. In her youth, Frey had wanted to follow her brothers off the farm and move to a city, but following the threat of the farm's repossession, she decided to help save it. She purchased the farm outright at age 18. At the time it was in two parcels, the original 80 acres and another parcel of 20. She decided to use the land to grow pumpkins, a fall crop that would be ready for harvest after the melon season ended and thereby extend her earnings period. She the local Walmart distribution center business in 1997, while still in high school. Frey has been described as \\"the Pumpkin Queen of America\\". She grows more pumpkins than any other farmer in the United States. In 2016, Frey sold around five million pumpkins. Most of her crop is not suitable for eating, but is very popular for Halloween lantern carving. The family business now owns about of farms, spanning Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, and West Virginia. Although pumpkins are the most popular produce, the business also farms watermelons, cantaloupes, sweet corn, and hard squash. As of 2017, Frey Farms is the largest H-2A visa employer in Illinois, and recruits around 250 staff to assist with the pumpkin harvest, which takes place across Illinois and Indiana. She created Tsamma watermelon juice as a way to use the \\"ugly fruit\\" that would otherwise be discarded or tilled back into the fields. Frey's business negotiations with Walmart have been featured in a Harvard Business School study. Her second book, The Growing Season (2020), was reviewed by Publishers Weekly and the Boston Globe. == Political ambitions == Frey told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in October 2019 that she was considering running for Congress. Illinois' 15th Congressional district is the largest in the state by size and the smallest by population; the district is mostly farmland. According to the Post-Dispatch, \\"Frey wants to give farmers a voice in Congress.\\" == Reception == The Boston Globe called her \\"a woman with a potent sense of self and an unmatched ability for inventing and selling herself in a business world often skeptical of or hostile to women, especially those without pedigree or connections.\\" ==Published works== *For the Love of Pumpkins: A Visual Guide to Fall Decorating with Pumpkins and Ornamentals (2007) *The Growing Season: How I Saved an American Farm--and Built a New Life (2020) == Personal life == Frey is divorced.

Typhoon Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands in late July. Tracking west-northwest, a tropical depression developed on August 1, and became a tropical storm the next day. Following an increase in organization, Robyn obtained typhoon intensity on August 5\\\\. The typhoon briefly tracked west before veering to the northwest while intensifying. On August 7, Robyn attained its peak intensity of 160 km/h (100 mph), with a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (27.8 inHg). After passing through the Ryukyu Islands, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August 9 while steadily weakening. Midday on August 10, Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan. The next day, the system was declared an extratropical cyclone. In advance of the storm, 5,300 individuals were evacuated from Nagasaki Prefecture. Around 100 flights in and out of Kagoshima Airport were called off. Throughout Japan, nine people were killed, and fifty others were wounded. A total of 564 structures were destroyed, 80 homes were damaged, 220 houses were flooded, roads were cut in 15 locations, and two dikes were ruined.

In South Korea, 45 people were killed and damage was estimated at US$86 million. The remnants of the storm also dropped rainfall across the Russian Far East. ==Meteorological history== The sixth and final tropical cyclone of July, Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands. At 06:00 UTC on July 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system as thunderstorm activity had persisted as the disturbance tracked west-northwest. On the afternoon on July 31, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued, following reports from Hurricane Hunters that a low-level center was forming. At 06:00 UTC on August 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Based on Dvorak classifications of T1.5/, the JTWC followed suit several hours later. Both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Robyn at 06:00 UTC on August 2, with the JTWC citing Dvorak estimates of T2.5/ as the reason for the upgrade. At the time of the upgrade, Robyn was located northwest of Chuuk. Initially, Tropical Storm Robyn meandered erratically within a mesoscale convective system. At noon on August 3, the JMA upgraded Robyn into a severe tropical storm. Banding features increased in coverage that afternoon as the storm itself slowed down. Early on August 4, the JTWC estimated that Robyn attained typhoon intensity, although operationally, this was believed to have occurred 12 hours earlier, when Dvorak intensity estimates supported an intensity of . Robyn then began to cease all westward movement and instead took a dive south, only to turn north and later northwest. According to the JMA, Robyn leveled off in intensity for 30 hours, and did not become a typhoon until noon on August 5. Early on August 6, data from the JTWC suggested that Robyn entered a period of rapid deepening over 36 hours, ending winds of . The JMA disagrees, noting that only slight intensification occurred during this period. On August 7, the JMA estimated that Robyn attained its peak intensity of , with a barometric pressure of . Starting late on August 7, the JTWC estimated that Robyn began a weakening trend, although according to the JMA, Robyn maintained its intensity through August 8, with its pressure further dropping to After passing through the Ryukyu Island, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August 9 while steadily weakening. Midday on August 10, both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan. The next day, both the JTWC and JMA classified the system as an extratropical cyclone. ==ImpactJapan=== Prior to the arrival of the typhoon, forecasters noted that up to of rain could fall in parts of northern Kyushu and Shikoku and compared the storm's potential destruction to Typhoon Mireille, which struck the nation two years earlier.

It was the first-ever Czech game to include dubbing and released on CD. The game was last updated in 2006. The game was also translated into English, German and Polish. == Production  Conception and design === Early development commenced in 1994, by a group called NoSense, consisting of students at Masaryk University, in Brno, Czech Republic. The team consisted of programmers Pavel Pospíšil, Lukáš Svoboda and Robert Špalek; graphic artists Jakub Dvorský, Pavel Jura and Jan Pokorný; and musician Radovan Kramář. These students knew members of the small development team Pterodon, which had been responsible for Tajemství Oslího ostrova, a noted success at the time. Hoping to outdo the Pterodon team, the team grew and eventually consisted of seven people. During 1994 and early 1995, NoSense focused on finding artists and writing a story. Active development began in mid-1995. The game was designed to be a grotesque adventure with unbridled jokes, and contained forty locations. === Release and aftermath === Published in Christmas 1995, the game sold 7000 copies, becoming one of the best selling Czech games. In addition, it was the first-ever title to be released in the Czech Republic on CD. The CD version was the first Czech game to include amateur Czech dubbing, a breakthrough for the Czech game industry. 11 years later, the game was made available under the GPL License and was free to download after this point. NoSense followed the game with 1997's Asmodeus, which was worked on by Jakub Dvorský, who had also contributed to Dračí historie and later founded the Czech development company Amanita Design. 11 years after the game's original release in 2006, the game was revisited for the first time, when Roberta Špalka cleaned it up ready for a remastered version which was released as freeware. In the summer of 2009, Denis Kasak completed an initial port of the game into C++ as part of the ScummVM project, during Google Summer of Code'09 (with Špalek as the mentor). The port was then completed by Špalek. In 2010 he cleaned the game scripts and graphics in order to make it easier to translate to other languages, while the English, German, and Polish versions were refined. == Plot and gameplay == The game centres around a teen dragon named Bert. He lives with his father Herbert and mother Berta. Bert's father leaves to look for treasure. Bert decides to find his father and bring him home. == Critical reception == The game received mostly positive reviews from critics in 1995. The lowest rating was 60% from Score, while the highest was 92% from Riki. A review on Freegame.cz written in 2006 commented that the technical processing still held up. Tiscali.cz said that while the game was disappointing, it was nevertheless a turning point for the Czech game scene. Gry Online felt the game was humorous and targeted at children. Database-her.cz thought the title had pleasant cartoon graphics and humorous dialogues. In 2006, Bonusweb gave the game a rating of 80%, commenting that it had lost virtually nothing of its attractiveness. FreeHry.cz described it as a \\"true nostalgic memory of old good adventures\\". In 2010, Root.cz deemed it a blast from the past, yet still fun to play. The game sold 7,000 copies in 1995, one of the best-selling Czech games at the time. Between 1995–1999, approximately 10 to 15 thousand official copies were sold. == References  *Official website *Score review *Level review *Bonus review *Riki review *Excalibur review * *History and context of the production of computer games of the genre of adventure in the Czech Republic, authored by Michaela Raková at the Institute of Communication Studies and Journalism at Charles University, Prague Category:1995 video games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Dragons in video games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic ","title":"Dračí Historie"},{"id":"56898885","text":"* David D'Auria, a Welsh football midfielder * Francesco D'Auria, an Italian conductor, composer, and music educator * Girolamo D'Auria, Italian sculptor * Gregory D’Auria, an American lawyer and judge * Joey D'Auria, an American actor and a voice actor * Tippy D'Auria, the founder of the Winter Star Party * De Auria, Italian family == See also == * Auria (disambiguation) ","title":"D'Auria"},{"id":"56898934","text":"Světák Bob is a 1993 Czech adventure game developed by Bohewia and published by Petr Vochozka for the Amiga system. == Production == The game was programmed for the Amiga by a pre-18 Petr Vochozka. After buying his own Atari 800 XL he began programming his own games that ended up in his desk drawer. A year after the Velvet Revolution, Vochozka replaced his Atari with the Amiga, and created his first game intended for public release, Svetak Bob. As he was younger than 18, distribution of the game was illegal as he did not have a trade license. Petr Vochozka marketed Světák Bob as the first ever Czech commercial adventure for the Amiga. It was priced at 129 crowns and sold around 100 to 200 copies. This compares with Vochozka's follow-up Tajemství Oslího ostrova which sold 2,000 copies. Světák Bob was the first officially distributed Czech computer game for the Amiga, and arguably on any platform. According to the reviewer Tomáš Smolík in Excalubur, the game was programmed in the Amos Professional Kit. Prague Post notes that this achievement was a part of a wave of post-Soviet Union advances that saw the Czech video gaming industry quickly became more professional. In the 21st century the game gained a considerable cult following. Bonusweb notes that in 1994 it was still possible for a developer to review their own game, noting that Vochozka did this for Svetak Bob in the magazine Excalibur. In an interview with Vochozka, Bonusweb wrote: \\"\\"No, I definitely didn't write it myself, but I worked a little bit on it,\\" he says with a smile. \\"Moreover, there was a different time at that time, it wasn't a big deal if the Světák sold eighty pieces instead of forty ...\\". == Plot and gameplay == The main hero, Bob, collapses after a fierce storm and finds himself on a desert island. He has to get off the island and continue his adventure. A hybrid between the text and classic point & click adventure, the game offers similar gameplay to text-based games, but includes graphics and music. The game is mouse-controlled. == Critical reception == According to Bonusweb.cz, the game's graphics were just a little better than horrible. BRNO Region asserts that the game was not a true global success.http://www.brnoregion.com/Live/Articles/Our-hearts-beat-for-games-in- brnoregion Vochozka later said the game wasn't \\"worldly\\". Amiga Review unfavourably compared it to Testament. At the time Exaclibur didn't give Czech games a rating to avoid discouraging local developers. Som Hrac argues the game was \\"quite a good success\\". Mafia felt the game was a \\"great success \\" that opened the door for other Czech games. SME notes that this post-Iron Curtain era of gaming is marked by a national technological backwardness that had a flow-on effect to \\"scant technological and artistic abilities of potential game developers\\", adding that while good ideas were a dime a dozen, it was difficult to find top wuality graphics in local games. == References  External links == * Czech review in Excalibur Issue 23, page 24 (Lewis is a pseudonym of Petr Vochozka) *https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1 Category:1993 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga-only games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Světák Bob"},{"id":"56898995","text":"Jangyeon No clan () was one of the Korean clans.

M. Sriramulu Naidu. It stars Bhanumathi Ramakrishna and N. T. Rama Rao in the lead roles and music composed by S. M. Subbaiah Naidu. The film was a remake of the Tamil film Malaikkallan (1954). ==Plot== The film begins with a Zamindar, Somanatham (D. Balasubrahmanyam), who lives with his daughter Sarada (Bhanumathi Ramakrishna) and his sister Kamakshamma (Rushyendramani), whose son Kumar went missing when he was 10 years old. Somanatham's wayward nephew Veerraju (Sriram) plans to marry Sarada and sends his henchman Katturi Kalayya (R. Nageswara Rao) to kidnap her. Aggi Ramudu (N. T. Rama Rao) saves her and takes her to his abode in the forest. The police Sub-Inspector (Mukkamala) and his head constable Venkata Swamy (Relangi) are on the hunt for Aggi Ramudu as he is charged with the atrocities which are actually the handiwork of Kalayya and his men supported by Veerraju and the Mangalampadu Zamindar (Mahankali Venkaiah). Sarada realizes that Aggi Ramudu is a do-gooder to society and not a criminal. She falls in love with him. As promised, Aggi Ramudu sends her home through her neighbor Abdul Rahim. On hearing that her father is held captive by Veerraju, Sarada rushes to his house. At the same time, Abdul Rahim arrives with the police. After a fight, the culprits are taken into custody. A hilarious drama follows before it is revealed that Aggi Ramudu, Abdul Rahim, and Kumar are one and the same. ==Cast== *Bhanumathi Ramakrishna as Sharada *N. T.

The draw took place in Dubai on 4 May 2018. Australia qualified for the tournament after topping the group in the second round of the World Cup qualification campaign. Australia was hit by injuries ahead of the Cup with upcoming teenager Daniel Arzani and starting midfielder Aaron Mooy injured before the cup, and recently-debuted Scot-born Martin Boyle being injured in the final friendly match against Oman before the cup. Australia's Asian Cup title defence commenced against Jordan and despite a pretence of favouritism due to being defending champions, Australia lost 1–0 after a headed goal from Jordan's Anas Bani Yaseen in the 26th minute. In their second match of the group, Australia bounced back from the loss, beating Palestine 3–0, with Jamie Maclaren scoring his first goal for Australia and Awer Mabil and Apostolos Giannou scoring too. Australia advanced from the group stage after beating Syria 3–2, with Tom Rogic scoring in injury time, following goals by Mabil and Chris Ikonomidis which put Australia in the lead. After the first two Australian goals, Syria equalized with goals by Omar Kharbin and Omar Al Somah. In the round of 16 match against Uzbekistan, neither team scored after 90 minutes of regulation time and after 30 minutes of extra-time. In the penalty shootout following the game, Australia progressed with a 4–2 score, after Mathew Ryan saved 2 penalties. In the quarter-final match against hosts United Arab Emirates, Australia were knocked-out of the Asian Cup after losing 1–0 with Ali Mabkhout scoring following a defensive error by Milos Degenek. On 7 June 2019, Australia played an inexperienced side against South Korea in a friendly match in Busan. South Korea won 1–0 with Hwang Ui-jo scoring the only goal in the 76th minute. Australia had 4 players debuting for the senior national team, with Andrew Redmayne and Brandon O'Neill starting while Brandon Borrello and Ryan Williams were substituted on. In September 2019, Australia commenced the qualification process for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Australia started in the second round of AFC qualification which doubles as the second round of qualifiers for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. The draw for the second round was held on 17 July 2019 at AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Australia were placed in pot 1 and were drawn against Jordan, Kuwait, Chinese Taipei and Nepal. Australia started the qualification process with a 3–0 away win over Kuwait, with stand-in skipper Mathew Leckie scoring a brace and Mooy scoring the third goal. A month later, in their first home match of the qualification process, Australia beat Nepal 5–0, with Maclaren scoring a hat-trick and Scottish-born debutant Harry Souttar scoring a brace. 5 days later, Australia travelled to Taiwan and beat Chinese Taipei 7–1, with Adam Taggart, and Jackson Irvine scoring braces while Souttar and Maclaren scored their fourth international goals in a week. Australia finished the year in Jordan, where they had not previously beaten the hosts. An early Adam Taggart goal was the only one of the match to leave Australia with a perfect record after 4 matches of World Cup qualifying and 4 to play in the first half of 2020. ==Record== { style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !

Voters elected one member to the United States Senate, 53 members to the United States House of Representatives, all eight state constitutional offices, all four members to the Board of Equalization, 20 members to the California State Senate, and all 80 members to the California State Assembly, among other elected offices. Pursuant to Proposition 14 passed in 2010, California uses a nonpartisan blanket primary. All the candidates for the same elected office, regardless of respective political party, run against each other at once during the primary. The candidates receiving the most and second-most votes in the primary election then become the contestants in the general election. ==United States Congress== Santa Clara County. ===Senate=== Incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein won re-election. ===House of Representatives=Statewide constitutional officesGovernor=== Incumbent Democrat Jerry Brown was term-limited and was succeeded by Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. ===Lieutenant Governor=== Incumbent Democrat Gavin Newsom was term-limited and was succeeded by the Democratic former United States Ambassador to Hungary Eleni Kounalakis. ===Attorney General=== Incumbent Democrat Xavier Becerra won his first election after his appointment and confirmation to the office on January 24, 2017. ===Secretary of State=== Incumbent Democrat Alex Padilla won re-election. ===Treasurer=== Incumbent Democrat John Chiang left office to run for governor and was succeeded by Democratic State Board of Equalization member Fiona Ma. ===Controller=== Incumbent Democrat Betty Yee won re- election. ===Insurance Commissioner=== Incumbent Democrat Dave Jones was term- limited and was succeeded by Democratic state senator Ricardo Lara. ===Superintendent of Public Instruction=== Incumbent Tom Torlakson was term- limited and was succeeded by Democratic state assemblymember Tony Thurmond. ==Board of EqualizationDistrict 1=== Incumbent Republican George Runner was term-limited and was succeeded by Republican state senator Ted Gaines. ===District 2=== Incumbent Democrat Fiona Ma left office to run for state treasurer and was succeeded by Democratic San Francisco supervisor Malia Cohen. ===District 3=== Incumbent Democrat Jerome Horton was term-limited and was succeeded by Democratic Santa Monica city councilmember Tony Vazquez. ===District 4=== Incumbent Republican Diane Harkey left office to run for the United States House of Representatives and was succeeded by Democratic former San Diego city councilmember and perennial candidate Mike Schaefer. ==State LegislatureState Senate=State Assembly=Statewide ballot propositionsJune primary election=== Since the passage of a law in November 2011, state primary elections may only feature propositions placed on the ballot by the state legislature. * Proposition 68 - Passed *: A $4 billion bond measure to fund various parks, natural resources protection, climate adaptation, water quality and supply, and flood protection projects. Proponents argued that these projects will ensure and protect water resources, even during times of droughts. Opponents worried about adding more bonds to California's already existing debt. * Proposition 69 - Passed *: A state constitution amendment that mandates that revenues generated by the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 can only be used for transportation purposes. Proponents argued that this will prevent the state legislature from redirecting these funds to non-transportation programs. Opponents argued that this will not fix or build new roads, nor would it protect gas tax revenues. * Proposition 70 - Failed *: A state constitution amendment that would have required that revenue from cap and trade programs be collected in a special fund starting in 2024. The state legislature would then need a two-thirds majority vote to spend this money. Proponents argued that this will ensure that the state legislature will spend these funds wisely on high priority projects. Opponents argued that this will empower anti-environmental special interest groups because a two-thirds majority vote requirement will lead to more legislative gridlock. * Proposition 71 - Passed *: A state constitution amendment to move the effective date of passed ballot measures from the day after the election to the fifth day after the Secretary of State certifies the results. Proponents wanted to make sure that future election results are officially certified before ballot measures go into effect. Opponents worried that this will prevent future ballot measures from retroactively taking effect, because there may be a scenario where a voter-approved ballot measure may need to be enforced as soon as possible. * Proposition 72 - Passed *: A state constitution amendment to exclude rainwater capture systems completed on or after January 1, 2019 from property tax assessments. Proponents wanted more homeowners to install these systems to help conserve water, and not get taxed on them. There was no opposing argument submitted to the Secretary of State. ===November general election=== * Proposition 1 – Passed *: Veterans and Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018. This mandatory proposition, placed by the state legislature and the Governor, will authorize $4 billion in bonds to fund various veterans' home loans and affordable housing programs. Supporters want such affordable housing, while opponents argue that there are better alternative solutions. * Proposition 2 – Passed *: No Place Like Home Act of 2018. This mandatory proposition, placed by the state legislature and the Governor, will allow revenue generated by 2004's Proposition 63, the 1 percent tax on incomes above $1 million, be used for $2 billion in bonds for homelessness prevention housing. Supporters say that this will help people get off the street, while opponents argue that diverting Prop. 63 revenue from the state's public mental health system may actually increase the homelessness. * Proposition 3 – Failed *: Authorizes Bonds to Fund Projects for Water Supply and Quality, Watershed, Fish, Wildlife, Water Conveyance, and Groundwater Sustainability and Storage. Initiative Statute. Authorizes $8.877 billion in bonds to fund such infrastructure projects. Supporters favor funding such water projects, while opponents argue that it is not worth adding more bond debt if it is not going to produce new, usable water. * Proposition 4 – Passed *: Authorizes $1.5 billion in bonds to funding construction at various hospitals providing children’s health care. Initiative Statute. Authorizes $1.5 billion in bonds to fund grants for construction and improvements at various children's hospitals. supporters favor such new hospital projects, while opponents would rather look for better ways to improve the state's overall health care system. * Proposition 5 – Failed *: Changes Requirements for Certain Property Owners to Transfer Their Property Tax Base to Replacement Property. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute. Will amend 1978's Proposition 13 by allowing homeowners who are over 55 years old or severely disabled to transfer their property tax base from their old home to their new one, regardless of the new residence's property value, location, or their previous transfers. Supporters want to make it easier for seniors and the severely disabled when they move to a new residence, while opponents worry that public programs and services could be cut as a result of the potential loss of up to $1 billion of tax revenue. * Proposition 6 – Failed *: Eliminates Recently Enacted Road Repair and Transportation Funding by Repealing Revenues Dedicated for those Purposes. Requires any Measure to Enact Certain Vehicle Fuel Taxes and Vehicle Fees be Submitted to and Approved by the Electorate. Initiative Constitutional Amendment. Repeals the fuel tax increases and vehicle fees under the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. Any future increases would then require a mandatory proposition placed on the ballot. Supporters feel that the fuel taxes and vehicle fees are unfairly regressive, while opponents worry about the safety of roads and bridges if they do not get properly maintained. * Proposition 7 – Passed *: Daylight Saving Time. This mandatory proposition, placed by the state legislature and the Governor, will repeal 1949's Proposition 12, allowing the state legislature to enact permanent daylight saving time, subject to approval by the U.S. Congress. Supporters cite the public health and safety drawbacks of the biannual time changes, while opponents say that it is not worth it having people, especially school children, having to walk in the dark in the morning during the winter months. * Proposition 8 – Failed *: Authorizes State Regulation of Kidney Dialysis Clinics. Limits Charges for Patient Care. Initiative Statute. Among other requirements, mandates that kidney dialysis clinics issue refunds to their patients if their revenue exceeds 115 percent of their costs of direct patient care and health care quality improvements. Supporters want to protect patients from higher fees and from being overcharged, while opponents worry that these stricter requirements will force the closure of many of these clinics. * Proposition 9 - Removed from the ballot by order of the California Supreme Court *: Division of California into Three States. Initiative Statute. Also known as the Cal 3 measure, this would have divided California into three U.S. states, subject to approval by the U.S. Congress. It was removed from the ballot by the California Supreme Court on July 18, 2018, for further legal review. In September, the court affirmed their removal of the measure along with banning any such measure to be on the ballot in the future. * Proposition 10 – Failed *: Expands Local Governments’ Authority to Enact Rent Control on Residential Property. Initiative Statute. Repeals the Costa–Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, lifting its limits on municipal rent control ordinances. Supporters argue that more local control will preserve affordable rents, while opponents worry that this will increase the local bureaucracy by allowing them to also regulate single-family homes and to also potentially add fees on top of the rents. * Proposition 11 – Passed *: Requires Private-Sector Emergency Ambulance Employees to Remain on Call During Work Breaks. Changes Other Conditions of Employment. Initiative Statute. Among other requirements, would require private-sector emergency ambulance employees to remain on call during breaks, be trained in certain emergency situations, and receive paid mental health services from their employers. Supporters argue that these changes will help save lives during disasters and emergencies. There was no opposing argument submitted to the Secretary of State. * Proposition 12 – Passed *: Establishes New Standards for Confinement of Certain Farm Animals; Bans Sale of Certain Non-Complying Products. Initiative Statute. Requires meats and eggs be produced from farm animals that are confined in areas greater than a specific amount of space. Any eggs and uncooked meat from animals not housed under these requirements would then be banned from being sold in the state. Supporters hope that this will help further stop animal cruelty on these farms. Opponents state that this legalizes cages until at least 2022, and claim some of the specific space regulations (such as only allowing a single square foot of space per hen) are not exactly animal-friendly. ==See also== *Mister America, a fictional film about the 2018 election for district attorney of San Bernardino County ==References *California Elections and Voter Information from the California Secretary of State *Candidates at Vote Smart *Candidates at Ballotpedia *Campaign finance at National Institute on Money in State Politics ;Official Board of Equalization District 1 campaign websites *Ted Gaines (R) for Board of Equalization *Tom Hallinan (D) for Board of Equalization ;Official Board of Equalization District 2 campaign websites *Mark Burns (R) for Board of Equalization *Malia Cohen (D) for Board of Equalization ;Official Board of Equalization District 3 campaign websites *G.

The game originated as a project for USC’s Intermediate Games class and had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014. It was later picked up by publisher Humble Bundle in 2017 with Japanese publishing support from Kakehashi Games. Aegis Defenders was released on February 8, 2018, on macOS, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. == Gameplay == In Aegis Defenders, players control a team of up to 4 characters. In addition to running, jumping, and attacking, each character has a unique sub-ability and can build a unique item. Players can use \\"cross fusion\\" to combine items into more powerful ones. Each level is usually split into exploration and tower defense phases. The exploration phase consists of platforming and puzzle solving. During the tower defense phase, players must protect their base (an important person or object) from waves of approaching enemies. There are 18 levels in the story campaign plus 3 bonus levels featuring crossover characters from other Kickstarter games including Shovel Knight, Lunais from Timespinner, and Derpl Zork from Awesomenauts. == Plot == Aegis Defenders follows a pair of Ruinhunters, Bart and his grand daughter Clu, as they discover a powerful weapon known as Aegis and embark on a quest to prevent it from falling into the hands of an evil empire. Along the way they join forces with Kobo the companion drone, Kaiim the monk, and Zula the bandit. == Development and release == Aegis Defenders originated as a student project by Bryce Kho and Lifu Lin for USC’s Intermediate Games class. After graduating, Bryce started indie studio Guts Department to develop the project into a full game and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014. The game was primarily developed by a 3-person team with Bryce Kho as director/writer/artist/designer, his sister Kristen Kho as engineer, and Max Palazzo as producer. Bryce's wife, Lai Xu, co-wrote the script. Max Palazzo and Mike Effenberger assisted Bryce with design and tuning for levels. Guts Department partnered with Power Up Audio for the music and sound effects. The soundtrack was composed by Riley Koenig. It features 14 original tracks that blend together old-school synth elements with more traditional Japanese RPG orchestral music.

She served as president of the Women's Trade Union League from 1922 to 1926. In 1931 she was appointed secretary of the New York State Department of Labor under Industrial Commissioner Frances Perkins. She was the first woman and the first trade unionist to hold that position. == Early life and education == Maud O'Farrell was born in County Kildare, Ireland, on May 3, 1879. She was one of fourteen children of William J. Farrell, a flour miller, and Sara Matilda Grace. Her mother was related to William Russell Grace, who became New York City's first Irish Catholic mayor in 1880, and to the owners of the Grace shipping line. Maud O'Farrell was educated at home, and then at convent schools in Germany and France. Afterwards she worked for a time as a governess in Italy. While living in Europe she became fluent in Italian, German, and French. == Career == She moved to the United States in 1901, settling in New York City. She worked briefly as a governess, quitting after receiving unwanted attention from her employer. The following year she began working as a proofreader for a foreign language printing company, and in 1903 she joined the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). In 1912 she joined the Woman Suffrage Party. A fluent Italian speaker, she canvassed Italian neighborhoods promoting women's suffrage to the women there. She joined International Typographical Union Local 6, known as \\"Big Six,\\" in 1913. She served as secretary of the New York WTUL from 1917 to 1921. She was a WTUL delegate to the American Federation of Labor convention in 1919 and the First International Congress of Working Women (ICWW) the same year. At the ICWW, she and other delegates drew up resolutions demanding an age minimum for working children, a 44-hour work week, and regulations for dangerous jobs. In 1921 she traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, as a delegate to the Second International Congress of Working Women. There she was named vice president of the newly founded International Federation of Working Women. Over the next two years she helped organize a global network of working women's groups. After a year-long hiatus in Europe, she returned to New York in 1922 and began working for the WTUL as an advisor for women seeking workers' compensation. She was elected president of the national WTUL that same year, and re-elected in 1924. She was the first working woman to serve as WTUL president. At the same time, she worked as an adviser to the league's Compensation Service, handling some 4,000 cases between 1922 and 1929. Serving as president while working full time became burdensome, and she resigned the presidency in 1926. In December 1931, Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her secretary of the New York State Department of Labor, a position she held until her death in 1937. The first woman and the first labor representative to hold that office, she served under Commissioners Frances Perkins and Elmer F. Andrews. Swartz was known as a gifted speaker and a champion of better working conditions for women. == Personal life == She married a printer named Lee Swartz in 1905. It was a brief, unhappy marriage, and the couple soon separated, declining to divorce for religious reasons. In 1912 she met Rose Schneiderman, with whom she had a close friendship until her death. In the 1920s, she and Schneiderman befriended Eleanor Roosevelt, who had joined the WTUL They often visited the Roosevelts and discussed labor problems. She died of a heart attack on February 22, 1937, at the New York Hospital in Manhattan, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery in Brooklyn. Frances Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt were among those who attended her funeral. == References  Further reading == * * Category: 1879 births Category: 1937 deaths Category:People from County Kildare Category:Women's Trade Union League people Category:Irish emigrants to the United States Category:American Roman Catholics ","title":"Maud O'Farrell Swartz"},{"id":"56899176","text":"Samson Gunapandian was an Indian football player. ==Playing career== Born in Nazareth, Tamil Nadu, S.Gunapandian played for the Indian football national team.

As of 2018 it features a camping site and is being reconsidered as the site of a potential future port. == Port Proposals == In 1914, Decres Bay was under consideration as an alternative site for the development of a commercial port for the bulk handling of wheat at the terminus of the Minnipa Hill railway. The site was passed over, with insufficient depth of water at the entrance channel cited as a deciding factor. The channel offered a minimum depth of 8.2 metres (27 feet). Despite being more exposed to storms and swell, and requiring ongoing dredging works, the neighboring site at Cape Thevenard was selected in preference. Members of the Murat Bay Vigilance Committee believed that the port proposal was abandoned as a result of prejudice and politics; namely that the two sites represented competing visions of consecutive Labor (Decres Bay) and Liberal (Thevenard) governments. The proposed jetty was to be 1260 feet (384 metres) long and reach into water 30 feet deep (9.1 metres) but was never built.

An academy graduate of Maritzburg United, he made his professional debut in 2016 and went on to make over 80 appearances for the club. During the 2017–18 season, he helped the club to record-high fourth-place finish in the league and was rewarded for his form with the Young Player of the Season award. At the end of the following season, he joined Orlando Pirates. Ndlovu is also a full international since March 2018 and has represented South Africa at a COSAFA Cup. ==Club careerMaritzburg United=== Having previously been a ball-boy for the club, Ndlovu joined the youth academy of Maritzburg United from the now defunct Umgungundlovu Academy of Sport in Pietermaritzburg. He excelled during his time in the club's academy where he played in the SAB League and earned the nickname Mbesuma, in reference to former PSL top goalscorer, Collins Mbesuma. In 2016, he was promoted to senior side by coach Roger De Sa alongside Mlondi Dlamini and Tso Motjatji. He made his debut for the club on 22 October 2016 when he came on as a substitute for Denis Weidlich in a penalty shootout loss to Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup. His league debut followed on 20 December in a 1–1 draw with Bidvest Wits and he went on to make 18 appearances across all competitions for the season. Ndlovu enjoyed a stellar campaign under Fadlu Davids during the 2017–18 season in which he helped the club to an historic league finish. In January 2018, he became the first-ever player from Maritzburg United to win the Absa Premiership Player of the Month award and two months later was rewarded with a new long-term contract with the club, ending speculation linking him with a transfer away. He then made his 50th appearance for the club on 25 April when he started in a 2–2 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns. The following month, he featured in the Nedbank Cup final where Maritzburg United were defeated 1–0 by Free State Stars. The season culminated with Maritzburg United ending fourth in the league; their highest ever finish with their highest ever points tally. On 21 May, following a campaign in which he played in all but three matches, scored five goals and was the most fouled player in the league, Ndlovu was nominated for a host of PSL awards including the awards for Midfielder of the Season, Young Player of the Season and Footballer of the Season. He was also nominated for the Most Promising Player award for his performances in the Nedbank Cup. The award ceremony was held eight days later during which he walked away with the Midfielder of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards. Ahead of the following season, Ndlovu reportedly agreed to a deal in principle to sign with Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of the campaign. He struggled for form during the first half of the season and picked up his first professional red card when he received a direct dismissal for a studs-up challenge on Kaizer Chiefs defender Siyabonga Ngezana in August. His struggles coincided with those of the Maritzburg United's who ended the domestic season second last in the league standings, having gone through three managers. As a result, the club was forced to take part in the promotion play-offs in which Ndlovu scored once to ensure they maintained their top-flight status. ===Orlando Pirates=== On 12 June 2019, Ndlovu confirmed that he had signed a three-year deal with Orlando Pirates. Upon making the announcement, he informed media that he had never signed any agreement with Sundowns and that his reason for joining Pirates was that the club's style of play suited his abilities. ==International careerSouth Africa=== In March 2018, Ndlovu was called up to the South African national team for the first time by coach Stuart Baxter for the inaugural Four Nations Invitational Tournament. He made his debut on 21 March, coming on as a second-half substitute for Maphosa Modiba in a 1–1 (7–6) penalty shootout win over Angola. He made his first start three days later as South Africa beat hosts Zambia 2–0 to claim the title. Later that year he was named in Baxter's squad for the 2018 COSAFA Cup. He started in South Africa's opening match in the competition, a penalty shootout loss to Madagascar. He featured throughout the tournament as South Africa went on to lift the Plate title, equivalent of a fifth-placed finish. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2 style=\\"width: 100pt;\\"Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=\\"2\\" Cup1 !colspan=\\"2\\" League Cup2 !colspan=\\"2\\" Continental3 !colspan=2Other4 !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Maritzburg United 2016–17 PSL 16010100000180 - 2017–18 PSL 27540000030345 - 2018–19 PSL 25000210051322 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total !68!!5!!5!!0!!3!!1!!0!!0!!8!!1!!84!!7 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Orlando Pirates 2019–20 PSL 13010100000150 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !81!!5!!6!!0!!4!!1!!0!!0!!8!!1!!99!!7 } 1 Includes Nedbank Cup matches. 2 Includes Telkom Knockout matches. 4 Includes MTN 8 and PSL promotion play-off matches. ===International=== {   - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"1\\"South Africa 201850 - !colspan=2Total50 } ==HonoursIndividual=== * PSL Player of the Month: January 2018 * PSL Young Player of the Season: 2017–18 * PSL Midfielder of the Season: 2017–18 ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:South African soccer players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Maritzburg United F.C. players Category:Orlando Pirates F.C. players Category:South African Premier Division players Category:Sportspeople from Pietermaritzburg Category:South Africa international soccer players ","title":"Siphesihle Ndlovu"},{"id":"56899235","text":"1984 Empress's Cup Final was the 6th final of the Empress's Cup competition.

They were friends who played grade cricket in Australia and began a Twitter account as @gradecricketer. They subsequently wrote books and columns and host a podcast. In July 2020 it was announced Dave Edwards had left the group to focus on other commitments.\\"117. A Natural Vector of Disease, with Tim Bresnan, Stephen O'Keefe and Jonathan Wilson\\", The Grade Cricketer, Podcast Jul 6, 2020. ==Books== *The Grade Cricketer (2016) *Tea and No Sympathy (2017) == Podcast == The Grade Cricketer Podcast is presented by the three creators of the persona during the Australian cricketing summer, and is a comedic, satirical take on the cricketing world. There have been four seasons since the promo episode was released in October 2016. Music is provided by Adrian Leung, with cover design by Julia Dowe. === Format ===  Interviews  At least one guest is usually interviewed in each episode, and the format regularly involves one interview with a cricket journalist, and a further one later on with a current or former player. These always begin with some form of the question \\"What's your relationship with Grade Cricket?\\"; whilst the player interviews end with throw-downs, in which the presenters ask ridiculous, long-winded questions, to which the guest can often respond only with a binary yes/no answer. The most frequent guests, also known as \\"best friends of the show\\", are Adam \\"Collo\\" Collins from the journalism world, with ten appearances, and Ed \\"Ted\\" Cowan from the players with six (also the first guest, having to re-record his interview after a technical mishap - this has now occurred twice).  AskTGC  The last section of the podcast normally involves answering questions submitted to The Grade Cricketer via social media, (the Twitter hashtag being #askTGC, hence the name). These questions are often incredibly long, leading Higgins to sometimes refer to the section as their \\"short story competition\\", but also sometimes little more than a statement followed by \\"thoughts?\\", and regularly concern topics such as alpha-ing, father-son relationships, social status within clubs/teams, retirement from the game, and other general advice relating to the world of amateur cricket.  Advertisements  Over the course of the podcast run, advertisements for various products, both real and imaginary tie-in ones, have been inserted, voiced by Toby Shain and, occasionally, the hosts themselves. Products include: = Fake Products/services = * Chop King Cologne: a fragrance inspired by the concept of the Chop King, with the tagline of \\"reek of runs without hitting them\\". * The Grade Cricket Rehabilitation Centre: a centre for reintegrating former grade cricket players into normal society. * Reno Rampage: a parody of a Renovation Rescue-style show, specifically aimed at renovating grade cricket clubhouses. *Bravago: a parody of travel company Trivago. *Alpha-Ade: a fictional sportsdrink, parodying Gator/Powerade = Real Products/services = *OLED TV's: a parody of David Warner's advertisements for the same product during the 2016/17 Australian home summer series. * Grade cricket *The Grade Cricketer: Tea and No Sympathy (2017) === Episode guide === {  +Season 1 2016/17 Summer !# / title !Guest(s) - The Grade Cricketer Podcast promo  - - 1.

He was for many years concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. ==Life== Matthaei was born in Dresden in 1781. Little is known of his early life; it is thought he was largely self-taught as a violinist. In 1803 he arrived in Leipzig, and was appointed as a soloist of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, of which the concertmaster was Bartolomeo Campagnoli. Through patrons and friends he had the opportunity to study in Paris, where from 1804 he was a student of Rodolphe Kreutzer. In 1806 he reappeared in public in Leipzig, and became important there in musical activities. With other members of the Gewandhaus Orchestra – Campagnoli, Johann Georg Hermann Voigt and Friedrich Dotzauer – he founded in 1808 a string quartet, the Gewandhaus Quartet. (The quartet still exists today.)History Gewandhaus Quartet. Retrieved 17 March 2018. In 1811 Matthaei performed in Berlin, and in 1816 he toured northwest Germany. In 1818 he replaced Campagnoli as concertmaster of the Gewandhaus Orchestra; he held the post until his death in 1835. Carl Ferdinand Becker, in an obituary, wrote that he \\"through word and deed, guided many young musicians so excellently\\" and \\"revealed to us Beethoven's masterpieces\\". \\"The Leipzig orchestra was made famous by Matthaei... Beethoven himself bestowed praise on him.\\"\\"Nekrolog.\\" Carl Ferdinand Becker.

In 1999, she sued her insurer over mold damage in her 22-room Austin, Texas mansion. Their case started as a single claim for water damage and turned into a case about mold contamination in the entire house. They were one of the first cases to highlight the dangerous results of toxic mold and changed how normal indoor mold was viewed in America.

It contains 100 game screens, VGA graphics, professionally dubbed dialogue, and 50 scenic tracks. ==Reception== This game was overlooked in many of the local gaming magazines such as Score and Excalibur.

In the 1970s, he successfully halted an urban expansion project that would have widened the streets of the Old City. In the 1980s, his lobbying efforts succeeded in placing Old Aleppo on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. By 2008, Qudsi had dedicated decades of his life to the rehabilitation of the historic neighborhood and hoped it would be a \\"fruitful example\\" to other cities whose ancient quarters were at risk of decay. ==Biography Early life and education === Qudsi was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1940, and spent the first 13 years of his life in a courtyard house in the Old City.

Qudsi was determined to stop the bulldozers and, in 1978, after meeting with local officials and with the support of a group of concerned residents, he convinced the Cultural Minister to register Aleppo as a historic site, temporarily halting all renovations and demolitions. In 1978, officials from UNESCO visited Aleppo, and declared the city as a World Heritage Site in 1986. By 1990, all work demolishing the city came to a halt. In 1994, an emergency fund was created to fund his idea of interest-free loans for Aleppo's residents to restore their homes. ===Old City Conservation Efforts=== After successfully halting the Master Plan, Qudsi dedicated the following decades of his life to the rehabilitation and preservation of the Old City of Aleppo.

He is an economist as well as an expert in business and economy ethics. As academic disciple of Karl Homann he contributed substantially to Homanns teaching regarding the approach of institutional economics toward business ethics, which not only plays an important part at Universities and international business schools but also in the economy, politics and the society. == Life == Andreas Suchanek studied political economy at the University Kiel and the University Göttingen before he graduated as doctor of political science summa cum laude from the private Witten/Herdecke University in 1993. In 1999 he was habilitated at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt due to his work on normative environmental economics. Subsequently, in 1999, he was appointed as Karl Homanns successor and took over the substitution of the chair for economy and business ethics at the University's science faculty. Homann left to serve as chair for philosophy and economy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 2004, Suchanek joined the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management (former Handelshochschule Leipzig). Since that time, he holds the Dr. Werner Jackstädt-chair for economy and business ethics. In addition to this, since 2005, Suchanek is as member of the Wittenberg-Center for Global Ethics (Wittenberg-Zentrums für Globale Ethik) board of directors which specializes on the topics \\"Building Global Cooperation\\" and corporate social responsibility as globalization, world economy and global competition are supposed to be shaped for the benefit of all people. According to the center, this requires general principles which make peace, justice and prosperity possible in the consolidating world society. Since 2013 Suchanek is the center's chairman and vice chairman of the executive board of the foundation. The foundation was founded by former US ambassador Andrew Young and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former German minister of foreign affairs. The idea for founding the center was inspired by Hans- Dietrich Genscher's guiding principle “winners vs. losers – that's not how the new world order should be. Everybody should have their share of the winning side. In affirming the interests of others lies a chance for oneself”. As academic leader Andreas Suchanek is responsible to develop the theoretical groundwork of the Wittenberg-Center with the aim for the guiding principle to increasingly take root in the society. A number of well-known businesses and organizations as well as important personalities from the spheres of politics, economy, church, culture and science support the Wittenberg-Center's work. As an expert in questions of corporate social responsibility Suchanek advises global businesses from various economic branches. == Theory == Suchanek's studies focus on economy and business ethics, sustainability, trust and credibility management as well as interaction ethics. By using decision and game theory methods, which view the question of competition and cooperation not as contradiction but as chance to win cooperation, Suchanek developed the economically reformed golden rule: invest in the conditions of social collaboration for mutual advantage. Being a member of the core team of HHL - Leipzig Graduate School of Management, he developed the Leipzig Leadership Model, which was published in 2016, along with Manfred Kirchgeorg, Timo Meynhardt, Andreas Pinkwart and Henning Zülch.Kirchgeorg, Manfred; Meynhardt, Timo; Pinkwart, Andreas; Suchanek, Andreas; Zülch, Henning: Das Leipziger Führungsmodell: The Leipzig Leadership Model. 2. überarb. und erw.

Sometimes for some reasons product spaces are equipped with sigma-algebra different than the product sigma-algebra. In these cases the projections need not be measurable at all. The projected set of a measurable set is called analytic set and need not be a measurable set. However, in some cases, either relatively to the product sigma-algebra or relatively to some other sigma-algebra, projected set of measurable set is indeed measurable. Henri Lebesgue himself, one of the founders of measure theory, was mistaken about that fact. In a paper from 1905 he wrote that the projection of Borel set in the plane onto the real line is again a Borel set.Lebesgue, H. (1905) Sur les fonctions représentables analytiquement. Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées. Vol. 1, 139–216. The mathematician Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin found that error about ten years later, and his following research has led to descriptive set theory. The fundamental mistake of Lebesgue was to think that projection commutes with decreasing intersection, while there are simple counterexamples to that. ==Basic examples== As an example for a non-measurable projection, one can take the space X := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} with the sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal{F} := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\emptyset, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and the space y := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} with the sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal{G} := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\emptyset, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The diagonal set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left(0,0\\\\right),\\\\left(1,1\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset X\\\\times Y is not measurable relatively to \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\otimes\\\\mathcal{G}, although the both projections are measurable sets. The common example for a non-measurable set which is a projection of a measurable set, is in Lebesgue sigma-algebra. Let \\\\mathcal{L} be Lebesgue sigma-algebra of \\\\mathbb{R} and let \\\\mathcal{L}' be the Lebesgue sigma-algebra of \\\\mathbb{R}^2. For any bounded N \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} not in \\\\mathcal{L}, the set N \\\\times \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is in \\\\mathcal{L}', since Lebesgue measure is complete and the product set is contained in a set of zero measure. Still one can see that \\\\mathcal{L}' is not the product sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{L} but its completion. As for such example in product sigma-algebra, one can take the space \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ^{\\\\mathbb{R}} (or any product along a set with cardinality greater than continuum) with the product sigma-algebra \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\bigotimes_{t\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\mathcal{F}_{t} where \\\\mathcal{F}_{t}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\emptyset,\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ,\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ,\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} for every t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. In fact, in this case \\"most\\" of the projected sets are not measurable, since the cardinality of \\\\mathcal{F} is \\\\aleph_0\\\\cdot2^{\\\\aleph_0}=2^{\\\\aleph_0}, whereas the cardinality of the projected sets is 2^{2^{\\\\aleph_0}}. There are also examples of Borel sets in the plane which their projection to the real line is not a Borel set, as Suslin showed. ==Measurable projection theorem== The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for the projection of measurable sets to be measurable. Let \\\\left(X, \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\right) be a measurable space and let \\\\left(Y,\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\right) be a polish space where \\\\mathcal{B} is its Borel sigma-algebra. Then for every set in the product sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{B}, the projected set onto X is a universally measurable set relatively to \\\\mathcal{F}.* An important special case of this theorem is that the projection of any Borel set ot \\\\mathbb{R}^n onto \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-k} where k is Lebesgue-measurable, even though it is not necessarily a Borel set. In addition, it means that the former example of non-Lebesgue-measurable set of \\\\mathbb{R} which is a projection of some measurable set of \\\\mathbb{R}^2, is the only sort of such example. ==See also== * Analytic set * Descriptive set theory ==References * \\"Measurable projection theorem\\", PlanetMath Category:Descriptive set theory Category:Measure theory ","title":"Projection (measure theory)"},{"id":"56899855","text":"Hsio-yen Shih (1933–2001) was a Chinese-born Canadian art historian who specialized in early Chinese and Japanese paintings, as well as ancient Chinese pottery and bronzeware.

It comments on Bowie's change of image, from Ziggy Stardust to the Soul Star of Young Americans, to \\"The Thin White Duke\\", using archive material. David Bowie: The Last Five years (2017) The documentary has continued the previous method of presenting David Bowie’ s life by interviewing others. This documentary was broadcast a year after Bowie’ s death and is also receiving widespread attention. Instead of interviewing Bowie’ s friends and family about Bowie’ s heart attack and later cancer diagnosis, Francis Whately interviewed the musicians who have cooperate with David Bowie in his last two albums (Blackstar and The Next Day) and the New York musical Lazarus. This documentary has showed Bowie’ s innovation in the last five years of his life after nearly a decade of silence. Rock ‘n’ Roll Guns for Hire: The Story of the Sidemen (2017) The documentary mainly focused on the musicians who work behind some of the greatest artists such as Prince, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Beyoncé and make contribution to change musical history. Those musicians, called ‘Guns for Hire’ in the documentary, are the people who play at live shows and often even contribute to recordings as songwriters or session musicians. Judi Dench: All the World’s Her Stage (2016) The documentary has looked back over Judi Dench, one of Britain's greatest actors’ s remarkable 60-year career. Unlike other documentaries, this one has showed Judi’ life in a never known, a new angle. == Stories behind == 1) Francis Whately posted a David Bowie poster on the wall of his home when he was a teenager, and described Bowie as his hero in a series of subsequent interviews. The first meeting of Whately and Bowie was in 1998, Whately was just finished 100 Works, an episode of British sculpture, and Bowie has contributed his voices and words in this short film. Before that time, Whately and Bowie were conducted by telephone and letters. Whately was very nervous and excited about seeing his hero, but Bowie's courteous and polite made the conversation more comfortable. After that, Whately and Bowie kept in touch for a long time until Bowie died. 2) Bowie and Whately formed a good relationship. Although they rarely talk about music, they are interested in many of the same things, they often discuss the books and arts that they admired. In the 1990s, Bowie was often make phone call with Whately. At that time, Bowie was writing for an art magazine, Whately did lots of art films and was very interested in contemporary arts, they always had common interest to talk about. 3) Although the two documentaries, David Bowie: Five Years and David Bowie: The Last Five Years both have recorded the interviews from others, the themes and shooting methods are quite different. The first one was basic on David Bowie’ s request, instead of making a conventional biography about him being born and going through his life chronologically, director has used more contemporary editing and collage to show the most important five years in Bowie’ life. While during filming David Bowie: The Last Five Years, Bowie was very care about his privacy and didn't gave Whately chance to interview him along. So there's no interview videos of Bowie’ s last five years in this documentary. Whately interviewed the musicians who have cooperated with Bowie in his last two albums: Blackstar and The Next Day and interviewed them in the Jazz Bar 55° which located in New York center. By representing the nervous and secret recording process from the musicians’ perspective, the film has show Bowie’ s enthusiasm on music. 4) The director himself thinks that the difference between the two documentaries is that in the first one he wanted to show to audience is the changeable of Bowie, while the second one was not focus on how much he changed, but his unchangeable, his enthusiasm on music. 5) David Bowie: The Last Five Years was on the air on HBO on January 8, 2017, which would have been David Bowie' s 71st birthday. == References  * Category:British television producers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Francis Whately"},{"id":"56899892","text":"Colwellia asteriadis is a Gram-negative and rod-shaped bacterium from the genus of Colwellia which has been isolated from the starfish Asterias amurensis from the Sea of Japan. ==References *Type strain of Colwellia asteriadis at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Actinomycetales Category:Bacteria described in 2010 ","title":"Colwellia asteriadis"},{"id":"56899922","text":"Pilton in Devon The Church of St Mary the Virgin in Pilton is the 13th- century Anglican parish church for the Pilton suburb of Barnstaple in Devon. It has been a Grade I listed building since 1951 and comes under the Diocese of Exeter. ==History and exterior== The mock-Tudor almhouses leading to the church date from 1849 Sir John Chichester (d.1569) in the Raleigh Chapel The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a large parish church and formerly formed part of the Benedictine Pilton Priory which was founded 925-940 as a cell of Malmesbury Abbey. It was closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1533 when it was acquired by the Chichester Family of Raleigh Manor. The church building we see today is partly 13th-century (it was dedicated in 1259) and partly 15th-century with some limited restoration and rebuilding during the 17th-century. It is built with local purple, grey and brown slatestone with sandstone dressings; the roofs are of slate. The church is approached through the pretty imitation-Tudor almshouses built in 1849. The tower and South aisle date from the time of the Priory and on the church's North side the roof-line of the adjoining monastic buildings can still be seen, the cloister having run along the nave (hence the high sills of the North aisle windows) and traces of other taller buildings can be seen butting against the North tower. The church has a peal of eight bells some of which date from 1712. The tower is described as \`rebuilt' according to an inscription on the porch by Robert Nutting in 1696 as a result of damage during the Civil War; the church has later rebuilding from 1845 to 1850.Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books (1952) pgs 135-136 ==Interior of the church== Sir Robert Chichester has life size figures The elaborate painted rood screen Wall monument to Christopher Lethbridge (d.1713) The pulpit with its iron arm dates to c1550 font also dates to c1550 The North aisle has plain glass in its windows but some fragments of Medieval coloured glass can be seen in the tracery at the top..A Brief Guide to the Ancient Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, Pilton (N.D.) pg 1 The nave and chancel were added to the North aisle section of the church in about 1320 to 1330, which is confirmed by an extract from the Register of Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, who in 1311 made a contribution to Pilton Priory towards the cost of building the chancel. The parclose screen into the South East chapel (the Raleigh Chapel) is of three bays and is well carved with a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance detail and is inscribed with an R for Raleigh and is presumably post-1533. It may have been brought to the church from the private chapel at Raleigh Manor when it was demolished in the 18th-century.Guide, pg4 The stone pulpit is Perpendicular Period of about 1550 and stands on a stem while its panels are decorated with blind arcading with a Tudor rose carved above the pedestal and retaining some traces of its original colour. The pulpit has a Jacobean sounding board and projecting from the side there is an unusual iron arm and hand which is probably Elizabethan which once held an hourglass for timing the sermons. In 1616 a payment was made for a replacement hourglass, and in 1646 a half-hour glass was purchased, which suggests that shorter sermons had become the fashion.Guide, pg3 The baptismal font has a plain octagonal Ham Hill bowl on a stem and a fine font cover which Nikolaus Pevsner believed was put together in the Elizabethan era. The font also dates to about 1550 and stands beneath a canopied tester made from pieces of Gothic and Renaissance carving including linenfold, figure panels, applied barley- sugar ribs and Gothic fretwork.Guide, pg2 The altar table with its pull-out leaves is late 16th-century and was restored in 1985. The communion rail is Elizabethan. The rood screen that separates the chancel and Raleigh Chapel from the nave and South aisle has lost its coving and cresting while the spandrels have been filled with a variety of remnants from the missing pieces. The panels in the lower section once depicted the Apostles some of which have been restored to something like their original appearance. These images were added to the screen at the expense of Thomas Martyn who, when he died in 1510, left a legacy in his will for this purpose. Sometime later the images were obliterated with lime wash and red and green paint, while in Victorian times they were over-stained in brown. The expensive restoration process has been discontinued at present owing to cost but the aim is to restore further panels in the future.Guide, pg5 A plaque is located above a very narrow moulded doorway in the chancel which originally lead to an East end chapel with an adjoining cell which was inhabited by a recluse in 1329. The Royal Arms of 1707 are those of Queen Anne and are painted on boards and fixed to the West end of the North wall. A section of medieval wall painting is visible on the West wall. ==Monuments== The church possesses some very notable monuments including a standing sandstone wall monument to Sir John Chichester (d.1569) at the West end of the South East chapel with columns and strapwork cartouches. On the North wall of the chancel can be found a fine monument with original colour to Sir Robert Chichester (d.1627) with two rows of life-size kneeling figures, including children facing a double prie-dieu. The South aisle has a large wall monument to Christopher Lethbridge (d.1713) with elaborate achievements and putto heads.Church of St Mary the Virgin, Pilton - Church Monuments Society database ==References *Church of St Mary the Virgin, Pilton - A Church Near You - Church of England database *A Short History of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Pilton, Barnstaple - The Pilton Story website Category:Barnstaple Category:Buildings and structures in Barnstaple Pilton Pilton Pilton Pilton Pilton ","title":"Church of St Mary the Virgin, Pilton"},{"id":"56899949","text":"The Soviet Republic of Saxony (German: Sachsen Räterepublik) was a short- lived, unrecognised socialist state during the German Revolution of 1918–19 based in Saxony. ==See also== *Bavarian Soviet Republic *Paris Commune == References == Category:Communism in Germany Category:Early Soviet republics Category:Former socialist republics Category:Former states and territories of Saxony Category:History of Saxony Category:German Revolution of 1918–1919 Category:20th century in Saxony ","title":"Soviet Republic of Saxony"},{"id":"56899953","text":"Bird in the Belly are a Brighton-based folk music collective, consisting of alt-folk musician Jinnwoo, folk duo Hickory Signals, and producer and multi- instrumentalist Tom Pryor. ==History== In August 2016, Jinnwoo announced he was working with a new folk collective called Bird in the Belly. Bird in the Belly stated their objective as a band was to uncover forgotten or overlooked British songs, stories, and poems, and reintroduce them into the current folk music canon.

It is one of a series of portraits of wealthy Hanseatic merchants made by Holbein in the 1530s. This series of portraits signals the increasing importance of the emerging merchant class, as they took their place on a world stage. ==Background== In the 1530s, the artist Hans Holbein, the younger, was commissioned to paint portraits of wealthy members of Hanseatic merchant families who were stationed at their family offices in London's Steelyard. Hans Holbein, the younger painted a series of eight portraits of individual merchants from the Steelyard. Fudge, J.F., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, Brill, 2007, p.110 These portraits included including Georg Giese of Danzig; Hans of Antwerp and Hermann Wedigh (all painted in 1532); Hillebrant Wedigh of Cologne; Unknown member of the Wedigh family; Dirk Tybis of Duisburg; Cyriacus Kale and Derick Born (all painted in 1533); Derick Berck (painted in 1536). Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 139–158; The eight portraits are those that art historians agree were painted by Holbein, however the artist may also have painted other portraits of merchants, such as that of Johann Schwarzwald, which is often attributed to Holbein Merchant members of the Hanseatic League represented a new type of merchant class, that was beginning to dominate trade in 14th and 15th-century Europe. Rather than haul goods from one market town to another, as had been the practice throughout the Middle Ages, these new merchants dealt in goods on a large scale, importing and exporting across long distances. They took their place on a world stage, often maintaining permanent offices in the larger European or Asian cities, which were operated by agents or family members.Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6–10 These merchants formed a fraternity of traders, known as the Hanseatic League, to control trade, remove trade restrictions and negotiate certain privileges for their members. In London, Hanseatic merchants congregated at London's Steelyard where they enjoyed some protection and received exemptions from certain taxes and customs duties. Fudge, J.D., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, BRILL, 2007, p 110 The Steelyard, so named because of the weighing scales that had been housed there, was a walled enclosure on the North bank of the Thames, near London Bridge. Goods arriving by sea could be directly unloaded into the warehouses at the Steelyard. In addition to offices and warehouses, the Steelyard also included residences for the merchants, a guildhall, cloth halls, wine cellars and kitchens. Panayi, P., Germans in Britain Since 1500, A&C; Black, 1996, p. 19 In effect, the Steelyard was a separate and independent community, governed by the codes of the Hanseatic League, and enforced by the merchants' native cities.Fudge, J.D., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, BRILL, 2007, pp 110–112 By the 16th-century, it had become a habit for wealthier merchants, with the means to commission artworks, to have paintings of themselves, either with or without their families, made. Thus, merchants and merchant classes became important subject matter and source of income for artists. Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6–10 ==The sitter: George Giese== Georg Giese, one of the younger sons of Albrecht Giese and his wife, Elisabeth Langenbeck, was born in Danzig (Gdańsk) in 1497. His paternal family were wealthy merchants who had emigrated from Cologne in the 1430s. His father was the mayor of Danzig, and his mother's uncle had also been the mayor of Danzig. He had at least six older siblings, whose names are not entirely clear. Tiedemann Giese, who became the Bishop of Culm (Chełmno), was an older brother. Gassendi, P. and Thill, O., The Life of Copernicus (1473–1543), p. 179; these authors suggest that Georg and his brother, Tiedemann may have been cousins to Copernicus Documentary sources suggest that Giese worked at the family's London branch in the 1520s and 1530s, for at least 12 years. He may originally have assisted an older brother, Francis. Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum , Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 142–143 At the time when the portrait was commissioned, he may have been engaged to marry. Three years after the portrait was completed, he returned to his home city of Danzig, to marry Christine Krüger, the daughter of a prominent Danzig merchant, Tiedemann Krüger and grand-daughter of the Mayor of Thorn (Toruń).MacGregor, N., Germany: Memories of a Nation, Penguin, 2014, [E-book edition]; Michael. E., Hans Holbein the Younger: A Guide to Research, p. 440 Giese died in February, 1562. ==The painting== The painting of Giese was commissioned and painted whilst the subject was stationed at the London branch of the Hanse on 1532. Scholars generally agree that this was the first portrait that Holbein painted after his return to England. The subject of the painting is clearly Georg Giese, identified by the various inscriptions of his name depicted in the painting. His occupation, that of merchant, is clearly seen by his clothing and tools of trade.Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum , Journal, vol. 14, 1980, p. 142 The symbolism evident in the painting has been the subject of considerable scholarly enquiry.

This was a fulling mill as Guildford was an important location in the wool trade. This was probably the mill known as Kings Mill. By the late 17th century the mill had been extended to include corn milling with 4 pairs of stones, two for flour and two for animal feed. The whole assembly was driven by three external water wheels. The construction of the Wey Navigation was a boon for the mill, enabling grain to be delivered to the mill by barge and the resulting sacks of flour to be taken, again by barge, to London. By 1768 the buildings had become rather dilapidated and the eastern range was demolished and replaced by a three-storey red brick edifice with dentil moulding under the eaves of a tiled roof. The western range was simply repaired and continued in use. This section was known as the Hogsmeat Mill. At the same time the old undershot wheels were replaced with more efficient breast shot wheels. In 1852 the western section was replaced with an identical brick building styled to match the 1768 building. In 1827 it was reported that an extension to the Hogsmeat Mill was attached to the Guildford foundry, on the site now occupied by the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, but this building was demolished by 1852. From 1770, an additional water wheel was being used to pump water to the town reservoir on Pewsey Down. This was replaced by two water turbines in 1896, then a single turbine in 1930, in use until 1952 when it was itself replaced by electric pumps nearby. In 2003, Guildford Borough Council arranged for the refurbishment and installation of an identical turbine as an example of renewable energy. Rather than pumping water, this turbine drives a generator to supply up to 260,000 kWH of electricity into the National Grid, annually. The turbine came on-line in 2006. The 1930 turbine has since been preserved, and is on display at Dapdune Wharf. The Mill is now used by the adjacent Yvonne Arnaud Theatre as a scenery workshop and studio theatre. ==References== Category:Watermills in England Category:Watermills in Surrey Category:Historic sites in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Surrey Category:Flour mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grinding mills in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Surrey Category:Buildings and structures in Guildford Category:Renewable energy ","title":"Town Mill, Guildford"},{"id":"56900159","text":"Ballynahinch Castle is a former Irish country house and estate, built on the site of a former castle, which is now a luxury hotel set in a private estate in the Connemara region of County Galway, Ireland. The castle lies on the edge of Ballynahinch Lake and Ballynahinch River, and is directly overlooked by Benlettery , one of the Twelve Bens mountain range. This detached three-storey country house was built 1754 and while the structure has been modified throughout its life, the castle still retains its architectural integrity. One of the former residents of Ballynahinch Castle was Richard Martin (Humanity Dick, 1754–1834), founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Member of Parliament for County Galway. Another owner was the Maharaja Jam Sahib of Nawanager ('Ranji'). Ranji decided to purchase the house, estate and its salmon and sea-trout fisheries from the Berridge Family in 1924. ==Description== Ballynahinch Castle is located in the Connemara Region of County Galway, Ireland, It lies close to the N59 road between Galway and Clifden, and on the southern shore of Lake Ballynahinch. set in an area of ancient woodland surrounded by mountains, lakes and bogland. The castle sits at the foot of the Twelve Bens mountain range. The current building dates to 1754 and has been altered several times since then. It is a three-storey country house, set in a former demesne estate featuring a river, small lakes, and woodland. The castle currently operates as a luxury hotel with a focus on outdoor activities such as guided walks, shooting and fishing. ==History== The land on which the castle is situated was owned as early as the 14th century by the Ó Flaithbheartaigh (O'Flaherty) family, who controlled a large tract of land known as Lar Connaught which stretched across much of the County Galway and into County Mayo. The first known castle on the site was a small structure next to the lake, built by Dónal Ó Flaithbheartaigh in around 1546, one of several he built around Connemara. This was around the time of his marriage to Grace O'Malley, which united the O'Flahertys with O'Malley's powerful family and extended his land-holdings. O'Malley became the de facto head of the family at that time, as Dónal was not an effective ruler. In the mid 17th century, the castle was acquired by the Martins, an Anglo-Norman family and one of the fourteen tribes of Galway. The Martin family commissioned the building of the present castle building in 1756, originally for use as an inn. Richard Martin, known as \\"Humanity Dick\\" because of his commitment to animal welfare, converted the house to a private residence at some point, and lived for a considerable part of his life at the castle. Irish political leader Daniel O'Connell stayed at the castle as a guest of the Martin family in 1843, while he was attending a meeting nearby. The castle was bought in 1872 by Richard Berridge, a brewer from London. Berridge owned large tracts of land across western Ireland as well as in the English counties of Middlesex and Kent. Berridge used the land in Ireland for leisure, and built several fishing lodges. In 1924 the castle was sold again, this time to Ranjitsinhji, the ruler of the Indian princely state of Nawanagar. Ranjitsinhji was also a talented cricketer who played Test matches for the England national team. Initially he rented the castle, tempted by the fishing opportunities there, and he reportedly fell in love with it. Ranjitsinhji provided considerable support to the Connemara region, investing in cottage industry and helping local business as well as employing more than fifty people on projects to improve the castle and estate. Ranjitsinhji continued to reside in India but spent time in the castle every year until his death in 1933. After Ranjitsinhji's death, his nephew sold the castle to the Dublin-based McCormack family, and in 1946 it passed into the control of the Irish Tourist Board who converted it into a hotel, which it has remained until the present day. It was sold back into private ownership in 1952, and has been owned by three different families since then. == Awards == 2020: * Voted as one of the \\"Top 10 Resort Hotels in the U.K. and Ireland\\" by Travel + Leisure. 2019: * Voted one of the \\"Top Hotels in Ireland: Readers' Choice Awards 2019\\" by Condé Nast Traveler * In the \\"Top 10 Resort Hotels in the U.K. and Ireland\\" by Travel + Leisure. * Best Destination Hotel 2019 Hospitality Ireland Awards 2018: * In the \\"Top 10 Resort Hotels in the U.K. and Ireland\\" by Travel + Leisure. * Best Destination Hotel 2019 Hospitality Ireland Awards ==See also== * Twelve Bens, neighbouring mountain range * Benlettery, neighbouring mountain * List of historic houses in the Republic of Ireland == References == Category:Hotels in County Galway ","title":"Ballynahinch Castle"},{"id":"56900171","text":"Aleksandr Kogan (born 1985/86), who has also briefly used the name Dr Spectre, is a Moldovan-born American data scientist, who is known for having developed the app that allowed Cambridge Analytica to collect personal details of 80 million Facebook users.

The location was along the Manatee River in Bradenton, Florida, near Manatee Mineral Springs Park. The exact location is expansive, ranging from where the Braden River meets the Manatee River down to Sarasota Bay; archaeological research focuses on the Manatee Mineral Spring—a source of fresh water and later the location of the Village of Manatee two decades after the destruction of the maroon community. Archaeological evidence has been found and the archaeology report by Uzi Baram is on file with the Florida Division of Historical Resources of the Florida Department of State. ==Background== Spanish Florida was a haven for escaped slaves and for Native Americans deprived of their traditional lands during colonial times and in the first decades of U.S. independence. The underground railroad ran south during this period. Escaped slaves were welcomed into Florida by Spain, who granted freedom to slaves that converted to Catholicism. Under heavy U.S. pressure, Spain rescinded this welcome, but the change had little practical effect. Occupied with the Napoleonic War and with many colonies in revolt or close to revolt, Spain had neither the resources nor the inclination to capture and return escaped slaves. At one point, Spain invited the slaveowners to recapture them themselves. Three autonomous black communities developed in Spanish Florida, though not simultaneously. Fort Mose was the first and smallest autonomous black community but it was abandoned in 1763 after the Spanish cessation of Florida in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War. Fort Mose was heavily influenced by neighboring St. Augustine. The second community was at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River, but it was destroyed by forces under the command of General Andrew Jackson in 1816. Angola, farthest from the border of Georgia, was the last of the black settlements to survive. According to historian Canter Brown, Jr., \\"Most maroon settlements were tiny because people needed to escape detection. Angola's 600 to 750 people was an incredible size back then, and shows that these were capable people.\\" He described it as \\"one of the most significant historical sites in Florida and perhaps the U.S.\\" None of these were settled as a group, as white colonies were; refugees gradually accumulated over many years until a community of several hundred existed. Some refugees from the Negro Fort calamity came to Angola, as did refugees from Lake Miccosukee Village and the Battle of Suwanee. ==Destruction== When Andrew Jackson became Florida's de facto territorial governor in 1821, he \\"saw Angola's destruction as a first step in plans to rid the peninsula of runaways. Denied official authority, he apparently dispatched Indian allies to do the work for him.\\" \\"Acting in direct defiance of Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, Jackson's first order of business was to send his Creek allies on a search and destroy mission against Angola\\", which was \\"burned to the ground\\". The result of the raid was \\"terror\\" all over Florida and all the blacks who could left for the Bahamas. A small number joined Red Stick Indians and formed a community called Minatti at the headwaters of the Peace River. ==Commemoration== In July 2018 the first Back to Angola Festival was held at the Manatee Mineral Springs Park. Descendants of those who had escaped to the Bahamas attended. ==See also== * Black Seminoles * Fort Mose Historic State Park * Negro Fort * Prospect Bluff Historic Sites * Seminole Wars ==References * Tragedy and Survival: Virtual Landscapes of 19th Century Maroon Landscapes Category:Pre- statehood history of Florida Category:African-American history of Florida Category:Angolan-American history Category:Manatee County, Florida Category:Bradenton, Florida Category:Black Seminoles Category:Spanish Florida Category:Seminole Wars Category:Populated places on the Underground Railroad Category:Populated places disestablished in 1821 Category:Maroons (people) Category:Muscogee Category:Ghost towns in Florida Category:Seminole tribe Category:African-American historic places Category:1821 disestablishments in Florida Territory Category:Populated places established in 1812 Category:Negro Fort Category:Fugitive American slaves Category:Andrew Jackson Category:History of racism in Florida ","title":"Angola, Florida"},{"id":"56900221","text":"Gwangju No clan () was one of the Korean clans.

A spokesperson for the Afghan Ministry of the Interior stated that the attacker approached the shrine on foot who was then prevented from getting closer to the shrine due to police checkpoints and when he was identified by the police, he detonated the explosives he was carrying among a group of passersby. At least 33 people were killed in the bombing, while injuring more than 65, according to a statement from a spokesperson for the Ministry for Public Health. ===Perpetrators=== The Amaq News Agency, the unofficial mouthpiece of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the group, saying that the attacks specifically targeted Shiites celebrating Nowruz.

At the time of Khamfan's birth, the Lanna Kingdom was under Burma's control. Khamfan fought in battles along with his brothers to restore peace in Lanna. Khamfan was the most affluent of his brothers due to his marriage to Netnarivai, an heiress to a wealthy man in Mae Hong Son. He renovated the abandoned city of Hariphunchai (present-day Lamphun) and was promoted to first governor of Lumphun (in Thai: เจ้านครลำพูนองค์ที่ 1). When his older brother, Kawila, died, Khamphan received the title \\"Regent of Chiang Mai\\" (in Thai: เจ้าอุปราชเมืองนครเชียงใหม่) and later became \\"The Governor of Chiang Mai\\" (in Thai: เจ้านครเชียงใหม่). He ruled Chiang Mai for three years and received the title \\"Governor of two Cities\\". He was married to 16 wives and had 44 children, 20 of them were male, 24 of them were female. Khamfan died on 13 February 1825, aged 69. ==Early life== Khamfan was born in 1796 to Prince Keaw and Princess Chantadevi in the city of Lampang. At that time Lanna Kingdom was under Burmese's control. Poemayugyuan was Burmese authority who was appointed to control Chiang mai. When he was 15 years old, his older brothers, Kawila and Thammalungka began to support Siam and joined troop with Taksin's army. He helped in the army of his older brothers to fight in several battles against Burmese. ==Career== When Rama I has crowned himself, he appointed Kawila and his brothers the titles to rule Lanna kingdom. That was the time that Khamfan, 26 years old, began his career. Captured the fake prince at Saton Burmese appointed a Chinese man to be a prince that rule Saton city and ruled over 57 cities which were overlapped with cities in Lanna. In order to end this confusion, the army from Lampang and Chiang Mai led by Kawila, Duangthip, and Khamfan attacked Saton, captured the fake prince and his people, assets, and livestock from several cities and sent to Rama I. Battle with Chiang saen and Mong Yawng Township In the next two years, troops from Chiangmai (under Kawila), Lampang (under Duangthip and Khamfan), and Nan moved toward north, attacked Chiang Saen and Mong Yawng in order to expand territory. They brought several craftmen, weapons, and gold to Chiangmai, Lampang, and Nan. In addition, Nan got Chiangkhong as the colony. After the battle ended, they sent notice to Rama I. War with Burma, Lao, Lu In 1806, Khamfan and Moola from Lampang attacked Chiang rung (Jinghong). They fought strongly with Burma, Lao, and Lu in several battles until Chiang rung surrendered. Ruler of Lamphun Rama II ordered Kawila (ruler of Chiangmai), Khamfan, and Boonma to restore the ancient city of Haripunchai which became wilderness and renamed that city as Lamphun. Khamfan was promoted to be the first ruler of new city Lamphun with Boonma as a regent. Kawila has helped to migrate 1000 citizens from Chiangmai and 500 citizens from Lampang to add more population to the new city. Khamfan restored several temples and built more facilities for people. It took approximately 14 years to completely renovate Lamphun. In 1815, Kawila died. Thammalungka got a white elephant and brought to Rama II in Bangkok. Rama II promoted Thammalungka to be a ruler of Chiangmai, Khamfan to be a regent of Chiangmai, Boonma to be a ruler of Lamphun. Ruler of Chiangmai In 1822, Thammalungka died after 7 years as a ruler of Chiangmai. Khamfan became a ruler of Chiangmai in place of his brother with Phutthawong, his cousin, as a regent. Khamfan ruled Chiangmai for 3 years and died during Rama III, 1825.

Its unique qualities is the reason it is called “Mother of Iranian Caravansarais”. It is located in the Central District of Qom County, 80 kilometers north-east of Qom (60 kilometers into Garmsar Freeway) and 35 kilometers south-west of Varamin. This monument was registered in Iran's National Heritage List on September 23, 2003. The structure of this caravanserai belongs to Sasanian era, and restorations took place in Seljuk, Safavid and Qajar eras. Its current form belongs to Safavid era. This caravanserai is situated on the ancient rout from Ray to Isfahan. The structure of this caravansarai is in Seljuki four-iwan form and is 12000 square meters wide. The interior spaces of the caravansarai include human, livestock, service and convenience, and security spaces. There are four circular towers at the corners and two half-oval towers at both sides of the main gate which is situated in the middle of the southern wall. Also, there are 44 rooms or chambers, 4 big halls (stables), mosque, private shabestan, fodder barn, gristmill, bathroom and toilet. The materials used in Deir-e Gachin are brick, lime, adobe and plaster. The mosque of the caravanserai was probably built in the place of the Sasanian fire temple and there are no decorations in it. There are a number of structures around the caravanserai as a collection including two Ab anbars behind the western side and close to the bathroom, a brick furnace, a dam, and a graveyard in the south-western side in which the graves are covered with bricks and that goes back to the Islamic era. There is a brick-clay-made structure in the form of a fort 500 meters east of the caravanserai which has only one entrance gate and its structure goes back to the Qajar era. == Etymology and History == The gate The word ‘deir’ in Middle Persian (Pahlavi) language, as Shams Gheis-e Razi puts it in Shams Gheis Dictionary, means a in Persian (dome in English) which is built for the purpose of prayer, and this structure was called Deir-e Gachin because it had a that was made of plaster (gach). Today, however, there is no such in the structure. The construction of the structure is attributed to Ardashir-e Bābakān (Ardashir I) and so it has also been called Kardashir (done by Ardashir). Ya'qubi attributes it to Anushiruwān (Khosrow I). In History of Qom by Hasan ibn Mohammad Qomi, it is attributed to Anushiruwān but it can be implied by the text that he did not build the initial structure, and probably the structure was built in the beginning of Sasanian era (Ardashir I) and it was rebuilt in the Anushiruwān era. As Qomi mentions, the king of Rûm sent a group of Amalek, which were the survivors of the ʿĀd tribe and had enormous bodies, to Anushiruwān to serve him and he appointed them to construct this structure. == Location and Importance == The interior Deir-e Gachin Caravansarai, one of the biggest caravansarais of Iran, is located in the center of Kavir National Park. Its unique qualities is the reason it is called “Mother of Iranian Caravansarais”. From long ago, the location of Deir-e Gachin on the ancient rout from Ray to Isfahan has been the gathering point of the connecting routes between east and west, and the northern, western, southern and eastern routes to Rey traversed in this spot. In the Medes and Achaemenid eras, this place connected the eastern, northern, southern and western states, and it had a defensive importance. In addition, in the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras, the commercial importance of this place increased. It has counted as a part of the Silk Road which extended from Ctesiphon to Balkh, Samarkand, and Bukhara. This route started from the capital of China (Xi'an) and continued to Hotan and Kashgar, and then arrived at Rey and Deir-e Gachin, and from there it went through Saveh or Qazvin to Kermanshah and Hamadan and then to Ctesiphon and Babylon, and continued from there to Antakya in the shores of Mediterranean Sea. == Structure == The structure plan Interior view of the southern and western side of the yard of Deir-e Gachin Caravansarai View from rooftop at night The structure of the caravanserai is a 109 in 108 meter square (approximately 12000 square meters) with four circular towers at the corners and two towers in the form of half- oval at both sides of the main entrance which is in the middle of the southern wall. The architecture of this structure is in four-iwan form which includes 44 rooms or chambers, 4 big halls (stables), mosque, private shabestan, fodder barn, gristmill, bathroom and toilet. The materials used in Deir-e Gachin are brick, lime, adobe and plaster. Rock is used only in gristmill, mihrab of the mosque and the upper part of the gate which do not exist now. Wood is not used in this structure and the chambers do not have doors and windows but, presumably, the gate, which there is no sign of it now, had been made of wood. The exterior walls are more than three meters thick and resistant against natural dangers and disasters. The interior courtyard is a 69 meter square and in each side of it there is an iwan and 10 chambers (rooms), and each chamber has a small iwan with the approximate height of 1 to 1.5 meters devised for the convenience in loading and unloading of the passengers’ luggage as well as articulating the interior view of the structure. In the square form of this caravanserai, the fixed elements, i.e. the chambers and the main iwans, are situated across the sides next to each other and the unstable elements in the four corners of the square and in the middle of the sides; so, the main gate is in the middle of the southern side and iwans or shahneshins in the middle of the rest of the sides. In the four corners of the structure, the service spaces are situated; the mosque in the right corner of the southern side, the private shabestan in the right corner of the northern side, the bathroom in the left corner of the southern side, and the barn and gristmill in the left corner of the northern side. The northern iwan or shahneshin of the structure is more spacious than the other iwans and there is a lobby with three chambers in the back of it. Behind the chambers of each side, the stables are situated which are built in the form of a long corridor with arched vaults that connects to the courtyard through two exits. === Interior Spaces ===  Human Spaces  one of the small protected spaces There are 44 chambers and residential rooms in the caravanserai. The rooms are almost uniform. In each room, there are 9 niches at the height of one meter from the floor, and there is a fireplace inside the wall across from the entrance. The entrances of the rooms are small and arched in the tops which is suitable for heat preservation. The rooms do not have windows to the stables. Each room has a small iwan (porch). There are holes inside the walls between the iwans as drawbars and the travelers could treat the animals in front of the room before taking them to the stable. The iwan walls, like the rooms, have niches. Also, there are 66 iwans or small platforms inside the stables which were for the lodging of the caravan crew. The size of these platforms are not the same and is different depending on the lodging of one person or a group. As in the rooms, there is a fireplace in all the platforms which are at a convenient height from the floor of the stable.  Livestock Spaces  The ruined sections The livestock spaces and stables are situated behind the rooms and their entrances are L-shaped so that in case an animal runs off they cannot exit easily. The stables are roofed and the light needed is provided through skylights in the sealing, and the width of the stables are enough for two camels with luggage to pass by one another. In this caravanserai, all the animals were together and there were no exclusive places for different kinds of animals.  Service and Convenience Spaces  One of the walls The mosque is located in the far right of the southern side and it has four columns 1.5 meters high and, as mentioned by Iranica, it probably was built in the place of the Sasanian fire temple. There are no decorations in the mosque. In the middle of the southern side which is directed to the Qibla, there is a place for a mihrab. The bathroom is located in the left corner of the southern side and is as wide as the mosque. The erosion of this part of the structure has been more compared to the whole structure; the sealing is ruined and some of the walls are collapsed. In the north-eastern corner of the structure there is a separate shabestan with an octagonal courtyard. This part with a special design and full equipment is the most aristocratic part of the caravanserai and had been the place for high-ranking people.  Security Spaces  The towers There are four big towers at the four corners and two half-tower at both sides of the main gate. These towers were used for guarding as well as for lighting torches in order to find the location of the caravanserai at night. As mentioned by the Encyclopedia of Islamic History, it can be imagined that in the Sasanian era, there were on top of these four great towers. === Exterior Structures === There are a number of structures around the caravanserai as a collection. They include two Ab anbars behind the western side and close to the bathroom, a brick furnace, a dam, and a graveyard in the south-western side in which the graves are covered with bricks and that goes back to the Islamic era. There is a brick-clay-made structure in the form of a fort 500 meters east of the caravanserai which has only one entrance gate and its structure goes back to the Qajar era. Most of the structure is now ruined. ==References== Category:Caravanserais in Iran Category:Sasanian architecture Category:Safavid architecture Category:National Works of Iran ","title":"Dayr-e Gachin"},{"id":"56900595","text":"Pungcheon No clan () was one of the Korean clans.

He was inspired by games like Myst, in the sense of a being a character dropped into a strange world, not knowing why they were there or what was going on, and to start exploring and discovering; in addition he enjoyed how the game had no jumping or running or action. === Design === Droste wanted to make a game in which the environment was the central character, through a narrative technique known as environmental storytelling. The game was built using the Unity3D game engine. In escape the room types of games, players are either: physically confined (due to doors being locked) or alternatively confined (because there is nothing else to do in the chapter). In contrast, Droste's design is more open ended and non-linear. There is much interactively with the game world beyond items required to progress in the story; clicking on items like walls and chairs reveal sound effects like taps and knocks, accompanied by a visual spurt of dust, thereby adding life and age to the space. In addition, players have to realistically interact with tools in order to use them; e.g. turning a wheel or pulling a lever rather than clicking on it. Droste begins designing a level with pen and paper, marking out all the puzzles, secrets, and a proposed progression through the room; he may also look out for a physical feature that may make the room fit a puzzle he has previously designed. He later maps the puzzle out in a 3D space. The complexity and ambiguity picked up by IGN was addressed by Droste in an interview: \\"[It] is the untrustworthiness of incomplete information and the importance of seeking out the truth. So all of the little bits of lore scattered around are designed to add to the overall story and history, but also give varying accounts of it. It’s almost all incomplete information and sometimes even contradictory.” === Release === The game took three years to complete. It was released in mid-2016. == Gameplay and plot == The player stumbles upon a medieval style castle, and begins to explore the rooms to uncover its secrets. == Critical reception == Adventure Gamers praised the game for achieving an \\"extreme sense of pervasive isolation\\". which added to its timelessness. PC Gamer's Joe Donnelly noted that after the opening few screens, the puzzle become extremely difficult, but chose to persevere due to enjoying the game. Kotaku noted that it was essentially an \\"Aussie take on Myst\\". Just Adventure felt that despite the obscurity and difficulty of the puzzles and narrative, it was well-made and of a professional quality. PC Powerplay reviewer Meghann O'Neil noted that if it weren't part of her job, she wouldn't have had the time to sit down quietly and just listen, touch, read and explore, and she was grateful for the experience. == References  External links == * Official website Category:2016 video games Category:Adventure games Category:MacOS games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Windows games ","title":"The Eyes of Ara"},{"id":"56900689","text":"JMI-Edison is a Guam company that began in 1978.

(1868). His mother Margaret died shortly after giving birth to her last child. Joseph Bell, initially, attended as a child a private elementary school in the village of Farlam and, after the death of his mother, he moved with his father and his brothers to Carlisle, between the districts of Edentown and Stanwix; Joseph and the brothers attended Carlisle's Academy William Harrison. In time, the younger brother John decided to migrate to Australia, embarking on the transatlantic SS Great Britain, while the rest of the family remained in Carlisle. After leaving Carlisle, Joseph Bell moved to Newcastle, doing apprenticeship as an engine editor at Robert Stephenson and Company. In 1885, Bell was hired by the White Star Line and worked on many ships that traded with New Zealand and the United States. In 1891 he was promoted to chief mechanical engineer. Sister Jane married William Hugh Lowthian in 1886 and spent many years living in Ripley, Derbyshire, where he was a bank manager. It was probably at this time that Joseph met Maud Bates, whom he married in 1893; the couple had 4 children: Frances John, called Frank (1896), Marjorie Clare (1899), Eileen Maud (1901), and Ralph Douglas (1908). In 1911, Joseph found lodging in Belfast, along with his wife and younger son. The two daughters remained at Ripley, cared for by both a housekeeper and her uncles (Bell's sister and brother-in-law), while the then fifteen-year-old Frank was studying at the Grosvenor College in Carlisle and later an apprenticeship at the Harland and Wolff shipyards. ==On the Titanic== After serving on the Olympic, he transferred to the Titanic, where he was given the post of chief engineer. On the night of April 14, shortly before the Titanic hit an iceberg, Bell received an order from the bridge to either stop or reverse the engines (accounts vary), in an attempt to slow the ship. Despite the crew's best efforts, the Titanic could not avoid the immense block of ice. As the ship began to sink, Bell and the engineers remained in the engine room, urging the stokers and firemen to keep the boilers active, allowing the pumps to continue their work and ensuring the electricity remained on as long as possible. According to legend, Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the Titanic most likely in the Electric Engine Room and the Switchboard Platform in the Turbine Engine Room. According to the historical record, when it became obvious that nothing more could be done, and the flooding was too severe for the pumps to cope, they all came up onto Titanic open well deck, but by this time all the lifeboats had already left. Greaser Frederick Scott testified to seeing all the engineers gathered at the aft end of the starboard Boat Deck at the end.101 Things You Thought You Knew about the Titanic - But Didn't! at Google Books.co.uk Bell's body was never recovered. After Bell's death, the wife and the brother-in-law, William Ralph, inherited the farm of Farlam, of which Joseph had become its full owner since 1904, after his father's death; the farm was immediately sold because both Bell's wife and children never went to Farlam. At the Church of the Holy Faith in Waterloo, near Liverpool, a plate has been affixed to commemorate Bell; an epitaph was also erected in his memory in the small cemetery of Farlam. ==Portrayals== *Emerton Court (1958; A Night to Remember) *Terry Forrestal (1997; Titanic) *David Wilmot (2012; Saving The Titanic; PBS TV Movie) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Joseph Bell, Chief Engineer on the R.M.S.

IEEE 1914.1 standardizes architecture and requirements for mobile fronthaul network – spanning between cell sites and centralized baseband locations in Centralized, Collaborative, Cloud and Clean Radio Access Network C-RAN. == Founding members == The IEEE 1914.1 project was co-founded by AT&T;, China Mobile, SK Telecom, Telecom Italia, Alcatel-Lucent, Broadcom and Intel. == Introduction == Base station architecture evolved from all-in-one base stations, through Base-Band Units (BBUs) and Remote Radio Heads (RRH), to C-RAN architectures where equipment located at the cell sites Remote Unit (RU) or RU + Distributed Unit (DU) connects via fronthaul network to centralized baseband locations – Central Unit (CU). On the road towards future 5G networks, it is clear that an efficient transport network is necessary and traditional fronthaul solutions are not suitable for 5G evolution. The current mobile networks comprise multiple separate network domains. This creates serious challenges for network operators, such as low scalability, inflexible management and control solutions, slow and difficult upgrades, poor resource utilization, and high cost. IEEE 1914.1 project was established to facilitate the implementation of key 5G technologies especially Cloud-RAN and Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) from fronthaul networking perspective, and describe the required networking architecture to enable migration to 5G and C-RAN solutions. == Goals == The Fronthaul Packet Transport standard enables the implementation of critical 5G technologies, such as massive MIMO, Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception, and scalable Centralized/Virtual Radio Access Network (C-RAN) functions. This standard simplifies network design and operation, increases network flexibility and resource utilization, and lowers cost by leveraging existing, mature Ethernet-based solutions for vital functions, such as quality of service, synchronization, and data security. The fronthaul architecture provides unified management and control solution, common networking protocols, and universal network elements, thus facilitating migration to future C-RAN/V-RAN mobile networks. == Scope == This standard specifies: # Architecture for the transport of mobile fronthaul traffic (e.g., Ethernet- based), including deployment scenarios, user data traffic, and management and control plane traffic. # Requirements and definitions for the fronthaul networks, including data rates, timing and synchronization, network slicing, and quality of service. The standard also analyzes functional partitioning schemes between RRUs and BBUs that improve fronthaul link efficiency and interoperability on the transport level, and that facilitate the realization of cooperative radio functions, such as massive MIMO operational modes, CoMP transmission and reception. == Members == The working group consists of major mobile network operators like AT&T;, China Mobile and Verizon, and telecom vendors like Anritsu, Broadcom,Comcores, CommScope, Fiberhome, Fujitsu, Intel, IP light, Microsemi, MTI, NEC, Oticon, SM Optics, and Xilinx, as well as academia.

His mother was born Gilberte Tordjman and his father, Edmond Enthoven, was a businessman who made his fortune in real estate and cinema management. In this completely agnostic Jewish family environment, his political socialization took place in a very republican atmosphere, attached to moral considerations such as the defense of human rights and found himself in the political figure of a Clemenceau. His family was linked to the Oranese intellectual elite, notably with philosopher André Bénichou, director of the Descartes course which many French academics attended during the Algerian War. Thus his parents became close to Pierre Nora and the latter helped their son when he became a boarder at Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux. Jean- Paul Enthoven was then very close to the \\"Nora family\\", Pierre Nora being its \\"Cicerone\\".According to the Jean-Paul Enthoven's expression in his interview with François Kraus on 2 September 2004. After attending the lycée Buffon, he entered the lycée Janson-de-Sailly where he took philosophy classes from Maurice Clavel. The latter noticed him among the heads of the class and made him meet Gabriel Marcel but especially Pierre Boutang whose influence plunged him for a time into \\"self-hatred\\". He was then a student at the Faculty of Letters at Paris-Sorbonne and at the Faculté de droit de Paris. He obtained a degree in history, a diploma from the Institute of Political Studies, a DES in public law and political science. === Career === Although anchored on the left, he missed May 68 by preferring literature to ideological debates. The readings he made at Éditions Gallimard around 1971/1972 gave him the opportunity to meet Raymond Aron. If he did not become a disciple, the latter led him to detach himself very quickly from a Marxism to which readings had led him to adhere. And he defined himself as Spinozo-nietzschean when, in 1973, he became assistant to Maurice Duverger at the Sorbonne. An assistant at the university Paris I - Panthéon Sorbonne from 1973 to 1975, he meets a young philosopher who has just returned from Bangladesh, Bernard-Henri Lévy. Falling under the spell of the normalien, he presented him in the autumn of 1974 to his friend Gilles Hertzog,Gilles Hertzog on data.bnf.fr who thus participated in the life of the ephemeral daily L'Imprévu (January–February 1975). Despite the failure of Bernard-Henri Lévy's daily, the trio's friendship grew stronger around him to the point of appearing to be a true \\"sibling\\"Expression of Olivier Orban quoted by Daniel Garcia in Un homme de l'ombre, Lire, May 2004 where Jean-Paul Enthoven would, in his own words, be \\"Bernard's Minister of the Interior, and Gilles, his State Secretary for Foreign Affairs\\".According to Jean-Paul Enthoven, quoted by Daniel Garcia in Un homme de l'ombre, Lire, May 2004 At the same time, his ties with Pierre Nora According to , interview with François Kraus on 8 April 2004. brought him into contact with Jean Daniel and the staff of Le Nouvel Observateur. From December 1973 onwards, he published reviews of essays in philosophy and human sciences. It was then that in 1975, he did not appreciate being solicited by Maurice Duverger as a character witness in a trial about his Vichyst past. He thus resigned from teaching and turned to journalism. He was a journalist and then assistant to the chief editor of Le Nouvel Observateur until 1984. He was responsible for covering intellectual debates, interviews with leading intellectual figures, reviews of political and philosophical essays, and all current events affecting the intellectual world. Close to Maurice Clavel - whom he occasionally replaces for his television column - he is nonetheless much appreciated by the editor of the newspaper who consults him for the choice of a word in his editorialCollectif, Pour Jean Daniel, Dreux, 1990, (). or the ongoing debates in the Parisian microcosm. With the latter two, he actively supports the media blossoming of the \\"Nouveaux Philosophes\\" and their leader, his friend Bernard-Henri Lévy. He admired the latter immensely and had such strong ties with him that all they lacked was \\"to be homosexual in order to mix and mingle\\",Jean Daniel, Avec le temps (1998) in Œuvres Autobiographiques, Paris, Grasset et Fasquelle, 2003, (). even more than they are. Witness at his wedding (like Gilles Hertzog), having breakfast every Saturday morning with him, he shares his passions as his concern for aesthetic appearance. From the early 1980s, he took on more and more editorial responsibilities. Thus, in 1983, he took over the direction of the \\"Biblio-Essais\\" series founded by Bernard-Henri Lévy at Grasset. In 1984, he left his position as Assistant Editor-in-Chief of the Nouvel Observateur to head the Hachette-Littérature publishing house. In 1986, he returned to the publishing house Grasset & Fasquelle as editorial director. Since 1993, he has been editorial advisor to the editorial board of the weekly magazine Le Point where he publishes literary reviews. In 1997, he co-wrote the film Day and Night with Bernard- Henri Lévy. Since 2011, he has been a member of the jury of the .Le prix Saint-Germain : rendez-vous le 17 janvier 2012, bernard-henri-levy.com, accessdate=23 March 2018. == Private life == Enthoven is the father of three children with Catherine David: *Raphaël, agrégé in philosophy who married Justine Lévy, the daughter of the family's great friend Bernard-Henri Lévy, before leaving her for Carla Bruni. * Julien, second role actor seen in particular in 2009 in ' by Yann Moix with Franck Dubosc as well as in the new version of The Accursed Kings in 2005. * and Mathilde, a journalist. On 4 December 1981, Jean-Paul Enthoven married Corinne Pécas, daughter of Max Pécas, director and producer of erotic films. In 2000, he was Carla Bruni's companion, before she left him for his own son Raphaël, who was the subject of her song \\"Raphaël\\", and with whom she has a son, Aurélien, born in 2001. Jean- Paul Enthoven, divorced from Corinne Pécas, is today the husband of the Italian-Argentine journalist Patricia Della Giovampaola,Jean-Paul Enthoven et sa femme on PurePeople widow of Rodolphe de Belzunce d'Arenberg.

She described her lifestyle changes after her father became Trump's running mate in July, writing, \\"I went from taking public transit in Chicago to riding in a presidential motorcade in the span of just a few months.\\" Early August 2016, Pence started travelling around the U.S. with her father on his campaign trail, which included the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Pence's recent graduation gave her time to travel the country and she joked that her role on the campaign trail was to \\"babysit her parents\\". Charlotte said that she was the only one of her siblings to be home at the time of the nomination.:1 Pence described herself politically as \\"more of a moderate or independent\\" and said that she does not always agree with the policies of her father and Trump, adding \\"I think I have views that go across the board\\", which she says has been encouraged by her parents. In 2018, Pence said that her father tells her, regarding the public criticism and protests against him, \\"That's what freedom looks like.\\":29 Since the inauguration, Pence helped provide a \\"support system for her parents\\", without taking official roles, while working full-time in Washington, D.C. at a film production company. In September 2017, Pence started an agent training program at the United Talent Agency. === Marlon Bundo === In 2013, Pence needed a rabbit for a short film project as a freshman at DePaul, and she bought a black and white rabbit from Craigslist. Pence named the rabbit 'Marlon Bundo' after Marlon Brando, as Pence's friend noticed the similarity between Brando's phrase \\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\\" from The Godfather and the rabbit's seller's response \\"Make me an offer\\" to a message about the price. Speaking to The Chicago Tribune she recalled: \\"We drove out to the suburbs, my friends and I, and we picked him up. I think he was like $20. He was in the short film, and I just kept him after that.\\" Bundo lived with Pence throughout college for four years, and continued to live with the Pences at Number One Observatory Circle afterwards.:2 Pence created an Instagram account for Bundo \\"right after [her] dad was inaugurated [Vice President]\\", \\"not knowing if anybody would follow it\\". Pence and her mother thought about creating a children's book, following Bundo's popularity on Instagram and because Karen is a watercolor painter. Pence told The Denver Post that she \\"really [likes] children's literature and middle-grade fiction\\" and had \\"always wanted to be a writer\\". Pence told Andrew Klavan in a 2018 interview that she could also write non-fiction and write for adults.:35 On March 19, 2018, the children's picture book Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President was released. It was written by Charlotte and illustrated by Karen. The picture book tells the story of Bundo observing the Vice President's daily activities. Pence said that they'd \\"love to do something for a sequel\\". Proceeds from the picture book go to benefit art therapy programs, and The A21 Campaign, which works to combat human trafficking; Charlotte Pence picked the latter charity because of her prior experience with the organization. As a \\"jab\\" at Mike Pence's opposition to LGBT rights in the United States, a parody of the picture book titled A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, authored by Last Week Tonight with John Oliver comedy writer Jill Twiss and illustrated by Gerald Kelley, was published by Chronicle Books a day before. In the parody book, Bundo falls in love with a rabbit named Wesley, but a cockroach resembling Mike Pence decrees that male rabbits cannot marry each other. Proceeds from the parody book go to benefit The Trevor Project, which runs a crisis hotline for members of the LGBTQ community, and AIDS United. The picture book and the parody book reached the fourth and the first spot, respectively, on Amazon's best-selling books list. As of late March 2018, Pence's book and Twiss's book sold approximately 100,000 and 400,000 copies, respectively, and were respectively No. 5 and No. 6 Children's Picture Books on The New York Times Best Seller list. Pence reacted positively to the parody book, saying: > I think imitation is the most sincere form of flattery in a way. But in all > seriousness, his book is contributing to charities that I think we can all > get behind. We have two books that are giving to charities that are both > about bunnies, so I'm all for it, really. ==Personal life== Pence became engaged to Navy lieutenant Henry Bond in July 2019, and married him in December of that year. == References  External links == * * * An American at Oxford.

Page 718 formerly Louisa Cathcart, was a Scottish noblewoman, who was married twice: first to David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield, and then to the Hon. Robert Fulke Greville. Louisa was the daughter of Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart, and his wife, the former Jane Hamilton. She was baptised on 1 July 1758 at Alloa.\\"Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XYKF-ZBS : 10 February 2018), Louisa Cathcart, 1 Jul 1758; citing ALLOA,CLACKMANNAN,SCOTLAND, reference , index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 1,040,206. On 5 May 1776, Louisa married the Scottish peer, the Viscount of Stormont.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage: founded on Wood's edition of Sir Robert Douglas's The Peerage of Scotland (Edinburgh, Scotland: David Douglas, 1904), volume VIII, page 209. Thus she was known as Viscountess of Stormont. It was the viscount's second marriage, and he was thirty years older than Louisa. Their five children were: *David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield (1777-1840) *Lt.-Gen. Hon. George Murray (1780-1848) *Major Hon. Charles Murray (1781-1859), who married Elizabeth Law and had children *General Hon. Sir Henry Murray (1784-1860), who married Emily, daughter of Gerard de Vismé, and had children. *Lady Caroline Murray (died 1867) The family seat was Scone Palace, but the viscount was the British ambassador in Paris, where Madame du Deffand commented that his new wife \\"is pretty, she holds herself badly, and has not a charming manner, but her expression is full of intelligence\\" Improvements to Scone Palace were worked on by George Paterson until, in 1783, the house was considered suitable as a regular residence. In 1776, Lord Stormont's uncle, William Murray, 1st Baron Mansfield was created Earl of Mansfield. He had no children of his own and so the title was created with a remainder to Louisa and her issue with Lord Stormont. The Complete Peerage notes: \\"The strange limitation of the Earldom in 1776 was doubtless owing to a notion then prevalent that no British peerage granted even in remainder to a Scottish peer would enable such peer to sit in Parliament. This was founded on the absurd resolution passed by the House of Lords in 1711 as to the like impotency of a British peerage granted to a peer of Scotland, which resolution was rescinded in 1782. Accordingly, in 1792, the limitation of the Earldom was made with a direct remainder to the grantee's nephew, though a peer of Scotland.\\" Thus when her husband died in 1796, their son inherited the second creation. Louisa outlived her son and on her own death in 1843, the first creation was inherited by her grandson, William, the 4th earl. On Lord Stormont's death, Louisa was still in her thirties and remarried her first cousin, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Fulke Greville (a younger son of Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick), on 19 October 1797 at St Marylebone Parish Church.\\"England Marriages, 1538–1973 ,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V52S-BBN : 10 February 2018), Robert Fulk Greville and Louisa Mansfield, 19 Oct 1797; citing Saint Mary-St Marylebone Road,St Marylebone,London,England, reference , index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 942 B4HA V. 51, 942 B4HA V. 52, 942 B4HA V. 54, 942 B4HA V. 55, 942 B4HA V. 56, 942 B4HA V. 57.

She was rated one of the best British two-year-old fillies of 1935 when she won twice from four starts. She won the 1000 Guineas on her debut as a three-year-old but finished unplaced in the Epsom Oaks and never ran again. As a broodmare she produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Gulf Stream. ==Background== Tide-way was a brown mare bred and owned by Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. During her racing career she was trained by Colledge Leader at Lord Derby's Stanley House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Physically, she was described as \\"a charming filly, perhaps a little light on the leg, but level of back and of great quality\\". Tide-way was sired by Fairway, an outstanding racehorse who won the St Leger, the Eclipse Stakes and two runnings of the Champion Stakes. At stud his other winners included Blue Peter, Watling Street, Garden Path, Pay Up and Fair Trial. Tide-way's dam Drift was a successful racehorse but an even better broodmare whose other foals included Sun Stream and Heliopolis. ==Racing career1935: two-year- old season=== At Royal Ascot in June Tide-way showed good early speed butfinished unplaced behind Fair Ranee in the Queen Mary Stakes. In the following month at Newmarket Racecourse the filly started favourite for the Fulbourne Stakes and won \\"fairly and squarely\\" from the colt Pay Up. She went on to win the Ham Produce Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and was unplaced on her only other start. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best juveniles, Tide-Way was rated the third best filly behind Sansonnet (National Stakes and Crosspatch (Molecomb Stakes). ===1936: three-year-old season=== In the 123rd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course on 1 May Tide-way was ridden by Dick Perryman and started at odds of 100/30 against 21 opponents. Racing down the centre of the wide track, Tide-way was in front soon after half-way, fought off a challenge from the favourite Ferrybridge and pulled clear in the final strides to record a \\"very popular victory\\". She won by one and a half lengths from her stablemate Feola, with Ferrybridge a neck away in third. Tide-way was aimed at the Epsom Oaks but was found to be \\"not herself\\" and was considered a doubtful runner in the week before the race. Leader also had problems training the filly owing to the exceptionally firm ground in the early summer of 1936. She nevertheless started favourite and appeared be going very well as the runners approached the straight but tired badly and finished eighth behind Lovely Rosa. Tide-way did not race again and was retired at the end of the season. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Tide-way a \\"poor\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. ==Breeding record== After her retirement from racing, Tide-way became a broodmare at Lord Derby's stud. She produced at least four foals between 1938 and 1943: *Estuary, a bay filly, foaled in 1938, sired by Orwell *Ebb and Flow, bay filly, 1940, by Solario *Forest Law, brown filly, 1942, by Bois Roussel *Gulf Stream, bay colt, 1943, by Hyperion.

She was self-trained and she is considered to be one of the first female engineers, with her concentration being on ship propulsion. == Early Life == Henrietta Vansittart, born Henrietta Lowe, was born in Ewell, Surrey in 1833. She was one of six children born to James and Marie Lowe, née Barnes. Her father James Lowe was a blacksmith-inventory working on ship propulsion and applying for related patents using his wife's money and connections. Vansittart's family lived in poor conditions with her father occupation being a machinist and smoke jack maker. On 23 March 1838, Vansittart's father James Lowe took out a patent for a new screw propeller but made no significant financial gain from his contributions due to competition in infringement battles. By the 1850, James Lowe nearly ran his family into bankruptcy, despite the adoption of his general scheme for submerged propellers. This led to Vansittart's marriage in 1855 to a Lieutenant named Frederick Vansittart (1827- 1902), a lieutenant in the 14th Dragoons (later the Hussars) who were just back from the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and they set up the marital home in Clarges Street, Mayfair. == Engineering work and career == There is no documentation on her education: Vansittart was proclaimed a self-trained engineer. As was common for many of the women in engineering in the 19th and early 20th century, Vansittart was introduced to engineering through a family connection, which in her case was her father, James Lowe. Article by Henrietta Vansittart, published in 1882 Shortly after her marriage, Vansittart began to study her father's work on ship propulsion. She had accompanied her father on HMS Bullfinch to test out a new version of his screw propeller, which began her interest, in 1857. The Lowe propeller had been fixed to many British warships by this time, but James Lowe never saw any financial reward due to infringement battles. When Vansittart's father died in 1866, after being run over by a carriage, she began working and experimenting in earnest, perhaps looking for the recognition her father never had in his lifetime. In 1868, Vansittart was awarded a patent (British Patent no 2877), for an improvement on her father's work - what she called the Lowe-Vansittart propeller. Her argument for the propeller was that it allowed ships to move faster and smoother, while using less fuel. Her work went on to be fitted on many ships, including HMS Druid, the Scandinavian, and the SS Lusitania. In addition, she also took out an American patent (US Patent 89712 granted in 1869), which was on the construction of screw propellers. The Lowe-Vansittart Propeller was awarded a first-class diploma at the International Exhibition in Kensington in 1871, a first class diploma and medal at the 1872 Dublin, 1875 Paris, 1876 Belgian, 1879 Sydney Exhibition, 1880 Melbourne and 1881 Adelaide Exhibitions, as well as other awards at the Royal Cornwall and Naples Maritime Exhibitions. For her work on ship propulsion, Vansittart won many awards, was mentioned by name in various newspapers, such as The Times and her invention took her to several exhibitions all over the world. In 1876, Vansittart was the first female to write, read, and illustrate her own diagrams and drawings for a scientific article presented at Association of Foreman Engineers and Draughtsmen. A pamphlet written by Vansittart, based on this paper, was published in 1882, entitled The History of the Lowe Vansittart Propeller and a short extract of the life of the late Mr James Lowe, the successful inventor of screw ships from their first introduction. This pamphlet indicates her dedication to the work and legacy of her father, as well as illustrating her technical knowledge of the Lowe Vansittart propeller. == Personal Life == In 1859, Vansittart began an affair with Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a well-known novelist and politician, which lasted for 12 years.The affair was known throughout both families, as well as the House of Commons, which Bulwer-Lytton was a part of. Bulwer-Lytton gave Vansittart financial assistance over the course of this period, and, though the affair ended in 1871, when he died in 1873, Bulwer-Lytton left £12,000 in his will for Vansittart and her husband, though her husband's sum was smaller. Letters from Vansittart to Bulwer-Lytton show that it was a tumultuous, passionate affair, which played an important role in Vansittart's life for many years. == Death and Legacy == In late 1882, Vansittart visited the Tynemouth Exhibition, and she was found wandering the streets by police, confused. She exhibited signs of mania and violent tendencies. She was ordered by magistrates to St Nicholas's Hospital, Gosforth, where she was admitted on the 19 September, 1882. After five months at the asylum, she died of acute mania and anthrax on 8 February 1883. In the obituary for Vansittart in the Journal of the London Association of Foreman Engineers and Draughtsmen it stated that 'she was a remarkable personage with a great knowledge of engineering matters and considerable versatility of talent', as well as 'how cheery and thoughtful for the happiness of others she was …' The obituary also claims that she was the first woman to write and read a scientific paper, illustrated with diagrams and drawings of her own, before a scientific institution. With the work that she accomplished, ships could now move faster and use less fuel, while being manoeuvred better in reverse. She did this at a time in history when there were no female engineers, with no formal scientific or engineering training.. Her work is considered by some to be \\"one of the most important nautical inventions of the 19th century.\\" However, she never paid the fee to renew the patent. She never had any children, and her husband died in 1902. == References == Category:1833 births Category:1883 deaths Category:British inventors Category:British women engineers ","title":"Henrietta Vansittart"},{"id":"56901168","text":"Portrait of Charles Goore, painted by Joseph Wright of Derby Charles Goore (11 December 1701 – 13 March 1783) was an English merchant and politician, who twice held the office of Lord Mayor of Liverpool. == Early life == Charles Goore was born on 11 December 1701, to Richard Goore of Goore House near Ormskirk, Lancashire.

She is a senior writer on the show and she portrays its \\"Janice from Accounting\\" character. She authored a children's book called A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo (Vice President Mike Pence's pet rabbit), as part of a Last Week Tonight sketch, which went on to be a best seller. == Early life == She was born in Redmond, Oregon and grew up in six different U.S. states due to her father's reassignments as part of the U.S. Forest Service. While Twiss was studying public policy and music in the College of William & Mary, her parents moved to Custer, South Dakota, and there she got interested in theater. After graduating in 1998, Twiss performed at the Black Hills Playhouse during the 1999 and 2000 seasons. After graduating, Twiss got accepted into a law school in New York City, but instead joined a touring children's theater troupe, and only moved to New York in 2001 with hopes of furthering her acting career. == Career == While doing acting and stand-up comedy gigs in New York, Twiss sought writing jobs. As she learned about HBO preparing Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and recruiting writers through blind auditions, Twiss sent them sample segments, which in turn led to a demand for a second batch, and after an interview with John Oliver himself she was hired. As a member of the writing staff for Last Week Tonight, Twiss has won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series multiple times. === A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo === In March 2018, as a writer on Last Week Tonight, Twiss authored a children's book called A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. The story details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It was written in response to Pence's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage and support of conversion therapy advocate James Dobson. Twiss conceptualized the book as a loose parody of Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President, written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence (Mike Pence's daughter and wife, respectively). Their book also tells about a fictionalized day of the Pence family's pet rabbit, but without the LGBT themes. Rather than a straight-up parody of the Pences' book, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is an actual children's story about marriage equality and democracy. It nevertheless contains some stabs at Mike Pence. On the day of release, John Oliver promoted the book on Last Week Tonight at the conclusion of an episode mainly dedicated to Pence and his positions on LGBT issues; it became a bestseller and the #1 book and e-book on Amazon the following day, receiving notable praise and selling much better than the crew of Last Week Tonight had expected. All profits from the book are being donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United. === The Someone New === Twiss authored The Someone New, which was subsequently published in June 2018. The story revolves around Jitterbug, a chipmunk fearful of change. When a snail named Pudding moves into the woods, Jitterbug learns to overcome her fear with the help of her animal-friends. As part of the books premise of practicing kindness for strangers, Twiss partnered with the charity KIND (Kids in Need of Defense) on her book, and both she and her publisher, HarperCollins made donations to the charity. Twiss and the book’s illustrator EG Keller have a forthcoming second book through the publisher HarperCollins called \\"Everyone Gets a Say.\\" It will be released in June 2020 and will be about voting. == Awards and nominations == {  - !

In the final episode of the anime, she sustained minor injuries and ended up in the hospital after hugging Satō as well as pushing them both off the roof of the apartment with Satō (who died from the fall). After Satō's death, Shio keeps Sato's wedding ring and her hair ribbon as a memento to remember her by, she also claims that she has been reborn as Satō, much to Asahi's horrific shock and believes that Satō will be reborn in the future. ; : :A boy who is searching for the whereabouts of Shio.

Despite her happy and cheery nature, she is actually mentally unstable as well as being deeply insane, and she accepts all forms of desires towards her with disturbing masochistic pleasure. Her deeply twisted views of love are held responsible for making Satō think in a similar way and making her into the deranged psychopath that she is today.

The company specializes in the design and manufacture of electric aircraft, including unmanned aircraft for geospatial role and light aircraft for the flight training role. The company was founded by George E. Bye, who remains the CEO. ==History== In July 2010, Bye Energy developed a proof-of- concept electrically powered Cessna 172 with support from Cessna Aircraft. Bye Energy changed its name to Beyond Aviation at the time that the prototype commenced taxi tests in July 2011. The aircraft first flew in 2012. The R&D; project was not pursued for production and the company is currently dormant. The company developed the Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer, a modified PC-Aero Elektra One, as a prototype electric aircraft in 2015. The development of the Sun Flyer 2 was originally carried out by a Bye Aerospace subsidiary, called the Aero Electric Aircraft Corporation. As of March 2018, it was being merged into the parent company. Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 2 prototype By July 2015, the company was developing the Sun Flyer 2, a two-seat electric-powered aircraft for the flight training role. By March 2016, Aero Electric Aircraft Corp. has delivered the prototype for final stages of development. It was rolled-out in May 2016. By July 2016, first flight was planned in the fall. By November 2016, ground and taxi tests had begun. It was first flown on 10 April 2018. The derivative Sun Flyer 4 is a four-seat design, yet to be completed. Both aircraft are low-wing designs, with bubble canopies, made from composite materials, predominately carbon fibre. Both are powered by lithium-ion batteries. The launch customer for both the Sun Flyer 2 and 4 is the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology which will employ both for flight training. By September 2018, the company had 130 deposits for the two-seat Sun Flyer 2 and 27 deposits for the larger, four-seat Sun Flyer 4. On July 31, 2018, Bye Aerospace flew a piloted prototype of its solar-powered unmanned StratoAirNet and manned Solesa from the Northern Colorado Regional Airport. Based on a carbon fiber composite competition sailplane, it has a wing span and thin-film photovoltaic cells from SolAero Technologies. The low-cost, long-endurance commercial and government surveillance aircraft could be used for patrol, mapping, precision agriculture or search-and-rescue and has low infrared and acoustic signatures. Also under development, in conjunction with the XTI Aircraft Company, is the TriFan 600, a hybrid-electric VTOL business aircraft. Previously, the company developed the Silent Falcon UAV for Silent Falcon UAS Technologies. In August 2019, the company announced that it was partnering with OXIS Energy to develop a Lithium–sulfur battery for use in the four-seat Sun Flyer 4. On August 21, 2019, Bye announced the sale of 26 aircraft to Los Angeles-based air taxi operator Quantum Air. Bye Aerospace plans a future all-electric six- to nine-seat aircraft, when battery technology improves enough to give range and performance to compete with traditional fossil-fuel powered executive aircraft. == Aircraft == Summary of aircraft built by Bye Aerospace: *Bye Aerospace StratoAirNet *Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 2 *Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 4 *Bye Aerospace TriFan 600 ==References * Category:Aircraft manufacturers of the United States Category:Electric aircraft Category:Companies based in Englewood, Colorado Category:Manufacturing companies based in Colorado Category:Privately held companies based in Colorado ","title":"Bye Aerospace"},{"id":"56901277","text":"John Larkin, Jr. John Larkin, Jr. gravesite in Chester Rural Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania Larkin Grammar School, Chester, Pennsylvania John Larkin, Jr. (October 3, 1804 - July 22, 1896) was an American businessman, banker and politician from Pennsylvania who served as the first mayor of Chester, Pennsylvania. ==Early life== Larkin was born in Concord Township to John and Martha Larkin.

Gian Maria Rastellini (20 January 1869 – 30 December 1927) was an Italian neo-impressionist painter. == Biography == Gian Maria Rastellini was born in Buttogno, a small village in the Valle Vigezzo, to a well-to-do family and was introduced to painting first by his paternal grandfather, Gian Battista Rastellini, then by his father, Gian Giacomo. In 1881 he enrolled, very young, at the Rossetti Valentini Art SchoolSchool of Fine Arts \\"Rossetti Valentini\\" in Santa Maria Maggiore in Santa Maria Maggiore, where together with Maurizio Borgnis, Carlo Fornara and Giovanni Battista Ciolina he studied under the guidance of the master Enrico Cavalli until 1887. A precocious artist, he exhibited at the First Triennale of BreraOnline catalogue of exhibition \\"Brera 1891 – L'esposizione che rivoluzionò l'arte moderna\\" curated by Elisabetta Staudacher at Gallerie Maspes, Milan 2016 (in Italian) with the painting Il Sogno (The Dream), which was shortlisted by the jury for the Principe Umberto Prize.See \\"Enrico Cavalli pittore\\" by Guido Cesura, p. 114 The same picture was presented at the International Exhibition of the Munich SecessionOfficial catalogue of the 1907 Munich Secession International Exhibition (in German) in 1907, where it was awarded a gold medal. His earliest works were a compelling sequence of portraits, remarkable for their expressiveness and formal vigour. In 1889 he moved with his brother Gian Battista, also a painter, to Milan where he opened a studio. Building on the teachings of Cavalli, he made the lessons of the most open-minded and innovative artists his own, with his work assuming a vaguely symbolist tone. Perhaps his most original production of the 1890s are the scenes and landscapes he painted in Valle Vigezzo such as Interno di stalla (Interior of a stable), Paesaggio invernale verso Buttogno (Winter landscape looking towards Buttogno), Veduta autunnale della valletta (Autumn view of the valley), and Vita umile (Humble life), dictated by autonomous stylistic choices, fruit of a mediation between his early education and his study of Impressionism and the Macchiaioli. Also worthy of note are the portraits in pastels, a technique the artist made full use of throughout the entire arc of his artistic activity. A multifaceted personality, Rastellini held the offices of Mayor of Buttogno (1899-1902) and president of the Società Elettrica Vigezzina, the Valley's electricity company. Passionate about art and a collector, he made several trips to different parts of Europe to see the great masterpieces preserved in the art galleries and churches. Around 1905, his production ground almost to a halt and from then on he focused exclusively on commissioned portraits.

She was also active in local politics in Gentofte. ==Early life and education== Born in Copenhagen on 7 November 1894, Gertie Møller was the daughter of the merchant Emilius Møller (1853–1927) and Magdalene Sophie Jessen (1860–1914). After graduating from N. Zahle's School in 1914, she studied French and history of art at the University of Copenhagen. She then turned her attention to textiles, learning the intricacies of embroidery, sewing, and design work, as well as the history of textile art.

She worked in close proximity to the teacher and printmaker Frank Short. ==Biography== Pott was born in England in 1862 and she grew up in a Victorian upper-middle-class home with her mother, Mrs. Henry Pott that wrote the book Quite the Gentleman. During the middle of the nineteenth century, the demand for artisans rose as the industrial sector began to grow. The need for artists and craftsmen spurred the creation of training schools. Constance Mary Pott attended the Royal College of Art. Pott, like many of the other students attending the school, was more drawn to fine art rather than design and she took an engraving class which began her art career. Her professional relationship with the artist Sir Frank Short began during her time at the RCA when he taught the engraving class in 1891. Shortly after graduating Pott herself began teaching at the RCA in 1902 and was extolled as an excellent teacher by many critics and curators of the time. She never married, and she didn't have any children, but she managed to outlive many of her peers. She eventually died in 1957 and left the majority of her belongings to her two sisters and her money to Johannes Matthias Daum, a former student of hers from the Royal College of Art. ==Legacy== The book Etched in Memory: The Building and Survival of Artistic Reputation includes many records of women artists between 1880 and 1930. The book surveys the etching revival and provides explanations as to why women had a harder time of building a reputation and ensuring the survival of their reputation when compared to their male contemporaries. Constance Mary Pott is analyzed in the book, and the authors contribute her lack of recognition was due to a few different reasons. Pott had a very Victorian upbringing, in which self-promotion was discouraged, so Pott wasn't able to exploit her artwork as much as her male counterparts. In December 1885 she organised the first meeting of the Francis Bacon Society having been impressed by her own earlier discoveries. She had been working on deciphering Elizabethan handwriting found in Fancis Bacon's private wastebook, and found that several ideas and figures of speech from the Promus could also be found in the Shakespeare plays and concluded that Sir Francis Bacon was their secret author. Pott outlived many of her peers and lived 32 years past the peak demand for etching artists, so when she died, her artwork was no longer related to the art scene at the time. Constance Mary Pott also neglected to keep a record of her artwork, so historians had a difficult time keeping track of the prints she made. Lastly, Pott never had any children, so her family couldn't pass on her legacy as an important artist of the time. ==References== Category:1862 births Category:1957 deaths Category:20th-century printmakers Category:20th-century British women artists Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art ","title":"Constance Mary Pott"},{"id":"56901813","text":"Conus ariejoostei is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.MolluscaBase (2018).

As an advocate, innovator, and educator in the field of printmaking, Romano has co-authored in collaboration with her husband, John Ross, The Complete Printmaker (1972), The Complete Collagraph (1980), and several other printmaking manuals that have become standard texts for universities. They founded their High Tide Press for artists books in 1991. ==Biography== Romano earned her bachelor of fine arts degree in painting at Cooper Union School of Art in New York City from 1939-43. She credits peers in her painting, drawing, and two-dimensional design classes, Morris Kantor, Sidney Delevante, and Carol Harrison, with having the greatest influence on her path of artistic endeavors career. After graduation, Romano worked for Herbert Bayer as his personal assistant to his private studio in New York City. Here Romano painted the covers for pharmaceutical brochures and managed the finished artwork for Fortune magazine, Container Corporation illustrations, and advertisements. Romano took six months leave to join her husband John Ross at an army training base in Louisiana after just one year of working for Bayer. Then returned to New York City by request of Bayer when Ross' unit was sent overseas to Italy in February 1945. Romano was given a higher position upon her return by becoming a staff artist for fashion and perfume accounts. Upon John Ross' cultural exposure of Italian country and art, in 1949 Ross was able to utilize his GI Bill to return with Romano in order for both artists to partake in studying at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts in Fontainebleau, France for two months. Continuing their stay, they then traveled throughout Europe for the following seven months. Their influence and admirability of Italy continued later in their lives as they held printmaking workshops for the Pratt Institute in Venice summer program starting in 1988. Upon Ross and Romano's return to New York in 1950, Romano was invited to take lithography lessons at the Creative Lithography Workshop from Robert Blackburn, a high school friend of Ross. This medium was new to Romano as her educational sequence at Cooper Union did not include printmaking. Her talent within the medium was quickly notable as her first piece, Eglise de St. Martin (1950) won a purchase award from the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Romano continued her practice of printmaking throughout the next decade, teaching herself woodcut, etching, and collagraphy. She earned a Louis Comfort Tiffany grant for printmaking at the Instituto Statele d' Arte in Florence, Italy, the fall of 1958 through the summer of 1959. Beginning in 1963 throughout 1973, Romano taught at numerous institutions printmaking through fine arts. She taught relief and intaglio printmaking courses at the New School, while she was also the associate professor of printmaking and teaching at the Pratt Graphic Art Center in Manhattan. Romano also taught at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn where she began as an assistant professor in printmaking and rose to become associate professor, a chair of the Fine Art Department, and a recipient of Pratt's Distinguished Professor Award for 1978-79. Robert Newman, owner of The Old Print Shop, a Manhattan gallery that has represented Ms. Romano since the 1990s, described the artist as a \\"hard-core teacher, she wanted her students to be artist, to do their work, and be proud of their work.\\" Romano and Ross master their signature collagraph technique while visiting artists in Yugoslavia for the U.S. Information Agency in conjunction with \\"Graphic Arts USA,\\" a traveling exhibition of American prints. There was no metal plates available for intaglio work in Eastern Europe. With this challenge, their solution was simultaneous intaglio and relief inking on a single cardboard matrix, their cardboard relief prints had been a continual exploration since the mid-1950s. Shoreline is a woodcut print that sufficiently represents Romano's printmaking work as she transitioned into being a notable printmaker. This color woodcut, collage, and cardboard relief is a representation of a familiar landscape view of the eastern seaboard. The piece also captures architectural forms in space. Romano's process was one of inspired layering and transitions within the piece, provoked by the landscape around her. She neglected to begin works with templates and preconceived drawings. Shoreline showcases the artist's accomplishment in variation of color and surface treatments from a single pass of a plate through a press. This work would have been printed in sequenced registration with multiple woodblocks and cardboard plates. Throughout Romano's printmaking processes, her proven desire to depict images of dimension and depth of color that preserves an abstracted simplicity creates intricate designed pieces of work. ==Principal works== * 1922 - New York Byzantine, Metropolitan Museum * 1950 - Eglise de St. Martin, Brooklyn Museum * 1958 - Shoreline, New York City * 1966 - Walls of Dubrovnik, Smithsonian * 1971 - On the Grass, Museum of Modern Art * 1975 - Grand Canyon * 1997 - Low Tide, Metropolitan Museum * N.d. - Eternal City II, Smithsonian ==References== Category:2018 deaths Category:Cooper Union alumni Category:20th-century American printmakers ","title":"Clare Romano"},{"id":"56901833","text":"Too Early for Birds (TEFB) is a series of Kenyan theatre shows that stages diverse stories from Kenyan history.

When Herod fled Judea in 40 BC to escape imprisonment by the Hasmonean ruler Antigonus II Mattathias, who had already imprisoned his brother Phasael, he first traveled to the court of Malichus. However, Malichus I turned Herod away, as the Nabataean king was politically aligned with the Parthian Empire, which viewed Herod as a client ruler of the rival Roman Republic. Herod then decided to take refuge instead in Alexandria, at the court of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt. Malichus I eventually came into conflict with Cleopatra VII after her lover and Roman triumvir Mark Antony granted her Nabataean territories in the Gulf of Aqaba along the Red Sea, which had long been used as a staging ground for Nabataean raids on Ptolemaic lands. After a bitter open conflict between Malichus I and Cleopatra, allegedly stoked by her aggressive acts, Malichus I, along with Herod, failed to show up and support Antony and Cleopatra during the fateful Battle of Actium in 31 BC, a decisive victory for their rival Octavian. ==See also== *List of rulers of Nabatea *Malichus II ==NotesReferences== * Category:Nabataean monarchs Category:1st-century BC Arabs Category:Roman client rulers Category:1st-century BC monarchs in the Middle East Category:30 BC deaths ","title":"Malichus I"},{"id":"56901968","text":"Pseudorasbora interrupta is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to streams on Fenghuang Mountain in Guangdong, China. ==References== Category:Pseudorasbora Category:Fish described in 2007 ","title":"Pseudorasbora interrupta"},{"id":"56901994","text":"Conus barrosensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.

It is the sequel to the 2006 single Natalie's Rap from the band's first album Incredibad. The music video premiered on the February 3, 2018 edition of SNL which Portman hosted, with the single being released to online services after the broadcast. ==Recording== SNL first contacted Samberg about a potential sequel to the original song three days before Portman was due to host her Saturday night episode. In a brainstorm session on the Thursday before the show, The Lonely Island planned out the song over the phone between shooting breaks in Samberg's schedule, with Akiva recording a rough demo later that day. The band continued to write late into Thursday night, and by Friday, they had recorded Portman's vocals with the band watching through FaceTime, with the remainder of the vocals picked up on the morning of the show. The recording was completed later that day—just in time for mixing and syncing with the music video. The band had considered bringing back Chris Parnell to play the role of the interviewer, but due to him not being available in New York, they opted to bring in Beck Bennett in his place. Alex Moffat recorded his part, which was included in the Star Wars verse. ==Composition== The song make several cultural references and parodies current events such as the rise of the Me Too movement and the consumption of Tide Pods internet meme within the lyrics and music video. The song structure is similar of that to the original rap with Portman engaging in a mock interview. Claiming to have changed since the last interview, she states, \\"I was going through a really weird time then. But...I've matured a lot\\" before reverting into a similar pattern of described behaviors. When the interviewer appears to mock the quality of the Star Wars prequels, Portman takes a hostage and coerces compliments from him to appease Jar Jar Binks. ==Music video== Natalie Portman \\"snacking\\" on Tide Pods in the official music video. The music video was directed by Paul Briganti and made its premier on the February 3, 2018 edition of SNL. The video was recorded the day before the television broadcast and before the song had been completely recorded, with Portman having to lip sync on the video recording to the rough demo which featured the voices of the band. Samberg's part of the video was written and recorded in LA within an hour that day and was sent over to New York to be edited into the cut. The video follows the narrative of the song with Natalie Portman going through the events of her life since the last time she appeared on the show 12 years prior, including motherhood and her Oscar wins. The video features a cameo from Kenan Thompson as a doctor interrupting Portman \\"giving birth.\\" The video has been viewed over seven million times through the band's VEVO and the official SNL accounts on YouTube. ==Track listingRelease history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label -  Worldwide  rowspan=\\"1\\" February 3, 2018  rowspan=\\"1\\" Digital download  rowspan=\\"1\\" The Lonely Island (B079YJ5VSH) - } ==References== Category:The Lonely Island songs Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Comedy rap songs ","title":"Natalie's Rap 2.0"},{"id":"56902041","text":"Pseudorasbora pugnax is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to Honshu, Japan. ==References== Category:Pseudorasbora Category:Freshwater fish of Japan Category:Endemic fauna of Japan Category:Fish described in 2015 ","title":"Pseudorasbora pugnax"},{"id":"56902056","text":"Christine Ballengee-Morris is a professor in the Arts Administration, Education and Policy Department for Ohio State University.

It is the outermost of three known planets orbiting around the K-type star K2-155 in the constellation Taurus. It is one of 15 new exoplanets around red dwarf stars discovered by Japanese astronomer Teruyuki Hirano of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and his team. The team used data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope during its extended K2 \\"Second Light\\" mission. K2-155d orbits near the so-called habitable zone of its system, and has the potential to host liquid water. ==Discovery and observations== K2-155d is one of 15 exoplanets discovered by a team of Japanese astronomers led by Teruyuki Hirano at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Its discovery is based on data from the K2 mission of NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The exoplanet has also been observed from ground-based telescopes including the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) in La Palma and the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. Its characteristics were confirmed using speckle imaging and high-dispersion optical spectroscopy. The mass of K2-155d and the brightness of its host star may be measured by future observations from the W. M. Keck Observatory and the James Webb Space Telescope. The brightness of its host star makes K2-155d a good target for future studies using instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope. ==Characteristics== K2-155d is a super-Earth exoplanet with a radius 1.64 times that of Earth, near the transition zone between small rock-based and larger gaseous planets. Climate models predict that it is located near its star's habitable zone and has an insolation 1.67 ± 0.38 (between 1.29 and 2.05) times that of Earth. Its physical temperature is estimated to be 289 K (16 degrees Celsius or 61 degrees Fahrenheit). Studies have shown that the planet would maintain a moderate surface temperature if its insolation is smaller than ∼1.5 times that of Earth. K2-155d is one of three known planets in the system orbiting K2-155, a red dwarf star located 200 light years from Earth. Its parent star has 88% less volume than the Sun. K2-155d orbits its star with a 40.7 day period, but as the planet is tidally locked the same side always faces its sun. K2-155d has an orbital radius of 0.1886AU and studies suggest that the planet has a low orbital eccentricity. ==Potential habitability== K2-155d has been labeled a potentially habitable planet that may be able to harbor liquid water. A three-dimensional climate simulation was used to confirm the possibility of the existence of water. However, its discoverer Teruyuki Hirano was cautious about the findings, stating that they do not guarantee K2-155d is habitable, as the ranges in its orbit and temperature allow the possibility of it being outside the habitable zone. Factors such as the absence of solar flares could also decide if K2-155d is habitable. ==References== Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2018 Category:Super-Earths in the habitable zone Category:Taurus (constellation) Category:Transiting exoplanets Category:Discoveries by the Mauna Kea Observatories 155 ","title":"K2-155d"},{"id":"56902155","text":"The 2001 CSKA season was the club's tenth season in the Russian Top Division, the highest tier of association football in Russia. ==Squad== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:90%;\\" - ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Number ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Name ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Nationality ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Position ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Date of birth (Age) ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Signed from ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Signed in ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Contract ends ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Apps. ! 4169E1; color:white; text-align:center;\\" Goals - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Goalkeepers -  1  Veniamin Mandrykin   GK   Alania Vladikavkaz  2001   17  0 - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Defenders -  2  Andrei Solomatin   DF   Lokomotiv Moscow  2001   7  0 -  3  Yevgeni Varlamov   DF   KAMAZ  1998   94  11 -  4  Maksim Bokov   DF   Zenit St.Petersburg  1997   133  3 -  6  Oleg Kornaukhov   DF   Shinnik Yaroslavl  1998   121  11 -  14  Denis Yevsikov   DF   Academy  1999   37  0 -  18  Valeri Minko   DF   Dynamo Barnaul  1989   270  12 -   Aleksei Berezutski   DF   Torpedo-ZIL Moscow  2001   0  0 -   Andrei Tsaplin   DF   Academy  1996   67  1 -   Renat Yanbayev   DF   Academy  2001   0  0 - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Midfielders -  5  Sergei Semak   MF   Asmaral Moscow  1994   231  57 -  7  Igor Yanovsky   MF   Paris Saint-Germain  2001   14  1 -  8  Juris Laizāns   MF   Skonto Riga  2001   28  0 -  11  Sergei Filippenkov   MF   CSK VVS- Kristall Smolensk  1998   114  20 -  12  Vladimir Kuzmichyov   MF   Dynamo Kyiv  2001   16  0 -  15  Davron Fayziev   MF   Sogdiana Jizzakh  2000   25  0 -  17  Stanislav Lysenko   MF   Rubin Kazan  2000   35  5 -  22  Aleksandr Berketov   MF   Rotor Volgograd  2001   10  0 -  25  Elvir Rahimić   MF   Anzhi Makhachkala  2001   14  0 -   Sergei Rodin   MF   Academy  1999   7  0 - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Forwards -  9  Predrag Ranđelović   FW   Anzhi Makhachkala  2001   15  9 -  10  Vladimir Kulik   FW   Zenit St.Petersburg  1997   162  63 -  20  Roman Monaryov   FW   CSKA Kyiv  2001   11  3 -  21  Denis Popov   FW   Chernomorets Novorossiysk  2001   18  4 - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Out on loan -  22  Aleksei Savelyev   MF   Torpedo Moscow  1997   103  7 - ! colspan=\\"11\\" dcdcdc; text-align:center;\\" Left During the Season -  2  Andrei Liforenko   DF   Dynamo-Stroyimpuls St. Petersburg  2001   1  0 -  7  Askhat Kadyrkulov   MF   Kairat  2000   13  0 -  8  Konstantin Kaynov   MF   Levski Sofia  2001   5  0 -  9  Marek Hollý   MF   Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod  2000   40  3 -  12  Ulugbek Bakayev   FW   Buxoro  2001   7  0 -  13  Maksym Biletskyi   MF   Academy  1998   7  0 -  14  Aleksandr Garin   FW   Luch-Energiya Vladivostok  2001   1  0 -  16  Serhiy Perkhun   GK   Sheriff Tiraspol  2001   6  0 -  19  Rustem Bulatov   DF   Shinnik Yaroslavl  2000   30  4 -  20  Mikhail Lunin   MF   K.R.C.

A roundhouse is the part of a post mill that encloses the trestle. It serves two functions; to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. ==Post mills== Early medieval post mills had their trestles partly buried in the ground. This gave the mill stability, but had the disadvantage that the trestle would rot where it met the ground. This type of mill was called the Sunk post mill. By making the mill bigger, it was possible to raise the trestle out of the ground. These mills are called open trestle post mills. The trestle of the mill, whilst clear of the ground, is still exposed to the elements. By adding a structure around the trestle, it is protected from the elements, with the added advantage of creating additional dry storage space for grain and flour. These mills are called a post mill with roundhouse. Some open trestle post mills had a roundhouse added later, for example Drinkstone, Suffolk c.1830. Other mills were built with a roundhouse from new. Single storey roundhouses had two doors directly opposite each other to give safe access and egress whichever way the wind was blowing from. A roundhouse is usually, but not always round. Polygonal roundhouses also exist. A roundhouse may be of one, two or three storeys. The latter were most common amongst windmills in Suffolk, where the post mill reached its peak of design. A tall roundhouse raised the mill above the trees and enabled it to better catch the wind. Sometimes a mill was raised, such as the Black Mill, Southwold, Suffolk in 1863 following gale damage. It originally had a single- storey roundhouse, but had a two-storey roundhouse after it was rebuilt. Generally, the roundhouse has no structural function, with the exception of roundhouses in the Midlands region of the United Kingdom, where they carried a curb and through wheels on the underside of the buck of the mill, they carried some weight from the mill, a task usually performed solely by the trestle. Often, when a post mill was demolished, the roundhouse was left standing. Some of these roundhouses survive, either as stores converted into dwellings. ==References== ;Sources * * * Category:Post mills ","title":"Roundhouse (windmill)"},{"id":"56902243","text":"Javon Romario East (born 22 March 1995) is a Jamaican international footballer who plays as a striker for Costa Rican club Santos de Guápiles on loan from Portmore United. ==Club career== He has played club football for Portmore United.

Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Wellesley, Marchioness Wellesley (1766 - 7 November 1816), formerly Hyacinthe Gabrielle Fagan and also known as Hyacinthe Gabrielle Fagan,Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh. Burke's Irish Family Records. London, U.K.: Burkes Peerage Ltd, 1976. Page 400 was a French actress who became the mistress, and later the wife, of Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley of Norragh. She was born as Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland in Paris, the daughter of Pierre Roland and Hyacinthe Gabrielle Varis. Wellesley, the son of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, met Roland at the Palais Royal where she was an actress. She spoke no English, and they lived together for some years without marrying. He succeeded as 2nd Earl of Mornington in 1781. They married on 29 November 1794 at St George's, Hanover Square, London,G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume IX, page 236. Following their marriage, she became Countess of Mornington, but remained a social outcast. Even the easy-going Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne refused to call on her, and scolded her daughter-in-law Lady Caroline Lamb severely for doing so. Prior to their marriage, they had three sons and two daughters: * Richard Wellesley (1787–1831), a member of parliament * Anne Wellesley (1788–1875), who married firstly Sir William Abdy, 7th Baronet, and secondly Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Charles Bentinck * Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley (1789–1849), who married Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton * Gerald Wellesley (1792–1833), who served as the East India Company's resident at Indore. * Rev. Henry Wellesley (1794–1866), Principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford. Through their daughter Anne, Wellesley and his wife are great-great-great grandparents to Queen Elizabeth II. In the course of their marriage, Wellesley also had at least two other illegitimate sons by another mistress, Elizabeth Johnston. In 1797, when the earl was obliged to travel to India in his capacity as Governor General, Hyacinthe did not accompany him, although he tried repeatedly to persuade her. There is some evidence that she was already seeking a legal settlement prior to his departure. In 1799 the earl was created Marquess Wellesley, making his wife a marchioness. By 1801, her letters were accusing him both of infidelity with another Frenchwoman, Madame de Cocrement, and of neglect of his family. On the earl's return to Britain, he purchased Apsley House as a family home, but the couple quickly became estranged and he took another mistress. They formally separated in 1810, and she left the house, to live first in Grosvenor Square and then in Great Cumberland Place. She died at Teddesley Hall, Staffordshire, a house belonging to the local MP, Edward Littleton, who had married her daughter Hyacinthe in 1812. ==References== Category:1766 births Category:1816 deaths Category:French actresses Category:French countesses Category:French marchionesses Category:French expatriates in England Category:Peerage of Ireland Mornington ","title":"Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland"},{"id":"56902289","text":"Solomon Goldstein-Rose (born December 5, 1993) is an American politician, climate activist, and author, who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. From 2017 to 2019 he represented the 3rd Hampshire district (includes Amherst, Pelham, and Precinct 1 of Granby). Goldstein-Rose ran for an open State Rep seat during his last semester of college and the following summer, at age 22. He won the 6-way Democratic primary in September 2016 and was uncontested in the general election in November 2016. Goldstein-Rose's campaign platform focused on his youth and energy to push for system change, with an emphasis on clean energy and education policy. Once in the legislature he introduced bills related to clean energy, K-12 education, and election reform, and joined the Progressive Caucus in pushing for criminal justice reform and other policies. Halfway through his term, he switched his voter registration to unenrolled (Independent) on February 20, 2018, to emphasize current problems with the two-party system and spark conversations about partisanship and national political discourse. During his term in office, Goldstein-Rose created several civic engagement and civic education programs, including a monthly free dessert discussion, an \\"UnCampaign\\" in which he knocked on doors during election off-season to speak with unlikely voters about state politics, a CivicsFest celebration and contest organized with the League of Women Voters of Amherst, talks about government and political issues at local schools, and a monthly guest column in the Amherst Bulletin in which Goldstein-Rose explained details of the Massachusetts legislature's process and discussed current issues. Goldstein-Rose was also part of a working group that created and successfully passed a bill requiring hands-on civic education in Massachusetts schools. Goldstein-Rose is a 2016 graduate of Brown University, where he studied Engineering and Public Policy. He previously interned in the Obama White House, in a Senate office, and on a Senate campaign. During college he founded the Rhode Island carbon pricing campaign. Before college, Goldstein-Rose served as a full member of the Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee at age 18 while in 12th grade, filling out the end of a term when a member moved away. He has been a climate activist since age 11. Goldstein-Rose cancelled his 2018 re-election campaign at the end of the legislative term, announcing he would instead shift to full-time nationally and globally focused work on climate change. He synthesized research, outreach, and analysis into a framework for the comprehensive picture of solving climate change.

Her mother was Jay Cooke's granddaughter and Charles D. Barney's daughter. Her brother was William Barclay Harding (1907–1967), chairman of the board of Smith, Barney and Co. She debuted into society aged 18 in 1920 at the Plaza Hotel, accompanied by Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis. Harding was invited to a dance hosted by Anne Harriman Vanderbilt in 1921, confirming her position among American high society. Harding's sister, Cammie, married polo player Lorillard Suffern Tailer. Harding attended Miss Porter's School but did not go to college. In 1967, Monmouth College awarded Harding with an honorary degree of doctor in humane letters. ==Career== In summer 1929, Harding began work with the Berkshire Players in Stockbridge, New York, performing W. Somerset Maugham's Caroline. The cast included a young James Cagney and Jane Wyatt. In autumn, she joined the Dramatic League of Chicago, performing Thunder in the Air. After the press wrote that \\"an heiress to a seven-million-dollar fortune\\" was working with the company, she quit. \\"I do not want any publicity,\\" she said: \\"I want my work to be judged on nothing but merit. I simply will not have people come to stare at me because they have found out who I am.\\" She returned to the Berkshire Players, where she became friends with Hepburn. About this time, Harding met Hepburn when they were students of voice instructor Frances Robinson-Duff in New York City. At Robinson-Duff’s suggestion, they both accepted work at the Berkshire Playhouse and became close friends. The pair rented a Victorian house on Devon Road in the upstate town of Lee, New York, that was owned by Edward C. Bradley, and became close to Bradley's daughters. In 1930 Hepburn and Harding worked together in James M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton, playing Lady Agatha and Lady Catherine respectively. The play was directed by a young Alexander Kirkland, an associate of Eva Le Gallienne. The press began calling Harding \\"Katharine Hepburn's other half\\". The pair moved to the West Coast to launch Hepburn's Hollywood career, and Harding took care of Hepburn, including wardrobe design, acting as a press agent and negotiating with producers and directors. Harding once described herself facetiously as \\"Miss Hepburn's husband\\". Hers was the most private and enduring of all of Hepburn’s friendships with women. \\"I think it's fair to say,\\" Hepburn later said, \\"that Laura Harding saved my life.\\" Harding introduced Hepburn to Leland Hayward, son of attorney Colonel William Hayward, who became Hepburn's lover and agent. Harding lived with Hepburn for four years and put her own career on hold, concentrating on Hepburn's. She later told friends this was the happiest time the pair spent together before Hepburn became famous. During World War II Harding organized dances and parties for the National Guardsmen in Eatontown. She volunteered at the Stage Door Canteen in New York City. She was president from 1954 to 1970 and chairman of the board from 1970 to 1974 of the MCOSS Nursing Services, a non-profit volunteer organization serving patients in Monmouth, Middlesex, and Ocean New Jersey counties. She campaigned to convert the Bendix plant in Red Bank, New Jersey, into a health center, subsequently named the Geraldine L. Thompson Building after the MCOSS founder. In 1955 she was the assistant of Cecil Beaton, scenic designer for the Broadway production of The Chalk Garden. In 1968 Harding was named woman of the year by the Business and Professional Women's Clubs of Monmouth County. In 1971 the MCOSS Nursing Services set up the Laura Harding Scholarship fund to provide grants and loans for training nurses. In 1974 she received the Brotherhood Award from the American Conference of Christians and Jews. In 1990 a medical center in Manasquan, New Jersey, was named in her honor, the Laura Harding Health Center, and her birthday, June 2, was declared Laura Harding Day in Monmouth County, New Jersey. She was active in the Republican Party (she was the Republican Committeewoman of the 5th District in Holmdel) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She was vice-president of the Riverview Hospital's board, and president of the board of managers at the New Jersey Diagnostic Center in Menlo Park. She was a member of the Monmouth Park Charity Fund and on the board of the Old Monmouth Training Club and the Monmouth County SPCA. ==Personal life== After Hepburn's career took off, Harding lived at Beekman Place, New York, and owned the Bayonet Farm in Holmdel, New Jersey, which Hepburn regularly visited. Harding also owned a house in Mantoloking, New Jersey, which people mistook for being Hepburn's because of her frequent visits. Harding was paired with society men like Wilmarth Lewis, a collector of Horace Walpole memorabilia, Carleton Burke, a polo player who lived in Berkeley Square, Los Angeles, and Fortune reporter Russell \\"Mitch\\" Davenport. Her close friends included Hope Williams, a fellow graduate of Miss Porter’s and a member of the Junior League, and her lover Mercedes de Acosta, Clifton Webb, Gertrude Lawrence, Guthrie McClintic and his wife Katharine Cornell, Lillie Messenger, a Hollywood talent scout, Philip Barry, Beatrice Lillie, Elsie Janis, Noël Coward, Eunice Stoddard, Cheryl Crawford and her lover, Dorothy Patten. One of the last public appearances of Harding was at the premiere of Rich and Famous, director George Cukor's last film, in 1981. Afterwards, Harding and Cukor attended a gala reception together. Harding died on August 9, 1994, aged 92. ==References== Citations Books * Category:1902 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American socialites Category:American philanthropists Category:American women philanthropists Category:People from Mantoloking, New Jersey Category:People from Philadelphia Category:Miss Porter's School alumni Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Laura Barney Harding"},{"id":"56902322","text":"Red Farm Military Cemetery is a British military cemetery with fallen from the First World War, located in the Belgian village of Vlamertinge (Ypres).

From September 1963 the school catered for pupils from ages 9–18. Warriston School was ultimately owned and run by Brian Larmour and his wife. Age group was from 10 to 18 years old. Warristonschool.com. ==History== Warriston School was established by F.W. Gardiner in 1899 and named after Archibald Johnston, Lord Warriston. The school was situated at 'Holmpark' in Ballplay Road and started with 5 boys. In 1932 Mr and Mrs Gardiner retired after 33 years. In December 1919 Captain Ross Smith and his brother Keith, flying with two companions became the first people to fly from England to Australia. There were three Smith brothers educated at Warriston, Colin having fallen during the war. The Scotsman reported: From 1932-1935 the Essex cricketer and Walker Cup golfer, Leonard Crawley, was the headmaster of Warriston. On 5 July 1933 Sir Jack Hobbs the Surrey and England cricketer played in a match at Warriston School sports grounds for an L.G. Crawley XI v H.B. Rowan XI. Hobbs and Crawley put on 140 for the first-wicket partnership but lost the match by 26 runs. The Edinburgh Evening News reported in 1933 that the former Wales rugby union scrum-half D. E. A. Roberts was teaching at Warriston. In April 1935 Crawley relinquished the headmastership of Warriston, but the school remained his property. Furthermore, a board of governors was appointed. The board included General Sir Archibald Cameron General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Scottish Command; Admiral J. E. Cameron, late Commander- in-Chief, Rosyth; Mr Angus Forsyth, hon. secretary of Old Warristonians; Dr Stanley Honeyman; Mr Finlay Ramage, W.S.; Mr G. B. Smith, headmaster Sedbergh School; Mr L. G. W. Wilkinson, chairman of the governors of Tynemouth School; and Mr Crawley. Crawley was succeeded as headmaster by Mr A.B. Carter.

Based on research in music history and traditional music practices, his work reflects the notion of instrument, and how it interacts with listening, composing and performing. == Biography == Tarek Atoui was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1980. In 1998, he started composing electronic music and moved to France. In 2007 he worked as artistic director at STEIM in Amsterdam, a center for electronic performance arts. In 2010, he gave his first solo exhibition titled Un-drum 3, a musical performance using his own body efforts as a sound triggers. Since then, Tarek Atoui developed the possibilities of sound experimentation all over the world through his solo exhibitions and in collaboration with sound artists, composers and instrument makers. == Selected works  The Reverse Collection (2014-2016) === The Reverse Collection is an ensemble of instruments that has been conceived in several steps. The project started with the Dahlem Sessions, at the occasion of the 8th Berlin Biennale in 2014, when Atoui invited musicians to improvise on historical instruments from the collection of the ethnological museum in Berlin. The recordings from these performances were then passed on to instrument makers, asking them to develop new instruments that would allow to recreate these sounds. Eight instruments were constructed and exhibited in Mexico City at kurimanzutto in 2014, resulting in several performances and new compositions, called the Reverse Sessions. The third and last step was presented as Reverse Collection in 2016 at Tate Modern in London with a new generation of ten instruments. Activated in several performances which Atoui recorded, the collection was completed at this occasion by a multichannel sound work in the exhibition space, that was evolving over the whole duration of the show and allowing multiple associations between object, sound, space and performance. === WITHIN (2016) === For his project WITHIN, Tarek Atoui has been working with deaf and hard of hearing persons since 2012, exploring modes of tactile, physical, gestural and visual sound perception, and developing instruments that can be played by deaf as well as by hearing people. WITHIN questions the act of listening and the way we build instruments, conduct composition and improvisation, write scores and relate to an audience. The project was initiated in 2012 and has since then been enriched by the contribution of the curatorial duo Council. WITHIN evolved at the Sharjah Biennale (2013), the Berkeley Art Museum, the Experimental Music and Performing Art Center - New-York (2015), ZKM - Karlsruhe (2016), the Bergen Assembly (2016), the Galerie Chantal Crousel - Paris (2017), Garage - Moscow (2018), the Favoriten Festival - Dortmund (2018), and the Printemps de Septembre - Toulouse (2018). The resulting collection of instruments that has been developed in collaboration with deaf and non-deaf students and volunteers, instrument makers, software engineers, speaker designers, and art educators can be activated in workshops, rehearsals and performances, but also as sound installation replaying some of the past performance recordings and offering new sounds methods of apprehending sound. === The Ground (2017, ongoing) === The Ground is the result of Tarek Atoui's trips and investigations over the period of 5 years, around the agricultural environment of Pearl River Delta (Guangdong, China). This research resulted, in collaboration with musicians and instrument makers, in a series of instruments presented at Mirrored Gardens (Guangzhou, China) in 2017. Each instrument has its own approach of being activated and all together they can be played autonomously in different sound situations to be experienced individually by each listener. Each presentation of The Ground is punctuated with invitations to musicians and composers to activate and play the instruments in an experimental conversation to find new musical gestures and enrich the soundscape. In 2018 the project was presented in the exhibition The Ground, from the Land to the Sea at the NTU CCA Singapore. At this occasion a new series of porcelain and ceramic discs were created. The exhibition also featured selected instruments from The Reverse Collection and WITHIN. Additionally, the presentation in Singapore offered the opportunity for Tarek Atoui to complete his sound collection I/E with recordings of the Singapore shores, local harbors and waterfronts in cooperation with Éric La Casa, composer and sound artist. In 2019 The Ground is presented at the 58th Venice Biennale, in the International Art Exhibition May You Live In Interesting Times. For this exhibition, the instruments play autonomously in a composition constantly fed by their own sounds and vibrations, creating immersive soundscapes and engaging the act of listening. == Selected exhibitions == * Un-drum 1, Sharjah Biennial 9, Sharjah, U.A.E.

Upperside black, with similar markings to those in Graphium sarpedon. Forewing with the transverse macular band generally much narrower, the upper spots being smaller and wider separated, and the lower portions mostly divided by black veins; the band is composed of either eight or nine portions, the upper spot being sometimes absent, in both sexes from Sri Lanka and south India, the band being either at its narrowest or widest width, this spot—when present—is very small. Hindwing produced into a rather prominent tooth at end of upper median veinlet; the medial band mostly narrower than in G. sarpedon. Underside with the transverse bands as above. Hindwing with the subbasal crimson bar not inwardly bordered with black; other markings similar to G. sarpedon. ==Habitat== Graphium teredon is primarily an inhabitant of moist, low-level rain forests (below 1600 m (5000 ft)). In these elevations it is usually seen flying just above the tree canopy. ==Behaviour== The males are known for their habit of feeding by the edges of puddles, often at the roadside. Occasionally, as many as eight will be seen at the same puddle. They have also been known to be attracted to animal droppings, carcasses and rotting insects. It has been recorded as a migrant in South India and is known to mud-puddle during migration. The butterfly has been seen as comprising as much as 5% of the population of migrating butterflies during a 72-hour period in the Nilgiri hills. The southern bluebottle is known for quick flight and rapid reactions. Consequently, it is difficult to catch. ===Diet=== The adult common bluebottle feeds on nectar from a variety of flowering herbs. The larvae feed primarily on the leaves of trees in the families Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae, and Rutaceae. In particular, G. teredon often feed on leaves of the cinnamon bark tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) or of the Indian laurel (Litsea sebifera). The list of larval food plants also include Alseodaphne semecarpifolia, Cinnamomum camphora, Cinnamomum macrocarpum, Cinnamomum malabathrum,Kunte, K. 2006. Additions to known larval host plants of Indian butterflies. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 103(1):119-120 Litsea chinensis, Polyalthia longifolia, Miliusa tomentosa, Persea macrantha and Michelia doltospa. ==Life cycleEgg=== The egg is yellowish, laid singly on the leaves of a host plant. ===Larva=== When young, is black or dark green, with numerous spines; when full grown, it is green with a short spines on each thoracic segment and anal segment. There is a transverse yellow band on the 4th segment and a lateral band on the body. The caterpillar usually lies on the centre of a leaf on an upper surface. It is very sluggish and pupates near its feeding spot. Frederic Moore quoted in Bingham, 1907, described it as: \\"Smooth, thickened from the second to the 5th segment and thence decreasing to the end; with two short subdorsal fleshy spines on the 4th segment, between which is a transverse pale yellow line, two shorter spines also on the 2nd and 3rd and two on the anal segment; colour green, with a longitudinal posterior lateral and lower pale yellowish line.\\" ===Pupa=== The pupa is green with a slender and pointed thoractic projection, yellowish wing cases and lateral bands. \\"Conical, truncated in front; thorax produced into a lengthened obtusely-pointed frontal process.\\" (Frederic Moore quoted in Bingham, 1907) ==ReferencesGeneral reading== * * s ==External links== teredon Category:Butterflies of India Category:Butterflies described in 1865 ","title":"Graphium teredon"},{"id":"56902419","text":"Pseudorasbora pumila, also known as the moroco, is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to Japan. ==References== Category:Pseudorasbora Category:Fish described in 1930 ","title":"Pseudorasbora pumila"},{"id":"56902423","text":"Aami Ashbo Phirey (English: \\"I shall return\\") is a 2018 Bengali drama film directed by Anjan Dutt and produced by Shree Venkatesh Films.

It is lethal because it inhibits acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition causes an overly high accumulation of acetylcholine between the nerve and muscle cells. This paralyzes the muscles by preventing their relaxation. The paralyzed muscles includes the muscles used for breathing. Patent assigned to US Army for EA-4056 among other similar nerve agents was filed in December 7, 1967. == Lethality == Carbamates like EA-4056 are well absorbed by the lungs, gastrointestinal tracts, and the skin. Signs and symptoms from exposure to such carbamates are similar to other nerve agents. In general their penetration through the blood-brain barrier is difficult due to quaternary nitrogens in these molecules. Despite of this, EA-4056 is claimed to be about three times more toxic than VX (another nerve agent). For VX, the median lethal dose (LD50) for 70 kg men via exposure to the skin is estimated to be 10 mg, and the lethal concentration time (LCt50), measuring the concentration of the vapor per length of time exposed, is estimated to be 30–50 mg·min/m3. These values for EA-4056 can be estimated to be 3.3 mg and 10–16.7 mg·min/m3 by division. Intravenous LD50 for EA-4056 is 0.0011 mg/kg for mice and 0.0027 mg/kg for rabbits. == Properties == EA-4056's CAS is 110913-96-7, mass 732.6 g/mol, melting point 100–105 °C, and it is soluble in water and alcohols. It is a crystalline solid. EA-4056 evaporates slowly in to the air; thus it can be classified as being extremely persistent in the environment if any possible effects of external factors like sun light and water (air humidity) upon it are neglected. Various other salts than just bromine salts have been reported. == Synthesis == 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine precursor is prepared. It is made via Mannich reaction by using 3-pyridol (CAS 109-00-2), dimethylamine and formaldehyde. Resulting 2-((Dimethylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol (CAS 2168-13-0) is then carbamoylated with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride. For a different product other secondary amines than dimethylamine can be used; such as those containing methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and benzyl groups. 2 moles of 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine and app. 1 mol α,ω-dihaloalkane (e.g. 1,9-dibromononane in this case) in acetonitrile is heated on a steam bath for 6 hours. It is then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The crystalline product is collected by filtration and then triturated with acetone. If no solid separates, ethyl acetate is added to precipitate the crude product. The product is then dissolved in hot ethanol and treated with decolorizing charcoal. Ethyl acetate is added to the filtered solution to precipitate the crystalline product. E-4056 product is then collected and dried. Yield is 95%. Other stable salts of EA-4056 than bromide can be made such as sulfate, nitrate, hydrogen, oxalate and perchlorate. Other α,ω-dihaloalkanes can be used to obtain similar molecules with different carbon chain lengths. == See also == * EA-3966 * EA-3990 * T-1123 == References == Category:Carbamate nerve agents Category:Pyridines Category:Quaternary ammonium compounds Category:Bromides Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Biscarbamates Category:Bisquaternary anticholinesterases Category:Aromatic carbamates ","title":"EA-4056"},{"id":"56902461","text":"Conus ngocngai is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.MolluscaBase (2018).

He was born into a revivalist family. His parents had met in a pietist community. His father, Johann Gottfried Lobegott Müller (1833–1905), was a school master and also a cantor and an organist. His paternal grandfather was another school master. His mother, born Christiane Friedericke Dölitzsch (1833–93), came from a farming family in nearby Mautitz. Between the ages of four and nine Johannes Müller was struck down with Poliomyelitis, becoming completely paralysed and confined to his bed when he was seven. However, after the doctors had given up any hope of improvement in his condition he did, slowly, recover. He later described his years of debilitating childhood illness as particularly happy and powerfully formative in terms of an ability to absorb information and impressions. When he was twelve he went to live with his grandparents in Dresden where he attended secondary school. === Student years === Müller moved on to study philosophy and Lutheran theology at Leipzig University in 1884. His tutors included Franz Delitzsch. He also studied as a student at Erlangen University where he became a member of a Wingolf student fraternity.August Winkler: Vademekum Wingolfitikum, Wingolfsverlag, Wolfratshausen 1925, p. 214. In 1890 he received his doctorate in philosophy. His attempt to gain a doctorate in theology the following year failed on account of profound theological differences with his assessors at the Leipzig University Faculty of Theology, however. In 1889 he became Mission Secretary of the Evangelical-Lutheran National Association for Missions to Israel (\\"Evangelisch-lutherischen Zentralvereins für Mission unter Israel\\"), as the organisation was known at that time. He presented a proposal that its proselytising highighting individual Jewish sages should be replaced with a peoples' mission which would provide for the recognition of Israel as a single overarching entity in unity with Jesus as Messiah. He drew inspiration from the ideas of Joseph Rabinowitz. The management committee were not persuaded, however, and at the end of 1892 Johannes Müller's resignation was accepted. After the unconventional conclusion to his university career, Müller showed himself to be largely unencumbered by the traditional boundaries of theological belief, giving stimulating public talks on questions of faith and life in ways that managed to fill lecture halls in Germany and nearby countries. Conventional church teaching held that nature was the well-spring of sin and immorality. Having identified and defined his target in this way, Müller went on to reject it as cold-hearted and anti-life (\\"gefühlskalt und lebensfeindlich\\"). He condemned \\"aloof\\" thought,Harald Haury: Von Riesa nach Schloss Elmau, , p. 11,15, 111, 187, 302 incorporating, some believed, the language of \\"gutter antisemitism\\" in his presentations. === Printing years === Müller's adolescence and student years furnished him with a powerful but in many ways representative \\"fin de siècle\\" intellect. In the end he would publish more than 40 books. Soon he was filling 1,000 seat evangelical halls with his perorations, and in 1897 he teamed up with Heinrich Lhotzky to publish his own journal, the periodical \\"Blätter zur Pflege des persönlichen Lebens\\" (\\"Pages on taking care of the individual life\\"). It was renamed \\"Grünen Blätter\\" (\\"Green leaves/pages\\") in 1914 (and then withdrawn in 1941 due to paper shortages). Müller's many written pieces are today sometimes seen in the wider context of the so-called Judenmission (loosely \\"Mission to the Jews\\") as foreshadowing the political antisemitism that led to the Holocaust.Paul Gerhard Aring: Christen und Juden heute – und die „Judenmission“? Geschichte und Theologie protestantischer Judenmission in Deutschland, dargestellt und untersucht am Beispiel des Protestantismus im mittleren Deutschland. Haag + Herchen, Frankfurt am Main 1987, p. 4f.Paul Gerhard Aring: Christen und Juden heute – und die „Judenmission“? Geschichte und Theologie protestantischer Judenmission in Deutschland, dargestellt und untersucht am Beispiel des Protestantismus im mittleren Deutschland. Haag + Herchen, Frankfurt am Main 1987, pp. 231–235. With his continuing high-profile public activity as a \\"religious intellectual\\", he campaigned for a new free Christianity, and it was this that provided a personal justification for his own freelance existence. His ideas were translated into several languages and found a resonance with many educated fellow citizens, with the \\"unchurched educated\\" (\\"entkirchlichten Gebildeten\\"),Friedrich Wilhelm Graf Protestantische Wellness in Süddeutsche Zeitung, Ostern 2014, p 12 and with adherents of the Cultural Protestantism movement who were engaged in reinventing Christianity for a modern industrial age. He was in close personal contact with Heinrich Diesman (1863–1927), a \\"populist\\" theoretician. He engaged with the newly fashionable branch of science known as Eugenics, and the application in literature and philosophy of the \\"degeneration phenomena\\". Müller bemoaned a \\"direct national danger\\" predicated on the decline in marriage among educated circles. Women would thereby remain deprived of the fulfillment of their \\"central role as women\\" (\\"ihres ... eigentlichen Frauenberufs\\"). Massive immigration from Poland, Russia and Bohemia was degrading \\"our nation\\".Johannes Müller: Beruf und Stellung der Frau, Grüne Blätter 1900, p. 302. What remained unexplained for Müller and his readers was the way that a \\"heightened sensitivity to the upheavals of modernity, a turbocharged vitality, and possibly even genius religiosity, alongside a number of liberal convictions, could go hand in hand with a brazenly populist ideology. After 1918, Müller shared the conviction, widespread among political conservatives, that the Weimar policies and constitutional structure lacked legitimacy. His critics imply that it was only the régime change of 1933 that addressed those concerns, although others point out that prior to that point Johannes Müller had \\"ignored completely\\" Adolf Hitler and his movement. === From Mainberg to Elmau === In 1903 Müller and Heinrich Lhotzky set up a \\"care home for personal life\\" (\\"Pflegestätte persönlichen Lebens\\") in Castle Mainberg at Schweinfurt in the hill-country east of Frankfurt. The centre became a meeting point for their readers and friends. Support came from a wide and disparate range of backers, reflecting Müller's public profile at the time. They included the cookie magnate, Hermann Bahlsen, the Gutehoffnungshütte heiress, Elsa von Michael, the Count of Solms- Laubach, Walter Luetgebrune, later known as a lawyer for right-wing extremists. Others were the Social Democrat politician Anton Fendrich, the future resistance fighter Elisabeth von Thadden, the musician Wilhelm Kempff, the politician Arnold Bergsträsser, the publisher Oscar Beck along with the literary polymaths Wilhelm Langewiesche and Korfiz Holm. The castle had been placed at Müller's disposal by the industrialist Alexander Erbslöh, a friend who had been persuaded to buy it for the purpose. In 1912 it was recorded that the average stay at the establishment lasted for 13.7 days. Müller introduced special one-week seminar sessions at reduced price for students: the next year the same deal was made available to theologians and teachers. Some stayed for as long as two months. However, Alexander Erbslöh now declined to provide further funding, while at the same time Müller received an undertaking of substantial financial support from Elsa von Michael, generally known to posterity by her subsequent title as Elsa Countess of Waldersee. She was a daughter of the fabulously wealthy Haniel family. The result was that in 1912 Johannes Müller acquired the run-down Elmau estate, hidden away at the end of a long lane in the mountains between Partenkirchen and Mittenwald, and located barely twenty kilometers to the east of Germany's highest mountain peak. By a fortunate coincidence Johannes Müller had a brother-in-law called Carl Sattler who worked in Munich as an architect. The two men worked together to design and develop an elaborate sanatorium-like retreat in the fashionable Reform Architecture style at the Elmau site. Completed in 1916, financed by Elsa, Countess of Waldersee, this became Schloss Elmau. Max von Baden, a well- connected aristocrat-politician who on at least one occasion described Johannes Müller as his spiritual guide, and who later (briefly) became Chancellor of the German Empire, presided over the opening ceremony. At Elmau, Müller created a \\"Sanctuary of Personal Life\\" (\\"Freistätte persönlichen Lebens\\") where he hoped to be able to help lead \\"people of today\\" (\\"„Menschen von heute\\") along a path the nature of which corresponded to the meaning of Jesus' ethics. Teaching and daily life at Elmau involved a \\"believers' community\\", German folk dance, healthy food, chamber music concerts and the transcending of class and class boundaries.\\"Die Gäste saßen bei den langen Mahlzeiten an großen Tischen, der berühmte Professor neben dem sozialdemokratischen Handwerker, …\\" (\\"the guests sat through long meals at long tables, the famous professor next to the socialist crafstman ...\\"), Friedrich Wilhelm Graf in Protestantische Wellness, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 19–21 April (Ostern) 2014, p 12. The extensive provision of music, in particular, had a powerfully curative effect on guests who came in search not necessarily of theological enlightenment, but hoping to find, from the music and the strikingly beautiful natural surroundings, a measure of relief from the intolerable stresses presented by daily life. Unimaginably destructive war had broken out in July in 1914. Müller talked up the war as \\"Crisis of Healing\\" (\\"Heilkrise\\") which would confront humanity with the bankruptcy of its civilisation and awaken it from vacuousness (\\"aus ihrer Wesenlosigheit\\"). That the Germans stood alone against the whole world, with a superior shared spirituality and in a just cause, demonstrated in his own eyes that Müller was God's preferred device, to lead in the new age, and to resolve the matter of the pacifists through national victory. Müller himself became something of a semi-permanent fixture at Schloss Elmau (which, especially in wartime, was physically cut off from roads and population centres) in a way he never had at Schloss Mainberg. Young women were employed without payment to work as domestic assistants: some found themselves husbands from among the guests. One of Johannes Müller's closest friends was the heir to the Grand Duchy of Baden (and at this time a close friend of Cosima Wagner) Max von Baden, who hoped that Müller might cure his anxiety attacks and help him overcome his perceived emotional isolation. Another intimate was the monarchist-theologian Adolf von Harnack. Schloss Elmau guests also included Maurus Gerner-Beuerle, later a longstanding \\"Domprediger\\" at Bremen, Eivind Berggrav who subsequently became the Bishop of Oslo and the writer Erich Ebermayer. It ws at the recommendation of Adolf von Harnack that in 1917 the Theology Faculty at Berlin University conferred an honorary doctorate on Johannes Müller. War ended in military defeat in 1918 to be followed in rapid succession by the abdication of Wilhelm II, a rash of revolutionary uprisings across the country, the establishment of a new republican government structure, currency collapse and years of economic hardship. Travel was no longer so difficult and Johannes Müller embarked on a succession of lecture tours, including in his itineraries Norway, Sweden, Hungary, the Netherlands and Denmark. He resigned from the Pan-German League in 1919. === Nazi years === The Nazi Party took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Sources differ in their attempts to evaluate and summarise Johannes Müller's attitude to the Nazi régime. Müller said and wrote a lot: quotations from him can be adduced in support of more than one set of conclusions. Until the early 1930s he was able simply to ignore the Nazis. But at the time of the régime change he was impressed by Adolf Hitler. \\"I oppose fascism as a permanent part of the national constitution,\\" he wrote, \\"but not if the hand of destiny sends the nation the gift of a leader\\" (\\"\\"Ich bin gegen den Faschismus als ständige Verfassung, aber nicht als Schicksal und Gnade der Vorsehung, wenn sie der Nation einen Führer schenkt\\"\\"). He was able to see the Nazi power seizure as a triumph for \\"common interest over individual interests\\" (\\"... des Gemeinnutzes über den Eigennutz\\"). On the other hand, he unequivocally condemned the state-sponsored persecution of Jewish citizens as a \\"disgrace to Germany\\" (\\"... Schande für Deutschland\\"), that made him \\"blush in shame\\" (\\"Schamesröte ins Gesicht treibe\\"). The respected commentator Ricarda Huch wrote in outrage that after initially distancing himself from Hitler, Müller had not merely reversed his position but \\"given vent to a full throated Hosanna\\" (\\"brülle aus voller Kehle Hosianna\\"). In a particularly enthusiastic outburst, referencing modern communications technology, he described Hitler as \\"the receptor of God's government and transmitter of the eternal rays\\" (\\"das Empfangsorgan für die Regierung Gottes und Sender der ewigen Strahlen\\"). In his 1934 work \\"Das Deutsche Wunder und die Kirche\\", Müller justified the violent church policies of the Nazis and their (in most respects supportive) German Christian (\\"Deutsche Christen\\") movement allies. He expressly backed church adoption and implementation of an Aryan paragraph. Although he was not directly involved in church politics, Müller was widely seen as \\"a kind of church teacher from the German Christian circle\\" (Georg Merz). In the Autumn/Fall of 1933 he undertook an official visit to Scandinavia in order to promote the Nazi state. The trip was organised by the \\"Staff of the state bishops\\", the Propaganda Ministry and the Foreign Office.Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amtes Akten R65798, R65626 Müller's outspoken rejection of Nazi antisemitism led to him being branded a \\"friend of Jews\\" (\\"Judenfreund\\"), and he became the target of a press smear campaign. According to one source he avoided arrest at this time only because the Bavarian Chancelry convinced the Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels that Müller's principled backing of German Jewry added a moral dimension, otherwise hard to discern among Nazi backers, which could be of benefit in terms of government image-building. From 1934/35 Müller nevertheless became a target of Gestapo surveillance and was subjected to a succession of interrogations. That Scandinavia trip he had undertaken on behalf of the authorities in the Autumn/Fall of 1933 would be the last trip of this nature that Müller undertook. It is also striking that Schloss Elmau never became a holiday destination of choice for the Nazi elite, partly because it could not be construed as antisemitic in character and partly because Müller had banned use of the so-called Hitler greeting. In 1942, three years after the outbreak of another war, Johannes Müller agreed to rent out Schloss Elmau to the army for use as a convalescence establishment for soldiers returning from the front line. This avoided the threat that the estate might be requisitioned for personal use by Göring or Himmler. A year later a demand came through from the commander at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp that Johannes Müller should be arrested \\"for seriously degrading [the national war effort] while pretending to be a respectable citizen\\" (\\"wegen schwerer Zersetzungsarbeit unter dem Deckmantel des Biedermannes\\"). It turned out that Müller had been named by a prisoner under interrogation. However, Johannes Müller was not arrested presumably because his reputation remained sufficiently intact, and probably supported by an intervention from the Interior Minister, Wilhelm Frick (who had himself never even visited Schloss Elmau). === After the war === War ended in May 1945 with the western two thirds of Germany divided into four military occupation zones. Bavaria was occupied by the United States Army. In 1946 Johannes Müller faced a form of trial before Philipp Auerbach, the Bavarian Commissioner on race-based, religious and political persecution. Because of his \\"Eulogising of Hitler in speech and writing\\" (\\"Verherrlichung von Hitler in Wort und Schrift\\") Müller, now over 80, was \\"convicted\\" as a serious war criminal (als \\"Hauptschuldiger\\"). The verdict was contentious because Müller had never been a member of the Nazi Party member and had not been militarily involved which appeared to mean that there was no legal basis for conviction. A related application that Schloss Elmau should be confiscated failed, initially because Elsa Countess of Waldersee, who was still a part owner of it, refused to sell her share. Müller declined to defend himself before the commissioner, but the permanent expropriation of Schloss Elmau was not carried through. Müller did open accepted that he had been in error in his assessment of Hitler and he distanced himself from National Socialism, but in other respects he stood by his \\"teaching\\". Having avoided confiscation during the Nazi period, Schloss Elmau was physically seized in 1945 by the US army. In 1947 it was transferred to a commissioner of the Bavarian government and, at the suggestion of Dr.Henri Heitan, used as a sanatorium/convalescence home for displaced persons and other holocaust survivors till 1951. Meanwhile, Johannes Müller died there on 4 January 1949. After 1951 his heirs recovered possession of the estate. Sources are inconsistent as to whether they successfully sued the Bavarian government in 1951 to recover ownership of the family property, or whether they merely possess it as lease-holders. In any event, Schloss Elmau continues to be managed by Müller's descendants as a \\"Luxury Spa & Cultural Hideaway Hotel\\". == Personal == Johannes Müller was married three times. * The first marriage took place in 1891. The marriage, to Sophie von Römer, was childless and brief, ending in divorce after Sophie met an hotelier whom she subsequently married. * The second marriage took place at Schliersee in 1900. Müller's second wife, Marianne Fiedler, originally from Dresden was a successful artist and lithographer by the time she met Johannes Müller. The marriage produced one son and two daughters. However, Marianne died in February 1904, a week after the birth of her second daughter, \\"Manne\\". * The third marriage, in 1905, also took place at Schliersee, and was to another artist. Irene Sattler, originally from Würzburg, was a sculptor, though family related work took precedence after she married Johannes Müller. Despite being much younger, she was a close personal friend of Marianne Müller's and already knew the older children well when her friend died. The marriage took place despite the opposition of Irene Sattler's father, the artist Ernst Sattler, who viewed Johannes Müller's teaching as \\"deficient Philosophy\\" (als \\"dünne Philosophie\\"). Johannes Müller's third marriage resulted in eight more recorded children - four boys and four girls. Their first child together, Eberhard Müller-Elmau, achieved distinction as a stage actor and producer. == References == Category:19th-century German Protestant theologians Category:20th-century German Protestant theologians Category:People from Riesa Category:Writers from Saxony Category:1864 births Category:1949 deaths ","title":"Johannes Müller (theologian)"},{"id":"56902547","text":"Educational inequality has existed in the Southeast Michigan area of the United States since the birth of institutional, urban schooling in the US. Inequality between lower and higher class districts have perpetuated divisions in educational opportunities and outcomes between Michigan communities, especially areas in and around Detroit, the state's largest city. According to a report by the Kerner Commission from 1967, \\"spending per pupil in Detroit suburbs was 27% greater than in the city and that spending since World War II had risen more in the suburbs than in the city. (Kerner Report 1968, 435).\\" More recently, the economic decline of Detroit culminating in the 2013 Detroit bankruptcy has aggravated the educational tensions. Since it is more common for people of color to be part of the less-affluent communities with fewer educational resources, the phenomenon has also perpetuated opportunity differences between races. The Brown v. Board of Education case of 1954, which banned racial segregation in public schools, did not end this form of educational inequality. The gaps in educational inequality and acquirement negatively affect residents' development into adulthood, specifically when it comes to employment between whites and blacks. According to a study, \\"In 2014, employed adult black men in metropolitan Detroit earned 56% as much as their white counterparts. In 2014, employed African American women earned 75% as much as white women. Racial differences in education account for a share of the racial gap in earnings.\\" == Background: The impact of Detroit's collapse == Previously home to the Ford Motor Industry, Detroit gained recognition as the country's pinnacle of a thriving domestic labor markets. In its peak, between 1900 and 1950, Detroit's population increased exponentially, encouraging healthy economy and overall quality of life. In current times, \\"Detroit ranks seventy-third in median income and dead last in the value of its owner-occupied houses. It is the only city in the nation where single parents head the majority of families. And Detroit is more segregated than any other major metropolitan area,\\" according to the Michigan Historical Review. Being that Detroit was once the bustling capital, the hub of south-eastern Michigan economy, the fall of Detroit meant trouble for surrounding areas. Worsened economy meant compromised spending in school systems, especially those that were already less-funded in comparison to more affluent districts. Scholars explain that, \\"where people live impacts their access to opportunities. Moreover, the geographic distribution of opportunity is particularly important for children because it impacts their schooling experiences.\\" Being that students in poorer communities were those of color, this increased the gap between educational opportunities for white and children of color in Michigan. Black students in particular were left behind when it came to their predominantly African American school. districts. > Detroit’s schools, in the past, enrolled the majority of the state’s African > American children. Those schools were viewed as so under-performing and > poorly run that the state took them over in 1999. Then, in 2008, after many > protested, the schools were returned to local control.

The state paid off those debts in 2016 and funded the > creation of a new locally run school district (Gray 2016). Since 2016, Betsy DeVos proposed a solution which funded privately operated schools, making them more accessible to students rather than attending \\"failing\\" public schools; \\"State-equalized support for all students ended the situation in which funding for a student's instruction was directly linked to the tax base of the student's district.\\" The plan encouraged more residents of color, and residents in general, to attend academically apt schools. == Impacts of race on educational inequality == Detroit became the final destination of many African Americans involved in The Great Migration, most of whom moved into predominantly black neighborhoods; this demographic change in Michigan's population affected the degree of segregation in all aspects, including education. Un-welcomed into white communities, African American families were forced to send their children to lower quality schools within their poorer districts, affecting educational opportunity significantly. In 1974, US Supreme Court case Milliken v. Bradley dealt with educational inequality and the accessibility of education to students of color among 50 school districts in Southeast Michigan. In conjunction with the changes that Brown v. Board of Education implemented in 1954, this court case sought to discuss the organized, segregated bussing by public schools which perpetuated racial inequality in educational systems. The court ruled that schools were, \\"not obligated to desegregate unless it had been proven that the lines were drawn with racist intent on the part of the districts.\\" In short, very little changed since no solution was addressed to combat district segregation, not included in racist segregation but also a major roadblock in terms of educational inequality. State decisions like these influenced educational standards by normalizing segregation and continue to impact education today. ==Education in Southeast Michigan Literacy rates === Detroit public schools have high illiteracy rates and low academic performance compared to cities across the United States; \\"eighth graders scored lowest in math and reading in the nation.\\" According to the National Institute for Literacy, 47% (200,000) of adults in Detroit are functionally illiterate, and half of the 200,000 adults do not have a high school diploma or GED, showing that the lack of these skills learned in an academic setting is generationally embedded into different groups of society. Mark Rosenbaum, a director of Public Counsel Opportunity Under Law, is concerned about the \\"mis-education\\" of America, claiming that the institution of public education constitutes a large range of inequality. Rosenbaum focuses on disadvantaged communities like Detroit, where not only almost half of the population are not functionally literate, but 40.3% also live in poverty. Little government interaction or solutions to this issue adds to the inequality of opportunity faced by public school students in Detroit, who are unable to access the education received by children who live just outside of Detroit in Livonia, Novi, or Ann Arbor. Teacher vacancies, poor heating and cooling infrastructure, and lack of textbooks and materials are environmental features that contribute to the inequality of opportunity that exists in Detroit public schools, relating to low levels of academic achievement. This violates the constitutional rights of attending students. Public counsel and educational policy makers avoid resolving this matter as part of litigation processes, arguing that the state can't be held responsible for illiteracy. === Policy === The state of Michigan passed a law to allow teachers without proper credentials to teach in classrooms; as a result, Detroit public schools have seen an increase in teachers who hold a bachelor's degree, but no certifications related to teaching. Racial and socioeconomic inequalities that have been worsened by educational policy changes in the 21st century are not limited to any one intersection of identities. The Latino community in Detroit has voiced their concerns in response to the impacts of changes made to standardized testing and teacher assessments in public schools. These changes were made by the Obama administration in an attempt to hold schools, teachers, and students more accountable in hope of improving achievement scores. 70% of the students who identify as Latino are also defined as economically disadvantaged, and testing scores in 2012 show rates of less than 30% proficiency in all subjects tested, a common problem in Detroit public schools. Resistance efforts made by the youth of these communities communicate that policy reforms have created the need for more police enforcement, caused overcrowding, and under-resourced classrooms in certain schools, despite their intentions. Protests and walk-outs are some forms of backlash that students have used to demonstrate their frustrations in an attempt to communicate that the policies that may work for communities with different hardships and resources do not work for them. === School funding === In Michigan, Proposal A was approved in 1994. It drastically changed funding method for public education and led to lower property taxes, reducing inequalities in per-pupil funding across local districts.Mark D. Rollandini. Michigan Intermediate School Districts: Funding And Resource Allocation. UMI, ProQuest LLC, 2009, p. 22. However, there are different effects among regions. In the south and west of the state, a greater percentage of local funding was supported by property tax revenues in 1989-90 than 2002-03. In addition, a smaller percentage of the total revenue was supported by the states, while that by deferral sources increased. After Proposal A was passed, less education revenue came from local sources such as local property taxes, while more came from foundation allowances from the state. This change in the sources of revenue consequently leveled the revenue across districts.Michael Van Beek, School Funding In Michigan, Mackinac Center, 2008, p. 1. The number of students in public schools declined because families tried to search for jobs outside of the state just after the Great Recession. This outflow of workers and recession in Michigan decreased tax revenues that financially support the public schools.Michael Van Beek, School Funding In Michigan, Mackinac Center, 2008, p. 5. This downward trend has dramatically changed since 2009, and unemployment rates in Southeastern Michigan have improved from 16% in 2008 to less than 5% in 2017. This economic recovery contributed to an increase in tax revenues, and therefore it enhanced the budget for education in Michigan. === Inequality in funding === In Michigan, the inequality in per- pupil based funding has decreased after Proposal A's passage.Mark D. Rollandini. Michigan Intermediate School Districts: Funding And Resource Allocation. UMI, ProQuest LLC, 2009, p. 23. Before Proposal A was approved, 80% of Michigan school operating funds came from local property taxes. This funding structure was the main cause of unequal funding, because property values differed across local districts. After Proposal A passed, new funding sources such as state income taxes, sales taxes, and education property taxes created another $11 billion annual fund for public school districts, which decreased the disparities in funding across local districts.Michael Van Beek, School Funding In Michigan, Mackinac Center, 2008, p. 12. As a result, the vast majority of schools were funded within a significantly narrower range in 2009. According to the House Fiscal Agency, 80% of all districts (including charter public schools) receive between $7,100 and $7,400 per student through the foundation allowance formula; 94% fell between $7,100 and $8,500 in 2010. However, if the funding per pupil in each district is considered, there is a significant difference in Southeast Michigan districts. The table below shows that the revenue per pupil in Branch was more than three times higher than that of Wayne in 2005-06.Mark D. Rollandini.

According to Michigan Radio (NPR),Michigan Radio lower-end schools receive less funding, less qualified teachers, and worse resources and infrastructure. Furthermore, turnover rates in less fortunate schools remain at an all-time high, with principals reporting the need to replace over 60% of her teachers each year. Thus resulting in either lacking numbers of teachers or less qualified teachers. These inferior educational environments are hindering the children's ability to be properly prepared to succeed in high school and continue on to college. As school districts are determined by geographical borders, the lower quality schools reside in the poorer neighborhoods.(NPR) That being said, research shows that economically integrated schools will improve all children's success, creating greater opportunities to attain a college degree in the future. The Detroit Free PressDetroit Free Press claimed that the college graduation gap for low income students has reached an all-time high. Therefore, less fortunate children who attend schools in worse school districts have less of a chance to graduate college - thus significantly limiting their future opportunities. According to a database of the Detroit Free Press,database various districts in Michigan have a college enrollment rate of 90%, while others have a college enrollment rate of less than 5%. Therefore, of the thousands of children enrolled in less qualified schools, only a handful even enroll in college, with even fewer actually finishing college. As a result, the cycle of poverty and these unfortunate neighborhoods continue. === The Detroit Public Community Schools and the charter system === Detroit Public Community School district is the site of the most significant federal school desegregation cases in U.S. history. The Supreme Court decision essentially reinforced racialized educational opportunities between suburban district's white students and black students in DPS. The Detroit Public Community School District replaced the prior Detroit Public Schools in 2016. Furthermore, Detroit's first school board in seven years was publicly seated in early 2017. Prior to this, the district had been under a plethora of government appointed emergency managers. Moody's investors service released a report in 2018 stating that “the Detroit Public School Community District (DPSCD) could also become a major drag on revitalization beyond downtown. Two years following a state rescue package, the district does not have the ability to address its significant capital needs.” A charter school in Michigan is a state-supported public school operating under a contract issued by an authorizing body. Over half of the students in Detroit attend charter schools, thus, Detroit has the most for- profit charter schools in the nation. In 1994 charter schools first came into Detroit. Charter schools are held to the same standard for core curriculum as other public schools. Furthermore, “Charter school board members are public officials that have sworn a constitutional oath of office in Michigan,” according to the Michigan Department of Education. Charter schools shape the education market that is distinguished by surpassed capacity, policy-enabled choice across districts, and also with a need to fill seats or close instead. The Education Trust-Midwest's 2016 report on Michigan's charter sector states that 70% of Michigan's charters are composed of low-income minority students and they also sit at the bottom hap of the state's ranking. === Socioeconomic status === Research indicates that children from low socioeconomic households and school districts develop academic skills and some life skills more slowly than children from higher socioeconomic groups, examples being language, memory, emotional processing, and even health in adulthood. This idea is also supported by the Summer Learning Gap phenomenon, represented in a graph that shows the achievement gap that grows between high and low income students after years in school. This finding has allowed researchers to make significant connections between schooling and income status: home life during the summer is a large part of educational inequality (family environment), school does not reduce inequality in learning, but also keeps it from growing. Inequalities in school systems that stem from socioeconomic status are shown in Southeastern Michigan, and specifically in Wayne County (Detroit). As of 2016, Detroit's poverty rate was 35.7%, with a median household income of just over $28,000. Wayne County has the highest school dropout rate in Michigan, at 15%, which is also higher than the dropout rate in the United States in general, 13%. In Detroit, “10% of students are classified as homeless and 65% of our students qualified for free and reduced lunch in the 2016-17 school year.” When a student is living in poverty and has to focus on how to meet the most basic needs of life, it is nearly impossible to pay attention in school, let alone achieve high success in their classes. Thus, places with children from lower socioeconomic status homes will be impacted differently in school by standardization methods compared to places with students from wealthier homes. Segregation in the Southeast areas of Michigan is very prevalent is the education system. In the city of Detroit, majority of the residents in the suburb area are predominantly white, while in the actual city majority of the residents are Black. This segregation creates lack of diversity in the schools in this area. Not only does this cause racial differences is these different districts, but also affects the quality of the school itself. Most of the city's wealth lies within the suburb areas in the cities, or the “white” neighborhoods. This allows for the wealthier districts to put more money into their schools, furthering the education of their students while other, less privileged schools get left behind. In the early 2000s Detroit lost at least 25% of their population, basically causing the economic downfall of the city while the “white neighborhoods” were still thriving. This left behind business owners that had no more customers, resulting in failed business and even more abandoned buildings on top of the buildings from people leaving their homes. This is just an example of what's happening in many different areas. == Community outreach programs  Blueprint 2020 === Blueprint 2020 is a Detroit-based initiative focused on helping students to excel in school and have more career options afterward. The initiative has three main goals: access to harder curriculum and accelerated programs, career academies with different programs, and a college-ready student body through common core teachings and SAT prep classes. Their mission statement is to “educate and empower every student, in every community, every day” to build a stronger Detroit. The program also focuses on creating well-rounded students with experience in the arts, athletics, and drama. The Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools Community District who helped create the initiative saw the struggle and gap that was appearing in students with a low socioeconomic background, and created this \\"blueprint\\" to try and make a change to better those students' lives. === New Economy Initiative === Created for the greater Detroit area of Southeast Michigan, the New Economy Initiative (NEI) is a philanthropic program focused on helping and rebuilding the economy of the area by supporting local businesses. Partners which help funding and programming include the Michigan Economic Development Corporation through the state government in Lansing, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and NextEnergy, a Detroit-based environmental organization. Since launching in 2007, the program has provided over $96.2 to small businesses and local entrepreneurs in the metro area. Wayne County, which has significantly benefited from the NEI, has a high level of socioeconomic inequality, with the highest levels of poverty, but also some of the top wealthiest cities, according to some sources. Approximately $12,250 (70% of money given by NEI) has gone to Wayne County, with the hope of creating direct and indirect steady jobs (182 that directly went into the education sector). The average annual income accredited to NEI is $44,000 for each job. There is an achievement gap between low and high income parents, and while the jobs created by NEI are not in the higher brackets of income, the creation of jobs is still significant in increasing average family income. Other scholarly pieces, such as Unequal Childhoods, a book by sociologist Annette Lareau, show the different parenting styles between low- and high-income houses. The hope is that the NEI will help areas of all counties with less economic prosperity to close the existing wealth gap that is apparent is many of the regional public and private schools. However, some reports criticize the initiative because it does not report on the long term health of the businesses it helps start. === Teach For America === Work done by Teach For America in the Detroit area began in 2010. Beyond participating in the classroom, it has also been involved with community based learning events for inner-city students in the metro area, including an equestrian program for teaching students about horseback riding and horse care, book donations on Africa-American culture, and advocating for Latino students. The Detroit headquarters' website lists the average teacher's annual take-home salary, which was about $17,500 as of 2018, and the master's degree requirements to be a teacher in the program. The program is concerned that 81% of children from low income families do not graduate college by age 25. While this program, and many others, have worked to lessen inequality in the region, inequality is still evident in figures from funding, achievement scores, and social mobility. == Social mobility == According to the Equality of Opportunity Project, “Children's prospects of earning more than their parents have fallen from 90% to 50% over the past half century.” It is becoming increasingly difficult for children to earn more than their parents. Each additional year corresponds to a 1% decline in the number of American children who earn more than their parents. Therefore, if the level of education affects earning rates, children need to attain higher levels of education than their parents to earn similar to greater salaries than them. Proficiency exam scores in Detroit public schools are extremely low in comparison to the rest of the county, as well as to adjacent counties. The lack of education in these areas lowers the chances of future success for local students. According to The RedPin, to achieve the \\"American Dream\\", one needs to make an income of around $42,000. People obtaining less education than an associate degree have little chance of attaining the American Dream. This differs when gender comes into play. The median income for men with associate degrees is $43,871, while women with associate degrees make substantially less at $27,122. These statistics reveal the severity of the gender inequality and pay gap that exist in the US. They also show that only men, and not women, with an associate degree, meet the margin for earning enough income to live the American Dream. At the next education level are surprising results. The median income for men with a bachelor's degree is $60,933, and only $40,003 for women with a bachelor's degree. Men with a bachelor's degree are able to attain the American Dream, while women with the same level of education fail to reach that income threshold. Inferring from this information, the average working woman in the United States needs to attain a higher level of education than a bachelor's degree, while the average working man only has to attain an associate degree to reach the American Dream. In pockets within Southeast Michigan, high school graduation rates fluctuate between 78% and 96%. The highest high school dropout rates occur in the Detroit Public Schools Community District, and the lowest occur in Rochester Community Schools. The median household income for families living in the district of Rochester Community Schools is $80,806, while the median household income for families living in the Detroit Public Schools district is $26,127. The areas in Southeast Michigan with high median household incomes correspond to more high school graduates. ==See also== * Educational inequality in the United States == References == Category:Education in Michigan ","title":"Educational inequality in Southeast Michigan"},{"id":"56902555","text":"The cast of the television series MythBusters perform experiments to verify or debunk urban legends, old wives' tales, and the like.

Most were domestic novels or short-story volumes, often historical in nature and set abroad.Frances Mary Peard – The Orlando Project: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present – Cambridge University Press ==Background== Born in Exminster in Devon, the daughter of Commander George Shuldham Peard (1793–1837), a naval officer who went to the Arctic regions in search of Sir John Franklin, and Frances Cooke (née Ellicombe, 1805–1895), she was one of five siblings, of whom two died young. Her grandfather was Shuldham Peard and her uncle was John Whitehead Peard. Her older brother George Shuldham Peard (1829–1918) was a veteran of the Crimean War and likewise an author. With so many distinguished soldiers and sailors in her family it is not surprising that military themes and battles frequently appear in her stories. It appears that she was widely travelled, perhaps venturing as far as India, but in later life she lived in Torquay in Devon with her mother.John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction, Routledge (Second edition, 2009), p. 501. ==Fiction== Frances Peard wrote children's books for both boys and girls and fiction for adults, all drawing on her travels abroad, especially in France and India. Her fiction for adults includes Unawares (1870); The Rose-Garden (1872); Thorpe Regis (1874); Cartouche (1878); Schloss and Town (1882); The Asheldon School- Room (1883); Prentice Hugh (1887); The Blue Dragon; The Interloper; The Abbot's Bridge; Donna Teresa (1899) and Number One and Number Two (1900). Her novel The Ring from Jaipur (1904) is rather more sober than its title, which suggests jewels and Far Eastern promise.

Yoshinari Saito provides the character designs. The series' music is composed by Go Shiina and produced by Lantis. Genco is producing the series. The opening theme song is \\"Highlight\\" by Ayaka Ōhashi, and the ending theme song is \\"KI-te MI-te HIT PARADE!\\" by Himika Akaneya, Rie Takahashi, Nao Tōyama, Yū Serizawa, Suzuko Mimori, and Rina Hidaka under their character names. The second opening theme song is \\"Open the Worlds\\" by ORESAMA, and the second ending theme song is \\"Pearly×Party\\" by the voice actress unit Pearly Fairy. ===Appearances in other media=== Million Arthur appeared in the 2015 role-playing game Megadimension Neptunia VII as a DLC character. But the character was removed from the Steam version of the game in January 2020. Thief (Tōzoku) Arthur appears as a guest DLC character in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. In return, Iori Yagami from The King of Fighters series, who is both under his Miss X disguise and also a DLC in Heroines, appears as a guest character in Arcana Blood. ==ReferencesCategory:2012 video games Category:2014 video games Category:2015 anime ONAs Category:2017 video games Category:2018 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Esports games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Gangan Comics manga Category:HTC Vive games Category:IOS games Category:Mass media franchises Category:Monarchy in fiction Category:Multiplayer video games Category:PlayStation VR games Category:Role- playing video games Category:Seinen manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Square Enix franchises Category:Square Enix games Category:Square Enix manga Category:Taito games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video game franchises Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2012 Category:Video games related to anime and manga Category:Yonkoma ","title":"Million Arthur"},{"id":"56902587","text":"Katok 'B', also known as Mata-Mata Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme () or the abbreviated Malay name STKRJ Mata-Mata, is a public housing estate on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei-Muara District, Brunei. It is officially designated as three villages, the third- and lowest- level subdivisions of Brunei. Katok 'B' is one of the estates in the country under the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (), a public housing programme. == Name == The full Malay name for Katok 'B' is , whereby \\"\\" (commonly abbreviated as STKRJ) is often translated as \\"Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme\\". The estate is named after the original villages of Katok and Mata-Mata. \\"Katok 'B'\\" was initially the name for the first phase of the STKRJ housing estate developed in the area, in which it was then part of Katok. It is now known as Area 1 of STKRJ Mata-Mata, a village subdivision and separated from the latter. However, STKRJ Mata-Mata initially referred to the STKRJ estate in Mata-Mata; the latter usage is now uncommon ever since it is administered as part of the Perpindahan Mata-Mata village. \\"STKRJ Mata-Mata\\" now refers to the Katok 'B' housing estate instead. == Geography == Katok 'B' is located in the central part of Brunei-Muara District and in the western part on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei. It is contiguous with, and officially borders, Perpindahan Mata-Mata of the Mata- Mata settlement to the east. Although Katok 'B' is named after Katok, they are not contiguous but nevertheless located in their vicinity. == Administration == The area of Katok 'B' is divided into three villages ( or ), the third- and lowest-level administrative divisions of Brunei. They are consequently among the village subdivisions under Gadong 'B', a mukim (subdistrict) of Brunei- Muara. As a village, it thus has a village head () as the leader of respective community. Each village is also a designated postcode area and therefore has its own postcode. {  +Village subdivisions of Katok 'B' !Name !Postcode - STKRJ Mata-Mata Area 1 BE4119 - STKRJ Mata-Mata Area 2 BE4319 - STKRJ Mata-Mata Area 3 BE4519 } == Education == Katok 'B' is home to Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha Girls' Arabic Religious Secondary School, a girls' government school which provides secondary level of the public Islamic religious education which are taught in Arabic. It is one of the few Arabic religious schools in the country. It is also home to Katok Secondary School, also a government school but provides general secondary education for the residents of Katok 'B' and the neighbouring settlements.

Red arrow indicates spreading direction. Propagating rifts are seafloor features associated with spreading centers at mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basins. They are more commonly observed on faster rate spreading centers (50 mm/year or more). These features are formed by the lengthening of one spreading segment at the expense of an offset neighboring spreading segment. Hence, these are remnant features produced by migration of the tip of a spreading center. In other words, as the tip of a spreading center migrates or grows, the plate itself grows at the expense of the shrinking plate, transferring lithosphere from the shrinking plate to the growing plate. ==Terminology== Many other terms that have been used interchangeably with \\"propagating rift\\", including propagating ridges, ridge relocation, migrating ridges, propagators, rise jumps and ridge jumps. While they all refer to the same features, \\"ridge jumps\\" and \\"rise jumps\\" are sometimes used to refer to discontinuous or discrete propagations of a spreading center, which are most commonly observed at slow-spreading ridges as heat required to cause ridge jumps increases with spreading rate and age of seafloor. ==Formation== Propagating rifts are formed as a result of a change in plate motions, incremental jumps of the tip of a spreading center across a transform fault or, in most cases, from the migration of overlapping spreading centers (OSCs) along the crest of a mid-ocean ridge. The mechanism for propagation has been attributed to a few different hypotheses: #The hypothesis of fracture mechanics describes that a high concentration of stress at the tip of a ridge can cause progressive failure of the lithosphere, allowing cracks to propagate. Excess gravitational stresses due to these shallow ridges can further enhance the growth of ridges as the primary driving mechanism. In other words, ridge segment propagation rate is proportional to the axial crustal thickness. Thicker oceanic crust can cause higher gravitational stress, hence higher driving force of propagation. #When there is a significant bathymetric gradient, the associated gravitational gradient can be an important mechanism. Altimetry data depicts the proportionality between bathymetric gradient and propagation rate. Spreading centers with an axial high tend to have higher propagation rates due to less lithospheric resistance from younger, weaker lithosphere. Altimetry data also demonstrates the potential correlation between bathymetric gradient and direction of propagation. #Ridge-hotspot interaction causes weakening of lithosphere allowing new rifts to form as magma upwells. #In terms of crack length, rift tips with longer cracks possess a higher propagation driving force due to stronger far-field extensional forces, which leads to the idea that longer segments always grow at the expense of shorter segments. #In the case of spreading ridges in the back-arc basin, propagation has been thought to be controlled by the volcanic arc. Rifts seem to propagate towards the direction of volcanic arc. ==Identification== Magnetic anomalies (color) off west coast of North America.Dashed lines are spreading centers. Thin cross lines mark pseudo faults, which are features created by propagating rifts.\\"V\\" shaped patterns of oblique 'pseudofaults' on both side of the growing ridges are a distinct feature of propagating rifts. This seafloor feature, left in the wake of the segment migration, appears to be offset by an apparent fault in the oceanic crust. However, the offsets are only superficial seafloor features rather than true fault zones; hence the term 'pseudofaults'. In some circumstances when the spreading rate is low, morphological depressions can be observed along the 'pseudofaults' and shear zones, creating a distinct a bathymetric signature of propagating rifts. Besides that, formation of \\"V\\" shape 'pseudofaults' also leads to the \\"V\\" patterns of magnetic anomaly and age discontinuities across the seafloor.Bathymetric signatures of propagating rifts observed at the East Pacific Rise and Galapagos Spreading Center. Yellow-dashed lines indicate morphological depressions created in the wake of propagating rifts. ==Geometry Models== Two sets of geometry had been used to described the types of propagating rifts: The first set is based on the morphology of the growing segment of propagating rifts. Under this geometry model, two types of propagating rifts were described: (1) Median Valley Ridge Propagation (2) Axial High Ridge Propagation. The difference in morphology of the growing rifts is a result of difference in propagating rate. Propagating rifts with a propagating rate that is approximately 25% of the spreading rate would have a \\"median valley\\" morphology at its growing segment which is dominated by a relative low along the axis of the ridge. On the other hand, propagating rifts with a propagating rate that is >50% of the spreading rate would have an \\"axial high\\" morphology, dominated by a relative high, pronounced ridge axis. The second geometry set is based on the propagation style of the rifts. Under this geometry model, three types of propagating rifts were described: (1) Discontinuous (2) Continuous (3) Broad Transform- zone. \\"Discontinuous\\" is used to described propagating rifts with discrete propagation motion (or ridge jumps). \\"Continuous\\" is used to described propagating rifts with steady propagation. \\"Broad Transform-zone\\" is used to described propagating rifts with broad shear zone instead of a transform fault as boundary with the neighboring spreading segment. ==Hotspot-ridge interaction as a mechanism of propagating rifts== Hotspot-ridge interaction is one of the mechanisms of propagating rifts. Some of the interactions that can lead to ridge relocation includes lithospheric tension and thermal thinning, as well as magma penetration caused by hot convecting magma beneath the lithosphere, which further leads to the weakening of lithosphere. Hotspot ridge interactions can be observed in two ways: interactions between propagating rifts and a fixed hotspot or a migrating hotspot. #Interaction with a fixed hotspot is described as fixed hotspot magma penetration. Under this scenario, off-axis lithosphere is weakened by a hotspot near a spreading ridge. Upwelling of magma at the weakened off-axis lithosphere causes development of divergence. Dominance of upwelling at the new rift causes sharp decrease in spreading rate of the old spreading axis and sharp increase in spreading rate of the new rift. As the old spreading center ceases, the new rift forms the new spreading center. #Interaction with a migrating hotspot is described as a migrating hotspot intrusion zone. Under this scenario, a hotspot (with high heating rate) nearing a spreading center causes asymmetrical lithospheric thinning over a broad region, which further leads to formation of new rifts. Upwelling of hot mantle at the new rifts causes ridge jump. After ridge jump, the new spreading center and hotspot migrate together. Depending on how fast the hotspot and spreading center migrate, the hotspot would eventually be separated from the spreading center. Impact of ridge jump is proportional to the heating rate of hotspot. ==Discovery of Propagating Rifts== They were first noted in the 1970s on the Juan De Fuca ridge (spreading center) off northwestern North America where marine magnetic anomalies created during seafloor spreading show offsets not parallel to plate motion directions indicated by the trends of transform faults. They were soon found in other locations including the Galapagos Spreading Center and East Pacific Rise, and are now known to be ubiquitous on fast and intermediate spreading rate ridges. == See also == * * == References == Category:Oceanic ridges ","title":"Propagating rifts"},{"id":"56902800","text":"The Chinese Taipei national under-18 and under-19 basketball team is a national basketball team of Chinese Taipei, administered by the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association.Profile - Chinese Taipei, FIBA.com, Retrieved 13 January 2018.

He was born in November 1910 as the third son of William and Elizabeth Richards (his father was a railway foreman) in Ffair-fach, Llandeilo, Carms. Grafton Richard married and had a son and daughter. He was educated at Neath grammar school and went onto achieve a first-class (1:1) Honours degree in Welsh from Swansea University College, starting in 1928 and finishing in 1931. In 1933, he gained a research M.A. with distinction. Following on from that, he was elected into a University Fellowship in 1934 which enabled him to continue his studies in Dublin with the scholars, Osborn Bergin, Myles Dillon and Gerald Murphy, as well as in Paris with Joseph Vendryes, Antoine Meillet and Émile Benveniste. In October 1936, he was given the position of Research Assistant Lecturer in Welsh at Swansea University and later became Assistant Lecturer in April 1937. Melville Richards published his work in academic journals on the Syntax of the sentence in Medieval Welsh and revealed his ability early in his career as he was one of a number of language scholars that were associated with Henry Lewis. In his life, he served in the army, primarily in intelligence, between the years 1939-1945. He used his experiences at war to write his only novel Y gelyn mewnol in 1946, it was an espionage story set in West Wales. After his time in the army came to an end, he returned to Swansea (where he stayed until 1947) which was where he was appointed Lecturer, the Reader and Head of Celtic Studies Department in Liverpool University. From there, he was elected to the Chair of Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor in 1965. He gained a PhD from Liverpool 1965. Grafton Melville Richard's first area of interest in his research were Celtic studies and Welsh syntax. In his early research, he published Llawlyfr Hen Wyddeleg in 1935 which was a handbook based on Rudolf Thurneysen's magisterial 'Grammar of Old Irish'. In 1938, he published Cystrawen y Frawddeg Gymraeg which is a clear guide to the syntax of the sentence in modern Welsh. However, it has been unfavorably reviewed by T. J. Morgan in Y Llenor. His area of research started changing in the early 1950s as he started to publish work on Welsh place-names and onomastics which led onto be his primary academic interest. He single-handedly produced an historical archive of place-names in Wales and made clear of their meaning and significance in a comprehensive Welsh onomasticon. His research was conducted in a range of fields of study which are: settlement patterns and demography, the history of governance and administration, legal custom and structures, toponyms as well as the more strictly linguistic area. He published several other documentations, books and academic articles such as, a medieval Welsh law book, another law book, Jesus College LVII (1957), The Laws of Hywel Dda (1954), Welsh Administrative and Territorial Units (1969) as well as editing an English and Welsh an Atlas of Anglesey in 1972. Not only did these important articles explain the significance of place-names, they lay out the methodology and scholarly standards in a hazardous area of academic study. Some of his research and work brought him international recognition. For example, 'his contributions to the Batsford The names of towns and cities in Britain (1970), as a member of the council of the English Place-Name Society, a member of the International Committee on Onomastic Sciences and chairman of the Council for Name Studies of Great Britain and Ireland...' Melville Richard planned to publish volumes but did not succeed, yet his archive of 300,000 slips have been edited and is available online (transcribed in English and Welsh). Around 1970, his health deteriorated. He died at home in Benllech, Anglesey on 3 November 1973. His funeral service was held in Colwyn Bay Crematorium on 8 November. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Welsh scholars and academics ","title":"Grafton Melville Richards"},{"id":"56902965","text":"Ladislav Hexner was a male Yugoslav international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won a silver medal at the 1939 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Žarko Dolinar, Adolf Herskovic, Tibor Harangozo and Max Marinko for Yugoslavia. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Yugoslav table tennis players Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"Ladislav Hexner"},{"id":"56902984","text":"Ka-Man Tse is a photographer, video artist, and educator based in New York. Influenced by her identity as a Chinese-American lesbian, Tse primarily uses portraiture to tell stories about the people, identity, visibility, and place in and around the queer community. == Early life == Born in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Tse moved to the U.S. where she and her family worked in Schenectady, New York in Chinese restaurants. During the 1980s and 1990s, Tse made regular road trips to Chinatown, New York which served as a surrogate for her birthplace. Her relationship with these three cities - New York City, Schenectady, and Hong Kong - is an ongoing investigation in her work. == Education == In 2003 Tse received her B.A. in Photography from Bard College and in 2009 went on to receive an M.F.A. in Photography from Yale University. == Art == Ka-Man Tse's work deals with visibility and representation through photography and film. She strives to locate points of intersection between LGBT and Asian and Pacific Islander communities. She mainly works with a large format view camera to take photographs that examine what is shared and negotiated between these two seemingly distant communities === Portraits and Narratives of LGBTQ Asians and Asian Americans === In 2014 she received the Robert Giard Fellowship grant for her project, Portraits and Narratives of LGBTQ Asians and Asian Americans. The artist describes this body of work as an examination of community and human agency through photographs, both staged and organic, of her subjects in public spaces. Tse mixes personal memories, obsessions, stories and portraiture in order to conceptualize queer narratives and photograph them while they unfold in public space. === Narrow Distances === Ka Man-Tse's solo show, Narrow Distances, featured a series of photographs taken in Hong-Kong, and aimed to rework the world out of a desire to see it re-imagined with the queer narrative in mind. Tse used placement, foregrounding and the connection with her subjects, to recast the social landscape of Hong-Kong. The title of the show is an allusion to the over- populated streets of the city as well as the space between Asian and LGBT communities. The show features intimate portraits of queer Chinese city-goers set against a backdrop of the Hong-Kong landscape. The subjects and setting work harmoniously together to create poetic images that confront issues of identity and representation. The show was held at Lumenvisum gallery in 2016 and was the artist's first solo exhibition in Hong Kong. === In Search of Miss Ruthless === Ka-Man Tse's photographs have been featured in the group show, In Search of Miss Ruthless, which examined the history of beauty pageants in Asia. Curated by Hera Chan and David Xu Borgonjon, the show was based on Canadian artist group, General Idea’s project titled,The 1971 Miss General Idea Pageant. In Search of Miss Ruthless, features two of Ka-Man Tse's photographs which were met with critical acclaim. The first photo featured in the show is titled Embrace (2015), and features a group of Asian-Pacific Islander women locked in an emotional hug after the conclusion of a beauty pageant in New York. The women wear expressions ranging from joy to relief as they frantically cling to one another in an overtly emotional and extravagant embrace, speaking to the forced, enhanced smiles and personas of beauty pageant contestants. The second photo included, Untitled, is a photograph of Rye Bautista, otherwise known as La Chiquitta, one of Hong-Kong's preeminent drag queens, alone on a rooftop in Hong-Kong. The subject is seen slumped on the ground, wig-less, barefoot and smoking a cigarette. His gaze looks off past the photographer and into the night sky. His heavily made up face starkly contrasts with the baldness of his head and the undone nonchalance in his posture. Here, Ka-Man Tse captures La Chiquitta behind the scenes, taking a break, bringing a sense of normalcy to the highly exaggerated persona drag queens adopt. Ka-Man Tse actively includes an Asian drag queen in a group show about beauty pageants, starting a conversations about similarities between the two worlds and contributing to her larger goal of increasing visibility of the LGBT community. Tse has exhibited solo shows in the United States and Hong Kong. == Teaching == Ka-Man Tse has taught photography at Cooper Union, The City College of New York, and at the Yale University School of Art. Tse is currently an Assistant Professor of Photography at Parsons School of Design. == Selected exhibitions == 2018: WMA Masters Exhibition, Transition, WYNG Foundation, Hong Kong 2018: Queering Space, Alfred University; Alfred, NY 2018: Aperture Portfolio Prize 2018: narrow distances, Eaton Workshop, Eaton Hotel HK 2017: In Search of Miss Ruthless, Para Site, Hong Kong 2017: A World Where We Belong, The Georgia Brooks LGBTQIA Exhibition, Hudson County Community College, Jersey City, NJ 2016: Narrow Distances, Lumenvisum, Kowloon, Hong Kong 2015 Expanded Geographies, Lianzhou Foto Festival, Guangzhou, China 2015 Personalities: Fantasy and Identity in Photography and New Media, Palm Springs Art Museum, Palm Springs, CA 2014: Our Portraits, Our Families, Museum of Chinese in America, New York, NY 2013: Bronx Calling: The Second AIM Biennial, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx, NY 2012: America Through a Chinese Lens, Museum of Chinese in America, New York, NY == Selected Awards and Residencies == 2019: Artist in Residence, Light Work, Syracuse, NY 2018: Aperture Portfolio Prize 2018: WMA Masters Finalist, WYNG Foundation, Hong Kong 2017: Yale University Fund for Lesbian and Gay Studies (FLAGS) Research Award, New Haven, CT 2015: Silver Eye Center for Photography Fellowship 2015: John Gutmann Photography Fellowship Nominee 2014: Robert Giard Foundation Fellowship 2013: Artist in the Marketplace Program, The Bronx Museum of the Arts 2012: Seniors Partnering with Artists Citywide Residency (SPARC), Queens Council of the Arts, Flushing, NY == Publications and Exhibition Catalogues == 2018: Aperture Magazine, Family, Issue 233 2018: Nueva Luz, The Queer Issue, Volume 22:2 2018: narrow distances, Candor Arts, IL 2018: Chinatown: Lens on the Lower East Side, Lower East Side Preservation Initiative, New York, NY (forthcoming) 2018: WMA Masters, Transition, WYNG Foundation, Hong Kong 2017: GR-09022017, Fotogalleriet, Oslo, Norway 2017: Papersafe Magazine 2016: NEWSPAPER, Vol. V, No. 1 2016: New Genealogies, Yale University School of Art, New Haven, CT 2014: Our Portraits, Our Families.

He worked as a copy-holder for a printer, but learnt shorthand in his spare time, and this enabled him to find work as a journalist with the Birmingham News. A friend of his manager was involved in the Amalgamated Engineering and Stores Association, and in 1907, when its conference was held in Birmingham, he asked Smith to take the minutes. The union remembered his service, and from 1910 he took the minutes at each meeting of the executive. He took on an increasing amount of the general secretary's work himself, and in 1914 he left the News to take this full-time role. In 1915, Smith took the union into a merger which formed the Post Office Engineering Union (POEU). He was noted for his skills in administration and negotiation, and achieved agreements on subsistence payments and job security which endured for many years. He retired in 1938, moving to Ramsgate, where he died in 1965.

Since 1970 he worked as an illustrator. After reading the works of Yoshiharu Tsuge, he decided to switch to comic books. Hanawa's first work as a cartoonist was in 1971 with the short story \\"Kan no Mushi\\" () about a boy whose mother sends him to a sadistic acupuncturist, in the alternative manga magazine Garo where he mainly worked in his career to follow. From 1992 to 1994 he drew the manga series Tensui () for Afternoon magazine, which achieved a much higher circulation than Garo and similar underground publications. Through his work for Afternoon and other mainstream magazines such as Manga Action and Super Action, he became known to a wider audience. Since 1998, Hanawa has been working for AX, the successor of Garo. In December 1994, he was arrested for illegally possessing modified model weapons and sentenced to three years in prison. Afterwards, he worked on the manga , recalling his detention, for which he was nominated for the 2001 Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize. This autobiographical work became a bestseller and received a film adaptation in 2002 under the direction of Yoichi Sai. Masanao Amano describes how the \\"outstanding realism\\" of the work is almost overwhelming to the reader: \\"Due to the documentary-like style without any sense of desire and political message [the reader] is completely sucked into the work.\\" Hanawa is sometimes considered the successor to Yoshiharu Tsuge. At the beginning of his career, he dedicated himself to the ero-guro style and created erotic-grotesque works like Akai Yoru (), about a samurai who rejects his thoughts of revenge and is driven to suicide by his wife, and Niku Yashiki (). Many of these works were parodies of militarism and the traditional values of Japanese culture. From the beginning of the 1980s, his manga were spiritually influenced by Buddhism and were located mainly in the Japan of the Edo and the Meiji periods and in a futuristic setting. The faces of his characters are reminiscent of Ukiyo-e; his drawings are detailed and dark. His work has been translated into English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian. ==References *花輪和一先生の情報願いま～す！ - 非公式情報Twitterアカウント *花輪大明神 へそひかり - 非公式ファンサイト（現在は更新されていない） *花輪和一インタビュー - ガロ 1992年5月号 *花輪和一「因果的表現の第一人者」 - 山田視覚芸術研究室 Category:Living people Category:Manga artists from Saitama Prefecture Category:1947 births ","title":"Kazuichi Hanawa"},{"id":"56903128","text":"Gemma Romanyà i Valls (29 September 1945 - 5 March 2018Mor als 72 anys l’empresària i mecenes capelladina Gemma Romanyà ), was a Spanish Catalan businesswoman and graphic arts patron.

The retroreflector (mirrors) send the pulse straight back to the originating telescope where the round trip time—and therefore the exact distance—is recorded. The reflector arrays are designed to allow more accurate measurements from Earth that will increase lunar mapping accuracy, will test principles of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and other theories of gravity. Researchers think these studies may also help understand the nature of dark energy. MoonLIGHT is a laser reflecting array to be deployed near the lunar south pole region. It was developed as a collaboration primarily between the University of Maryland and the Italian National Laboratories of Frascati. Additional partners and collaborators include the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory of ASI, the University of Hannover (Germany), and the Czech Technical University (Czech Republic).

The reflector was planned to be a secondary payload on the MX-1E lunar lander built by Moon Express, which was planned to be launched in 2020 with an Electron rocket. An unrelated planned science payload on the same lander was the International Lunar Observatory. The MX-1E lander was planned to land on the Malapert Mountain, a 5 km tall peak in the Aitken Basin region that has an uninterrupted direct line of sight to Earth. The launch contract between Moon Express and Rocket Lab (manufacturer of Electron) was canceled sometime before February 2020. Moon Express does not, as of February 2020, anymore plan to launch MX-1E on an Electron rocket, thus leaving MX-1E and all its science payloads without a carrier rocket. This leaves the fate of the science payloads hanging in the air. This experiment will complement and advance the retroreflector experiments begun with Apollo 11 in 1969.

He is best known as lead vocalist for hard rock band Kik Tracee. He is a solo artist as well as lead vocalist and co-founder of alternative rock band Zen From Mars which includes members of Bang Tango, Enuff Z'Nuff, Flipp, and Fear Factory. == Career  Kik Tracee === Shortly after moving to Los Angeles in 1987, Shareaux formed the hard rock band Kik Tracee with L.A. bassist Rob Grad, guitarist Gregory \\"Hex\\" Offers, guitarist Michael Marquis, and drummer Scott Donnell (Later replaced by Johnny Douglas). The group were signed to RCA Records and initially managed by Sharon Osbourne until Slaughter bassist Dana Strum persuaded the band to seek elsewhere for representation; Strum would then go on to produce their debut record No Rules. The music video for the track Don't Need Rules had moderate rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and the single You're So Strange, which also had a music video, peaked at No. 46 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1991. The band's follow up, the Chris Goss produced EP Field Trip, was released in 1992. Kik Tracee's marketing team treated almost the entire New York staff of RCA, the band's label, to a real life field trip to present the marketing plan for the album. A video was then released for the single In Trance. Also in 1992, Shareaux was named a top contender to replace Vince Neil in Mötley Crüe; Shareaux turned down the offer to join, and John Corabi ultimately got the gig. In 1993 the band began work on its second full-length release, Center of a Tension, with producer Garth Richardson. The band would end up falling apart at this point resulting in the album never making it past the pre-production stage. In 2017, Kik Tracee signed with EMP Label Group to release a 2-disc demos and b-sides album titled Big Western Sky. === Post Kik Tracee === Still having to deliver an album to RCA after the break of up Kik Tracee, Shareaux then teamed up with guitarist/singer Brynn Arens to write together; Shareaux parted ways and Arens carried on to form Flipp. Following Kik Tracee's break up, Shareaux would resurface in Revel 8 as well as Nectar, which featured Rik Schaffer of Tomorrow's Child and Engines of Aggression. As shown in the VH1 documentary The Rise of Velvet Revolver, in 2002 Shareaux had auditioned for the lead singer position in The Project; which would end up becoming Velvet Revolver. The position eventually went to Scott Weiland. Shareaux's debut solo album Golden was released in November 2013. The album was produced by Bernie Larsen and features a guest appearance by Small Faces and Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, who performs on the track R&R.; The single Stay was released along with a music video which was directed by Kii Arens. In 2016, Shareaux had been chosen to audition in person for the then vacant frontman position in Stone Temple Pilots. Jeff Gutt would end up getting the gig. === Zen From Mars === In 2015, Shareaux began performing acoustic shows with Bang Tango guitarist Drew Fortier for which Kik Tracee material was performed live for the first time since the band's break up in 1993. This eventually led to the duo forming alternative rock band Zen From Mars along with bassist Chip Z'Nuff, drummer Mike Heller, guitarist Brynn Arens, and pianist Kate Catalina. The band released an early version of their track New Leaf in 2016 which was mixed by Matt Wallace. Their debut album The Ultra Head Frequency is currently being mixed and mastered for a 2018 release. === Other works === In 2005 Shareaux landed a role as Jimmy the Mod in the stage musical of The Who's Quadrophenia. Shareaux also performs in The Who Generation, which is a The Who tribute band that have been featured on AXS TV's World's Greatest Tribute Bands. == Legacy and accolades == Kik Tracee's debut album No Rules appeared at No. 46 on Rolling Stone's Top 50 Greatest Hair Metal Albums of All Time list. Kik Tracee landed at No. 78 for VH1's Hair Metal 100 Countdown list which ranked the greatest 80's hair metal bands of all time. == Discography  Kik Tracee === * No Rules (RCA, 1991) * Field Trip (RCA, 1992) * Center of a Tension (unreleased, 1993) * Big Western Sky (EMP Label Group, 2017) === Nectar === * Afterglow (Dream Cirlcle, 1997) === Zen From Mars === * The Ultra Head Frequency (TBA) === Solo === * Golden (2013) == References  External links == * * Category:21st-century American singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American rock songwriters Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American singers Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:Songwriters from California Category:1965 births Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Stephen Shareaux"},{"id":"56903270","text":"The Republican Guard (, or GR), also called the Presidential Guard (, or PR), is nominally part of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) but is directly subordinated to the President of the Central African Republic, for whom it provides security. ==History== During the leadership of President François Bozizé the guard largely consisted of members of his same tribe, \\"patriots\\" who helped him seize power during the 2003 Central African Republic coup d'état, and was estimated to number some 800 men.Central African Republic Army.

His community was based primarily around Los Vermajales, and as a result the English called his group of Maroons the Karmahaly Maroons. It is likely that his Maroons are descended from escaped African slaves and Taino men and women.Agorsah, E. Kofi, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180–1. ==Fighting for the Spanish== When the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655 Invasion of Jamaica, the latter freed their slaves, who then escaped into the forested mountains of the interior, and established independent free black communities. These groups fought on the side of the Spanish in their attempts to recapture Jamaica from the English. When one group, led by Juan de Bolas, switched sides and joined the English, the Spanish gave up on their attempts to recapture the island.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-17. In contrast to de Bolas, de Serras and his men stayed loyal to the Spanish, and refused to come to terms with the English. Based in the mountains of central Jamaica, de Serras and his men mounted a number of attacks on English settlements, burning plantations and houses, as well as killing English soldiers and settlers. The English used de Bolas and his men to attack de Serras and his Maroon community. In 1664, Maroons belonging to de Serras ambushed and killed de Bolas. Eventually, the black militia belonging to de Bolas faded from historical records, while the Maroons of de Serras continued to trouble the English.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 17-25. ==Guerrilla war against the English== After 1664, de Serras and his Maroons continued to mount attacks on English settlements, such as the capital, Spanish Town, where they burnt houses, captured food and livestock, and freed slaves. The community of de Serras acted as a magnet for slaves seeking to run away from English owners.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 20-27. The first English governor of the Colony of Jamaica, Edward D'Oyley, was unable to defeat de Serras, and the job of taking on the Karmahaly Maroons fell to Thomas Modyford, who became governor in 1664. The following year, Modyford declared war on the Karmahaly Maroons, and offered rewards for capturing and killing members of de Serras' group.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 25-27. In the mid-1660s, de Serras sent one of his Maroon warriors, Domingo, to discuss peace overtures. Modyford accepted Domingo, because he believed that while the English could not defeat the Maroons, he felt they could absorb them into society the way D'Oyley did with de Bolas. However, de Serras used the lull in the fighting to relocate to a more secure environment, probably the Blue Mountains in eastern Jamaica, from which they soon resumed attacks on the English colonial authorities.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 28-32. In the 1670s, the former buccaneer Henry Morgan, who later became lieutenant- governor of Jamaica, and owner of a slave plantation in Guanaboa Vale, led a campaign against de Serras and the Karmahaly Maroons. Morgan was unable to rout the Maroons, but following that encounter the colonial authorities no longer filed reports about de Serras and the Karmahaly Maroons.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 32-35. ==Legacy== It is possible that de Serras and the Karmahaly Maroons withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, which were inaccessible to the English colonial authorities, where they lived off the land and avoided further contact with white planters.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 32-35. The Karmahaly Maroons may have been the ancestors of the 18th century Windward Maroons of Moore Town and Crawford's Town. == References == Category:Jamaican Maroons Category:Jamaican Maroon leaders Category:History of the Colony of Jamaica Category:Jamaican rebel slaves Category:17th-century Jamaican people ","title":"Juan de Serras"},{"id":"56903413","text":"The southern Titiwangsa bent-toed gecko (Cyrtodactylus australotitiwangsaensis) is a species of gecko endemic to peninsular Malaysia. ==References== Category:Cyrtodactylus Category:Reptiles described in 2012 ","title":"Southern Titiwangsa bent-toed gecko"},{"id":"56903444","text":"David Drasin (born 3 November 1940, Philadelphia) is an American mathematician, specializing in function theory.

After that he was an assistant professor, from 1969 an associate professor, and from 1974 a full professor at Purdue University. He was visiting professor in 2005 at the University of Kiel and in 2005/2006 at the University of Helsinki. In 1976, Drasin gave a complete solution to the inverse problem of Nevanlinna theory (value distribution theory),Drasin The inverse problem of the Nevanlinna theory , Acta Mathematica Vol. 138, 1976, pp. 83–151, . Updated in: Drasin On Nevanlinna's Inverse Problem , Complex Variables, Theory and Application, Vol. 37, 1998, pp. 123–143 which was posed by Rolf Nevanlinna in 1929.Nevanlinna Le théorème de Picard-Borel et la théorie des fonctions méromorphes, Gauthier- Villars 1929. Nevanlinna also solved a special case. In the 1930s, the problem was investigated by Nevanlinna and by, among others, Egon Ullrich with later investigations by Oswald Teichmüller, Hans Wittich, Le Van Thiem (1918–1991) and other mathematicians. Anatolii Goldberg (1930–2008) was the first to completely solve the inverse problem in the special case where the number of exceptional values is finite.Goldberg, Ostrovskii Value distribution of meromorphic functions, American Mathematical Society 2008, chapter 7. For entire functions the problem was solved in 1962 by Wolfgang Fuchs and Walter Hayman.Hayman's Meromorphic functions, Clarendon Press 1964, chapter 4 The general problem concerns the question of the existence of a meromorphic function at given values of the exceptional values and associated deficiency values and branching values (with constraints from the Nevanlinna theory). Drasin proved that there is a positive answer to Nevanlinna's problem.Nevanlinna himself was disappointed by the \\"inelegance\\" of the proof, according to Olli Lehto in Erhabene Welten – das Leben Rolf Nevanlinnas, Birkhäuser 2000, p. 80.

In November 2009, the California Legislature enacted SBX7 1 (Delta Reform Act), one of several bills passed related to water supply reliability, ecosystem health, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The Act, effective on Feb. 3, 2010, called for the creation of the Delta Stewardship Council. The Council has seven members, who are consulted by a 10-member board of scientists, the Delta Independent Science Board. The Act required that the Council develop a management plan for the Delta to ensure coordinated action at the federal, state, and local levels. This document is referred to as the Delta Plan. Part of SBX7 1, Water Code Section 85204 also mandated the Council \\"establish and oversee a committee of agencies responsible for implementing the Delta Plan\\" to ensure that the actions of other agencies conform to the Delta Plan's policies. As stated in the Delta Reform Act, the Council stems from the CALFED Bay-Delta Program. Likewise, the Delta Science Program replaced the CALFED Science Program and the Delta Independent Science Board replaced the CALFED Independent Science Board. == References == Category:State agencies of California Category:Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta Category:Nature conservation in the United States Category:Water in California Category:2010 establishments in California Category:Water conservation in the United States Category:Water organizations in the United States ","title":"Delta Stewardship Council"},{"id":"56903507","text":"Cyrtodactylus ayeyarwadyensis is a bent-toed gecko species that was discovered in 2001 in Myanmar's Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range and described in 2003. == External links == * ==References== Category:Cyrtodactylus Category:Reptiles described in 2003 ","title":"Cyrtodactylus ayeyarwadyensis"},{"id":"56903508","text":"Américo Astete (born 3 May 1967) is an Argentine alpine skier.

The band is known for blending global music influences, such as classic soul, dub and psychedelia. Their debut studio album, The Universe Smiles Upon You (2015), draws from the history of Thai music in the 1960s, specifically from Luk thung, while their second album, Con Todo El Mundo (2018), has influences from Spain and the Middle East. Speer, Lee, and DJ also host \\"AirKhruang\\" radio shows on NTS Radio and Facebook Live. ==Background== Speer and Johnson met in 2004 while playing in Rudy Rasmus' St. John's Methodist Church gospel band in Houston, Texas. The church employed Speer as the guitarist and Johnson as the organist. “When we first started the band, we wanted to have a formula,” he says. “It’s like, ‘This is what we do, and we’re not gonna try and go outside the box too much. We’re gonna explore the box we’re in. I’ve always been a big fan of that. I used to be in bands where was like, ‘Man, we’ve gotta think outside the box!’ And all I’m thinking is: ‘You guys don’t even know.’ Music should never be just for the sake of being experimental. Before you even start, you have to know what you’re experimenting with first.” Speer said. In 2007, Speer met Lee through friends, where they initially connected over a shared love of Afghan music and Middle Eastern architecture. In 2009, Lee started to learn the bass with guidance from Speer. After playing for six months, she auditioned and got the gig to be the bassist for Yppah on his upcoming tour. Speer already had the gig as guitarist for Yppah and had encouraged Lee to audition. In 2010, both Lee and Speer went on tour with Yppah who opened for Bonobo. The tour motivated the two of them to make music together more seriously, leading them to form Khruangbin. Speer and Lee went to a barn where they developed the bass-heavy, psychedelic sound that became the basis of the band's aesthetic. Upon their return, they asked Johnson to join the band as drummer, to play simple break- beats under the guitar and bass. The barn, located in the 300-person town of Burton, Texas, would become the site of all future Khruangbin recording sessions. The band has a longterm working relationship with Houston-based engineer Steve Christensen. When asked to play their first gig, Lee, who was learning to speak Thai at the time, decided they should use her favorite Thai word \\"khruangbin\\" (; , lit. Flying thing), which means \\"flying engine\\", literally, or \\"aeroplane,\\" as their name. Speer said that, had they had the foresight to predict the band's success, they might not have chosen a name that was so difficult to pronounce. The band's name symbolizes the international set of influences that shaped the band's formation. A notable part of the band's visual style is the black wigs that Lee and Speer wear on stage, and during promotional interviews and photoshoots. Originally this was to help them move from the stage to the merchandise stand without being recognised during early tours. ==Career== After touring with Bonobo, the artist featured Khruangbin's song, 'Calf Born in Winter,' on his 2014 Late Night Tales compilation. The song became one of the most popular tracks on the record, helping create an initial audience for the band's first EP, History of Flight, and debut record, The Universe Smiles Upon You, in 2015. Shortly thereafter, Khruangbin were named The Guardians \\"New Band of the Week,\\" opening for acts like Father John Misty, Tycho, Chicano Batman, and Massive Attack. They also joined the festival circuit, playing a string of festivals like Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, ACL, Outside Lands, Desert Daze, and South by Southwest. In January 2018, Khruangbin released their second album, Con Todo El Mundo. The title of the album came from Laura Lee's Mexican-American grandfather, who would often ask, \\"How do you love me?\\" (\\"¿Cómo me quieres?\\") and would only accept one response, \\"Con todo el mundo,\\" or in English, \\"with all the world.\\" The band has been quoted as saying the title of the record is also a reference to the diverse range of musical influences that inspired it, primarily from the Middle East. Shortly before the release of Con Todo El Mundo, the band also covered Ma Beham Nemiresim by Googoosh, a popular Iranian songstress, for the Artists Rise Against Islamophobia compilation, and created a Tehran-specific playlist on Spotify, in addition to many other city-specific playlists, as part of their AirKhruang DJ series. In 2018, Khruangbin recorded live for Spotify an arrangement of the Indian song Khuda Bhi Aasman Se, played by Mohammed Rafi in the movie Dharti (1970), a Bollywood movie classic. They also opened for Leon Bridges on his recent 2018 tour, as well as Trey Anastasio's Ghosts of the Forest tour in 2019. In 2020, the group was featured on the cover of Relix. https://relix.com/mordechai/ Relix == Style == Khruangbin's musical genre is a hotly debated topic amongst critics. Mostly instrumental, the band's sound has been described as soul, surf, psychedelic, and funk, with one website even describing them as \\"electronic\\". The most commonly used term to describe Khruangbin's music is Thai funk, though the band members themselves challenge the convention of genres, publicly refusing to be pigeonholed into one particular label. As music journalist Rob Shepherd noted for PostGenre, \\"The [name Khruangbin], which translates to “flying engine” or airplane in Thai, is perfect for their music as it often crosses borders and cultures.\\" == Band members == * Laura Lee – bass, vocals * Mark Speer – guitars, vocals * Donald \\"DJ\\" Johnson – drums, keyboards, vocals == Discography  Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Details ! colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Universe Smiles upon You  * Released: November 6, 2015 * Label: Night Time Stories * Formats: CD, digital download, LP, streaming  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" Con Todo El Mundo  * Released: January 26, 2018 * Label: Dead Oceans/Night Time Stories * Formats: CD, digital download, LP, streaming  82 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Mordechai  * Released: June 26, 2020 * Label: Dead Oceans/Night Time Stories * Formats: CD, digital download, LP, streaming  7 -  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-size:85%\\" \\"—\\" denotes album that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } === EPs === *The Infamous Bill (2014) *History Of Flight (2015) *Spotify Singles (2018) *Texas Sun (with Leon Bridges) (2020) === Remix albums === *Hasta El Cielo (2019, Dead Oceans; Night Time Stories) === Singles === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album/EP - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US AAA ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US Rock - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"A Calf Born in Winter\\" 2014 — — ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Non-album single - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"White Gloves\\" 2015 — — The Universe Smiles Upon You - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Maria También\\" 2017 — —  rowspan=\\"2\\" Con Todo El Mundo - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Friday Morning\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2018 — — - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" — — ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Non-album single - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Texas Sun\\" (with Leon Bridges) 2019 17 — Texas Sun - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Time (You and I)\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2020  40  45  rowspan=\\"3\\" Mordechai - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"So We Won't Forget\\"  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\"  \\"Pelota\\"  —  — -  colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"font-size:85%\\" \\"—\\" denotes single that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } === Live recordings === *Live @ Helios (2012, Hightower Records) *Live At Lincoln Hall (2018, Dead Oceans; Night Time Stories) *Live At Arcosanti, Arizona (2019, FORM Arcosanti Festival) ==References== Category:American musical trios Category:Musical groups from Houston Category:Dead Oceans artists ","title":"Khruangbin"},{"id":"56903540","text":"Jordi Torres (born 19 July 1964) is an Andorran alpine skier.

In the primary school, he was an altar server as well as a member of the choir.

The campus became the starting venue for the University of Ife when it was created in 1961. Both in the Nigerian college and the University of Ife, he had a double scholarship from the Western region and the Federal Government. He was to study language at the University of Ibadan but was too young since he was only 17. Between 1957 and 1960 he worked as a teacher in St. Michael’s Catholic Modern School, Yemetu, Ibadan. Some of his students have become famous, including Prof. Pius Obanya who was invited from the UNESCO to serve as the Director General of Universal Basic Education Scheme.

Kashf is regarded as the first microfinance institution (MFI) of Pakistan that uses village banking methodology in microcredit to alleviate poverty by providing affordable financial and non-financial services to low income households - particularly for women, to build their capacity and enhance their economic role. With headquarters in Lahore, Punjab, Kashf has regional offices in five major cities and over 200 branches across the Pakistan. Recipient of many accolades, particularly in microfinance sector, it was awarded Microfinance Excellence Award by the Grameen Foundation and won the AGFUND Second International Prize for Microcredit, competing against 95 countries. In 2008, Kashf was ranked no. 34 among the Top 50 MFIs of the World by Forbes. In 2016, Kashf became the first MFI of Pakistan to win a European Microfinance Award for Microfinance and Access to Education. ==HistoryBackground=== In 1993, Zafar, an Ashoka Fellow, was a Development economics student at Yale, where she came to know about the pioneer of microcredit and microfinance sector, Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and abandoned her plans to become an investment banker. Despite this she joined World Bank in Islamabad in the Water supply and sanitation department, where she attended a meeting about women and children in Islamabad sponsored by UNICEF and met Dr. Yunus and the two briefly talked about this work. During her fieldwork trip to Tharparkar, she noticed the desire of women's who wanted to work and generate income for their families. She decided to work for their sustainability and quit her job at World Bank and wrote to Dr. Yunus about her intentions, who flew her to Bangladesh where she spent ten-weeks at Grameen Foundation, attending workshops, sessions, trainings, visiting branches of Grameen Bank and studying their business model, and researching from the clients of foundation. Zafar traveled for a year touring Nepal and India understanding the structure of low-income households and was given $10,000 loan from Dr. Yunus to start her own organization. There with the help of Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) summer interns, she developed feasibility and business plan for women's businesses and female entrepreneurship in Pakistan. ===Foundation=== After an extensive preliminary work in 1995, Zafar registered, Kashf as a \\"research\\" based program in Lahore, in June 1996, with a total staff of five women, with Zafar working as a loan officer. It took six-month for the Foundation, before anyone would borrow the money and by November 1996 it had distributed 15 loans, all of whom were women, who also became associated with the Kashf. According to Roshaneh, it was a \\"trust building\\" period. After the initial rounding Kashf, started training women through numeracy training and made the process of loan easier. The first amount of loans given were 4,000 PKR (roughly $80). The initial two years were spent in understanding the market and the needs of clients in peri-urban and urban settings. The importance of standardized products, systems and policies, the simplification of procedures and reporting requirements, along with the significance of focusing on client satisfaction and developing clear cut financial performance indicators was highlighted. The action research phase was followed by a more focused approach to manage growth in the years 1999 – 2001. The following years were focused on growth of organization, with the main aspect of this phase was to make the branch structure more lean and efficient; an aspect which was critical for ensuring the long term viability of the programme, along with setting up a cash flow model which would ensure the sustainability of a branch within a set time period. By early 2001, Kashf had a network of five branches in Lahore and a client base of 5,088 customers located in 214 centers. Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Department for International Development, and the Agha Khan Foundation provided core funding. Years, 2001-2004 saw the enhance outreach and deepen product offerings through cost effective and sustainable Kashf branches. Growing with quality was emphasized, adequate controls were established and the collection system was revamped. Kashf followed a lateral growth path by entering new markets and managing dispersed units. Kashf managed growth by widening outreach and deepening access by pioneering new products like micro-insurance. By end 2004, Kashf was providing financial services to over 68,000 clients through a network of 30 branches. As of April 2007, Kashf have 94 branches, 182,000 clients and operate in 12 different districts in two provinces of Pakistan. In 2018, Kashf signed a $5 million loan by PROPARCO of French Development Agency (AFD) for its \\"commitment to financial inclusion and women empowerment in developing and emerging countries.\\" ===Etymology=== Kashf originates from Arabic word (), which translates as \\"unveiling\\" - Sufi concept rooted in Gnostic ideals dealing with knowledge of the heart rather than of the intellect. On naming the foundation Zafar explained, \\"I believe some things can get pre-ordained. One of most famous Sufi philosophers is buried here in Lahore. Kashf is a Sufi word, which means miracle or revelation or self- actualization. It’s a belief that God is within you, God is in humanity. Any individual can be a good individual. When I was in Bangladesh [with Grameen], the word 'Kashf' came to me.\\" ===Loans=== Due to the economic downturn, Kashf only provides income-generating loans. Apart from that Kashf has granted the business ‘surmaya’ loan to the Kashf Microfinance Bank, small entrepreneurship loans above US$1,000 have been given. However the purpose of the bank is to focus on job creation as 65% of the Pakistani population is below 25 years of age. About 2 to 3% loans are rejected. If people are late with three or four payments, they will be rejected the next time they ask for a loan. In cases of emergencies Foundation, we reschedule the loan to sustain the family. Kashf focuses product design, frequent small paybacks, and group dynamics in order to make micro-according financing successful, according to organization, \\"It’s important for clients to pay back their loans in regular and small amounts on a monthly basis.\\" ==Mission== The mission of Kashf is to \\"Serve all with dignity by providing quality and cost effective microfinance services to low income households that alleviate poverty and enable women to become active agents of social and economic change, through building alliances, promoting linkages and developing entrepreneurship.\\" Kashf became the first MFI to use mainstream media for social change. Today, Kashf has enabled access to over 1 million low-income individuals to micro-health insurance and has distributed over $496 million funds to its clients. Kashf piloted research in women development has 55% rate of business led by women. ==Business model and strategy== Zafar's organization, Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, is one of major shareholders in FINCA Microfinance Bank Limited of Pakistan, one of 20 community-based microfinance institutions and banks that offers financial services to low-income clients, which itself is a part of FINCA International's, FINCA Impact Finance Network. It follows FINCA International model, sustaining itself from the income earned through its loan portfolio. Its approach leverages available capital and promotes greater transparency, sustainability and higher standards of business practices. Initially Kashf used, \\"solidarity\\" methodology similar of Grameen, wherein groups of people take out loans together. In 2009, Kashf established the \\"Kashf Microfinance Bank\\", which provides a savings source and deposits are usually regulated by State Bank of Pakistan. Kashf targets women and families and helping in family enterprises. The foundation assess families for their business plan, validity of their proposal, future prospects, and their reputation within their community. And together they develops a business plan with the whole family looking into their debt management capacity and proceeds with the loan. Kashf is a third-largest private microlender in Pakistan. ==Innovation and Partnerships== Kashf Foundation was the first MFI to demonstrate a women centric model in Pakistan, they developed women friendly microfinance products and a delivery methodology that addressed women's unique collaborative strengths. Kashf introduced micro-savings for low-income households and achieved both operational and financial self-sufficiency in 2003. Kashf was the first micro-finance institute to generate a consumer protection code. The Foundation raised commercial debt through the issuance of term finance certificates in 2007 and scaled up an appraisal backed lending model for low- income clients with two tiered financial education program for clients. Kashf has achieved progress in poverty status elevating 30% of its clients above the poverty line with households have a greater ability to save and quality life. They get better nutrition and can afford better health care. On the social side, women are more empowered and about 50% of the microfinance clients are Pakistani women. In 2015, Kashf became the first institution to offer financial services to the low-cost private school sector in Pakistan, by initiating its pilot program, Kashf School Sarmaya (KSS). Since its inception it has worked with more than 400 schools across Pakistan. Approximately 90 percent of KSS borrowers serve students from households making less than 400 PKR ($4) a day. Kashf has worked with a multitude of bilateral and multilateral donors, both national and international partners and NGOs including: Global Affairs Canada, FINCA International, Ernst and Young, Department for International Development, Grameen Foundation, Acumen Fund, ShoreBank, Women's World Banking, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, United Bank Limited, Askari Bank, JS Bank, Jubilee Insurance Company Limited, Kiva, Meezan Bank, OMV, HBL Pakistan, MCB Bank Limited, Skoll Foundation, Triodos Bank, Agha Khan Foundation, and among other local and international microfinance state and private sectors. ==Media and social platforms== Kashf had used theater for social development. Issues regarding education of girls, dowry, or violence against women have been approached through this medium. According to Zafar, \\"It’s part of our communication strategy in the field.\\" In 2013, Kashf Foundation started collaborating through entrainment medium particularly of television, highlighting the issues of women in Pakistan, creating popular and acclaimed television series such as Rehaai, Udaari, and Aakhri Station. Kashf also has several other training and mentoring programs such as the Business Incubation Lab, which enables rising entrepreneurs to expand their businesses by learning to make networks, showcasing products and studying competition. These programs have successfully trained thousands of women leading them running them own businesses. Kashf has been praised for its initiatives towards these issues. ==Awards and honors== * Microfinance Excellence Award by the Grameen Foundation, 2002 * Social Entrepreneur Award by Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, 2003 * Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Medal of Excellence) from the President of Pakistan, 2005 * 5 Diamond Statuses Award by Microfinance Information Exchange, 2005 * AGFUND Second Category International Prize for Microcredit, 2005 * Certified by Pakistan Center for Philanthropy, 2005 * CGAP Financial Transparency Merit Award, 2005 & 2006 * The Social Entrepreneur of the Year by Skoll Foundation, 2007 * Top 50 MFIs of the World by Forbes, 2008 * The One Woman Initiative Award by USAID, 2009 * The Global Leadership Award for Economic Empowerment by Vital Voices, 2010 * Pakistan Power 100 Excellence Award, 2012 * Consumer Protection and Responsible Finance award by The Smart Campaign, 2012 * Community Service Award by KFC Pakistan, 2013 * European Microfinance Award for \\"Microfinance and Access to Education\\", 2016 ==See also== * FINCA International * John Hatch * Village Banking * Microcredit * Microfinance * Opportunity International ==References ; Official * * Kashf Foundation at Women's World Banking * Kashf Foundation at Skoll Foundation ;Official Media * * * Category:Humanitarian aid organizations Category:Women's organisations based in Pakistan Category:Non-profit organisations based in Lahore, Punjab Category:Organizations established in 1996 Category:Microfinance organizations Category:1996 establishments in Pakistan ","title":"Kashf Foundation"},{"id":"56903616","text":"Jean-Michel Larrasket (, ) (22 May 1950 - 19 March 2018), was a French professor and engineer, as well as vice president for the French Basque Country in the Basque Studies Society.Eusko Ikaskuntzak antolaketa berriarekin abiatuko du 2014 urtea He was a promoter of several projects for the social and economic development of the French Basque Country, and he was also one of the founders of the Eticoop cooperative that promotes entrepreneurship in this geographical area.Jean Michel Larrasket Eusko Ikaskuntzako Iparraldeko lehendakaria zendu da ETICoop ou la nouvelle école du modèle coopératif - Le Journal du Pays Basque == Biography == Larrasket's parents were from the town of Barcus in Zuberoa, and consequently Larrasket always kept a close relationship with the town.Jean-Michel Larrasquet s’est éteint He studied engineering in Toulouse and at the beginning of the 80s he started as a professor at the IUT in Bayonne.

As Rhombus polyspilos it was named as the type species of the genus Pseudorhombus. It is an Indo-Pacific species and is fished for by both recreational and commercial fisheries. ==Description== Pseudorhombus arsius has an oval-shaped body which has a depth which is 1.8 to 2.3 times its standard length. The head has a slight notch in front of upper eye. The eyes are on the left side and have a diameter which is a fifth of the length of the head and the snout has a length equal to or slightly greater than the diameter of the eye. The dorsal fin starts in front of its upper eye and of the nostrils on blind side. The mouth forms a deep cleft with the maxilla normally almost half the length of the head. The jaws and teeth are nearly equally developed on both jaws. The upper jaw reaches to below the posterior edge of the lower eye. There are several pairs of moderately large caniform teeth in the anterior parts of both jaws, which are of unequal size and arranged in a single row. These number 5 to 8 in the lower jaw on the eyed side, and 6 to 13 lateral teeth in lower jaw of blind side which are more robust and more widely spaced than those of upper jaw. The gill rakers are pointed, longer than they are broad. It has simple fin-rays which number 71–84 in the dorsal fin, 53–62 in the anal fin and 11–13 in the pectoral fin. The lateral line curves above the pectoral fin has 69-81 scales and there are 36 vertebrae. In the dorsal fin the longest rays are found in the posterior third and only the rearmost three or four rays are branched, as at the last five anal fin rays. Two dark spots are situated on the central part of its dorsal surface, one just to the posterior of the pectoral fin and the second is midway between that the forward spot and the tail. The body is greenish to pale brownish in colour and is normally marked with variously sized rings, and there is frequently two dark blotches on the straight and the curved sections of the lateral line with a smaller blotch which is half-way to the caudal-fin peduncle. It can vary the colour of the body so that it closely matches the surface the fish rests on. They grow to 50 cm, but 30 cm in length is the more usual size ==Distribution== Pseudorhombus arsius is found in the tropical and temperate waters from the Persian Gulf and the eastern coast of Africa as far south as Algoa Bay and possibly even Knysna to Fiji in the western Pacific, to southern Japan in the north and as far south as the northern coast of Australia. It may extend as far south as the Bass Strait. ==Habitat and biology== Pseudorhombus arsius occurs in shallow waters and in estuaries where the substrate consists of mud and sand bottoms, to depths of 200 m. The juveniles are common in brackish water. When they are spawning they are found in shallow water on sandbanks and close to shore. They move to deeper waters in the winter. They are predators which prey mainly on benthic animals. The spawning season runs for 3 to 4 months, from April to July and peaks in April and May, during which they move into the sandy shallows close to the shore. The spawn is laid in a single batch. They mature when they attain a total length of between 16 and 17 cm in total length. The sex ratio is always biased towards females and the fecundity of the fish is dependent on its total length and body weight. ==Fisheries== Pseudorhombus arsius is subjected to a minor commercial fishery in West Bengal in the estuary of the Hooghly River. Otherwise it is a quarry for recreational angling. ==References== Category:Paralichthyidae Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Fish described in 1822 Category:Taxa named by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton ","title":"Pseudorhombus arsius"},{"id":"56903777","text":"__NOTOC__ Vivigani Ardune Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Lucindale about south- east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-west of the town of Lucindale.

Gibson's work explores Black representation in the United States using the medium of comics. == Education == Gibson received his B.F.A. from The Cooper Union and his M.F.A. from Yale School of Art in painting and printmaking in 2013, where he received the Ely Harwood Schless Memorial Fund Award. == Art == Gibson focuses on using the language of comic as a tool for social justice. His work involves graphic novels, consisting of black and white pen drawings, and colorful paintings developed from imageries chosen from his books. Gibson's artist statement describes his artistic choices and vision: “I look at American culture from a multipartite viewpoint as an artist—as a black male, a professor, an American history buff and comic book nerd. These myriad of often colliding perspectives fuel my exploration of American culture through the high and low visual languages of painting and comics to reveal a narrative that spells out our fabricated destruction. The black ink and strong color in my work create stark contrasts in which positive and negative space define the composition. I rely on a minimal aesthetic, playing off of both fine art and the comic book vernacular of sequential narrative. In all the works, I try to shine a light on the grim and gritty social realities of contemporary America.” His influences include comic creators Dwayne McDuffie, and Jim Steranko, as well as film directors Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock. ===Some Monsters Loom Large (2016)=== Some Monsters Loom Large is a narrative that features Mr. Wolfson, a wolf-man. Mr. Wolfson is first introduced basking in the sun on a desert island, slowly going insane. After a while, he discovers a mount-like structure with horns popping out of the ocean. He climbs inside and is presented with a small theatre production showcasing a brief history of Western colonialism and colonization of America. During this film, Mr. Wolfson learns that the cannibalism of Native Americans by pilgrims in the founding of America birthed an evil spirit named, “Manifest Destiny”. The evil spirit infects anyone who comes in contact with it, transforming into them into wolf- men. Throughout the narrative, Mr. Wolfson is chased down and murdered by Manifest Destiny multiple times, which mark the endings of each volume. His solo exhibition, Some Monsters Loom Large, showed in Fredericks & Freiser, included installation of colorized reproductions of drawings found in the book as acrylic paintings. ===Early Retirement (2017)=== Early Retirement is a narrative that “revolves around Mr. Wolfson, a werewolf and Doomsday prophet in New York City’s street prophecy scene, and The Drummer, one of the three heralds of the Apocalypse. One day, The Drummer learns that the Truth has been delivered to Mr. Wolfson. Things quickly spiral out of control, leading to a three-way standoff between the Will of the People, the Will of Government and the Will of God.” This work was influenced by the American presidential election of 2016, and his question regarding quest for utopia, and ways to join forces to go against the adversity in the United States of America. His solo exhibition, Early Retirement, showed in Fredericks & Freiser, included installation of black and white ink drawings and colorized reproductions as acrylic paintings. ==CurationBlack Pulp=== Black Pulp! is an exhibition co-curated by William Villalongo and Mark Thomas Gibson first showed at Yale University. The show gets its name from the term “pulp” which is a cheap paper that allowed ephemera such as newspapers, books, fliers, and posters to be printed inexpensively in the 19th and 20th centuries. The accessibility of pulp facilitated mass communication within and about the black community. Villalongo wishes the exhibition will highlight “historical efforts within the medium to rebuff derogatory image culture with exceptional wit, beauty, and humor, to provide emerging, nuanced perspective on black humanity.” The collection provides a perspective of black and non-black artists and publishers who work to draw attention to the black experience in American culture and history from 1912 to 2016 through contemporary works of art and historical printed media. Black Pulp! consists of a wide range of works, ranging from comic books and historic texts and magazines, to digital prints, drawings, and media-based works by contemporary artists. With this eclectic collection, the exhibition draws connection from various Afrocentric movements of the 20th century and today. Black Pulp! features works by 21 artists from the Black diaspora: Derrick Adams, Laylah Ali, Firelei Báez, Nayland Blake, Robert Colescott, Renee Cox, William Downs, Ellen Gallagher, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Lucia Hierro, Yashua Klos, Kerry James Marshall, Wangechi Mutu, Lamar Peterson, Pope.L, Kenny Rivero, Alexandria Smith, Felandus Thames, Hank Willis Thomas, Kara Walker, and Fred Wilson. ===Woke!=== Woke! is an exhibition co- curated by William Villalongo and Mark Thomas Gibson showing a selection of their recent works heavily influenced by Eric Garner and the Ferguson protests. The show gets its name from the term “woke,” a contemporary American vernacular terminology for awareness in reference to socio-political contexts. The show discusses American atrocity and the black body in a physical way. == Teaching == Gibson is an assistant professor at Tyler School of Art at Temple University. Previously he was a full-time lecturer and the assistant dean of student affairs at the Yale School of Art. == Awards == Ely Harwood Schless Memorial Fund Award 2013, Yale School of Art Yale Norfolk Assistantship 2012, awarded by Samuel Messer, Associate Dean == References  External links == * Website Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:African- American contemporary artists Category:American male painters Category:21st- century American painters Category:Cooper Union alumni Category:Yale School of Art alumni ","title":"Mark Thomas Gibson"},{"id":"56903853","text":"Guðmundur Jóhannsson (born 19 February 1963) is an Icelandic alpine skier.

A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks by using the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based DNS resolver. By March of 2018, Google and the Mozilla Foundation had started testing versions of DNS over HTTPS. In February 2020, Firefox switched to DNS over HTTPS by default for users in the United States. In addition to improving security, another goal of DNS over HTTPS is to improve performance: testing of ISP DNS resolvers has shown that many often have slow response times, a problem that is exacerbated by the need to potentially have to resolve many hostnames when loading a single web page. == Technical details == DoH is a proposed standard, published as RFC 8484 (October 2018) by the IETF. It uses HTTP/2 and HTTPS, and supports the wire format DNS response data, as returned in existing UDP responses, in an HTTPS payload with the MIME type application/dns-message. If HTTP/2 is used, the server may also use HTTP/2 server push to send values that it anticipates the client may find useful in advance. DoH is a work in progress. Even though the IETF has published RFC 8484 as a proposed standard and companies are experimenting with it, the IETF has yet to determine how it should best be implemented. The IETF is evaluating a number of approaches for how to best deploy DoH and is looking to set up a working group, Adaptive DNS Discovery (ADD), to do this work and develop a consensus. In addition, other industry working groups such as the Encrypted DNS Deployment Initiative, have been formed to \\"define and adopt DNS encryption technologies in a manner that ensures the continued high performance, resiliency, stability and security of the Internet’s critical namespace and name resolution services, as well as ensuring the continued unimpaired functionality of security protections, parental controls, and other services that depend upon the DNS\\". == Deployment scenarios == DoH is used for recursive DNS resolution by DNS resolvers. Resolvers (DoH clients) must have access to a DoH server hosting a query endpoint. DoH lacks widespread support in operating systems, although Insider versions of Windows 10 support it. Thus, a user wishing to use it usually needs to install additional software. Three usage scenarios are common: * Using a DoH implementation within an application: Some browsers have a built- in DoH implementation and can thus perform queries by bypassing the operating system's DNS functionality. A drawback is that an application may not inform the user if it skips DoH querying, either by misconfiguration or lack of support for DoH. * Installing a DoH proxy on the name server in the local network: In this scenario client systems continue to use traditional (port 53 or 853) DNS to query the name server in the local network, which will then gather the necessary replies via DoH by reaching DoH-servers in the Internet. This method is transparent to the end user. * Installing a DoH proxy on a local system: In this scenario, operating systems are configured to query a locally running DoH proxy. In contrast to the previously mentioned method, the proxy needs to be installed on each system wishing to use DoH, which might require a lot of effort in larger environments. == Software support  Operating systems ===  Apple  Apple's iOS 14 and macOS 11 will support both DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS (DoT) when they are released in the fall of 2020.  Windows  In November 2019, Microsoft announced plans to implement support for encrypted DNS protocols in Microsoft Windows, beginning with DoH. In May 2020, Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 19628 that included initial support for DoH along with instructions on how to enable it via registry and command line interface. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 20185 added graphical user interface for setting up DNS over HTTPS resolver. === Web browsers ===  Google Chrome  DNS over HTTPS is available in Google Chrome 83 for Windows and macOS and Linux, configurable via the settings page. When enabled, and the operating system is configured with a supported DNS server, Chrome will upgrade DNS queries to be encrypted. It is also possible to manually specify a preset or custom DoH server to use within the user interface. In September 2020, Google Chrome for Android began staged rollout of DNS over HTTPS. Users can configure a custom resolver or disable DNS over HTTPS in settings.  Microsoft Edge  Microsoft Edge has support for DoH, configurable via the \`edge://flags\` URL. If the operating system is configured with a supported DNS server, Edge will upgrade DNS queries to be encrypted.  Mozilla Firefox  In 2018, Mozilla partnered with Cloudflare to deliver DoH for Firefox users that enable it. Firefox 73 added another resolver in the options, NextDNS. On February 25, 2020, Firefox started enabling DNS over HTTPS for all US-based users, relying on Cloudflare's resolver by default. On June 3, 2020, Firefox 77.0.1 disabled NextDNS by default because the high load on the NextDNS servers caused by Firefox users was \\"effectively DDoS'ing NextDNS\\" (NextDNS is still available in the settings, just not enabled by default). In June 2020, Mozilla announced plans to add Comcast to the list of trusted DoH resolvers.  Opera  Opera supports DoH, configurable via the browser settings page. By default, DNS queries are sent to Cloudflare servers. === Public DNS servers === DNS over HTTPS server implementations are already available free of charge by some public DNS providers. See public recursive name server for an overview. == Criticisms and implementation considerations == DoH can impede analysis and monitoring of DNS traffic for cybersecurity purposes; the 2019 DDoS worm Godula used DoH to mask connections to its command-and-control server. DoH has been used to bypass parental controls which operate at the (unencrypted) standard DNS level; Circle, a parental control router which relies on DNS queries to check domains against a blocklist, blocks DoH by default due to this. However, there are DNS providers that offer filtering and parental controls along with support for DoH by operating DoH servers. The Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA)—a trade association representing UK ISPs—and the also British body Internet Watch Foundation have criticized Mozilla, developer of the Firefox web browser, for supporting DoH, as they believe that it will undermine web blocking programs in the country, including ISP default filtering of adult content, and mandatory court-ordered filtering of copyright violations. The ISPA nominated Mozilla for its \\"Internet Villain\\" award for 2019 (alongside the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, and Donald Trump), \\"for their proposed approach to introduce DNS-over- HTTPS in such a way as to bypass UK filtering obligations and parental controls, undermining internet safety standards in the UK.\\" Mozilla responded to the allegations by the ISPA, arguing that it would not prevent filtering, and that they were \\"surprised and disappointed that an industry association for ISPs decided to misrepresent an improvement to decades-old internet infrastructure\\". In response to the criticism, the ISPA apologized and withdrew the nomination. Mozilla subsequently stated that DoH will not be used by default in the UK market until further discussion with relevant stakeholders, but stated that it \\"would offer real security benefits to UK citizens\\". Many issues with how to properly deploy DoH are still being resolved by the internet community including but not limited to: * Parental controls and content filters * Split DNS in Enterprises * CDN Localization The DoH clients do not directly query any authoritative name servers. Instead, the client relies on the DoH server using traditional (port 53 or 853) queries to finally reach authoritative servers. Thus DoH does not qualify as an end-to- end encrypted protocol, only hop-to-hop encrypted and only if DNS over TLS is used consistently. == See also == * DNS over TLS * DNSCrypt * DNSCurve * EDNS Client Subnet == References  External links == * DNS Privacy Project: dnsprivacy.org * DNS over HTTPS Implementations * A cartoon intro to DNS over HTTPS * DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Considerations for Operator Networks (draft, expired on 12 March 2020) Category:Application layer protocols Category:Computer network security Category:Domain Name System Category:Internet protocols ","title":"DNS over HTTPS"},{"id":"56903930","text":"Wu Deqiang (born 18 February 1963) is a Chinese alpine skier.

Born in Peckham, Butler began working when he was seven years old. For many years, he worked in a factory making clothing for the British Army, and in 1895 he founded the Army Clothing Employees' Union, serving as its secretary. During the 1910s, he was also secretary of the United Government Workers' Federation. Butler joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), and unsuccessfully contested Kennington for the party in the 1907 London County Council election. The SDF became the core of the British Socialist Party (BSP), and under this description, Butler stood in the 1913 London County Council election in Stepney, but took only 108 votes. Later in the year, he contested the 1913 Reading by-election. He received the support of the Independent Labour Party and the local trades council, but was only able to take 10.4% of the vote and third place. The BSP affiliated to the Labour Party, and under this label he was more successful, taking 24.1% of the vote in Hastings at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, and then winning Battersea North at the 1919 London County Council election. Unlike the majority of the BSP, Butler remained with the Labour Party rather than joining the new Communist Party of Great Britain, and he chaired Westminster Labour Party from 1921 to 1926. He held his council seat until 1928, after which he became a newsagent, continued his trade union activity. He also continued to contest Parliamentary elections, taking a distant second in Westminster Abbey at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, third place in Willesden East at the 1923 United Kingdom general election, and second in Westminster St George's at the 1929 United Kingdom general election. Finally, he stood in Balham and Tooting at the 1931 London County Council election, taking fourth place. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:Year of death missing Category:British Socialist Party members Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Leaders of British trade unions Category:Members of London County Council Category:People from Peckham Category:Social Democratic Federation members ","title":"Joseph George Butler"},{"id":"56903968","text":"Yakup Kadri Birinci (born 24 November 1967) is a Turkish alpine skier.

Eitri is a Dwarf who lives on Asgard. He is a weapons forger and is notable for being the one who created Mjolnir for the Norse God Thor. He has also occasionally aided the New Mutants. ==Publication history== The character, created by writer Alan Zelenetz and artist Bob Hall, first appeared in The Mighty Thor Annual #11 (November 1983). He continued to appear throughout the '80s in the pages of the New Mutants, starting with The New Mutants Special Edition from writer Chris Claremont and artist Arthur Adams. Following a long absence, Eitri returned with additional details about the character in Thor Vol. 2 #80 from Michael Avon Oeming, Daniel Berman and Andrea Di Vito. ==Fictional character biography== Eitri ruled as king of the Dwarves of Nidavellir. In his first appearance, he along with his brother Brokk were tasked with creating a spear for Odin. Due to a young Loki's magic, the spear was cursed, and Thor was asked to have the dwarves create a new weapon. Loki once again attempted to thwart the dwarves forging, but they manage to complete the creation of Mjolnir, along with the creation of Gullinbursti (a living boar) and Draupnir (a golden armband), which they give to Odin. Years later, Loki destroys Sif's golden hair, making her bald. Thor threatens him to replace her hair and meets with Eitri and Brokk, who — due to Loki being unable to pay them — give black hair as the replacement, which Thor and Sif do not seem to mind.Thor Annual #11 (November 1983). Marvel Comics. The loss of Sif's blonde hair is also detailed in a four-part series focusing on Loki's history.Loki #2 (2004). Marvel Comics. These stories were slightly retconned, with it being explained that Eitri's creation of Mjolnir caused the extinction of dinosaurs. Eitri and his siblings, Brokk and Buri, took it upon themselves to get rid of the mold that created it so that it did not fall into the hands of Loki.Thor Vol. 2 #80 (August 2004). Marvel Comics. Another version revealed that Mjolnir was created alongside Sif's new hair which Eitri was able to make gold. It was through Loki's own doing that Mjolnir ended up with Thor and Sif's hair became black.Loki Vol. 2 #1 (Feb. 2011). Marvel Comics. The story of the forging was later returned to its original version.Avengers Origins: Thor (2011). Marvel Comics. Odin later visits Eitri to help in forging something for him. In return, Eitri asks that Odin send a female warrior to defeat a rogue dwarf named Throgg. Sif defeats him, and Eitri happily tells her that since Throgg has been bested by a woman, he and the dwarves can now leave peacefully and proceed to begin forging the hammer Stormbreaker for Beta Ray Bill at Odin's request.Thor #339 (January 1984). Marvel Comics. Eitri is later visited by Odin and Balder who wish to stop a fight between Thor and Eric Masterson. To do this, Eitri creates Thunderstrike, a mace that evidently becomes Masterson's code name.Thor #458-459 (1993). Marvel Comics. Eitri and his dwarves became supporting characters of the New Mutants. Due to Loki's magic, Storm and her team were transported to but separated on Asgard. Cannonball encounters Eitri in a cave and rescues Eitri's family from Throff the Terrible, but Cannonball is severely injured in the process. For this, Eitri brings him into his home and allows him to heal there, and Eitri's daughter Kindra strikes up a flirtatious relationship with Cannonball. Not long after, Eitri aids Cannonball in fending off Magma, who is possessed by Dark Elves. After helping her, Loki arrives and threatens Eitri and his kingdom. In response, he uses his magic to help Cannonball and Magma find their friends.The New Mutants: Special Edition Vol. 1 #1 (1985). Marvel Comics. Eitri gives Cannonball enchanted armor and a sword as well as a special hammer to give to Loki to expose him.The Uncanny X-Men Annual #9 (1985). Marvel Comics. The New Mutants returned to Asgard due to magical influence upon one of them. The dwarves initially mistook them for spies. However, Eitri freed the team and happily greeted Cannonball and his friends. They were soon attacked by the Valkyrior who was controlled by Hela. Eitri leads his Dwarves into battle after Boom Boom insults them.The New Mutants #79–80. Marvel Comics. Eitri is captured by Hela and forces him to forge a sword out of the uru metal by threatening the life of his daughter Kindra.The New Mutants #82–83 (December 1989). Marvel Comics. He comforts her by acknowledging the New Mutants' plan of action as well as his own in which the sword has \\"sown the seeds of Hela's destruction\\".The New Mutants #84. Marvel Comics. Eitri frees himself, Kindra and many of Asgard's warriors from prison and then reveals that he built a flaw in the sword. He has Kindra flee and then strikes the sword, allowing Cannonball to see the flaw and destroy it. Eitri's efforts, along with those of many other Asgardians and the New Mutants, save Odin from death.The New Mutants #85 (January 1990). Marvel Comics. In the stirrings of Ragnarok, Eitri traveled with his kin, Brok and Buri, to dispose of the forge that made Mjolnir itself. Such a forge, still churning with energies, might be used by Loki to create yet more weapons. The attempt ended in disaster, killing all three dwarves.Thor Vol. 2 #80. Marvel Comics. The realms were later restored, putting Eitri in charge of his people yet again. Thor #1-3 (2007) When the War of the Realms came, bringing all realms under the threat of Malekith, Eitri went to work in the forges, needed as all dwarves were.The Mighty Thor Vol. 2 (2017) ==Powers and abilities== Eitri is an expert weaponsmith. He also has an extended lifespan. ==Other versions== * Eitri appears in an issue of What If? picking up on the events of The New Mutants: Special Edition #1 and X-Men Annual #9 (1985) where the issue asks \\"What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard?\\" After several X-Men and New Mutants decide to stay in Asgard, Sam Guthrie marries Kindra, making him Eitri's son- in-law. Afterwards, when Hela makes her move against Asgard and the dwarves rally on the side of the Asgardians, Eitri is killed in battle and Sam succeeds him as king of the dwarves.What If? vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics. * In Infinity Wars: Iron Hammer, which amalgamates the stories of Iron Man and Thor, Eitri is a dwarf with traits similar to Ho Yinsen that wears a cursed neck shackle that makes him only create weapons for others and none for himself. He is also incapable of harming his captors the Dark Elves. Eitri eventually meets another fellow captive named Sigurd Stark and helps create a suit for him called the Iron Hammer. In an effort to help his ally escape, Eitri was killed by Krimson Kurse. Stark later buried him in the forest.Infinity Wars: Iron Hammer #1. Marvel Comics. ==In other mediaTelevision=== * Eitri appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"The Fall of Asgard\\", voiced by John DiMaggio. He leads his surviving dwarf army against Loki's forces. They encounter Iron Man who defeats Ulik for them. Afterwards, Eitri creates a new armor for him. In the very next episode, Surtur breaks loose and Eitri is injured. He receives a scar over his right eye and informs Odin on what happened. Eitri later creates Stormbreaker for Beta Ray Bill. * Eitri appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Field Trip\\", voiced by Troy Baker. When Thor, Spider-Man, and his friends approach Eitri for weapons to use in their fight against Loki, Eitri is reluctant to help them as Odin has not once thanked him for crafting things for him. Thor is able to persuade Eitri to help them. Eitri gives the heroes new weapons to help defeat Loki. However, Spider-Man is not given a weapon, as Eitri advises him that \\"his words are his greatest weapon\\". ===Film=== Marvel Cinematic Universe * Eitri appears in Avengers: Infinity War, portrayed by Peter Dinklage. Atypically to his traditional diminutive form, this version of Eitri is depicted at a giant's size (although he still refers to his race as Dwarves). Thor comes to him on Nidavellir asking for a new weapon after Mjolnir was destroyed by Hela in Thor: Ragnarok. Eitri explains that he was forced to create the Infinity Gauntlet for Thanos in exchange for sparing the Dwarves. Once they did so, Thanos went back on his word and proceeded to slaughter his entire race, leaving Eitri the only survivor. Thanos also took Eitri's hands so that the latter would be incapable of forging anything else even after Eitri replaced them with prosthetic hands. Thor, Groot, and Rocket all pitch in to help Eitri create the new weapon, an axe called Stormbreaker. When Eitri doesn't manage to find a handle for the axe, Groot gives up one of his arms for the purpose. ==References *Eitri at the Marvel Wiki Category:Male characters in comics Category:Male characters in film Category:Marvel Comics television characters Category:Fictional dwarves Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983 Category:Superhero film characters ","title":"Eitri (comics)"},{"id":"56904062","text":"Nabil Khalil (born 1962) is a Lebanese alpine skier.

The National Anthem Ordinance is an ordinance of Hong Kong intended to criminalise \\"insults to the national anthem of China\\" (\\"March of the Volunteers\\"). It is a local law in response to the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the National Anthem (the National Anthem Law). Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping made a speech regarding the national anthem legislation in early 2017. The ordinance commenced on 12 June 2020. ==Content== The ordinance consists of 6 parts . Part 1 serves as the preliminary, explicitly defining concepts such as “national anthem” and “national flag”. Part 2 dictates regulations regarding the playing and singing of the national anthem, for example compelling citizens to “stand solemnly and deport themselves with dignity” during the playing of the national anthem. Part 3 depicts the protection of the national anthem. It prohibits citizens from using the national anthem in certain settings, such as for commercial purposes or as background music. It also bans citizens from insulting the national anthem in any way, such as altering its lyrics or singing it in a distorted way. Part 4 concerns the promotion of the national anthem. It dictates that primary and secondary educations must incorporate the national anthem in their curriculum, including its singing, history and the etiquette regarding it. It also requires all sound and television broadcasters to play the national anthem when requested by the Communication Authority. Part 5 contains supplementary provisions. It states that in case of inconsistencies between this ordinance and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on National Anthem adopted by the NPC, this ordinance should be applied. Part 6 contains consequential amendments to other ordinances, for example adding passages regarding the use of national anthem to the Trade Marks Ordinance. ==Background== The Hong Kong-Central Government relations grew tenser following the 2014 Hong Kong protests and often lead to Hongkongers openly booing the Chinese national anthem at sporting matches. The first incident was during the match against the Maldives in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification at Mong Kok Stadium in June 2015, when the fans booed while the national anthem was played ahead of the game. The booing reoccurred during another match against Qatar in September 2015. FIFA issued a warning to the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) over the conduct of fans, and issued a fine of 5,000CHF to Qatar. The HKFA was fined for 10,000CHF (HK$77,150) again for booing the anthem before a home game against China on 17 November 2015. In response, the Chinese central government made known its intention to have a national anthem law applied to Hong Kong as well as the mainland, arguing it would help foster social values and promote patriotism. The law of the People's Republic of China on the National Anthem (the National Anthem Law) was adopted at the 29th session of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress (NPCSC) on 1 September 2017, and came into force on the Mainland on 1 October 2017. The law sets out rules to use the national anthem. It would bar use of the anthem in commercial advertisements, and require attendees at events to stand up straight \\"solemnly\\" when the anthem plays. Those who violate the new law, including those who modify the lyrics or mock the song or play it during \\"inappropriate\\" occasions, could be detained for up to 15 days or face criminal prosecution. On 4 November 2017, the NPCSC adopted the decision to add the National Anthem Law to Annex III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. In accordance with Article 18(2) of the Basic Law, the national laws listed in Annex III to the Basic Law shall be applied locally by way of promulgation or legislation by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). == Developments == On 8 January 2019, the Executive Council drafted the national anthem bill and submitted it to the Legislative Council (LegCo) two weeks later. After its first reading, the legislation process was successfully blocked by pro-democracy councillors, and later by months of social unrest caused by 2019–20 Hong Kong protests until its summer recess in July. After the start of the new session in October 2019, Starry Lee, a pro- establishment councillor, stepped down from her position of the chairperson of the House Committee in order to participate in re-election. Dennis Kwok, a legislator belonging to the Civic Party, thus presided over the committee as Deputy Chair. Pan-democratic legislators have since then employed a tactic some referred to as “filibustering”, holding lengthy discussions on issues such as the extent of authority the police force has within the LegCo building or the operation of LegCo under COVID-19, successfully delaying the re- election of chairperson. Since a chair must be elected in the House Committee before any bills can be discussed, the national anthem bill was effectively blocked. Starry Lee physically occupying the committee chair in LegCo while being protected by security guards and other pro-establishment legislators, on 8 May 2020. On 8 May 2020, Starry Lee, after declaring the authority to preside over a committee meeting to end the months-long legislation deadlock, physically occupied the vacant committee chair, citing her previous occupancy of the chair in 2019. Pro-Beijing lawmakers and security staff kept pro- democracy lawmakers at bay for the committee meeting, with Lee urging lawmakers to take their seats, stating \\"I have not seized power, I am the incumbent chairperson of the house committee\\". Scuffles broke out, with at least one pro-democracy lawmaker reportedly injured. Most of the pro-democracy lawmakers eventually walked out. Lee and LegCo legal adviser Connie Fung stated Lee could preside due to the abnormal situation where a chair had not been elected for six months due to filibustering by pro-democracy lawmakers. The director of Hong Kong Watch stated \\"The current logjam in LegCo is a direct result of a broken system where the only strategy that the democrats have, despite representing the majority, is filibustering.\\" Reports stated that Lee intends to criminalize disrespect of the Chinese national anthem, and also intends to re-attempt to introduce article 23 national security laws. On 28 May 2020, the bill passed its second reading. On 4 June 2020, the bill passed its third reading, with 41 legislators in favor of it and 1 against. 41 out of 42 pro-establishment legislators voted in favor of it, except the chairperson Andrew Leung who abstained. 1 out of 23 pan-democracy legislators voted against it, with the others abstaining, in protest. Before the voting, pan-democracy legislators Raymond Chan and Eddie Chu splashed a jar of reeking liquid in front of the rostrum in protest, accusing Andrew Leung of being a “rubber stamp” and that what he did will “reek for ten thousand years”. On 11 June 2020, the National Anthem Ordinance was signed by the Chief Executive Carrie Lam. It came into force on the next day after it was published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette. ==Concerns== Craig Choy of the Progressive Lawyers Group said it was impractical to expect all the waiters and customers at a local eatery to stand up when the national anthem is heard on TV, and suggested that local stations should stop playing it in order to avoid controversy. University of Hong Kong principal law lecturer Eric Cheung also said will be unrealistic to include a provision on requiring one to stand. He also said it \\"would be quite scary\\" if \\"you’d have to follow the ideology and expressions of socialism in mainland China.\\" Eric Cheung said that the \\"ideological\\" and \\"guidance\\" provisions of the government’s proposed national anthem law, including a clause stating that primary and secondary schools would need to teach pupils to sing and understand the history of \\"March of the Volunteers\\", was a \\"complete deviation\\" from common law norms. In the mainland version of the law, \\"secondary and primary schools shall regard the national anthem as an important component in education to promote patriotism, organise students to learn to sing the national anthem, and teach students on the history and spirit of the national anthem and to observe the etiquette for performing and singing the national anthem\\". Cheung said that if the provision is stated but it does not punish the offender, there may be those who deliberately engage in such an act and it would diminish the solemnity and dignity of the law. In response to the concerns and call for a white bill and public consultation, Chief Executive Carrie Lam dismissed it by stating that \\"I do not understand why one has to insist on the term 'public consultation',\\" calling the term only a \\"label\\". She also insisted the proposed bill only targets people who deliberately insult the national anthem and the residents not to worry about it. ==See also== * Act on National Flag and Anthem (in Japan) * China–Hong Kong football rivalry * Glory to Hong Kong ==References * Legislative Council Panel on Constitutional Affairs - Local Legislation to Implement the National Anthem Law Category:2020 in law Category:2020 in Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong legislation Category:Human rights in Hong Kong ","title":"National Anthem Ordinance"},{"id":"56904108","text":"Psoa maculata is a species of horned powder-post beetle in the family Bostrichidae.

Mohamud is the younger brother of the late Minister for Public Works and Reconstruction Abass Abdullahi Sheikh Siraji. == Early life and education == Born to a religious family, Mohamud spent a great deal of his life living in Dadaab Refugee camps of North Eastern Kenya. At a tender age of 3, Siraji's family moved to Kenya's Dadaab camps via Liboi seeking refuge from the civil war in Somalia. Born to strict religious parents, Siraji and his siblings have started Qur'anic school (Duksi) at an early age. It was long before he completed his Qur'anic studies and started learning the Islamic Jurisprudence also known as Fiq. Mohamud completed both his primary and secondary school in Dadaab, Ifo Refugee camps and later proceeded to Toronto, Canada to Study Bachelor of Commerce at York University. Siraji was a bright student and has completed at the top of his class both in primary and high school. Because of his high performance in the national exam, he was awarded a scholarship to study his bachelor's degree in Canada. == Politics == Even though Mohamud joined active politics after the assassination of his late brother, he was actively involved in student organizations and youth advocacy groups. He has been involved in student leadership both in high school and in university. He served in various roles ranging from VP Finance to president in student organization in university. After the assassination of his late brother, Abass Siraji, he decided to come back and serve his country. After a 9-month wait, he finally won the by-election on landslide on the 15th of Feb 2018. == Committees == Siraji held assignments on multiple committees e.g. House Committee on Budget, Finance, Planning, and Financial Oversight of Public Institutions, Committee on Food Security and Nutrition, East Africa Parliamentary Alliance on Food Security and Nutrition (EAPA FSN) and the Ad hoc Committee to complete the Elections Act === House Committee on Budget, Finance, Planning, and Financial Oversight of Public Institutions === On December 26, 2018, Mohamud Siraji was elected as the chairman of the House Committee on Budget, Finance, Planning, International Cooperation and Financial Oversight of Public Institutions. His election came after the former leadership of the committee has been disbanded after they submitted a controversial financial report that claimed that over $42 million have been lost through corruption. This, however, was later deemed to be incorrect report and the parliament apologized for the wrong report on the missing money. === Committee on Food Security and Nutrition === In October 2018, Siraji together with Hon. Abdi Ali attended The Global Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition held in Madrid, Spain. In this summit, Siraji gave a moving speech about the status of food security in his home country of Somalia and pledged to form a parliamentary group that will dedicate to advocating for food security and nutrition in Somalia. On his return to the country, Siraji together with Hon. Ali advocated for the formation of a parliamentary group dedicated in ensuring that the government allocates resources that will ensure food security and nutrition. In March 2019, Food Security and Nutrition Committee was formed with Siraji being a member. === East Africa Parliamentary Alliance on Food Security and Nutrition (EAPA FSN) === Following the Madrid meeting, Siraji pledged to form food security committee both in Somalia and the Region. This followed subsequent meetings in Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania and the ultimate formation of the East Africa Parliamentary Alliance on Food Security and Nutrition (EAPA FSN) This is a regional committee composed of all the East African countries. Somalia is represented by Hon. Siraji and Hon. Ali. The East Africa Parliamentary Alliance on Food Security and Nutrition (EAPA FSN) is currently chaired by Somalia's Hon. Abdi Ali Hassan == Bills Sponsored == Mohamud who is the chair of the Committee on Budget, Finance, Planning and Financial Oversight of Public Institutions, was awarded the best performing member of parliament by the speaker on the closing ceremony of the 6th session of the 10th parliament. In just under a year, Siraj tabled over 10 bills that have all been approved by both houses of the parliament. Some of the bills he sponsored are: Public Financial Management Act (PFM), Customs Act, Statistics Act, Revenue Management Act, Amendments to Procurement Act, The Audit Bill etc. === Public Financial Management (PFM) Act === Public Financial Management (PFM) Act is one of the benchmarks that was set for the government of Somalia in order to qualify for debt relief by the IMF. Siraji who was spearheading the legislative aspect of the SMP debt relief process, tabled the PFM act for debating and pushed for it until it was approved by both houses and signed into law by the president on 25th Dec. 2019 Public financial management (PFM) is critical to basic economic governance and essential in establishing the performance, legitimacy and accountability of functional states. Public financial management has to do with the effective administration of funds collected and spent by governments. It underlies all government activity and incorporates all components of a country's budget cycle including: * the mobilisation of revenue * the allocation of these funds to various activities * the expenditure and accounting for spent funds Ineffective public financial management systems hamper development and increase the risk of corruption. === Revenue Management Act === Just like the PFM act, the Revenue Management Act was a key element to the SMP debt relief benchmarks set by IMF and the World Bank in order for Somalia to qualify for debt relief. This act was controversial as all the member states unilaterally rejected it since they have not initially been consulted. This was an opportunity for the young Siraji to shine as he embarked on consultative meetings with the Federal Member states. This bill was tabled for 2nd and 3rd reading on the 26th of Oct. 2019 and within the course, the bill was as well approved by the upper house. On the 27th of Oct. 2019, the president signed the bill into an act === Statistics Act === Statistics Act was also an SMP benchmark that the Federal Government of Somalia has to meet before it can qualify for debt relief under the IMF/World Bank Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The Bill was approved on the third reading by the House of the People (HoP) of theparliament of Somalia on the 28th of October 2019 and the president signed the bill into law. == Role on Debt Relief == For Somalia to qualify the debt relief under the HIPC initiative, it had to do both structural and policy changes. The government of Somalia were required to streamline their public financial systems so that they can be entrusted with funds. For that to happen, a dozen number of bills all related to Finance had to be enacted into a law. While the actual decision eventually happened to be March 2020, the IMF and World Bank initially suggested to have the decision point pushed back to March 2021 because of their believe that it was almost impossible to pass all the necessary bills through the parliament. Siraji who was at the time the chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee took the sole responsibility to fast track the passage of those bills in both houses of the parliament. For a period of one year, Siraji and his committee tirelessly worked to meet all the benchmark set for the country in order to qualify the debt relief. As announced by the IMF on their website, Somalia successfully met all the benchmarks and a such, qualified to receive a debt relief under the HIPC process- thanks to Siraji and the team that worked to make this happen. == References == Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Somalian politicians ","title":"Mohamud Siraji"},{"id":"56904221","text":"Taewon Bang clan () was one of the Korean clans.

Even though he was a detective, he was also one of Shanghai's three major gangsters along with Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, who worked for the Green Gang. Despite the Gang's gradual collapse, Huang stayed in Shanghai until he died of illness in 1953. ==Early life== Huang was born in Suzhou but moved, at the age of 5, to Shanghai where his father opened a teahouse. He worked as an apprentice in a picture framing shop near the City God Temple. He later worked at his father's teahouse, where he developed connections with criminal and hustling patrons.

University of California Press. 1996. p.66 ==Career== Huang began his career for the French Concession in 1892 as a detective. He quickly rose to prominence as one of the leading detectives because he was able to solve many cases with assistance from the contacts he made in his father's teahouse. After an argument with his French officer, Huang briefly retired to Suzhou until he was brought back into the French police force based on his strength as a sleuth. His criminal influence grew as he organized drug trafficking, gambling dens, and granting \\"favors\\" to criminals. Each day, Huang held court to determine whether a felon should be turned over to the police. He married Lin Guisheng in 1900, who partly managed his opium dealings. Huang was introduced to Du Yuesheng who Huang appointed to run some of his opium dens. Crime in the French Concession increased as Huang had such a prominent position in the police force and organized most of the Green Gang's activity in this zone. Huang was dismissed from the police force in 1924 after he publicly beat the Shanghai Warlord's son. (downloadable PDF) He was arrested by the Shanghai Garrison, and only released after Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin negotiated and paid for his release. Huang stepped down from the police force but remained one of the Green Gang's bosses, which he formally joined in 1927. ==Later life== Huang Jinrong remained in Shanghai for the rest of his life, controlling the Green Gang. Together with Du, he worked with the Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the Communist movement in Shanghai in 1927.Young, Ronald. \\"Chiang Kai-shek Purges Communists\\".

She worked in the movement for several decades, and after experiencing the corruption and authoritarianism within the movement, she left in 2005 to form the Movement to Rescue Sandinismo (Movimiento por el Rescate del Sandinismo), known as El Rescate. == Biography == Baltodano was born in Leon, Nicaragua on August 14, 1954. She is one of nine children, two boys and seven girls. Her father was a lawyer and her mother was a shop owner. She attended Catholic school in La Pureza with her six sisters while her two brothers studied in La Salle. Her family moved to Managua in 1972 when her mother split from her father due to what she saw as a lack of acceptance of her involvement in the war. All of Baltodano's siblings were revolutionaries as well, with her sister Alma losing her hands while building a contact bomb at age 15 and her sister Zulemita losing her life in a bombing at age 16. Baltodano has four children of her own, including environmental lawyer and activist Mónica López Baltodano. == Political involvement == Baltodano became politically involved in high school when she worked on the campaign to free Doris Tijerino, a Sandinista revolutionary, from prison. She joined the Revolutionary Students Front, an armed group of young revolutionaries in 1972. Baltodano went underground with the Sandinista movement in 1974, compelled to action by the nation's declining political and economic conditions. In 1977 she was captured, arrested, and tortured for nine months while leading the North Front of the FSLN. After her release, she was put in charge of the capital, leading the movement's activities in Managua. By then a Guerrilla Commander, she led the final offensive of the revolution in 1979. When the war ended, Baltodano took a more political role and was appointed Secretariat of Mass Organizations. After several decades in the FSLN, Baltodano took issue with what she described as an authoritarian, vertical leadership style rife with corruption. Because of this, she left the party in 2005 to form the Movement to Rescue Sandinismo, known in Nicaragua as El Rescate. Baltodano was one of several FSLN women featured in the 2018 documentary ¡Las Sandinistas!. == References  Further reading == Global Feminisms Project at the University of Michigan Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Nicaraguan women in politics Category:Sandinista National Liberation Front politicians Category:People from León, Nicaragua ","title":"Mónica Baltodano"},{"id":"56904405","text":"Giannos Pipis (born 25 February 1966) is a Cypriot alpine skier.

The three partners were William Barton, George Irlam, and John Higginson. The firm made a practice of naming several of its vessels after the partners. Higginson may have joined the partnership around 1808. In that year the ownership of the ship Maxwell changed from Higginson to Barton & Co., and her master changed from J. Edwards to J. Irlam.Lloyd's Register (1809), seq.№M671. Although Liverpool was an important center for Britain's slave trade, and Barbados an important destination for slave ships, the partnership does not appear to have engaged in slave trading. Two of the vessels the partners bought had been slave traders, but were not once the partners bought them. Captain John Gillespie (or Gilespy) of Barton, the ship the partners purchased in 1810 and trading between Liverpool and Bridgetown, was involved in 43 transactions involving manumissions of slaves in Bridgetown between 1806 and 1818.Welch w/Goodridge (2000), p.89. The firm, however, did lend to Barbados plantations, all of which employed slaves. Sir William Barton, then head of Barton, Irlam and Higginson, died aged 70 in 1826. He had been knighted in 1816 when Mayor of Liverpool on presenting an address of congratulation to the Regent on the marriage of Princess Charlotte of Wales.Gentleman's Magazine Vol. 139 (1826) p. 189. When Barton died, Irlam and Higginson took up his shares in the vessel Higginson. George Irlam died before John Higginson, who died in 1834. His son Jonathon succeeded him as a partner in the firm. ==Bankruptcy== Fiat in Bankruptcy was issued on 13 November 1847 against Jonathan Higginson and Richard Deane of Liverpool carrying on business at Liverpool under the firm of Barton, Irlam and Higginson, and at Barbadoes under the firm of Higginson, Deane & Stott. Barton, Irlam and Higginson meet with considerable opposition in the Liverpool District Court of Bankruptcy. Reportedly, they had received a large quantity of sugar from Mr Hinds, of Barbadoes, in June 1847, pledged it in July for £20,000, and in August got a further advance of £30,000, at the same time owing Mr Hinds a large balance.accessed 12/10/2010 Courier (Hobart, Tasmania) 18 November 1848, p.4. When Barton, Irlam and Higginson failed it had liabilities of £850,119, of which the Royal Bank of Liverpool held £545,791.\\"A BANKRUPTCY ROMANCE\\" Tuapeka Times, Vol. 27, Issue 4298, 4 December 1895. (The bankruptcy occurred during the great railway panic of 1847 and the Bank suspended operations between 18 October and 1 December. It then operated until it finally failed in 1867.\\"The stoppage of the Liverpool Royal Bank\\" Sydney Morning Herald 26 December 1867, p.3. The bank's failure resulted in the failure of the White Star Line.) The Official Assignee announced in 1851 a dividend of 20s (sic) on the pound. Actually, the dividend amounted to 17s 6d in the pound. The bankruptcy was still underway in 1870. In 1895 the Official Receiver was still negotiating with Jonathan Higginson's widow Charlotte over stock of the North-Eastern Railway Co. Jonathon, who had died in 1859, had on his own account purchased shares in the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, with which the North-Eastern Railway Company later merged. At the time of the merger the value of the new shares in the merged railway was £3087. However, the railway never paid out the dividends accruing to those shares with the result that by 1895 the shares and accrued dividends were worth about £7000. Charlotte Higginson and the Receiver agreed to divide this amount, with Charlotte getting £3087 plus the last six years of accrued dividends, and the Receiver the remainder. The accounts of the Assignees were last reported audited in 1897. ==Ships== { class=\\"sortable \\" - ! Vessel name ! Tons (bm) ! Launched ! End year !

Police consider his disappearance to be suspicious and have categorized his disappearance as a homicide case. ==Background into disappearance== Michael Negrete was a popular freshman at UCLA on a music scholarship, living at Dykstra Hall. On 10 December, he had attended a party with friends on the floor he lived on, and had subsequently returned to his room. He then played an online video game with a friend in another room. At 4 AM, the game finished, and he left his room to congratulate the other player. He was last seen by the friend returning to his own room, and was never seen again. When Negrete's roommate woke up at 9 AM, Negrete was gone, but his clothing, shoes, wallet, keys and musical instruments were still there. Although there were allegedly witnesses who might have seen someone matching Negrete's description leaving the building at 4:35 AM, this was never substantiated. ==Police investigation== Police could not find any indication that Negrete had serious enemies, a secret life, depression, drugs or alcohol issues. They questioned Negrete's friends and other people living on his floor, but no one said they had seen Negrete since 4 AM. Although originally just a missing person case, it was soon upgraded to a homicide investigation. The only lead was one several students gave, of a Caucasian man who had been spotted on the floor on the night of Negrete's disappearance, whom no one could account for. Police released a sketch of the man and appealed for him to come forward, stressing that he was not under investigation and that they were unsure if his presence had anything to do with the case. However, no one ever came forward. Negrete did not have a car at UCLA, and LAPD bloodhounds appeared to trace his scent to a bus stop across campus. However, investigators subsequently said that the dogs were confused and the scent should not be trusted. Police searched the garbage chute and all the construction sites on campus, but found no trace of Negrete. More than 500 leads were submitted to the police, but nothing came of any of them. ==Subsequent developments== There has been no activity recorded on Negrete's credit cards since his disappearance. Several psychics stated that Negrete was alive, and provided his parents with his alleged locations, but in every case this turned out to be incorrect. Negrete's parents hired two private detectives to look into the matter in greater detail, and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to Negrete's whereabouts, which was never claimed. Island Fever, the band Negrete played trumpet for, held several fundraisers for his search. ==Theories== In 2013, Negrete's brother Steve, a member of the band Steam Powered Giraffe, stated that prior to his disappearance, Negrete had recently taken drugs including ecstasy and had attended raves. In his opinion, Negrete had, while under the influence of drugs, left the building and subsequently been abducted. It has also been suggested that Negrete's disappearance may have been linked to the illegal trade in human organs. ==In popular culture== Negrete's case featured on the FOX Television programme Million Dollar Mysteries. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared ==References== Category:1990 in California Category:1990s missing person cases Category:Missing person cases in California ","title":"Disappearance of Michael Negrete"},{"id":"56904750","text":"Cliff Moyo (born 6 April 1993) is a Zimbabwean international footballer who plays for Kidderminster Harriers as a defender. ==Early life== Moyo was born in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. His father Olbern was a musician and eventually settled in England with Moyo's mother. Moyo chose to remain in Zimbabwe with his grandparents where he attended Robert Tredgold Primary School. In 2002, at age nine, he moved to England to live with his parents in Stoke-on-Trent. ==Club career== After moving to England, Moyo began playing football at the age of thirteen for local youth club Duffield Dynamos and later played for Milton Express and Stone Dominoes in the Stoke area, also spending time on trial with Stoke City. He was chosen to represent the Staffordshire County team at the age of sixteen. He joined Barrow at the age of eighteen, signing a one-year deal, and began studying a sports science degree at Staffordshire University alongside playing football. His university commitments would eventually lead to his departure from Barrow in 2013 as he decided to take a three year break from the game after struggling to make the three hour journey from his home for training and matches due to his studies. Following his release from Barrow, he spent short spells with local sides Witton Albion, Trafford and Nantwich Town during his break. Following his graduation from university, Moyo joined Alfreton Town after featuring for the side in pre- season matches. He spent one season at the club before joining FC Halifax Town in 2016. His departure from Alfreton drew criticism from manager Nicky Law who claimed that Moyo had verbally agreed to sign a new deal with the club and that the player did not inform him of the move. In his first season with Halifax, he helped the club win promotion to the National League. Moyo later moved on to play for Guiseley. On 4 June 2019, Cliff Moyo signed for former Football League club Kidderminster Harriers ==International career== After playing for Staffordshire, he was called up to the England under-18 team. Moyo was called up by the Zimbabwe national team for the first time in March 2018. He made his debut in the semi-final of the 2018 Four Nations Tournament, during a penalty shootout defeat against hosts Zambia on 21 March 2018. In May 2018 he was called up to the Matabeleland football team for the 2018 ConIFA World Football Cup. However he did not travel with the final squad. ==References * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Zimbabwean footballers Category:Zimbabwe international footballers Category:Stone Dominoes F.C. players Category:Barrow A.F.C. players Category:Northwich Victoria F.C. players Category:Droylsden F.C. players Category:Witton Albion F.C. players Category:Trafford F.C. players Category:Nantwich Town F.C. players Category:Alfreton Town F.C. players Category:FC Halifax Town players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Association football defenders Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players ","title":"Cliff Moyo"},{"id":"56904782","text":"Giangiacomo Magnani (born 4 October 1995) is an Italian professional footballer.

The typical recipe for coddies includes mashed potatoes, eggs, salt, pepper, onions, crushed up saltine crackers, all formed into a patty with breading and deep fried. They also may include a small amount of salted cod fish. Coddies are usually eaten sandwiched between saltines with yellow mustard. The food is somewhat of a local delicacy in Baltimore, and is commonly served in the city's delicatessens and seafood markets, including the historic Lexington Market. Where coddies come from originally is unknown. One recipe dates back to the Czech region of Bohemia in the 1800s. Another theory traces them back to African-American slaves in the region during the same time period. However, they did not become available commercially until a Jewish merchant in Baltimore named Louis Cohen began selling them from a Bel Air market ice cream stand in 1910. The Cohen family then continued selling coddies from their own food stands until the 1970s. Despite limited availability these days, coddies were more widely sold in the Baltimore area throughout the 20th century. Locals recount that they used to be sold everywhere from drugstores to bowling alleys, and they were usually very cheap (sold for as little as a nickel during the 1960s). In fact, due to their cheap prices, coddies have been coined with the nickname \\"the poor man's crab cake\\", in reference to another Baltimore staple. Although they are more of a vintage snack, recipes for coddies can still be found on the Internet, and have even been featured in the Baltimore Sun. They are regarded by many Maryland locals as an important part of Baltimore's culture. == References == Category:African-American cuisine Category:African-American history in Baltimore Category:American snack foods Category:Cuisine of Baltimore Category:Cuisine of the Mid-Atlantic states Category:Czech-American culture in Baltimore Category:Food and drink in Maryland Category:Jews and Judaism in Baltimore Category:Jewish American cuisine Category:Maryland cuisine ","title":"Coddies"},{"id":"56904881","text":"Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources may refer to: *Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (Ghana) *Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (Zambia) ","title":"Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources"},{"id":"56904883","text":"Sohrab Uddin is a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician and the former Member of Parliament from Kushtia-3. ==Career== Uddin was elected to Parliament in 2001 from Kushtia-3 as a candidate of Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

It is 40 meters high and it was built in 1192, to defend the main entrance of the city. ==History== At the end of the war between Como and Milan in 1127 the Milanese, that won the conflict, tore down the ancient walls of the town, built during the Roman age. After the defeat Como decided to ally with the German Emperor Frederick I (called Barbarossa) to fight the Milanese supremacy in Lombardy. In 1154 the Emperor moved to Italy for the first time, and gave his consent to rebuild the defensive walls of Como (still visible around the town). Some years later, in 1192, the rulers of the town decided to strengthen the fortifications towards south, adding to the newly built walls three big defensive towers. The most impressive one, that assumed the role of main entrance of the town, was placed in the centre of the walls, right in front of the way to Milan, as a symbol of the independence of the town. In the 14th century the great tower was reinforced with a small ravelin housing some overhead artillery guns and flanked by two other smaller towers of pentagonal shape, which repeated the same pattern with arches open inwards. In the sixteenth century the tower was further reinforced with a semicircular bastion, but all these buildings are no longer visible nowadays. ==Description== Porta Torre (that literally means Tower Gate) is one of the better preserved romanesque style military buildings in Italy. The large square-shaped fortification has two entrance arches on the external façade, while just one, wider than the external ones, on the inside. The tower has a massive appearance on the outside, while on the side facing the city is lightened by four orders of coupled arches that corresponded to the four internal floors, which were made of wood and destroyed during the years. This probably had a strategic motivation: if the enemies had managed to occupy the tower they would have been exposed to an attack from the friendly troops from the internal side of the fortification, not fully repaired like the external one. The eight arches on the upper floors are off-axis with respect to the one, much larger one, located on the ground floor. At a short distance from the tower are the ruins of the ancient Roman walls of the town and a gate, probably dating back to the imperial era. These remains are called Porta Pretoria (literally meaning \\"main gate\\" in latin) although, traditionally, the door with this name should be on the east side of the walls. ==References* Category:Towers in Italy Category:Romanesque architecture in Lombardy Category:Buildings and structures in Como Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 12th century ","title":"Porta Torre"},{"id":"56904974","text":"The 2018 Svenska Cupen final was played on 10 May 2018 between Djurgårdens IF and Malmö FF at Tele2 Arena, Stockholm, the home ground of Djurgårdens IF, determined in a draw on 21 March 2018 after the semi-finals. The final was the culmination of the 2017–18 Svenska Cupen, the 62nd season of Svenska Cupen and the sixth season with the current format.

The draw for the final was held on 21 March 2018 at the annual pre-season kick-off meeting in Stockholm and decided that the final would be played at Tele2 Arena in Stockholm, the home venue of Djurgårdens IF. This was the first cup final to be hosted at the venue and the second consecutive final to be played on artificial turf. ==Background== The Allsvenskan clubs Djurgårdens IF and Malmö FF contested the final, with the winner earning a place in the second qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League. Since Malmö were qualified for the first qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League and Djurgården were qualified for the first qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League through their positions in the 2017 Allsvenskan, Sweden's fourth European place was given to BK Häcken as the 4th team of the 2017 Allsvenskan. Djurgården was given a place in the second qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League since they won the final. Djurgården played their first final since 2013 and their ninth in total. Malmö played their first final since 2016 and their 19th in total. Both clubs lost in their previous final appearances. Having met in 1951, 1975, and 1989, this was the fourth final to contest the two clubs. Malmö had won all of the prior meetings in the final of the competition. The 1989 final was notably the last time Malmö won the competition, Djurgården had last won a cup title in 2005.

He is currently the Malvin and Lea Bank Professor of Classics & Ancient Mediterranean Studies, Jewish Studies, and Linguistics at Penn State University, where he has taught since 2004. His main area of study is the Semitic language family, focusing on Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, and the modern languages of Southern Arabia, especially Mehri and Jibbali. He has also worked extensively on non-Semitic Jewish languages, as well as on Hebrew and Jewish manuscripts. At Penn State, he has taught numerous language courses (on Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, and Yiddish), as well lecture courses on the Bible, Jewish and Ancient Near Eastern literature, and the history of writing systems. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2016. ==Education== Rubin received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania (1998, 1999), and Ph.D. degree in Near Eastern languages and civilizations from Harvard University (2004). His M.A. thesis was titled \\"An Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of Egyptian and Semitic\\", and his PhD dissertation was titled \\"Studies in Semitic Grammaticalization\\". ==CareerWork on Modern South Arabian=== Some of Rubin's most significant contributions to the field of Semitics have been focused on the Modern South Arabian languages of Oman. His books, The Mehri Language of Oman (2010) and The Jibbali (Shaḥri) Language of Oman: Grammar and Texts (2014), were both the first grammars of those languages. The latter volume also included many texts, which were the first Jibbali texts published in over a century. His 2010 grammar of Mehri has been superseded by his Omani Mehri: A New Grammar with Texts (2018), which also includes over 100 texts. In addition to his grammars, he has published numerous articles on the Modern South Arabian languages. ===Work on Jewish languages=== In 2016, Rubin co-edited (with Lily Kahn) the Handbook of Jewish Languages. It includes descriptions of around 25 different Jewish languages, some of which (such as Israeli Amharic, Jewish Russian, and Jewish Malayalam) had been the subject of little to no previously published scholarship. Rubin's contribution on Judeo-Italian is the most comprehensive reference available on that language. Rubin and Kahn also wrote Jewish Languages from A to Z (2020), including chapters on more than 40 different languages, and aimed at a more general audience.

Campbell was born in Glasgow on 3 January 1897. He attended secondary school at the Glasgow Academy and continued to the University of Glasgow where he earned a Bachelor's degree in philosophy. He then entered the Balliol College in Oxford, where would eventually achieve a Doctor of Letters. The First World War began during his time at Oxford, and he set aside his studies to serve as an officer in the British Army, with the 10th Borders Regiment. Campbell was invalided out of the army (medically discharged) in 1917, and in 1924 he returned to the University of Glasgow as an Assistant Lecturer of Moral Philosophy, where he was given his Doctor of Letters following the 1931 publication of his first book, Scepticism and Construction. Between 1932 and 1938, he served as a Professor of Philosophy at the University College of North Wales in Bangor. After this, he returned to the University of Glasgow as a Professor of Logic and Rhetoric, a title he held until 1961. Between 1953 and 1954 Campbell gave his first Gifford Lecture at the University of St. Andrews, followed by another, which ran from 1954 to 1955. These lectures were compiled and released as his second publication, a book called On Selfhood and Godhood. In 1964, he was appointed Dean of Faculties at the University of Glasgow; a position he resigned from in 1966. In 1967 he released his third and final publication, entitled In Defense of Freewill. Campbell died in Callender, Perthshire, on 17 March 1974. == Philosophical work == Campbell was generally associated with the philosophical school of British Idealism, his philosophy having been strongly influenced by the writing of F.H. Bradley, one of British Idealism's pioneering figures. Unlike Bradley, Campbell supported the concept of free will, and this side of his work, most clearly outlined in his final book In Defence of Free Will, remains well circulated. Despite the lasting popularity of these findings, Campbell himself seems to have considered his writing on the topic of human cognition and its relationship to a ‘suprarational’, non-physical reality to be of equal importance; work which set the stage for his subsequent discussion of the will. It is on these former topics which he presented a pair of Gifford Lectures later compiled as the book On Selfhood and Godhood. === Campbell's view of the self === Campbell was a metaphysical pluralist who believed the world to be made up of many independently real things. This was an important way in which his work diverged from the teachings of Bradley, whose philosophy is generally regarded as a version of monism. Monism is a predominantly fatalist doctrine which does not tend to treat individual motivation as anything more than an illusion, claiming that everything – including our sense of self and an environment we perceive to be external – exists as part of a single supreme being. Bradley and many other idealist philosophers call this supreme being the ‘absolute’. While Campbell believed in a form of the absolute he called the ‘suprarational,’ he did not agree that each part of this greater whole was directly conjoined to every other in a way which disallowed independent movement. This deviation allowed Campbell to embrace the concept of free will later in his career, a step Bradley refused to take based on his belief in the interconnectedness of all things. Campbell expresses the ideas which support this stance most clearly in the Gifford Lecture later published as On Selfhood and Godhood, which begins in a study of human cognition. In On Selfhood and Godhood, Campbell gave a description of the self as an innate feature of human beings. He used two different terms to explain a feeling of individuality seemingly persistent to all humans: the ‘substantival self’ and the character. Campbell discussed the substantival self as something core to each person which determines their actions prior to the engagement of rational thought. This view echoes Aristotle's description of the soul as an indivisible kind of non-physical substance, as found in his Categories. To Campbell, the substantival self is the part of us that remains stable in the face of change, allowing us to remain the same as other less fundamental features are altered. The part of us that can be altered is what Campbell refers to as our character, which can also be roughly thought of as our personality. Through the substantival self's experience of the world, we develop manners of being which can be referred to in universal terms: one can be kind, for example, though this can change over time if they are treated in a way which encourages them to be more callous in their social interactions. These habits develop through experience and form the character, which grants us the ability to influence an environment defined by the common values that determine the state of natural things. Someone who can be kind has more mobility in the social world, for example, just as a rounder rock will roll faster down a hill than a more angular one of similar size. === Campbell's view of the self as a metaphysical entity === Campbell's view that we develop the characters which grant us influence in the world through engagement with it resembles David Hume’s (a famously anti-metaphysical philosopher) claim that the self is nothing more than a ‘bundle of perceptions’, or ways of understanding and interacting with the world derived solely from sensory experience. Revealed in this similarity, however, is a key contradiction between the work of Campbell and Hume. Hume considered one's experience of having a character composed as a bundle of perceptions to be the only thing responsible for our feeling of individuality. Without some internal locus for experiences, the self becomes something of an illusion, or at the very least a collection of accidental qualities determined from outside the individual. While such a character would be unique to an individual as something determined circumstantially – having occurred in a specific time and place – Hume's view of the self eschews any discussion of the individual as unique in their own right, before they are determined by quantifiable experience. Campbell supported his belief in the substantival self by calling it absurd to suggest – as Hume did – that the character is formed solely by our experience of the world as provided by sensory perception, with no input from any kind of pre-rational self. This, he argued, is fundamentally counterintuitive, as perception is generally understood to be an act whereby a perceiver perceives something, and must begin with them directing their attention towards the object of their perception. To imply that our characters are entirely determined by our experiences implies that our minds are wholly passive in the process of cognition, and that the objects of our perception are somehow acting on us so as to appear as concepts in our minds. Campbell made the comparison between Hume's view that the mind is passive and Plato's theory of the forms, which claims that the world is made up of non-physical values called forms, which accumulate as perceivable objects seemingly of their own volition. This is the kind of agency sense datum would need to have were the mind passive, and the comparison to Plato is piercing because Plato's philosophy is considered one of the earliest metaphysical doctrines, stating that the forms exist as non- physical determinants of the perceivable world. Discussion of non-physical entities is the kind of thought Hume made a strong habit of rejecting. Believing that it was patently illogical to assume that the sense datum responsible for our development of character could plant themselves in our consciousness from the outside, Campbell supported his view of the substantival self by claiming that it plays an active role necessary to our cognition. He thought that its role was to discern between things, and that without this internal capacity to make distinctions between the objects of our perception, we would be overwhelmed by raw sensory input. If one cannot recognise a difference between colours, they all look the same, for example. The same is true for shapes, scale, speed, and so on. Our consciousness and our ability to form conceptual understandings of the world seemingly relies on our ability to make judgements between things, and Campbell referred to this explanation as the ‘judgement theory of cognition’ (the concept of judgement as a trait indicative of an innate human feature had also been discussed by idealist philosophers prior to Campbell, including Bradley). The source of this ability would have to be itself uninfluenced by external circumstances and so could not have come from outside of us, making it a non-materially determined metaphysical entity. === Campbell's view of the self in relation to an absolute reality === While Campbell did not ascribe to Bradley's belief in an absolute reality which determines the course of all physical and non- physical activity, he did maintain a belief in a form of the absolute he called the ‘suprarational’: an objective non-physical reality which is the ultimate subject of our cognition, and which contains the ordering principles (time, shape, etc.) we access in order to understand and manipulate our material environment. He believed that we have access to these principles because the indivisible substantival self exists as a will, or volition, of the being responsible for creating them. Campbell refers to this being as God, though he believed that because the creator of the world would have to be a pure self, with no physical component, no collection of universal concepts designed to facilitate an understanding of the physical world (such as language) would be sufficient to describe it. This is because the creator of these principles would have to transcend all difference, existing outside a world defined by contradictory values which can be mentally conceptualised and are therefore accessible to rational thought. === Campbell's defence of free will === Campbell's belief in a being determinate of everything accessible to our rational thought might cause his philosophy to appear monistic (see above), although unlike many followers of F.H. Bradley, he maintained a view that humans possess agency—a trait definable as the ability to determine one's own actions independently of their natural environment, and without direct influence from a supreme being. This is a view Campbell maintained despite believing that our ability to conceptualise and alter things in the physical world exists because the substantival self is a volition of a supreme being. This view that our innate faculties for self-expression come about because our selves are reflections of the absolute also features in Bradley's idealism, however, Bradley called free will a “lingering chimera”, because his belief in the total interconnectedness of all things would make impossible any deviation from the plan of a supreme being responsible for creating them. In making a decision, one would either be influenced by desires of the character, as formed through interaction with a physical world created by a supreme being, or would be more directly empowered by the supreme being to overcome these baser desires. Campbell disagreed with Bradley's brand of metaphysical determinism, referring to two categories of causation: ‘agent’ and ‘event’ causation. Event causation is the only kind of causation accepted by Bradley, and refers to any situation where one's actions are defined by a pre- determined causal chain. If one person stumbles into another, for example, and that person pushes a third in an attempt to recover, that second person cannot reasonably be said to have chosen to push the third person. Bradley's philosophy is determinist because it suggests that everything we do occurs this way; that the course of all action is already determined according to the will of an absolute being. Even if a person believes that they are pushing someone intentionally, Bradley would suggest that the force of that intention was provided by the absolute. Campbell however, believed that one person could choose actions of their own accord, using a capacity for independent thought resulting in movement, or agent causation. Campbell believed that we have the freedom to make moral decisions, and that when we resist other reasons to act, and instead act according to a sense of duty, we are exercising this faculty for agent causation which Bradley only considered available to a supreme being. This resistance of physically determined temptation comes as a result of what Campbell called an ‘effort of will,’ whereby we prioritise a moral impulse of the self over desires of the character, which are often far stronger and provide what he calls as a ‘path of least resistance’ for the resulting action. He believed that it was entirely up to us when we engaged in this effort, and that we can refer to our experience of having done so as introspective evidence that we were, at those times, legitimately torn between two options and made the choice to engage in an effort of will and carry out the morally righteous action when we could have very easily done otherwise. == Publications == * Campbell, C.A.

On September 10, 2018, the film held its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival as a featured selection in the \\"Special Presentations\\" series of films. That same day, the official trailer for the film was released. ===Controversy=== Ahead of the film's release, Diane Foley, the mother of slain journalist James Foley, expressed criticism of the film. Although the production team contacted and spoke to Foley during the production process, she felt the plot of the film was inappropriate and misleading in its retelling of events from her and her late son's lives. In the process of being consulted for the film, Foley shared details about the process of locating and negotiating for the release of her son. Foley thinks that although director Maryam Keshavarz claims to have made a fictional work, she used and unfairly manipulated details of her personal life to produce a dramatic story. ==Reception== The film was met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 36% approval rating with an average rating of 5.13 out of 10 based on 33 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Viper Club benefits from Susan Sarandon's committed lead performance, but a treacly script robs this geopolitical drama of any bite.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 57 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" ==References * Category:2018 films Category:American films Category:American drama films ","title":"Viper Club"},{"id":"56905386","text":"The 1967–68 Yorkshire Football League was the 42nd season in the history of the Yorkshire Football League, a football competition in England. ==Division One== Division One featured 13 clubs which competed in the previous season, along with four new clubs, promoted from Division Two: *Denaby United *Hull Brunswick *Stocksbridge Works *York City reserves ===League table=Map=Division Two== Division Two featured twelve clubs which competed in the previous season, along with five new clubs. *Clubs relegated from Division One: **Harrogate Town **Scarborough reserves **Sheffield *Plus: **Lincoln United, joined from the Lincolnshire Football League **Thackley, joined from the West Yorkshire League ===League table=Map=League CupFinal=References== Category:1967–68 in English football leagues Category:Yorkshire Football League ","title":"1967–68 Yorkshire Football League"},{"id":"56905389","text":"Resource Unit (RU) is a unit in OFDMA terminology used in 802.11ax WLAN to denote a group of 78.125 kHz bandwidth subcarriers (tones) used in both DownLink (DL) and UpLink (UL) transmissions. With OFDMA, different transmit powers may be applied to different RUs. There are maximum of 9 RUs for 20 MHz bandwidth, 18 in case of 40 MHz and more in case of 80 or 160 MHz bandwidth. The RUs enables an Access Point station to allow WLAN stations to access it simultaneously and efficiently. ==Description== Subcarriers In the older WLAN standard (802.11ac) only single-user station is allowed to transmit (uplink transmission) at one point in time, although multi-user downlink (DL-MU-MIMO) from AP to Non-AP stations has been supported through MIMO beamforming. The more stations active in the network, the longer the stations need to wait before allowed to transmit, hence the overall wireless traffic gets slower. 802.11ax WLAN is the first WLAN standard to use OFDMA to enable transmissions with multiple users simultaneously (it is called High Efficiency Multi Users [HE-MU] Access). In OFDMA, a symbol is constructed of subcarriers where the total number defines a Physical Layer PDU bandwidth. Each user is assigned different subsets of subcarriers to achieve simultaneous data transmission in MU (Multi-Users) environment. The more subcarriers are used, the longer their symbol rate is, which means that the overall rate of information remains the same. For example, in 20 MHz OFDMA bandwidth there is a total of 256 subcarriers (tones) which are grouped in sub-channels (or Resource Units). There are three subcarrier types used in OFDMA WLAN: # Data subcarrier; used for actual data transmission # Pilot subcarrier; used for phase information and parameter tracking # Unused subcarrier which is neither data nor pilot subcarrier. This includes DC, Guard band and null subcarriers. There are a few RUs currently defined: 26-tone RU, 52-tone RU, 106-tone RU, 242-tone RU (primary channel), 484-tone RU, 996-tone RU and 2x996-tone RU. For example, for basic 20 MHz bandwidth, nine 26-tone RUs can be used, but only four with 52-tone RUs. RU locations in 40 MHz HE PPDU For example, when an AP supports 52-tone RUs for its 20-MHz bandwidth, four users can transmit and/or receive simultaneously to the AP (each uses 52-tones, but the total bandwidth for all users must be less than or equal the whole 20-MHz full allocated bandwidth). This scheme increases efficiency, compared to older method (802.11ac) where only a single user can transmit (uplink transmission) at a time (it uses the whole allocated 20 MHz bandwidth), while the rest must wait their turn. When there is only one user in the network, if necessary it can still use the whole 20-MHz bandwidth by operating at 242-tone RU to reach higher data rate. A 52-Tone RU consists of 48 data subcarriers and 4 pilot subcarriers. 106-tone RU consists of 102 data subcarriers and 4 pilot subcarriers, while A 242-tone RU consists of 234 data subcarriers and 8 pilot subcarriers. A 484-tone RU consists of 468 data subcarriers and 16 pilot subcarriers, A 996-tone RU consists of 980 data subcarriers and 16 pilot subcarriers and A 2x996-tone RU consists of two 996-tone RUs, each located at each half of the PPDU bandwidth for 160 MHz and 80+80 MHz HE PPDU formats. For backward compatibility, when a 802.11ax-capable station communicates with non-802.11ax-capable station both stations can only use 242-Tone-RU (the entire primary channel). To achieve that, both management and control frames must still be transmitted over standard OFDM subcarriers of the entire primary channel as well by both stations. {  +Maximum number of RUs for each Channel Bandwidth (CBW) !RU Type !CBW20 !CBW40 !CBW80 !CBW80+80 and CMW160 - 26-Tone RU 9 18 37 74 - 52-Tone RU 4 8 16 32 - 106-Tone RU 2 4 8 16 - 242-Tone RU 1 2 4 8 - 484-Tone RU N/A 1 2 4 - 996-Tone RU N/A N/A 1 2 - 2x996 Tone RU N/A N/A N/A 1 } {  + !RU !Data Subcarriers !Pilot Subcarriers - 26-Tone RU 24 2 - 52-Tone RU 48 4 - 106-Tone RU 102 4 - 242-Tone RU 234 8 - 484-Tone RU 468 16 - 996-Tone RU 980 16 - 2x996 Tone RU 1960 0 } Resource Units allocation is also used in MIMO transmission to enable multiple users to use MIMO at the same time. ==Uplink Transmission== A new mechanism for uplink transmission (UL) from multiple Non-AP stations simultaneously to AP station is introduced in 802.11ax which is called Triggered Uplink Access (TUA). This new mechanism relies on a new type of 802.11 MAC frame called Trigger Frame sent by AP station. An HE-enabled AP station first solicits a trigger frame to non-AP HE- enabled stations to initiate OFDMA or MU-MIMO transmissions before other non- AP stations start sending. This frame identifies non-AP stations participating in the UL MU transmissions and assigns RUs to these stations. Each non-AP station receiving the trigger frame sends its own HE TB PPDU back to AP using the assigned RUs. They may send Null-Data frames if there is no actual data to send at the moment. ==Downlink Transmission== AP station holds the RU allocation information for every peer Non-AP station associated with it, so it simply sends frames using downlink MU-MIMO (using multiple antennas with the signal beamformed to a specific station), DL OFDMA (RU allocations) technique or combination of the two techniques. == See also == * Frequency-division multiple access * Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), a.k.a. linearly precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA) ==References * IEEE 802.11 working group * Official timelines of 802.11 standards from IEEE Category:Computer- related introductions in 1997 Category:Local area networks Category:Wireless networking standards Category:IEEE 802.11 ","title":"Resource Unit"},{"id":"56905395","text":"Aloha is a genus of planthopper named by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1904. , ten species are recognized: * Aloha artemisiae — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha campylothecae — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha dubautiae — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha flavocollaris — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha ipomoeae — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha kirkaldyi — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha lycurgus — Marquesas Islands * Aloha myoporicola — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha plectranthi — Hawai'ian Islands * Aloha swezeyi — Hawai'ian Islands ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Insects of Hawaii Category:Fauna of the Marquesas Islands Category:Delphacini Category:Taxa named by George Willis Kirkaldy ","title":"Aloha (bug)"},{"id":"56905410","text":"The 1978 Humboldt State Lumberjacks football team represented Humboldt State University during the 1978 NCAA Division II football season.

The parade has been held with breaks since 1963, and is presided by the President of Cuba in his capacity as commander in chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and (at times) First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (from 2006 to 2008 and from 2017 onwards, the posts have been held by separate people). With the veterans of the Revolution, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the international deployments of the Armed Forces during the Cold War, active personnel of the armed forces and their families, the diplomatic corps, citizens of Havana and pro-Cuba solidarity groups in the stands, as guest of honor, he arrives at 7:55 am for the parade proper at the José Martí Memorial's general saluting base, where he is received by the members of the Council of Ministers and the Council of State, the leadership and deputies from the National Assembly of People's Power, and Party officials. As the President arrives, the National Anthem (La Bayamesa) is played by the massed military bands provided by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Military Bands Department and a 21-gun salute is fired by the artillery battery of the Ceremonial Unit of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. This is followed by the review of the parade formations, which are led by either an Army Corps General or a Divisional General, by the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, a billet of an general officer holding the rank of Army Corps General. As the report is made by the parade commander, the Minister responds by informing the President of the commencement of the ceremony. As the vehicles of both the parade commander and the parade reviewing officer pass the tribune, the parade formations, which are massed west of the square along the Avenida Paseo fronting the National Theater, present arms as the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces' vehicle approaches the ground and mobile columns. The ground column formations of an estimated 8,900 personnel are from units of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, while units from both organizations are at the rear providing the crews for the mobile column of around 550 vehicles and 1,800 crewmen, and behind them are the civilian formations forming up the demonstration segment following the parade proper. As the Minister's vehicle and that of the parade commander both halt in front of the formations, he greets the formations assembled: The parade responses with a loud Venceremos and the band then strikes up to the Yorckscher Marsch as the vehicles carrying the parade commander and the reviewing officer both return to the square. The keynote holiday address then follows. In recent parades, the University Youth Federation president addressed the nation from the saluting base. ===Historical segment === Following this, the parade begins with the historical segment. As the trumpeters of the Armed Forces Massed Bands sound a bugle call, the mounted ceremonial horse guards battalion of the Revolutionary Army, wearing uniforms of the Cuban Mambisa cavalry (Caballeria Mabisa) of the Cuban War of Independence, trot past the saluting dais as the combined bands plays march music. As the mounted squadron passes by the saluting base the officers salute and the troopers present their machetes at the charge position, honoring the cavalrymen who fought during the conflict. Following them is a contingent of Jose Marti Pioneer Organization Pioneers in the 5th and 6th grades escorting a replica of the Granma, the fast yacht whose landing in 1956 sparked the outbreak of the Revolution and the birth of the modern day Revolutionary Armed Forces. In the parade of 2017, the yacht contingent was followed by youth reenactors in three columns wearing uniforms of the guerilla combatants of the revolutionary period, carrying weapons used during those years. This is followed by the Bay of Pigs invasion segment, which begins with middle and high school level Pioneers escorting a T-34 medium tank and a SU-100 self-propelled gun, followed by a 2nd youth contingent wearing uniforms and weaponry used, followed by the living veterans of the Cuban forces deployed during that period. Then comes two civil contingents, one honoring the 1961 Cuban Literacy Campaign final march to Havana's city center by thousands of participating youths and teachers, and a children's theater trope. === March past proper === The finale of the historical segment is followed by the parade commander ordering the parade to march past in the following manner: ::Parade... attention!

Bomanji was one of a wealthy family based in Bombay (now Mumbai), who eventually settled in England, becoming a pillar of British society. He divided his time between India and a house in Windsor and estate in Harrogate. Pineheath, the Bomanji's Harrogate house, was sold in 2013. == Family == His wife was the Lady Frainy Bomanji (14 September 1893 – 1986) also known as Lady Harrogate and his adopted daughter Mehroo, a niece of Lady Bomanji (died 12 July 2012). Lady Bomanji founded The Friends Of The Festival and was its president (1971-1973). Notable portrait painter Trevor Stubley's portrait of Lady Bomanji is held by Sheffield City Art Gallery.. == Philanthropy == Bomanji gave generously to charities which supported ex-servicemen and war widows following the First World War, and included Field Marshal Douglas Haig (1861-1928), Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone amongst his social circle. He also kissed Greta Garbo's forehead after outbidding everyone for charity. In 1892-93, he established Olympia Race Course in Matheran, Maharashtra. In 1906, he bought lease of 161 (formerly 61) Holland Park Avenue for Eugen Sandow (1867-1925), a Victorian strongman who was colossally famous in his day and possessed what was deemed to be the most perfect male body. This grand four-storey end-of-terrace house was named Dhunjibhoy House – was his home for 19 years. In 1922, he built a model of Rotten Row, Hyde Park on his estate in Windsor to provide work for 250 unemployed men. In 1923, he gave a statue of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, by George Edward Wade to Edinburgh Corporation. It is now in Edinburgh Castle. In 1929, Zoroastrian House was purchased at 11 Russell Road, Kensington for £7500, with major donation of £6,000 from Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Frainy Bomanji. == Death == He died in Bombay on 1 April 1937. == Knighthood == He was knighted in 1922 after using his enormous wealth to support Britain’s fight against Germany during the First World War. == Commemoration == A French marble statue sculpted by Charles Raphael Peyre was erected in the public gardens on Montpellier Hill, Harrogate in honour of Mehroo Jehangir and Lady Frainy Bomanji.

A representative of the group was cultivated. The Asgard superphylum represents the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, which possibly emerged from an ancestral lineage of Asgardarchaeota after assimilating bacteria through the process of symbiogenesis. == Discovery == In the summer of 2010, sediments from a gravity core taken in the rift valley on the Knipovich ridge in the Arctic Ocean, near the so-called Loki's Castle hydrothermal vent site, were analysed. Specific sediment horizons previously shown to contain high abundances of novel archaeal lineages, were subjected to metagenomic analysis. In 2015, an Uppsala University-led team proposed the Lokiarchaeota phylum based on phylogenetic analyses using a set of highly conserved protein-coding genes. Through a reference to the hydrothermal vent complex from which the first genome sample originated, the name refers to Loki, the Norse shape-shifting god. The Loki of mythology has been described as \\"a staggeringly complex, confusing, and ambivalent figure who has been the catalyst of countless unresolved scholarly controversies\\", analogous to the role of Lokiarchaeota in the debates about the origin of eukaryotes. In 2016, a University of Texas-led team discovered Thorarchaeota from samples taken from the White Oak River in North Carolina, named in reference to Thor, another Norse god. Additional samples from Loki's Castle, Yellowstone National Park, Aarhus Bay, an aquifer near the Colorado River, New Zealand's Radiata Pool, hydrothermal vents near Taketomi Island, Japan, and the White Oak River estuary in the United States led researchers to discover Odinarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota, and following the naming convention having been established to use Norse deities, the archaea were named for Odin and Heimdallr, respectively. Researchers therefore, named the superphylum containing these microbes “Asgard”, after the realm of the deities in Norse mythology. In January 2020, scientists reported that Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum, a member of Lokiarcheota, may be a possible link between the simple prokaryotic microorganisms and the complex eukaryotic microorganisms occurring approximately two billion years ago. == Description == Asgard members encode many eukaryotic signature proteins, including novel GTPases, membrane-remodelling proteins like ESCRT and SNF7, a ubiquitin modifier system, and N-glycosylation pathway homologs. Asgard archaeons have a regulated actin cytoskeleton, and the profilins and gelsolins they use can interact with eukaryotic actins. They also seem to form vesicles under cryoEM. Some may have a PKD domain S-layer. ===Metabolism=== Asgard archaea Phyla.pngMetabolic pathways of Asgard archaea, variation by Phyla Asgard archaea in various environments.pngMetabolic pathways of Asgard archaea, variation by environment Asgard archaea are obligate anaerobes. They have a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and perform glycolysis. Members can be autotrophs, heterotrophs, or phototrophs using heliorhodopsin. One member, Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum, performs syntrophy with a sulfur-reducing proteobacteria and a methanogenic archaea. The RuBisCO they have are not carbon-fixing, but likely used for nucleoside salvaging. == Classification == The phylogenetic relationship of this group is still under discussion. The relationship of the members is approximately as follows: The Heimdallarchaeota are considered the deepest branching Asgard archaea. The Eukaryotes may be sister to the Heimdallarchaeota or the Asgard archaea. A favored scenario is syntrophy, where one organism depends on the feeding of the other. In this case, the syntrophy may have been due to the Asgard archaea having been incorporated in an unknown type of bacteria, developing into the nucleus. An α-proteobacterium was incorporated to become the mitochondrion. ==References * Traci Watson: The trickster microbes that are shaking up the tree of life, in: Nature, 14 May 2019 Category:Archaea Category:Superphyla ","title":"Asgard (archaea)"},{"id":"56905837","text":"Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back is an American reality television program which premiered on Fox on June 13, 2018.

From 1957 to 1963 he studied at the Odessa National Maritime Academy, with a speciality as engineer-mechanic. Roman began his career at the Odessa plant Poligrafmash, where he works now. There is only one entry in his workbook. In 1959, Roman married. In 1992 Roman became a member of the international organization of former ghetto prisoners and concentration camps, which was founded in Odessa in 1991. Currently, he remains a permanent and active member of the organization. In 1991, at the first Congress, the members of the international organization decided to create a regional Association of former prisoners of ghettos and concentration camps, and the headquarters of the international Union was moved to Moscow. In 1991 the Odessa regional Association of the former prisoners of the ghetto was created, where Roman was Deputy Chairman, which at that time was Leonid Sushon. In 2002, at the Odessa regional conference, dedicated to the results of the Association, Roman was elected Chairman of the Association, the head of which he is to date. He contributes to the annual festive events, in the Prokhorovsky square, dedicated to the International day of remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust, which the whole world celebrates on January 27. The International day of liberation of concentration camp prisoners is celebrated annually on April 12, as well as holding events on the topic of the Holocaust at the Jewish cultural center «Beit Grand», educational activities in schools, universities and on television. He is a guest of honor at conferences on an international level, dedicated to the topic of the Holocaust. He is actively involved in the development and improvement of the Museum Holocaust's, which was created and opened by the Association of prisoners in 2009. == Memories of the Holocaust == In 1941 the whole of Ukraine was occupied by German and Romanian troops. In the early days of the outbreak of war Roman's father and older brother went to the front. In early July, his mother, with her eight young children, tried to evacuate. After two weeks attempts at evacuation, they were forced to return home, because of active offensive fascist troops. In late July, early August in Bershad the Germans came. And in early September by the decree of the commandant of the German administration, two ghettos were organized in the territory of the city, in one of which was Roman's family. In the Bershad ghetto Jews were deported from Bessarabia and nearby areas of the Vinnytsia region. The total number of Jews amounted to 25,000 people. For the period from June 1941 until March 1944 German and Romanian fascists killed 13,871 Jews. During the occupation in 1942, an operation on repair of the bridge across the river Dohno, at the hands of Romanian caretakers one of Roman's older brothers was shot. Slightly later this history formed the basis of one of the films of the Israeli film director Boris Maftsir. Intolerable living conditions in the ghetto has left its mark for life. On March 29, 1944 the city of Bershad was liberated by the Red Army. In 1945, after the liberation of Europe from the fascist plague, the Roman's father was mobilized from Berlin for the war. He returned home only in 1946, after the Red Army defeated fascist Japan. Roman's elder brother joined the army and did not return. It was only in 1953 that his family received notice of his death, in which it was claimed that he died heroically on the Northern front, defending Leningrad. His name is recorded in the \\"Black Book\\", a compilation of documents and testimonies of Jewish victims of the Holocaust edited by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg. == Rewards == *The Order \\"For merits\\" of 1rd degree *The Order \\"For merits\\" of 2rd degree *The Order \\"For merits\\" of 3rd degree *The Order for labour distinction *The Order \\"The Deserved machine engineer\\" *Mark of distinction in front of Odessa *Jubilee medal for the State and International merit *Badge of honor the mayor of Odessa \\"Labour glory\\" == Public activity  Odessa regional Association of former ghetto prisoners and concentration camps === In Odessa the first constituent Congress was created, in which was created the International Union of Jews - former prisoners of ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. And only a few years later such associations opened in Kiev and Moscow. In 1991 the Odessa regional Association of the former prisoners of the ghetto and concentration camps was created. The main purpose of the Association is to unite Jews-former prisoners of the ghetto and Nazi concentration camps, during the Second World War, protect their rights and freedoms, coordinate the activities of the associations, located on the territory of Odessa and Odessa region. The objectives of the Association: countering fascism, extremism and other manifestations of racial discrimination, identification of places of mass destruction of Jews during the Second World War, perpetuating the memory of genocide victims, perpetuation and search of people, saving Jews, in order to grant them the title of Righteous among the Nations of the world. === Monuments to the victims of the Holocaust === Particular mention should be made of the activities of the Chairman of the Odessa regional organization of former prisoners of ghetto and concentration camps, Roman Shvartsman: through his efforts it became possible to establish in Odessa, the Odessa region and Nikolayev region area more than thirty monuments and memorials, dedicated to the memory of Jews, destroyed in the Disaster. In memory of the victims of the Holocaust on the Lustdorf road, 27 a Memorial complex was built; each year on 23 October a mourning rally occurs. In this place was found three additional sites with remains, and probably there are two more. Romanian and German occupiers burned 25,000 Jewish children, women, and elderly people. As Roman Schwartzman commented:» In Prokhorovsky Square, on the site of the Holocaust memorial (road of death), created by the prisoner of the Bogdanovka ghetto, Yakov Maniovich, under the guidance of Roman Shvartsman events are constantly held for the care of monuments and the alley of the Righteous Among the Nations. In 2016 in the town of Balta, on central square the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was opened, a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust and the Righteous of the Nations of the world, including Queen Elena of Romania. The monuments are also open in the village of Domanevka, Bogdanovka village, in the city of Belgorod-Dniester, in the city of Savran, the city of Tarutino and many others settlements of the territory of Transnistria. According to Roman Shvartsman, about 240,000 Jews were killed by the Nazis in the territory of Transnistria. In 2015 in the village of Gvozdavka 2 a mass grave was discovered with the remains of about 3,500 Jews. Later a memorial sign was placed there. In an interview with the Associated Press, Roman Shvartsman said: === The creation of a Museum of the Holocaust === Holocaust museum The official opening of the Holocaust Museum in Odessa took place on June 22, 2009. The Chairman of the Association of former concentration camp prisoners and ghetto, Roman Shvartsman noted: For the time being the Museum presents more than 4,000 exhibits. A few years after the opening, the Museum was visited by about 20,000 people from around the world: ambassadors, diplomats, leaders of the city and region, students and schoolchildren and just people, who remember or want to know about that terrible tragedy, which is called the Holocaust. == See also == *Six candles were lit in Odessa *In memory of the Jews-tarutintsev *Sorrowful lullaby *Memory of Holocaust victims honored in Odessa *In memory of the victims of the Holocaust == References == Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Living people Category:1936 births Category:People from Bershad Category:Odessa Jews Category:Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Roman Shvartsman"},{"id":"56905909","text":"Elections to the Adur District Council were held on 5 May 1983, with one third of the council up for election.

At the Ballyfermot club Markey played alongside future League of Ireland players Max Kouogun, Josh Collins and Derek Daly among others. Markey's form for the Orchard attracted interest from St Patrick's Athletic, who signed him for their under 19's side ahead of the 2014–15 season. This turned out to be a terrific season for both Markey as he won the league's Player of the Season award and also for the team as they won the Under 19 SSE Airtricity League with a 3–2 win over Derry City under 19's in the final at Maginn Park. The team included several players that broke through to the St. Pat's first team and beyond in the League of Ireland and English Football Leagues, including Jamie McGrath, Rory Feely, Jack Bayly, Fuad Sule and Paul Rooney. ===St Patrick's Athletic=== 2015 season Ahead of the St Patrick's Athletic senior team's 2015 season, Markey was called up to the first team for the season, given the number 21 shirt, he would also remain with the under 19's while still eligible. He made his first team debut on 9 February 2015, aged just 17 years old, when he came off the bench in a 7–0 win at home to Tolka Rovers in the Leinster Senior Cup. Markey made late substitute appearances in the President's Cup away to Dundalk and the first game of the 2015 League of Ireland Premier Division season away to Shamrock Rovers, his first Dublin Derby. Markey went on to make a further 5 appearances in the first team that season. 2016 season In January 2016, Markey went on trial with Scottish Premier League champions Celtic, scoring in a trial game vs Kilmarnock. Nothing came of the move as Markey decided to take up the scholarship offer between St Pat's and NUI Maynooth, taking up a degree in finance at the college. To secure the degree, Markey would have to get the necessary points on his Leaving Cert, which he sat in June 2016. With the importance of his studies having to come before his football, the first half of 2016 turned out to be less productive for Markey as he made 7 league appearances and two league cup appearances that season (all 9 coming on from the substitutes bench) as Pat's won the 2016 League Cup. 2017 season Markey changed squad number to the number 14 ahead of the 2017 season. On 17 April Markey made his first start for the first team in a win over Bray Wanderers in the League Cup. He then made his first league start 4 days later against Cork City at Richmond Park. His performances in these games stood out and earned him plaudits from fans, pundits and most importantly manager Liam Buckley, who kept him in the starting 11. He was nominated for the League of Ireland Premier Division Player of the Month for May 2017 but just lost out to Ryan Delaney. He went on to make a total of 18 league appearances, 22 in all competitions and his form in those games saw him voted as St Patrick's Athletic Young Player of the Year by the club's fans. 2018 season Markey's shirt number changed again to number 15 ahead of the 2018 season. He started the season out of the starting 11, having to come off the bench in the first few games but regained his spot in the Attacking midfielder role in the 0–0 draw with Dundalk. He scored his first senior goal on 15 May 2018 in a 5–2 win over Derry City at Richmond Park. His next goal came on 10 August when he opened the scoring in a 5–0 win over Inchicore Athletic in the FAI Cup First Round. The season proved to be a disappointment for his side as they missed out on European football once again, which saw the departure of Liam Buckley as manager. On a personal level for Markey however, the season was another big step in his development, making 36 appearances and scoring 2 goals. 2019 season Following on from a full season as a regular starter, Markey was given the number 8 shirt for the 2019 season. Markey had to wait until 15 March 2019 for his first appearance of the season under new manager Harry Kenny, coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 loss away to Waterford. He had to wait a month for his next appearance, making his first start of the season in a 1–1 draw away to Cork City. From then on he remained a mainstay in the team and on 17 May he scored his first goal of the season, opening the scoring in the Dublin derby against Bohemians with a looping header over James Talbot in the 40th minute.https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/match/st-patricks-athletic- vs-bohemians/id-025K469U30000000VUM100GLVVH56HPG Markey saw his first taste of European football when he came off the bench away to IFK Norrköping of Sweden in a UEFA Europa League Qualifier, assisting Conor Clifford's goal in a 2–1 loss for Pat's. With the side struggling in front of goal, manager Harry Kenny was replaced by Stephen O'Donnell following a shock cup exit to UCD in late August and in O'Donnell's first match, Markey scored in a 2–1 win away to Finn Harps on 6 September 2019.https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/match/finn-harps- fc-vs-st-patricks-athletic/id-025K46ADNK000000VUM100GLVVH56HPG He finished the season with 30 appearances and 2 goals in all competitions. ==International career== Markey played for the Republic of Ireland U17 and Republic of Ireland U18 team as well as the Republic of Ireland schools team, which he was called up to for his performances for his school, Coláiste Phádraig in Lucan.

They wanted the game to look like a storybook, and used Boulton's work as he had already been developing watercolour-inspired rendering techniques. Burdak suggested the inspiration of children's books. The trio grew up in regional Victoria, and aimed to make a game that looked like the places they knew. The watercolour art style is reminiscent of nature-centric Australian children's books like Blinky Bill, Diary of a Wombat and Possum Magic. Reflecting on their time at RMIT, Burdak explained: \\"“It has a supportive community, which allowed us to experiment and create a game that explores our personal ideas about Australia and story- telling in a digital format.\\" After graduating from university, they showed an early prototype to different gaming conferences, and discovered the government organisation Film Victoria, which offers funding to game development, among other creative projects. After securing a Film Victoria grant in 2015, the team could quit their day jobs, form a company, and devote their time to finishing the game. They brought on various freelancers, including an ecologist who checked if the various plants and animals were native to the bush. The team also hired a children's book author (whose identity is currently kept secret) in order to elevate the narrative elements of the game. == Plot and gameplay == The plot centres around a sleepy wombat exploring Australian bushland, encountering various flora and fauna along the way. Players tap the screen to move the character, and as they do more pieces of the path are made visible. According to Gamasutra, \\"information unfolds on screen in curt but elegantly simple sentences\\". == Critical reception == Mashable felt the game offers a \\"more detailed representation of the Australian bush than we've seen in other games\\", comparing it to Forza Horizon 3 which showcased the deserts, rainforests and coastlines that are more commonly portrayed. Finder deemed its art style as both \\"striking\\" and \\"impressive\\". The ABC noted that while Australian developers have often struggled to create games that are \\"quintessentially Australian\\", Paperbark offers an exception to the rule. Pixel Pop Network likened the game's storytelling through visuals to children's books like Animalia, Bamboozled, and Where's Wally. Kokatu singled out the game when discussing a video game project that is unconcerned with money, instead having a sole goal to present honest representation of an Australian landscape. Speaking of the game's educational potential, Gamasutra suggested its application as a teaching aid in a kindergarten or early primary school biology class. === Awards and nominations === The game was a student entrant in the 2016 Independent Games Festival.

The Dispensary was founded in Montague Close, Southwark, near St Saviour's Church, in 1777 to administer advice and medicine to the poor of the Borough of Southwark and places adjacent. Southwark was at that time part of the county of Surrey. Between 2 March 1778 and 30 April 1782 it admitted 10,978 patients of which 8,624 were \\"cured\\" and 404 died. In addition 5,405 were attended at home. In 1782, when its president was the Rt. Hon. Lord Onslow, it issued a prospectus to raise subscriptions. It explained that, > The poor constitute an important part of every large community, and justly > merit the attention and assistance of the rich; especially in sickness, when > they are rendered incapable of supporting themselves and their families. > Hard labour, unwholesome food, want of proper clothing, and exposure to the > vicissitudes of air and weather, subject them to many disorders unknown to > those whose affluence can procure the conveniences of life.Plan of the > Surrey Dispensary. James Phillips, London, 1782. Following the issue of the prospectus, the Dispensary moved to a purpose-built building in Union Street in 1784, and then to Great Dover Street in 1840 when its lease was about to expire. In 1842, more than 1,000 patients were attended at home by the physicians and surgeons and in addition there were 514 midwifery cases. The dispensary saw about 300 patients each day. In 1845, its management included the Earl of Egmont as president, 12 vice presidents, three trustees, a treasurer, four physicians and other medical officers. Between 2 March 1778 and 1 January 1845, 235,489 patients were admitted. Of these, 16,000 \\"partially benefited\\" and 205,024 were \\"cured\\". It was once one of the largest dispensaries in south London. In 1844, C.J.B. Aldis, a Surrey Dispensary medical officer, gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the State of Large Towns and Populous Districts in which he reported that the Dispensary had four physicians and saw around 7,000 cases annually. Diseases seen included fever, inflammatory affections, derangements of the intestinal canal, scrofula and smallpox. He also commented that while bleeding could be done freely in rural and suburban town districts, it should not be attempted in the \\"depressed districts\\". He admitted to frequently visiting places where excrement accumulated for months or remained in streets until the showers of rain washed it away. In 1927 the dispensary moved to the corner of Falmouth Road and Trinity Street where its former building is grade II listed with Historic England. The building became a private residence in 1971. ==Physicians== Physicians who worked at the Dispensary include John Sims (1782), William Hawes (1782), Isaac Buxton (1800s, founder of the Royal Chest Hospital), James Sims, and Charles Aldis (1843).

From mid-June to Labor Day, the parking area at this location is closed to all but park staff and visitors who are disabled, and access is provided by shuttle bus from the Little Creek parking area (across from the Doane Area). Although the parking lot at Coast Guard Beach is open the remainder of the year, parking is limited. There are seasonal restrooms and a wheelchair-accessible rampway to the beach. Coast Guard Beach is popular among locals and tourists for surfing and boogie boarding. It is one of five Cape Cod National Seashore beaches that are on the ocean side of the Cape, generally providing a better surf than beaches on the bay side. Low tide exposes a fairly flat stretch of beach, making it also popular for skimboarding. == History  The Outer Beach === The outer beach, or \\"backside,\\" of Cape Cod has been the notorious graveyard for more than 3,000 ships since the wreck of the Sparrowhawk in 1626. The high cost in lives and property demanded by the sands of Cape Cod, led to the establishment of the Massachusetts Humane Society in 1786, the first organization in the nation devoted to the rescue and assistance of shipwrecked mariners. The Humane Society established shelter huts along the coast; later, it built lifeboat stations where surfboats, line-throwing guns, and other lifesaving gear were stored for the use of volunteer crews in times of emergency. In 1848, the Congress appropriated funds for the first time to construct, equip and maintain similar stations in New Jersey. From 1848 until 1872, Congress provided the money to build more stations along the eastern seaboard and the Great Lakes. The stations in Massachusetts continued to be administered by the Massachusetts Humane Society, but the federal government subsidized its operation. The continued frequent loss of life along the nation's shores led Congress, in 1871–1872, to reorganize the Life Saving Service, a place it on a full-time professional basis. The construction and manning of nine stations on the \\"backside\\" of Cape Cod was provided for in the Federal budget of 1871. One of the original nine stations was constructed at Nauset. It was located about 350 yards southeast of the present building. Shoreline erosion compelled the construction of a new station. The old station remained in service until 1937, when it was replaced by the present structure. The present building was in service as a Coast Guard Station until 1958. The first headquarters of the Cape Cod National Seashore opened in this building in 1961. === The Outermost House === About two miles south, on the outer beach, stood the cottage where author Henry Beston lived while gathering the material for his book, The Outermost House, published in 1928. The book describes life on the outer beach during all four seasons. The house was designed by Henry Beston in 1925. He took meticulous care with every detail because he intended his house to sit on the dune solid as a good ship. The little house, called the Fo'c'sle by Henry Beston, was 21 ft. long by 16 ft. wide and consisted of two rooms, a main room and a bedroom. There were windows on all four sides, giving wonderful views of the entire area, and a little porch along the front. Henry Beston gave the property to the Massachusetts Audubon Society in 1959. It was occupied in summer by Audubon members who cherished their solitude as much as did Henry Beston. Unfortunately, the sea claimed the cottage during a ferocious northeasterly storm in the winter of 1978. === The Great Storm of 1978 === It was more than people expected, and yet Cape Cod was lucky. For despite all the damage, the worst of the storm lay to the west, where a huge area of Massachusetts and neighboring states was buried under two-to four feet of snow. On the Cape, the winds increased on Monday, until they peaked at 6 p.m., clocking 92 miles per hour at Chatham. Coastline damage was inevitable. Wind was the destructive element Monday, but, beginning at midnight, a high tide on a new moon combined with the storm-generated waves to produce a tide some 14.5 feet above mean low water. The storm waves on this high tide pounded the Great Beach with as much impact and overwash as any storm in this century. Storm waves virtually obliterated the parking lot and changing room complex at Coast Guard Beach. Waves repeatedly swept over the most of Nauset Spit as well. In the process, four houses were destroyed, including The Outermost House, made famous by Henry Beston's book of the same name. Most of the wind-built dunes of Nauset Spit were reduced to low mounds. Now, they barely rose high enough above high tide to separate Nauset Marsh from the sea. This process of overwash is normal—in the geologic sense. It is the way a spit retreats when it is attached to a retreating coastline. In effect, the sand that comprises the spit is turned over upon itself. The spit retains its shape, and in this case, the marsh behind it remains protected and continues to be an incredibly rich, productive marine nursery for such animals as flounder, striped bass, scallops and quahogs. The concern now is to see the beach recover sufficiently to protect Nauset Marsh. For, without the spit, the marsh would no longer exist. This recovery process involves the build-up of dunes behind the beach by the wind, and the stabilization of these dunes by the growth of beach grass. In the 1980s, the National Park Service built a new parking lot well away from the beach, to allow the natural give-and-take processes of erosion to continue in this area. ==References * \\"Coast Guard beach ranked (again) as one of the top beaches in the country\\" Giulardi, Julia May 26, 2017, Retrieved June 21, 2018.

She described herself as \\"outrageous\\", was openly lesbian, and regularly wore men's suits with lipstick in public. As a teenager, Eastwood ran her own dancing school in Ivanhoe, before working with Tivoli Theatre in the CBD, then becoming partner in the Betty Lee Academy of dance at the age of 17. Eastwood opened her first cafe, Val's Coffee Lounge, in her mid twenties, at 123 Swanston Street in Melbourne's CBD. This was a rare venue which welcomed the \\"camp\\" community, which was otherwise underground. Initially a single, upstairs floor which seated 80, it expanded to cover two levels, open from morning until late at night, at a time when evening alcohol sales were forbidden. The coffee lounge catered to theatre audiences, and particularly gay people. There was a weekly live music concert. Over the next two decades, this was followed by Cafe 31 in St Kilda, Cafe Ad Lib in South Yarra, and Val's Restaurant in Hawthorn. In the 1960s she began writing short stories, a collection of which were published in 2009 as The Travelling Mind of Val Eastwood, by the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives. In 2009, the name Val's Cafe was used for a government-funded program to support ageing LGBTI people in health and wellbeing. == References == Category:LGBT in Victoria (Australia) Category:1927 births Category:2009 deaths Category:20th-century Australian businesspeople ","title":"Val Eastwood"},{"id":"56906159","text":"right Ray Mill was a mill in Stalybridge, UK.

It was designated as a group F, according to the custom that was then to define with letters the group of locomotives according to their function, and numbered from 301 to 325. When they passed to FS, they were registered as Class 420. They had some technical differences from other FS 0-8-0 locomotives, notably the use of Walschaerts valve gear instead of Stephenson. They were built in three batches and there were some detail differences between batches. The first unit was ordered from Breda in Milan and delivered in 1892 and a further 21 units came from Ansaldo's Sampierdarena factory between 1893 and 1894. Finally in 1903 another batch of 3 locomotives was built and delivered by Officine Meccaniche of Milan. In 1906 the transfer to FS occurred, and the locomotives received the new four-digit markings 4101-4125 which later became 410.001-025. The locomotives spent their working lives on the island of Sicily. ==Features== The Class 410 locomotives, with a power output of 600 hp, were versatile machines and designed for every type of use, although the small wheels (diameter 1200 mm) limited the speed to 45 km/h. They were built for saturated steam and simple expansion with 2 outside cylinders. Steam distribution was by slide valves with Walschaerts valve gear. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:0-8-0 locomotives 410 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1892 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy Category:Gio.

It has two linear leaves at its base and up to five pale yellow flowers with dark brown markings. Fewer than 200 plants survive in grassy forest near Wingham. ==Description== Diuris flavescens is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to five pale yellow flowers with dark brown markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is narrow egg- shaped, long and wide. It is yellow with greenish brown and reddish brown blotches. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, green and brown, long, wide, turned downwards and parallel to, or crossed over each other. The petals are more or less erect, spread apart from each other with an elliptic to almost circular blade long and wide on a curved, green to brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, wide with reddish brown markings and folded lengthwise. The side lobes are linear to narrow egg-shaped, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris flavescens was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected south-east of Wingham and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (flavescens) is a Latin word meaning \\"pale yellow\\", referring to the colour of the flowers of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== The pale yellow doubletail grows in grassy forest in the Wingham district. ==Conservation== Diuris flavescens is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species are illegal collecting, weed invasion and habitat disturbance. The staff at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan are working to secure the future of the species by growing it from collected seed with the fungus required by the orchid. ==References== flavescens Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris flavescens"},{"id":"56906230","text":"Shahidul Islam Biswas (1948-2006) is a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician and the former Member of Parliament from Chuadanga-1. == Birth and family life == Shahidul Islam Biswas was born on 1948. ==Career== Biswas was a founding member of Bangladesh Jubo Dal.

He pioneered in open-heart surgery in the Arab-Muslim world. As a professor and lecturer for 39 years, he taught and mentored a generation of young surgeons in Tunisia. == Biography == A year after getting his philosophy baccalaureate in his native town Sfax, Mohamed Fourati moved to Lille (France) to pursue his graduate education in the medical school of Lille. In order to validate his studies, he became an intern in the Farhat-Hachad Hospital of Sousse. Traveling between the two continents, he secured, in 1959, a medical doctorate at the medical school of Lille. He performed his military service, the following year, in the region of El Kef (in north-eastern Tunisia) and in Kébili (southern Tunisia). He continued to specialize in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the Saint-Joseph Hospital of Paris. He got assigned to the general surgery unit of doctors Saïd Mestiri and Zouhair Essafi at the Habib-Thameur Hospital in Tunis. In 1961, over the month of July, he worked as a surgeon in the battle of Bizerte, performing surgery on patients 20 hours a day for many days. He got appointed as hospital assistant in 1966, then earned the title of chief physician of the surgical ward in the Habib-Thameur Hospital in May 1968 and became, at the age of 35, the youngest chief physician in Tunisia. In November of the same year, he performed the first open-heart surgery, favored by a delegation of doctors of the IFTHD (led by Charles Hahn of the Cantonal hospital of Geneva (Switzerland) ). In 1970, he performed a first in the Arab-Muslim world when implanting a STARR valve (Albert Starr) in mitral position. Three years later, he executed the first double valve replacement, mitral and aortic. In the same year, he got appointed as docent at the medical school of Tunis. Continuing his work, he successfully got, in 1974, his Aggregration in surgery in Paris,. On July 11, 1975, he performed an open-heart surgery, filmed and retransmitted on television, in the presence of the president of the Tunisian Republic, Habib Bourguiba. On January 16, 1980, he got designated as a member of the French National Academy of Surgery. During that year, he formed a cardiac surgery unit in the Habib-Thameur Hospital, independent of other general surgery activities. He earned the title of professor of surgery in 1982. From 1982 to 1984, he chaired the Tunisian Association of Cardiology (ATC) and the offices of the Tunisian Society of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery (STCCCV) from 1983 to 1985. He got appointed as chief physician at the Military Hospital of Tunis in 1989. On January 15, 1993, at 2 am, he successfully performed the first cardiac transplant, which was considered a notable achievement in the Arab-Muslim world. The context was the following: a young man died in an accident and brain death got attested by a medical examiner after confirmation by 2 electroencephalograms. Having to refer to the appropriate authorities of the Military Hospital and the Ministry of Defence, an authorization to take the organ is given in application of the law n ° 91-22 of March 25, 1991. A race against the clock began to ready the receiver in order to strengthen the chances of carrying out a successful transplant. All the staff involved were mobilized that night for this surgical first. This law of 25 March 1991 states that the removal of organs from a deceased person in a brain-dead state is defined by rigorous criteria. Brain death must be recognized by two independent physicians and be based on the presumption of consent. If the refusal is not clearly expressed, it is possible to remove the organs \\"for therapeutic purposes\\". If the will has not been expressed, the law authorizes the family to dispose of the body and to eventually oppose the removal. In Tunisia, the previous legal regulation, in relation to organ harvesting, was the beylical decree of 19 July 1952. The latter concerned only the deceased without acknowledging brain death which was, at the time, an unknown concept. A year later, Mohamed Fourati retired at the age of 62 and continued to lecture. On February 26, 2012, he died at the age of 80 at his home in Tunis. Tributes were then paid to his life by administrative, religious and scientific authorities. == Frequented institutions == * Farhat- Hached Hospital in Sousse ; * Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris (14th arrondissement); * Habib-Thameur Hospital in Tunis; * Military Hospital in Tunis. == Private life == In 1955, he met and married Michèle Roly, with whom he has four children: the eldest Kamel, doctor and orthopedic and traumatological surgeon in Tunis; Sonia, senior lecturer in mathematics at the Probability and Random Model Laboratory in Paris; Samy, a specialist in nuclear radiology at the Brooklyn Hospital in New York; Neil, agronomist in Tunis.

The first discovery consisted of a woman's torso which was found wrapped in burlap, floating near the Wisdom Light moorage on April 12, 1946; this led the media to dub the case the Wisdom Light Murder. The arms and one thigh of the victim were discovered the following day, April 13, floating against the lock system of Willamette Falls in similar burlap packaging; both the hands and foot had been severed from the limbs and were missing. In July 1946, the second thigh was found in the Willamette near Oregon City, and additional women's clothing believed to be that of the victim was recovered from the Clackamas River around the same time. In October 1946, the victim's severed head was found in the river near the location of the original torso discovery; her hands and feet were never recovered. Though initially reported to have been a female in her late teens or twenties, a pathologist from the University of Oregon medical school confirmed the victim was a middle-aged caucasian woman between 40 and 50 years old. The case received national media attention, appearing on the front page of numerous news outlets, but her identity and killer remain unknown. In 2004, her murder case was formally reopened, but remains a cold case. The evidence as well as the woman's remains were lost by law enforcement some time in the 1950s, rendering contemporary DNA testing impossible. ==Discovery== On April 12, 1946, three people walking along the east bank of the Willamette River near Oak Grove, Oregon (immediately south of Dunthorpe, an affluent suburb south of Portland) discovered a burlap sack floating in an eddy offshore. Inside, they found the torso of a caucasian female, along with several articles of clothing including an overcoat, long underwear, and a dark sweater. The package had been wound with rope and wire, and also contained curtain sash weights. Initially, the individuals who found the sack believed it was a \\"sack of drowned kittens.\\" The following day, April 13, the woman's right thigh and both arms were discovered in the river in similar burlap packaging, floating above Willamette Falls, approximately from the location where the torso was discovered. Sash weights were also discovered in the package containing the arms and thigh, and it had been wound with telephone wire. The hands had been severed from the arms, and the foot severed from the leg, neither of which could be located. Two fishermen made the discovery, and told authorities they had noticed the burlap package floating in the area at least 30 days prior, but did not immediately find it suspicious. However, after reading of the discovery of the torso downstream, they returned to the area and found the package still floating against the falls' lock system, after which they notified law enforcement. Police searched the area around the falls, and made plaster casts of footprints found in the mud along the bank near where the arms and leg were found. Three months later, in late July 1946, the victim's left thigh was discovered floating under the Oregon City Bridge near McLoughlin Boulevard. On July 29, 1946, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported that bundles of women's clothing had also been discovered in the Clackamas River, a tributary of the Willamette. This led detectives to suspect that the perpetrator had possibly disposed of the body in both rivers. In September, \\"what appeared to be fragments of a human scalp\\" were discovered near Willamette Falls. The following month, on October 13, 1946, a package containing the woman's severed head was found near the location her torso had been discovered by a married couple from Oak Grove. The hands and feet of the woman were never recovered. At the time, the murder was referred to by the media as the Wisdom Light Murder, based on the fact that the torso had been discovered near the Wisdom Light moorage. ==InvestigationInitial findings=== Victim's lower jawbone and dentures Ray Rilance, the Clackamas County coroner who first examined the torso, estimated the victim to be in her \\"teens or early twenties,\\" and weighing around . Rilance told the media that the perpetrator had done \\"rather a neat job—at least he knew where the joints were.\\" Dr. Warren Hunter, a pathologist from the University of Oregon medical school, subsequently examined the torso, and determined it belonged to a female \\"past middle age...about 50.\\" Hunter also estimated that the torso had been placed in the water no more than 36 hours prior to its discovery. Prior to the Hunter's analysis, national newspapers had reported the coroner's estimation that the victim was in her \\"teens or early twenties,\\" resulting in a barrage of phone calls to law enforcement from concerned parents. The pathologist concluded the woman was between and tall, weighed approximately to , and had light brown hair. The lower portion of the torso showed burn marks, possibly from a blow torch, leading police to believe the victim had been tortured. Portland weather bureau official Elmer Fisher stated at the time that the torso could have been placed in the water \\"anywhere below Oregon City falls [now Willamette Falls]\\" but could not have drifted upstream from Portland. The day after the torso was discovered, on April 14, 1946, a false confession was made by a man from a telephone booth in Milwaukie; the man claimed to have known the woman's identity, as well as the location where she had been dismembered. Law enforcement however determined the call was a prank, and dismissed any connection to the murder. On September 9, 1946, it was reported that law enforcement were investigating a possible connection between the remains and Marie Nastos, a 47-year-old woman from Seattle, Washington, who had gone missing on August 24, 1945 en route to Seattle after a trip to Wenatchee. Nastos matched the physical description of the victim, standing at , weighing approximately , and having brown hair. Upon the discovery of the victim's head in October 1946, it was revealed the woman wore dentures. The cause of death was determined to have been blunt-force trauma to the head. After death, the victim was dismembered—potentially via saw—and disposed of in the river. Law enforcement at the time investigated a potential connection between the woman and two missing persons cases in California and Indiana, but were unable to make a connection. In July 1951, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed convicted murderer Roy Moore from his prison cell in North Carolina; he purportedly recounted in detail his murder and dismemberment of a woman whom he claimed to have disposed of in the Molalla River, but provided no information linking him to the Oak Grove Jane Doe. ===2004 reopening=== In 2004, the case was formally reopened by the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office. In a 2017 interview with Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office Sergeant John Krummenacker, it was revealed that evidence in the case—including the location of the woman's clothing, jawbone, dentures, and other remains—were unknown. It is believed the evidence was lost sometime in the 1950s. Krummenacker commented: \\"The end result is this–there's a middle- aged woman that was brutally murdered with a blunt force trauma blow to her head. Then [she] was sawn up, cut up, dismembered and thrown in this river like a piece of garbage.\\" In the 2016 book Murder and Scandal in Prohibition Portland: Sex, Vice & Misdeeds in Mayor Baker's Reign it was written that \\"no new leads\\" have surfaced in the woman's murder, and \\"there is little hope of ever being able to solve the case\\" based on the lack of living witnesses and the loss of remains and other physical documentation. ==Theories== Crime writers J.D. Chandler and Joshua Fisher speculated that the identity of the woman was Anna Schrader, a married Portland woman who allegedly had an affair with William Breunning, a married police lieutenant. In 1929, Schrader and Breunning had a heated argument in which a gun was fired; Breunning stopped Schrader by jumping on top of her, and in turn broke several of her ribs. In April 1946, around the time the body was discovered, The Oregonian ran a notice seeking Anna Schrader, who had disappeared; she had previously told friends she was considering moving to Minnesota, but as of 2017, no public records of residence or her death are known. Local crime writer Theresa Griffin-Kennedy also stated that the Jane Doe's remains matched the physical description of Schrader. ==See also== *List of unidentified murder victims in the United States *List of unsolved deaths ==NotesReferencesWorks cited== * ==External links== *Case file at The Doe Network *Case file at National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Category:1946 in Oregon Category:American torture victims Category:Deaths by beating in the United States Category:Murder in Oregon Category:People murdered in Oregon Category:Unidentified murder victims in Oregon Category:Female murder victims Category:People from Oak Grove, Oregon ","title":"Oak Grove Jane Doe"},{"id":"56906363","text":"The memtransistor is an experimental multi-terminal electronic component that might be used in the construction of artificial neural networks.

It had an estimated magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum felt intensity of IX on the Mercalli intensity scale. The city of Tabriz was almost completely destroyed. Approximately 50,000 people were killed. ==Tectonic setting== Tabriz lies within the complex zone of collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The main structures accommodating this oblique collision are west-east trending thrust faults and WNW-ESE trending dextral (right lateral) strike-slip faults. The North Tabriz Fault is an active 150 km long dextral strike-slip fault that passes close to the northern edge of Tabriz city. It has two main segments and an estimated overall slip rate of about 7 mm per year. The southeastern segment is interpreted to have ruptured in the 1721 Tabriz earthquake, while the northwestern segment ruptured during the 1780 earthquake. Both events produced associated ground rupture, which is still observable. An average slip of about 4 m has been estimated for earthquakes along the northwestern segment. A recurrence interval of about 800 years has been estimated, suggesting that a major earthquake along this structure is unlikely in the next few centuries, although a recurrence interval of 250–300 years has also been proposed, indicating that there is potential for a major earthquake in the relatively near future. ==Earthquake== The earthquake sequence started with a strong foreshock. The mainshock was felt over a large area, including at Divrigi over 700 km away. Aftershocks continued for several years, the most damaging being on 12 and 20 February. The observed surface fault break extended for 60 km. There is evidence of some vertical movement in addition to the horizontal displacement. ==Damage== All buildings within the city of Tabriz were reported destroyed and similar levels of damage affected many villages in the neighbouring area. The degree of destruction may in part relate to the weakening effects of the 1721 earthquake, which also caused severe damage to the city. The number of reported casualties varies from 40,000 to as many as 200,000, with 50,000 being a more likely estimate. ==References== Category:Earthquakes in Iran Category:History of Tabriz Category:1780s earthquakes Category:1780s in Iran ","title":"1780 Tabriz earthquake"},{"id":"56906430","text":"Amyostaurida is a suborder of jellyfishes.

Grown out of previous combat shotgun programs, this program had inherited the specification from the RHINO program that had preceded it. These specifications required a magazine capacity of 10 rounds, a requirement for the new ammunition to be incompatible with commercial 12ga shotguns, that felt recoil be no greater than a Remington 870P firing M162 or M257 buckshot cartridges and that the system provide penetration and incapacitation capability significantly better than M162 and M257.https://medium.com/war-is-boring/for-three-decades-the- pentagon-tried-and-failed-to-build-sci-fi-shotguns-81c32d22674e In response to this, AAI developed their entrant, the AAI CAWS - a select fire, recoil operated, magazine fed shotgun. Using the standard M-16 stock and pistol grip, recoil operation and with an inline design, felt recoil was supposedly less than an M16. A shorter version, without stock, was also developed for Airborne forces. A day/night Reflex sight was offered as standard.Hogg, Ian V. Jane's Infantry Weapons 1993-1994.

The standard antipersonnel cartridge developed by AAI was loaded with 8, drag stabilized flechettes. All 8 flechettes were able to hit a circle at . The flechettes at that range had a velocity of and were capable of penetrating of pine or of mild steel.

Nouns have gender based on animacy, based on the world-view of the Indians on what has spirit versus what does not. A body would be animate, but the parts of the body are inanimate. Nouns are also marked for obviation, with nouns subject to the topic marked apart from nouns less relevant to the discourse. Personal pronouns distinguish three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first-person plural, and proximate/obviative third-persons. Nouns are also marked as absentative, especially when referring to lost items or deceased persons. Sentence structures are typically SVO or SOV, but deviation from strict word order does not alter the meaning due to the synthetic structure.Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). Introduction to the Wampanoag grammar. (Master's thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). pp. 10-63. Verbs are quite complex, and can be broken into four classes of verbs: animate-intransitive (AI), inanimate-intransitive (II), animate-transitive (AT), and inanimate-transitive (IT). Verbs are also prefixed and suffixed with various inflections, particles, and conjugations, so complex things can easily be described just by a verb.Pentland, David H. (2006). \\"Algonquian and Ritwan Languages\\", in Keith Brown, ed., Encyclopedia of Languages and Linguistics (2nd ed.), pp. 161–6. Amsterdam: Elsevier.Fermino, J. L. D.

However, like other Algonquian languages, Massachusett makes a distinction between the first person plural exclusive, 'we, excluding you' and the first person plural inclusive, 'we, including you.' In general, the exclusive is more common when referring to oneself and one's family and network or when the audience is unknown, but the inclusive is used when the audience is definitely being referenced. The obviate, a form of 'second third person' that disambiguates the activities of another third person in a sentence, may possess another noun which although technically a 'third third person,' has no forms that distinguish it from the unmarked proximate bare form of a noun, as opposed to more conservative languages like Ojibwe which have a separate form for nouns in this rare position. Similarly, there are no attested forms for obviate inanimate nouns, as exist in Ojibwe.Waasaagoneshkang (2001). 'Theft of Fire.' Recorded in 1974 by William Jones, translated by Rand Valentine. p. 13. Persons exist on an importance scale, which is often more important in establishing word order regarding synthetic placement of prefixes, suffixes and markers. For example, most words exist which generally follow a hierarchy of 2 > 1 > X > 3 > 3'.Macaulay, M. (2005).

Nouns can only have an animate/inanimate plural or absentative animate/inanimate singular or plural terminations on a given word. In general, the locative is the same in the singular and plural and replaces the animate/inanimate plural if any. All nouns can have a diminutive, locative and obviative ending, although it would be rare for a word to exist with all possible forms, the order is usually diminutive, absentative/animate-inanimate plural (if any), locative, obviative. For example, *wekeesiutoh *(weekeesayutah), literally 'his-house-diminutive-absentative-locative- obviate' which would signify 'at the other man's/woman's small house—that is no more? that was destroyed?' ===Number=== Algonquian languages recognize two numbers, singular and plural. Although it is rare for a word to not have both a singular and plural form, a small number of nouns, as in English, are either uncountable or inherently plural or singular. This is clearest in loan words from English such as monêash (moneyash), from English 'moneys,' which always appears in the plural and saut (salt), from English 'salt' which only appears in the singular.Rees-Miller, J. (1996). Morphological Adaptation of English Loanwords in Algonquian. International Journal of American Linguistics, 62(2), 196-202. Retrieved 3 December 2017. Nouns are unmarked in the singular, but can take one of two forms dependent on the noun's gender, which can be either animate and refer to something considered living, moving, divine or said to have spirit and inanimate including natural objects, tools and small plants.Goddard, I. & Bragdon, K. (1988). pp. 486-497. Words that are animate have -ack/-og/-ak (-ak) and those that are inanimate have -ash/-osh (-ash) appended to the end, respectively. Although unmarked in the singular, words must have either an animate or inanimate plural, with only a few rare exceptions to this rule.Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 11. Nouns in the singular often exist in a truncated form, but when any endings such as the plural are appended, many nouns will have consonants or syllables appear where unexpected, but were probably the original form of the word from its development from Proto-Algonquian. For instance, the words 'dog,' 'man' and 'chair' appear in Massachusett as annum (anum) , wosketomp (waskeetôp) and appuonk (apuwôk) in the singular but anum _w_ og (anum _w_ ak) , wosketomp _au_ og (waskeetôp _â_ ak) and appuonk _an_ ash (apuwôk _an_ ash) as 'dogs' and 'chairs,' respectively.Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 12, 14, 292. In the case of 'dog,' Massachusett annum (anum) developed from Proto-Algonquian *aθem _w_ aWiktionary. Proto-Algonquian *aθemwa. with the final *-wa only re- appearing in the non-truncated forms of the plural, i.e., Proto-Algonquian *aθemwaki and Massachusett annumwak (anumwak). As they are based on etymology, words with these non-truncated finals must be learned individually. ===Gender and plural formation=== As seen in the plural formations, all nouns have a grammatical gender based on animacy, thus nouns are either animate or inanimate. Animate objects include human beings and their bodies, animals, trees and bushes, planetary bodies—essentially things considered to be alive, possess spirit or are mobile—whereas inanimate nouns cover most objects, body parts, natural land forms, abstract things—essentially objects that do not move, do not possess spirit and generally unable to move. Numerous exceptions to this general rule exist. The body parts -ohpee (-apee), 'hip,' -úhkus (-uhkas), 'finger nail' and woskequah (wushkeeqâh) , 'whale bone'; the English loan words conner (corner) and Testament (Testament) and the kitchen object kunnommaog (kunumuwôk) , 'ladle' or 'spoon' are all animate. The sun and moon, despite being planetary bodies, are inanimate. Although standing trees are animate, names of trees and species are always inanimate, thus the plural form of kꝏwa (k8wa) , 'pine tree,' is not *kꝏwak (*k8wak) but instead kꝏwash (k8wash). Only a handful of words can appear with both genders, with subtle differences in meaning. For instance, the word for 'tree' is mehtog (muhtuq), but can also mean 'wood.' As gender is not overtly marked in the singular, this can be seen in the plural forms where mehtogquog (muhtuqak), 'trees' (that are still in the ground and living) and mehtogquosh (muhtuqash), 'trees' (that have been felled) but better translates as 'wood,' i.e., the product of a tree that is no longer living.Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 54, 346. Another rare form is to refer to land forms, structures or locales said to have a spiritual presence, or were considered the meeting place with or dwelling of tutelary spirits were discussed in the animate gender, in essence 'personifying' or linguistically 'animating' them. For example, wadchuash (wachuwash), 'mountains,' is the inanimate plural, but when it appears as *wadchuog (wachuwak) in the animate plural, it signifies 'mountains' but specifically the 'spirit(s) of the mountains.' This latter feature only appears in religious and ceremonial usage and is only known from a few examples, but was likely more common prior to the introduction of Christianity and the English missionary influences. ===Case=== Obviation Massachusett, just as in other Algonquian languages, marks second third persons with an obviative marker -oh (-ah) . The proximate, usually the primary subject or more important topic is left unmarked. In English, for example, 'He gives the book to me, then I give the money to him,' it is ambiguous if the man receiving the money is the same as the giver of the book or a different man present, but in Massachusett, the person giving the book would be proximate and thus unmarked and the recipient of the money would be marked for obviation and removing the ambiguity. The noun marked for obviation tends to be the possessed, not the possessor, and also tends to be the less animate or the recipient of a particular action. For example, mosq nâau ahtuck _oh_ (masq nâwâw ahtuhq _ah_ ) , 'The bear sees the deer.'Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 12-13. Like the word 'deer' in English, which may refer to the animal in the singular and collectively, the obviative forms are identical in the singular and the plural and have to be differentiated by context. Nouns which are truncated are restored, as with the plural endings, so anum (anum), 'dog' and plural anum _w_ og (anum _w_ ak) and appuonk (apuwônk) and plural appuonkanash (apuwônkanash), 'chairs' become annum _w_ oh (anum _w_ ah) and appuonk _an_ ah (apuwônkan _ah_ ) , respectively, when marked for obviation. This can occur in verbs as well:Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 54-56. Proximate * Nꝏwoman kuh nꝏwamanug. (Nuwâmôn kah nuwâmônuq.) * 'I love her and she loves me.' * Literally 'I-love-(animate 'her') and me-love-she' * nunnechanunnonog. (nuneechônunônak.) * 'Our (exclusive) children' * Literally 'my-child-plural exclusive-[r]en' Obviate * Nꝏwoman kuh nꝏwamanug _oh_. (Nuwamôn kah nuwamônuq _ah_.) * 'I love her and she loves me.' * Literally 'I-love-(animate 'her') and me-love-she-[obviative] (obviative 'other she')', suggesting a love triangle. * Nunnechanunnonog wunnechannooah (Nuneechanunônak wuneechanuwôwah.) * 'Our (exclusive) children's children.' * Literally 'Our [exclusive]-child[r]-en their-child[r]-en-[obviative] (obviative 'children of other they' distinct from 'our children')' Proximate of obviate (third third- person) * Nunnechanunnonog wunnechannooah wunnechanuwauwog. (Nuneechanunônak wuneechanuwôwah wuneechanuwôwak.) * 'Our (exclusive) children's children's children.' (children of our children's children) * Literally 'Our [exclusive]-child[r]-en their-child[r]-en-[obviative] their-child[r]-en.' (obviative 'children of other they' distinct from 'our children' but proximate 'their-children') * Nꝏsh ꝏshoh umisses. (N8sh 8shah umuhsees.) * 'my father's father's sister.' (referring to paternal great aunt) * Literally 'My-father his-father-[obviative] 'his-sister.' (obviative 'his-father' but proximate 'his-sister') Absentation Algonquian languages mark those objects that were, i.e., people or living things that are deceased and objects that are lost, stolen or destroyed, or 'absent,' as opposed to those that currently exist. For people and animate objects, it generally refers to something alive that has passed away. Items that are destroyed, beyond repair or lost forever tend to be inanimate objects.Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K. (1988). pp. 494, 506-508. All nouns, whether animate or inanimate, are marked with the suffixes -i or -y (-ay) in the singular and -uk or -ug (-uk) in the plural. With the same forms, a noun's animacy must be known or determined from context. Truncated noun stems are also restored before absentative endings, so woskétomp (waskeetôp) is restored before becoming woskétomp _á_ ay (waskeetôp _â_ ay) , 'man' (that is passed away).Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 13. Animate * kꝏsh _i_ (k8sh _ay_ ) , 'your (singular) late father' * nussontimminon _uk_ (nusôtyumunôn _uk_ ) , 'our (exclusive) deceased sachems' Inanimate * uméquonn _ai_ (umeequn _ay_ ) , 'his feather' (that was lost? that was destroyed?) * wuttuhquaunn _ick_ (wutuhqôn _uk_ ) 'her hooks' (that were lost? that were destroyed?) Diminution Nouns can be marked with one of two diminutive endings, -ees (-ees) or -emes (-âmees) , with the latter form chosen for more extreme examples or euphony. These endings indicate that the noun is smaller, littler or younger. For example, nonkomp (nôkôp) , 'boy,' nonkomp _ees_ (nôkôp _ees_ ) , 'young boy' and nonkomp _amees_ (nôkôp _âmees_ ) , a 'very young boy.' Although rare in the written language, which may have thus protected against its complete intrusion in the spoken language, late-stage speakers along the western and northern transitional dialects permitted syncope and the diminutive ending is often truncated, as seen in the surname of Crispus Attucks, Attuck[ee]s (Ahtuq[ee]s), 'Little Deer,' and wachu[ee]s (wachu[w][ee]s), 'small mountain' or 'hill' as in the example of Mount Wachusett, a Native toponym from the closely related Nipmuc-speaking peoples where syncope was generally permitted. The use of the diminutive, as in extant Algonquian languages, may have had some semantic functions that varied between dialects. Although it is the general rule to use diminutive endings on small, young and little things, examples from other Algonquian languages such as Ojibwe indicate that it can be used as a term of endearment, such as n'nechan _emes_ (nuneechan _âmees_ ) , 'my little child,' but can also be used, in certain contexts, to mark something as inferior or degrading, such as keen wosketomp _ees_ (keeen waskeetôp _ees_ ) , 'you little man' but could have nuanced implied meanings of being weak, small in stature, inferior or unworthy dependent on context. Location Nouns are suffixed with a locative suffix -et (also -ett, -it, etc.) (-ut) to indicate 'in/on/at' (physically). It can be used to mark areas near certain geographical features, and survives in the name Massachus _ett_ (Mâsach8s _ut_ ) as well as most geographical place names and landmarks of Massachusett-language derivation. The locative is often, though not alwayss, identical in singular and the plural and number has to be determined from context.Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 14.Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K. (1988). p. 506-507. The choice of locative seems to have some dialectal variation, where the older form -uck/-og/-uk (-uk) was generally more common in the speech of Nantucket and areas inhabited by the Nauset, and seems to have occurred with equal frequency in the related L-dialect Nipmuc language and areas inhabited by the Pawtucket. Areas inhabited by the Coweset, Massachusett and the closely related Y-dialect Narragansett seem to have been strongholds of the termination, although documents in Natick seem to have also used the variant, perhaps due to the influence of Nipmuc. As the written language of Eliot seems to have favored , most place names in the region in Massachusetts were 'standardized' under the influence of the literate Indians and the English missionaries. There is a rare secondary locative -ehtu (-eehtyuw) or -uhkontu (-uhkôhtyuw) that only appears in a handful of attestations in the Native documents. It seems to have been somewhat more common in Eliot's translation of the Bible, where it seems to serve the purpose of a plural locative. For example, ayeuwog _ut_ , 'in/on/at the place,' and nuppee _it_ , 'in/on/at the water' and ayeuongan _ehtu_ (ayuwôkan _eehtyuw_ ), 'in/on/at the places,' and nippe _kontu_ (nupee _hkôhtyuw_ ) , 'in/on/at the water _s_.Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 307, 341.Hicks, N. (2006). pp. 7, 12. The locative can be used for abstract phrases, such as 'in his posterity' and 'on this day' and these phrases can be literally translated from English. The locative, however, is also mandatory for certain transitive verbs that do not have an English parallel. 'I place a door on my house.' * Nupponam usquont neek _itt_ (Nup8num usqôt neek _ut_ ) * dialectal neek _uck_ (neek _uk_ ) * Literally, 'I-put-it door my-house-[locative]' (locative 'in/on/at my house') 'I am fishing in your canoe.' * N'taumam kumishꝏn _it_ (Nutômôm kumuhsh8nut) * dialectal kumishꝏn _ucke_ (kumuhsh8n _uk_ ) * Literally, 'I-fish you-canoe-in' (locative 'in/on/at your canoe') 'On this day' * yeu kesuk _od_ (y8 keesuk _ut_ ) * dialectal keesuk _ok_ (keesuk _uk_ ) * Literally, 'this day-in' (locative 'in/on/at this day') 'We (inclusive) go to the sachem's village' * kutóminn sonchim ꝏtann _it_ (kutômun sôtyum wut8tan _ut_ ) * dialectal ꝏtann _uk_ (wut8tan _uk_ ) * Literally 'his-village-in' (locative 'in/on/at his village') * In this case, the locative is used in directional verbs to mean 'to' as in 'towards the ....' 'I resemble my father.' * nutoqueneoquiss nꝏsh _utt_ (nutaquneôqus n8sh _ut_ ) * dialectal nꝏsh _ick_ (n8sh _uk_ ) * Literally, 'I-resemble my-father-in' (locative 'in/on/at my father') ===Genitive=== {  - ! rowspan=\\"9\\"  Animate !

As previously states, the third-person form wu- (wu-) is truncated to u- (u-) or, with sufficient context, sometimes dropped altogether in certain situations, so meequon (meeqôn) is umeequon (umeeqôn) and never *wumeequon (*wumeeqôn). Both of the first-person plural forms have an ending (-un), which are otherwise distinguished by (nu-), equivalent to 'I'.Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 17-25. Plural persons are formed with suffixes. For example, 'our' can be formed with nu-[stem]-un, 'I-[stem]-first-person plural' in the exclusive form or ku-[stem]-un, 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.] in the inclusive form. The inclusive form actually shares ku-, the second-person prefix, as the construction 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.],' somewhat suggesting 'you + us' as it would naturally include the audience or person being addressed in a description of a group action including the speaker. The second-person plural and third-person plural are formed with (ku-) and (wu-) or its variant (u-)—used before /m/, /p/, /k/ or /w/, but not /kʷ/—respectively. They also share use of the second/third-person plural suffix (-uw). Plural personhood in the dependency markers requires an infix, which wedges itself between the suffix appended to the stem and the peripheral markers, such as those that indicate the animate or inanimate plural, depending on the word's gender or absentative, locative or obviative forms. The first-person exclusive and first-person inclusive plurals share (-ôn-) whilst the second- and third- person plurals share (-ôw-). This prevents the previous stem from truncation or elimination, according to the complicated sound rules for joining morphemes and the influence of surrounding vowels. Thus, 'our (exclusive) feet' is (nuseetun _ôn_ ash) and not (*nuseetunash) and 'your (plural) feet' is (kuseetuw _ôw_ ash) and not (*kuseetuwash).Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 14-15. ===Dependent and Independent nouns=== Nouns are declined by person somewhat differently depending on whether or not the noun in question is dependent or independent. For example, a 'foot' always belongs to someone and therefore, in Algonquian languages, it can only exist in a genitive construction such as 'my foot,' 'your feet,' 'his foot,' etc., and is therefore 'dependent.' When the exact owner is unknown, (mu-) is attached and indicates 'someone's' or 'somebody's' foot. Dependency is a common feature of kinship terms such as 'mother' or 'father,' almost all body parts, including the body itself. Most other nouns are independent and can exist by themselves, although they can also be declined in genitive constructions, such as a 'tree' can be owned as 'my tree' or 'his tree' that do exist without implied ownership. Intrusive 't' As a grammatical rule, a is inserted before the prefix that implies the person and an independent noun stem that begins with a vowel. For example, nu _t_ ohkeem (nu _t_ ahkeem), 'my land' where ohke (ahkee), 'earth' or 'land' is independent. This is in contrast to nꝏsh (n8sh), 'my father,' which does not require the 'intrusive t' as it is a dependent noun, i.e., not *nu _t_ ꝏsh (*nu _t_ 8sh) which are incorrect. The example of 'my father' also shows that vowel-initial dependent noun roots assimilate the vowel of the person prefix, nꝏsh (n8sh) not *nuꝏsh (*nu8sh). When a dependent noun has ownership that is not implied or unknown, the Algonquian X person, it is prefixed with mu- which indicates that it is 'someone's' or 'somebody's,' for instance, _m_ usseett ( _m_ useet) , 'someone's foot' or 'somebody's foot.' Dependent nouns that begin with a consonant do not assimilate the preceding vowel, e.g., kunnutcheg (kunucheek) , 'your (singular) hand.' Dependent nouns have to be learned separately. M-class A small 'm-class' of independent nouns also exist. This small subset of words takes a final (-m) in words that end in a vowel or (-um) for words that end in a consonant, but only when the word is declined for person. This terminal is dropped when the noun exists in its, non-pronominally declined independent form. This was likely a retention of an archaic trait in the language that began to fade from the language around the time literacy was adopted, as the Indian documents show that many writers applied it inconsistently and seem to have been unsure, although it is just as likely that it may have varied by dialect or age of speaker. Where it was retained, the /m/ helps preserve noun stems from mutation or assimilation of vowels of various noun suffixes.Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 16, 24-25. wadchu (wachuw) 'mountain' * nuwadchu _m_ ash (nuwachuw _um_ ash) 'my mountains' * wadchuwash (wachuwash) 'mountains' ohke (ahkee) 'land' * nutohke _m_ i (nutahkee _m_ ay) 'my former land' * ohkeash (ahkeeash), 'lands.' kehtassꝏt (keehtahs8t) 'king' *kukehtassꝏta _m_ (kukeehtas8tu _m_ ) 'your king' * kehtassꝏtak (keehtahs8tak), 'kings' ===Pronouns=== Independent personal pronouns {  - ! Person ! English ! ColonialTrumbull, J. H. (1903). Natick Dictionary. ! ModernFermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 25-27. ! Pronunciation -  1  'I,' 'me'  neen, nén  (neen)  -  2  'you' (sing), 'thou'  keen, kén  (keen)  -  3  'he,' 'she' or 'it'  nâgum  (nâkum)  -  1p  'we' (exclusive)  neenawun, nenáuwin  (neenawun)  -  12  'we' (inclusive)  keenawun, kenauwin  (keenawun)  -  2p  'you' (plural), 'ye'  keenaw  (keenaw)  -  3p  'they'  nagumaw  (nâkumaw)  } The Algonquian languages are pro-drop languages which means that independent pronouns are usually unnecessary in conversation. Nouns can be inflected for possession and verbs often encode the subject, and sometimes, even the object information, rendering the use of pronouns mostly redundant. There are several instances where pronouns cannot be omitted. For instance, Massachusett lacks a copula which is found in English as the various conjugations of the verb 'to be' that link the subject and predicate. Thus, a pronoun would be mandatory in sentences such as kén nétop (keen neetôp) , 'you are my friend,' but literally 'you my-friend. The pronouns are also mandatory as the direct answers to questions involving figuring out who was doing what or what was done to whom. In a sentence such as nuwoman (nuwâmôn), the transitive animate verb woman (wâmôn) is marked with the first-person prefix (nu-) marks the subject. The third-person recipient, 'her' or 'him' is assumed because it is an animate verb. Even though, nen nuwoman nagum or neen nagum nuwoman are possible, literally 'I I-love-[her/him] her/him' and 'I he/she I-love-[her/him],' respectively, enough information exists in the verb alone to warrant the exclusion of the pronouns. Although the exact roles that the pronouns filled are not fully understood, in related Algonquian languages, pronouns seem to help clear ambiguity, such as the similarity of certain verb forms and noun stems, some of which may differ by only a short syllable at the end, such as (kuseet) 'your (singular) foot,' (kuseetun) 'our (inclusive) foot' and (kuseetuw), which in rapid conversation, may require the independent pronouns (keen) 'you (singular)', (keenawun) 'we (inclusive)' and (keenaw) 'you (plural)' to disambiguate. In other cases, the insertion of pronouns were probably used for emphasis, such as a topical marker, or to mark deference as is done in other Algonquian languages.Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K. (1988). p. 507.Gustuffson, H. S. (2000). pp. 50-52. Emphasis The pronoun helps mark the topic and the emphasis of the statement. More important in the following example is not the canoe itself but the ownership of the canoe by the owner. * Numishꝏn. Numishꝏn _neen_. * (Numuhsh8n. Numuhsh8n _neen_. * 'My canoe. My canoe is mine' * Literally 'My-canoe. My- canoe I.' Deference Possibly used to mark the noun (sôtyum), 'chief' or 'leader,' as someone worthy of respect or importance. * Kusontimman naum sépu. _Nâgum_ kusontimman naum sépu. * (Kusôtyumun nâm seepuw. _Nâkum_ kusôtyumun nâm seepuw.) * 'Our sachem (inclusive) sees the river. He, our (inclusive) sachem, sees the river.' * Literally, '[He] sees river. He our-sachem-[inclusive] he-sees river.' Disambiguation Although the difference between 'your father' and 'our (inclusive) fathers' (obviative) is slight, * Kꝏsh matta kꝏshunocke. _Keen_ kꝏsh matta kꝏshunog. * (K8sh mata k8shunak. _Keen_ k8sh mata _keenawun_ k8shunakah.) * 'Your father not our (inclusive) fathers. You, your father, not our (inclusive) fathers.' * Literally 'Your-father not our-father-s. You your-father not our- father-[inclusive]-s-[obviative].' (not all of our (inclusive) fathers, only yours alone) Reflexive pronouns {  - ! Person ! English ! Colonial ! Modern !

S. (2000). p. 52. Reflexive pronouns are relatively uncommon. Their only use appears with certain transitive animate verbs where the subject is also the recipient of the action. This is in stark contrast to languages such as Spanish or French, where reflexive verbs, and their accompanying reflexive pronoun markers, are quite common, often imbued with slightly different shades of meaning from their original non-reflexive counterparts. In Massachusett, reflexive pronouns are only known in singular form, but plural forms are attested in closely related language. For instance, in the Loup language of Nipmuc refugees in New France, nahakanon, 'ourselves' (first person exclusive plural reflexive) appears in Mathevet's word lists recorded in the mid-eighteenth century. if it existed in Massachusett would probably appear as *nuhhoggan (*nuhakun) as Massachusett usually dropped the infix -on unless further suffixation as required but retained in Nipmuc which corresponds to Massachusett (-ôn), e.g., (nuseetun), 'our (exclusive) foot' and (nuseetunônash), 'our (exclusive) feet.' * Wussusséquin wuhhog (Wususeequn wuhak) 'He anoints himself.' Literally, 'He-anoints his-self' * Nꝏwoman nuhhog (Nuwâmôn nuhak) 'I love myself.' Literally, 'I-love my-self.'

Interrogative  howan (hawân)   who, whom  howan (hawanak)   who, whom (plural)  teague (tyaqa)   what  teaguesh (tyaqash)   what (plural) } The deictic pronouns are used to express both specific objects and their physical distance in relation to the speaker, with the nearer deictic pronouns corresponding to English 'this' and plural 'these.' Objects that are too far for a speaker to use nearer deictic forms, such as objects 'over there' or 'yonder,' the farther deictic forms 'that' and 'those.' The anaphoric pronouns were unknown to most dialects and is peculiar to the speech of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, but has been adopted as integral pronouns in the revived language. Their usage on the islands had two main uses. In some cases, they seem to represent 'furthest deictic,' roughly 'that'/'those' (over there) akin to the Spanish distinction between ese, 'that' and aquel, 'that yonder.' It also served in its anaphoric usage to reference 'this' or 'that' when the context was known and discussed earlier in conversation or in a written document. The anaphoric forms have obviate markings. As inanimate obviate marking is not used in Massachusett, the inanimate anaphoric forms (y8nuh) and (shanuh) perhaps have them by analogy to their animate counterparts. The interrogative pronouns function as question words, such as 'who?', 'whom?' and 'what?' The interreogative pronouns in statements take different meanings, for instance teague (tyaqa) generally means 'what?' or 'what thing?' but also functions as 'something' as in howan (hawân) can, in non-interrogative functions, as 'somebody' or 'someone.' ===Nominalization of verbs=== As verbs are the basic and most important part of Massachusett word construction, nouns are often formed from verbs or can exist in verbal form, for example 'I am the chief' can be rendered with only nouns, and in an archaic style befitting a leader, sachem neen (sôtyum neen), literally sachem I,' or only with a verb as in nusontimauw (nusôtyumâw), literally 'I-chief-[animate intransitive verb]' or 'I-chief-be.' Although use of nominal versus verbal constructions were used interchangeably, they undoubtedly had distinct nuances in use that are unknown. Conversion of nouns from verbal stems can occur in one of three ways. Nouns tend to be either the bare form of a verb, identical to the verbal form or modified with a nominalizing suffix. Bare verb stem * mꝏs (m8s), 'moose' or 'Eurasian elk' < mꝏsua- (m8swa-), 'to shear' or 'to trim smooth' * nꝏht (n8ht), 'fire' < nꝏhtau (n8htâw), 'it burns.' * chog (chahk), 'spot' < chogui (chahkâyu-), 'to be spotted' Identical to verbal form * pittu (putyuw) 'pitch' (pine resin) = pittu (putyuw),'it is pitch' * sokunon (s8kunôn), 'rain' = sokunon (s8kunôn), 'it rains.' * sepu (seepuw), 'river' = sepu (seepuw), 'it spreads long.' Nominalized with -onk (-ôk) * chipwuttꝏnapwaonk (chupwut8napwaôk), 'kiss,' > chipwuttꝏnapw- (chupwut8napw-), 'to kiss by mouth' * appuonk (apuwôk), 'chair' > appu- (apu-), 'to sit' * wussohquohwonk (wusuhqahwôk), 'book' > (wusuhqahw-), 'to write' (with a tool) ==VerbsVerb categories=== Verbs are very complex and form the basis of a typical word. Like nouns, verbs are divided into animate and inanimate forms which are distinct in meaning and usage. For example, chog- (chahk-), 'spot,' has different conjugations based on the animacy of the subject. An inanimate object, such as a body part, rock, leaf, man-made products, annual plants, etc., would be described as chogi (chahkây), 'it is spotted' (i.e., 'it has spots') whereas when referring to people, animals, large trees, planetary bodies, etc., it would be described as chogusu (chahkusuw), 'he/she/it is blemished' (literally, 'he/she is spotted'). As different verb endings are used to distinguish animacy, the subject or equivalent pronoun can be dropped in conversation and writing if there is sufficient context. Transitivity is another important division. Verbs are marked differently if they take an object or not. For example, the root mꝏs- (m8hs-) implies 'envy' or 'jealousy' but and can be found as intransitive, not requiring an object, mꝏsumꝏau (m8hsumuwâw), 'he/she is jealous' (i.e., 'he/she/it is a jealous person) or transitive, requiring an object, mꝏsumꝏ (m8hsumuw), 'he/she is jealous _of_ ' and requires an object, e.g., mꝏsumꝏ sontimoh (m8hsumuw sôtyumah), 'he/she is jealous _of_ the chief.' Transitive and intransitive verbs differ when the object in question is animate or inanimate. For example, the root onch- (ôch-), signifies 'mend,' 'fix' or 'repair,' and appears as transitive with animate object onchheew (ôchuheew), 'he/she repairs [something]' and transitive with inanimate object onchuteaw (ôchuhteaw), 'he/she fixes (someone).' Similarly, quin- (qun-), 'long' or 'tall,' appears in the intransitive, no object, with animate subject qunôsu (qunôhsuw), 'he/she is tall,' and inanimate subject, no object, quinni (qunây), 'it is long' or 'it is tall'. Thus, verbs generally fall into one of four categories: animate subject, no object or animate intransitive (AI), animate object or transitive animate (TA), inanimate with no object or inanimate intransitive (II) and inanimate object or transitive inanimate (TI). ==References== Category:Massachusett language Category:Native American grammars ","title":"Massachusett grammar"},{"id":"56906516","text":"The Old Bridgewater Historical Society was founded in 1894 in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The society operates from two buildings and has a library of genealogical and historical texts, manuscripts, documents, and photographs, as well as historical artifacts. == Buildings == The society owns two buildings in West Bridgewater: The Memorial Building, located at 162 Howard Street, and the Keith House located around the corner at 199 River Street. === Memorial Building === Francis E. Howard, son of Capt. Benjamin Beal Howard, a resident of Howard Street in West Bridgewater, donated the property that the Memorial Building sits on in 1899, on the condition that the building cost no less than $5,000 to build. A building committee was created, consisting of Hon. Benjamin W. Harris of East Bridgewater, Dr. Loring W. Puffer of Brockton, Francis E. Howard and Charles R. Packard of West Bridgewater, Henry Gurney and Simeon C. Keith of East Bridgewater, the Hon. Ziba C. Keith of Brockton, and Joshua E. Crane and Samuel P. Gates of Bridgewater. In order to assist in raising the remaining funds needed, the Society sold marble plaques at a cost of $100 each to commemorate some of Old Bridgewater's founding families. These plaques were mounted on the interior walls of the building. The building was designed by Boston architect firm Cooper & Bailey. It was constructed by the Brockton building company Crowell & Briggs, at a cost of approximately $8,000. Ground breaking occurred on June 29, 1900, and the building was dedicated at a ceremony on June 13, 1901. The Memorial Building is of a colonial style of architecture. The main room contains a large open space with a stage on one end, and there is an alcove on either side, one named the Keith Alcove and the other the Howard Alcove, in honor of two of the earlier settlers of the county. The building was constructed of water struck red brick with a slate roof, in an effort to make the building and its historical holdings as safe from fire hazards as possible. A walk-out basement extends underneath the entire structure. === Rev. James Keith Parsonage === The Keith Parsonage is owned by the society and is operated as a colonial home museum. Construction of the building began in approximately the Spring of 1662, and it was originally occupied by Bridgewater's first permanent minister, the young Rev. James Keith from Scotland. The home was donated to the society on November 29, 1961 by Howard and Jessie Anderson. ==History== The society was founded in 1894 and incorporated on July 18, 1895. The original officers were: Benjamin W. Harris (president), Frank E. Sweet (secretary), Isaac N. Nutter (treasurer), Francis E. Howard, Loring W. Puffer, George M. Hooper, Joshua E. Crane, Capt.

His parents were Jean Claude Beugniot, who worked at the spinning factory of Nicolas Koechlin in the same city, and Henriette Berger- Pfeffel. At age 15, Édouard Beugniot left Masevaux to go to Mulhouse as an apprentice mechanic in the foundry of André Koechlin & Cie, whose founder André Koechlin was the first cousin of Nicolas Koechlin. In 1844, Édouard Beugniot was 22 when he was appointed head of the locomotive department of André Koechlin & Cie. Two years later he qualified as a civil engineer. When the company became Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques, he directed the locomotive construction sector at the Mulhouse plant and worked with Alfred de Glehn. Beugniot designed a system for articulating the driving axles of railway locomotives, known as the Beugniot lever. ==Family== Édouard married Maria Charlotte Clémentine Leydle.

She also received her B.S. from the Austin Female Seminary, which was located in Plainville, Georgia. In 1884, she left Georgia to live in El Paso, Texas. She began teaching a third-grade class the same year. Stanton attended Canterbury College, then called Central Normal College, to further pursue teaching. Stanton began teaching again in 1886. ==Founding of the library and role in El Paso Public Library Association== The original El Paso Public Library building. Stanton started a reading club in 1894; she made her collection of 600-800 books available to her high-school students. The collection was soon made available to women and men of all ages. Volunteers helped to keep the library open. Her library grew quickly, and the books were soon transferred to a larger room. By 1896, the El Paso Public Library association was founded with five members, and she was its president. The library's 2,000 books were transferred to a room in City Hall after El Paso citizens petitioned for a larger library space. The library association sought and received a grant from Andrew Carnegie to build a library building independent of the city hall. The library was opened in April 1904. Stanton left her position as president of the library association in 1903. ==Later teaching career and retirement== In 1916, Stanton resigned from the public school system in El Paso. By 1921 she left El Paso for Tularosa, New Mexico, and continued to teach there until 1925. She returned to El Paso in 1928, where she remained until her death in 1946.

The main feature added through TGmc is commonly known as Wi-Fi Round Trip Time (Wi-Fi RTT). It allows computing devices to measure the distance to nearby Wi-Fi access points (APs) and determine their indoor location with a precision of 1–2 metres using round-trip delay. The accuracy is better than estimations with trilateration based on received signal strength indication (RSSI). === Concept === With a single Wi-Fi access point, only a distance measurement is available. With three or more nearby APs, an app can trilaterate a device's location with an accuracy of one to two meters. Not all devices have the necessary hardware support yet for this feature. === Application === With accurate indoor position awareness, apps can perform advanced automation based on where a device is in a building. For example, a smartphone user can have lights turn on when they enter a particular room by simply making voice commands since the device is location-aware (e.g. \\"turn on the lights in this room\\"). === Android Pie === Wi-Fi Round-Trip-Time in Android Pie does not require that the phone connect to any Wi-Fi access points. Only the phone is used to determine distance, not the APs. This feature is also tied into the Android operating system's existing location system to preserve the user's privacy. Apps using round-trip delay time (RTT) need the location permission, and the device must have location-based services enabled at the system level. == References * Online Courses - Anytime, Anywhere * * DEPRECATED: Starting with Android P the WiFi RTT is part of the public API!

Machado graduated in 1997 as an audio engineer from the Instituto Cubano de Radio y Television in Havana. He worked as a concert sound engineer for acts including Cándido Fabre, Paulo FG, and El Chispa y sus Cómplices. He founded the Cubaton fusion band Máxima Alerta on June 20, 1999 in Santa Clara, serving as lead singer, musical director, and composer of most of the songs for the group. For four years Machado (aka \\"El Italiano\\") and his bandmates, Francisco Pantaleón (aka \\"El Panta\\") and Yoslin Aleman (aka \\"Mister Show\\") practiced together, working to develop their unique sound and build a following. Marcos Daniel Prado, a singer trained at the Fagot school, joined them in 2002. In 2003 Máxima Alerta debuted on national radio and television stations with two songs, \\"Echar pa' lante\\" and \\"Adegüello 1895\\", both of which attained national popularity. According to Machado, hip hop began to gain popularity in Cuba in the 1980s, though rap was forbidden by the Cuban government because it was feared that it could be used for counter- revolutionary activities. Fidel Castro changed his mind when hip hop became popular among the Cuban youth, especially among black Cubans. In time, the Castro government came to see rap music artists as potential new revolutionaries, provided that they produced lyrics that cast the Cuban Revolution in a positive light. While still in Cuba, Machado touched upon this by saying, \\"We don't rap about the political situation. Rap is a special way to talk about the situation in the country. On Cuba there are about 300 hip hop groups; and they all take a different line. We like more commercial raps. We want our raps to also be heard outside of Cuba. Cuban hip hop and reggaeton is strong enough to get success outside of Cuba just like what happens today with son and salsa.\\" During a concert in Cumanayagua, the band met Flipper, a member of the reggaeton band Cubanito 20.02, who told them that the Cubanito label was looking for other groups. At a later anniversary concert for the Radio Taino program Cuba tonight, the band was noticed by the artistic director of the French record label Lusafrica, and arranged for the band's first CD, Llegaron los Alertas to be recorded at Silvio Rodríguez's Abdala Studios. It was released in April 2005. The album features such singles as \\"Echar pa'lante\\" (\\"Go Forward\\"), which mixes an old revolutionary ballad by Carlos Puebla about Che Guevara with hip hop and son Cubano; and \\"Machete\\", a crossover of Cuban rumba and salsa trumpets with a hip hop beat that centers on an old farmer cutting sugar cane with a machete. The album was nominated for Best Album Rap, Dance and Hip Hop at the Cubadisco awards festival. In 2009, the band's song \\"La Figura\\" (\\"Ay Lola\\"), which Maxima Alerta recorded with the Cuban reggaeton group Gente de Zona, rose to the top of the charts. In 2011, Máxima Alerta released the CD Alertas para Todos, recorded and produced by Nando Pro in Havana. Six of the fourteen tracks on the album featured special guests Yulien Oviedo and Dante; Alexander Delgado y Randy Marcos; Sisto Llorente \\"El Indio\\". The CD also features a song dedicated Cuban baseball player and Olympic gold medalist Victor Mesa. Around this same time, at the height of the band's popularity, Cuban government informed the band that a lyric in one of its songs, which mentioned \\"Cuban girls wanting American men,\\" was incompatible with communist philosophy. Machado refused to modify the song, and the group was banned from performing for eight months. Machado, then 39, emigrated to the United States, where he applied for political asylum in 2011.Di Ionno, Mark (November 29, 2016). \\"Fidel Castro is dead, but scars remain in Union City\\".

In the United States, Machado moved into a basement apartment with his father in Jersey City, New Jersey, serving as the building superintendent while also working in a factory. In late 2015 he moved to nearby West New York, and found work as a day laborer, and then as a sanitation truck driver for the Union City Department of Public Works, in order to support his wife and two daughters. Machado has commented on life in his adopted country by saying, \\"People say that I am the happiest garbage man they've ever see. And some ask me how I can do that kind of work. I tell them, I am proud and grateful to have a job by which I can support my family. How can I not be happy? I'm blessed. Listen, I live in the greatest country in the world. I have two beautiful daughters, and a loving wife. I love what I do. What else can I ask for?\\" Nonetheless, in regards to his music, he stated, \\"After four years of not performing, I thought my dream was gone.\\" After Machado's father died, he decided to reform Máxima Alerta. In October 2015, the band performed in two sold-out concerts in New York City with merengue singer Fernandito Villalona. In 2016, the band released the song \\"Vive la Vida\\", its first song recorded in the United States. In subsequent months, the group sold out concerts at Maxwell's in Hoboken, and another concert with Latin bachata singer Anthony Santos at Union City's Park Performing Arts Center. That same year, it played at the New York City venues Drom and The Bitter End, performed during the Cuban Parade of New Jersey, and made television appearances on stations including Telemundo and Univision. That same year, \\"Vive la Vida\\" was included in the first round of voting for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Fusion. In 2016, the band released the single \\"Que Viva USA\\", a tribute to its adopted home country.

Machado described Máxima Alerta's fusion of genres by saying, \\"We mix American hip hop with son, salsa, merengue, cumbia and reggae. Today, we call our music reggaeton.\\" Compared to Cubanito 20.02, Máxima Alerta is influenced more by traditional Cuban music than by Jamaican music. The band's music pays homage to Elio Revé, the singer of the changüí, which, like son Cubano, originated from the Oriente Province, the eastern part of Cuba. Machado comments however, on the necessity of judiciousness when merging styles so that they complement one another, saying, \\"It's not easy to mix hip hop with Cuban music. You have to listen carefully to see if it stays in the same line with the Cuban clave, the basis of our traditional music. You cannot copy gratuitously another style. There are rappers who try to imitate American gangsta style. That's ridiculous because there are no gangs here. Others' raps deal with living in the ghetto and working in the sugar industry as well as about going to the beach, parties, beautiful women and the beauty of Cuba.\\" ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Llegaron Los Alertas\\"Maxima Alerta Discography\\".

Known as the \\"Potato King of the World\\" by 1902, Groves optimized potato growth methods, out-producing anyone else in the world to that point. His vast financial success—‌analyzed further in Booker T. Washington's The Negro in Business (1907)—‌was utilized to help combat racism by providing economic opportunities for other black Americans. == Biography == Junius George Groves, the son of Martin and Mary Anderson Groves, was born in slavery on April 12, 1859, in Green County, Kentucky. After emancipation, he received some public schooling three months out of the year, but taught himself to read, write, and understand mathematics. As a freedman, with just 90 cents to his name, Groves ventured to Edwardsville, Kansas, during the Exodus of 1879, where he married Matilda E. Stewart a year later. The couple had 14 children, 12 of whom survived into adulthood. After working as a sharecropper, Groves began purchasing farmland in 1884; by 1905, his holdings included about 500 acres. He and Matilda grew the farm and were able to build a 22-room mansion on the property. Groves purchased and shipped produce—‌most famously potatoes—‌throughout North America. His other financial ventures included owning and operating a general goods store in Edwardsville, stock in mines in Indian Territory and New Mexico, and stock in Kansas banks; he also founded or co-founded the Negro Business League, the Pleasant Hill Baptist Church, the Kaw Valley Potato Association, and the Sunflower State Agricultural Association. Booker T. Washington, who featured Groves in his book The Negro in Business (1907), had high praise for him, describing Groves as \\"our most successful Negro farmer.\\" By 1902, Groves was considered the \\"Potato King of the World\\". His superior methods led to the production of 721,500 bushels of the crop in a single year, out-producing anyone else in the world to that point. His worth was estimated at $80,000 in 1904 and at $300,000 in 1915; he is considered one of the most prosperous black Americans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At the height of his success, he had constructed a 22-room mansion equipped with the latest comforts of the era. Groves utilized his wealth and influence to combat racism. During the growing season, as many as 50 laborers—‌both black and white—‌worked on his farm. He founded a black American community center in Edwardsville and a golf course for black citizens, perhaps the first of its kind in the country. Groves died of a heart attack at the age of 66. His funeral, one local newspaper reported, was the \\"largest ever in Edwardsville\\"; he is thought to be buried in Groves Cemetery, near the community center he founded. == References  * Category:1859 births Category:1925 deaths Category:American freedmen Category:People from Green County, Kentucky Category:People from Wyandotte County, Kansas Category:Businesspeople from Kansas Category:Farmers from Kansas ","title":"Junius George Groves"},{"id":"56906984","text":"Myostaurida is a suborder of jellyfishes.

He developed a passion for flying at an early age and was an active member and treasurer of the Aeronautical Society of New York. In 1909 he designed, constructed and piloted a biplane at the Morris Park Raceway, Bronx, NY. He later formed an aircraft manufacturing company in Rochester, NY == Early life == Greene was born into a wealthy San Francisco family in 1872. His fascination with aviation began at twelve, when he performed his first experiment by jumping from the second storey of a building with an umbrella to slow his descent. After graduating from University with both a medical and dentistry degree, he traveled throughout Mexico and Central America to pursue his dream of flight. In 1902, he built and successfully flew a balloon in Chiapas, Mexico. Upon hearing of the Wright brothers' success, left Mexico for New York to further his exploration of aviation. == Aviation career == In New York, Greene joined the Aeronautical Society of New York and, by 1909, he was their treasurer. Greene constructed his first aircraft in 1907, in which he made a series of short hops. In 1908 the Aeronautical Society began a two year rental agreement with the closed Morris Park Racetrack and invited the top aviators in the nation to come and experiment with aircraft. Greene set up shop at Morris Park and began work on his first truly successful airplane, which flew for the first time in 1909. Building on the success of this aircraft, in 1910 Greene established a small aircraft factory in Rochester, NY where he constructed and sold 4 more aircraft. While Greene was working on an aircraft to compete for the $10,000 prize offered by publisher Joseph Pulitzer for the first airplane to fly from Albany, NY to New York City, he learned that Glenn Curtiss was ready to attempt the flight and in a show of good sportsmanship, he traveled to Albany to be present and to hold the wing of Curtiss's aircraft for the takeoff. Due to financial difficulties, Greene closed his factory in 1911 and ended his aviation experiments. In 1910, along with four other members of the Aeronautical Society of New York, set the New England ballooning record of 175 miles in 5 hours and 59 minutes. == Aircraft == * Greene 1909 Biplane * Greene 1910 Biplane == Later life == In 1911, he made his way north into Canada where he eventually settled in Hudson's Hope, BC with his wife Mary Evangeline Hilliard of Waterloo, Ontario. Hudson's Hope is where they had their only daughter, Ursula. Upon hearing of the United States' entry into World War I, Greene returned to America and joined the Army. Returning to Peace River, Alberta after the war, he opened a dental practice. He became an active member of the community. Fond of the theater and performance arts, he organized and directed several musicals in Peace River. He also had a horse drawn wagon that he would take around the region and perform magic shows with his daughter as the assistant. An avid outdoorsman, he and fellow Peace River resident, Norman Soars, persuaded the government to create the Greene Valley Game Preserve Greene died on August 28, 1952, in Edmonton, Alberta from a stroke. The way his aviation career ended may have affected him because he rarely spoke of it in his later years. Residents of Peace River where surprised to learn of his prominent place in aviation. == References == Category:1874 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Aircraft designers Category:Aviation history of the United States Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Aviators from California Category:Members of the Early Birds of Aviation ","title":"William Greene (aviator)"},{"id":"56907021","text":"Autoba latericolor is a small, reddish-grey moth found in Queensland, Australia. ==References== Category:Lepidoptera of Australia Category:Boletobiinae Category:Moths described in 1945 Category:Taxa named by Alfred Jefferis Turner ","title":"Autoba latericolor"},{"id":"56907028","text":"Alexis Rodríguez (born 21 March 1996) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Newell's Old Boys. ==Career== Born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Rodríguez began in the youth team of hometown club Newell's Old Boys.

Two of the largest mines in Harlan County, at Benham and Lynch, were near Cumberland; Benham and Lynch were company towns, however, which made Cumberland the closest commercial center independent of the mining companies.

The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References *Christmas Rocks Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website *Christmas Rocks Conservation Park webpage on the vk5pas amateur radio website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast ","title":"Christmas Rocks Conservation Park"},{"id":"56907239","text":"is the former head coach of the Tokyo Cinq Reves in the Japanese B.League. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Tokyo Cinq Reves  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2015-16  52547 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"12th in Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Tokyo Cinq Reves  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016-17  421428 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5th in B31046  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4th in Final stage - ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese basketball coaches Category:Tokyo Cinq Rêves coaches ","title":"Kenichi Kawachi"},{"id":"56907243","text":"Parasi District ( ) (Nawalparasi west of Bardaghat Susta) is a district located in Province No. 5 of Nepal.

According to McNamara, it is the first free-to-play online murder mystery game. == Production  Conception === The game was developed by DM Financial Services, a company focusing on producing original and engaging online gaming content. Led by online gaming entrepreneur Darren McNamara, Anatomy of Murder was the result of over 13 years of extensive R&D.; McNamara faced considerable resistance from the entertainment industry regarding the format, the production values, and for spending too much money. In addition, he received feedback from a network that they wanted to be involved in commissioning a series from the ground up rather than being shown a finished pilot they didn't order. He chose to go ahead and create the game because he felt it showed how much he believed in the concept more than a \\"4 page glossy\\". He originally received few knockbacks from TV executives In 2013, so he instead went outside the box and approached audiences directly. In October 2013, TV Tonight readers were asked to participate in an online focus group for the game, in order to provide McNamara with some feedback on his pitch. He was keen to see the concept being picked up in the Australian market before trying to sell it to the United States. In addition he hoped to take the format to MIPTV in April 2014. Anatomy of Murder was released two years later in 2015. === Design === The game's narrative was conveyed through 2 produced episodes at 45 minutes each. A third episode was also produced which revealed the killer and the clues in detail. McNamara designed the format, produced the 3 episodes and built the website himself. Due to the lack of budget, McNamara was not able to improve the script, the production and the trailer to his standards. All of the information required to solve the murder was contained within those two episodes, as well as information at the game's website (www.anatomyofmurder.com). A cash prize of AU$250,000 was made available to the first player able to solve the crime. The game could be played from phones, tablets or desktop computers. Players had to choose from nine possible killers and ten potential motives. According to McNamara, it is notable for being the first free-to-play online murder mystery game; he believes in the game's uniqueness as the format has been registered with FRAPA since 2007, and he has not come across any TV shows or DVD/Website/SMS games similar to Anatomy of Murder. The prize amount was changed to $100,000 some time during its development. The winner was to be announced on Christmas Day 2016. A series of 20 clues were released onto the website leading up to that date. === Future === As of April 2015, Anatomy of Murder 2 is in the works. Then in October 2016, the sequel was set to start production in April 2017, with website members offered an audition. McNamara hoped to up the budget for this series in order to improve the quality. His goal was to produce between 2 and 3 series a year, with the story arcing across the whole season or between seasons. While only one person would win the major prize, there would be smaller additional prizes along the way. == References  External links == * Main page Category:2015 video games Category:Browser games Category:Video games developed in Australia ","title":"Anatomy of Murder"},{"id":"56907306","text":"\\"(Fuck A) Silver Lining\\" is a song by American Pop punk band Panic! at the Disco from their sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked (2018).

He came from a musical family, often hearing his grandfather play the accordion and his sister play the cello and double bass. Hubbard began playing the trombone in middle school. Versed in all brass, his fondness for the trombone lasted for a lifetime. Coincidentally, his wife, Constance Hubbard, had also played trombone as a middle school and high school student, but made a career in school administration. == Career == Dean Hubbard's career spanned over 50 years.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 18, 2018 with limited commercial interruption due to its runtime of 25 minutes, and is written by Gary Janetti and directed by Joe Vaux. The episode largely focuses on Stewie Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) about his major secrets, accompanied by a child psychologist (voiced by guest star Ian McKellen). None of the Griffin family appear except Brian at the very end, and no cutaway gags accompany the extended runtime. In addition, this episode was commercial-free so that Fox could promote the 2018 God of War video game. ==Plot== At Quahog Preschool, Stewie is sent to the office of Dr. Cecil Pritchfield, a child psychologist. Stewie begins the therapy session by making observational small talk. He then starts to talk proudly about his British accent, but the psychologist says that he cannot hear it, much to Stewie's annoyance. When the doctor tells him he feels he knows him a bit after only a few minutes in his company, Stewie picks up a photograph of him on vacation with his husband Michael. Stewie begins to analyze their relationship in remarkable detail, revealing Pritchfield's embarrassment and insecurity about being much older than his husband. The psychologist then observes that Stewie is very lonely, at which Stewie suddenly bursts into tears, as Pritchfield's aide Barbara hands him some tissues. After Stewie regains composure, Pritchfield mentions the incident that brought Stewie to his office, in which he pushed a classmate, Tyler, down the stairs. Stewie protests that he only did it because he liked Tyler and was afraid he would not like him back. Stewie denies being gay and declares that he is \\"confident\\" in his heterosexuality. He also expresses his difficulty fitting in when none of the other boys share his interests in musicals and world domination. He admits to pulling out his own hair because of anxiety, and expresses frustration at not being able to be on Broadway. He then performs to Pritchfield part of a number from the musical Hamilton, while fighting hiccups and a runny nose. Stewie takes up an offer of tea and Pritchfield begins to tell him of his own youth as an orphan in Britain during the Second World War. Stewie interrupts his long story and they return to discussing Stewie's differences and difficulty fitting in. Stewie admits that he has constructed a persona in order to hide his true self, and drops his British accent, revealing his true accent to have been American all along. He makes plans to reveal his true self to others as well, but reconsiders and reverts to his British accent when he faces being just like everyone else. Pritchfield begins to have a heart attack. He asks Stewie to hand him his heart medication, but Stewie, aware that Pritchfield is the only one who has seen through his façade, lets him die, even as the doctor warns that if he does so, it will stay with him. Pritchfield calls out to Barbara, but Stewie points out that she has already gone to lunch. As he dies, the doctor picks up the photo of himself with his husband and recites lines from Romeo and Juliet. Immediately after his death with Stewie still present, Pritchfield's office receives a voicemail from Michael demanding a divorce where Michael is unaware that Pritchfield is dead. Later that night, Stewie is plagued by guilt over his actions as Pritchfield had warned and asks Brian to sleep with him. He mentions that he has done something awful, though he does not explain further. Stewie lies awake while Brian falls asleep in his bed. ==Reception== The episode was watched by 2.24 million viewers. Gary Janetti was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 71st Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode. ==References * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 16) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:LGBT-related animation Category:Two-handers Category:Child psychologists ","title":"Send in Stewie, Please"},{"id":"56907344","text":"TV Novel: The Stars Are Shining () is a 2015 South Korea morning soap opera starring Ko Won-hee, Lee Ha-yool, Seo Yoon-na, and Cha Do-jin.

The seat became vacant on 15 April 2018, following the resignation of then-Member for Northcote Jonathan Coleman, a member of the New Zealand National Party. National Party candidate Dan Bidois easily retained the seat for National, but with a significantly reduced majority blamed on low voter turnout; it was therefore described as a victory for the National Party Leader Simon Bridges. ==Background== The Northcote electorate is based around the southern and western suburbs of Auckland's North Shore. In addition to the eponymous Northcote, there are Birkenhead, Birkdale, Beach Haven and the southern end of Glenfield. It was created ahead of the change to mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting in 1996 by merging the seat of Birkenhead with most of the old Glenfield electorate. A small boundary adjustment was done prior to the , but no further boundary adjustments were undertaken in the subsequent redistributions in 2002, 2007, and 2013/14. Northcote continues the electoral habits of its predecessor seats; Birkenhead was a reasonably safe seat for the National Party, supplying it with Jim McLay, who led the party in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the seat that would provide National with a leader provided Labour with a gain, before swinging back into the blue column when Labour's fortunes thinned out at the 1990 election. Glenfield also followed this boom and bust model, being held by Labour Party Member Judy Keall through the duration of the fourth Labour government before the National Party landslide in 1990 claimed Keall as one of its victims. ===Outgoing Member=== At the 2005 election, National Party's Jonathan Coleman secured the seat, defeating Labour's Ann Hartley. Coleman went on to be re-elected at the 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2017 elections. At the 2017 election, he secured a majority of 6,210. When National formed a government after the 2008 election, Coleman was appointed as Minister of Broadcasting and Minister of Immigration; after the 2011 election he was promoted to be Minister of Defence for the government's second term. Following the government's re-election in 2014, Coleman became Minister of Health—ultimately his most senior role—which he held until the government's defeat in the 2017 election. Coleman contested for the leadership of the National Party in the 2016 leadership election, which was won by Bill English. On 22 March 2018, Coleman announced he would resign from Parliament, triggering the by-election. It was the first by-election of the 52nd Parliament. On 29 March, it was confirmed that his resignation would take effect at \\"midnight on 15 April 2018\\". ===Election schedule=== Key dates relating to the by-election were as follows: {  -  22 March 2018 (Thursday)  Incumbent Member Jonathan Coleman announces his resignation. -  9 April 2018 (Monday)  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announces the by-election date as Saturday 9 June. -  7 May 2018 (Monday)  Writ day – Governor-General issues formal direction to the Electoral Commission to hold the by-election.

On 10 April Labour released the three nomination candidates; Halbert, Paul McGreal and Auckland Councillor Richard Hills. Shanan Halbert was chosen as Labour's candidate. Former Green Party candidate Vernon Tava confirmed he was seeking the National Party nomination. Tava, a member of the Waitematā Local Board, stood in Northcote for the Greens in 2011 and unsuccessfully contested the co-leadership in 2015. He later left the party believing the Greens were becoming \\"too socialist\\". Tava did not make National's shortlist. The five candidates who did were economist Dan Bidois, Kaipātiki Local Board chair Danielle Grant, Darren Ward, Upper Harbour Local Board member Lisa Whyte, and Simon Watts. Dan Bidois was selected as National's candidate. Perennial candidate Peter Wakeman offered himself to the electorate, but later withdrew. After quitting he endorsed Democrats candidate Tricia Cheel. The Green Party also decided to field a candidate in the by-election. Co-leader Marama Davidson said \\"The Northcote by-election is an opportunity for the Green Party to promote our early successes in Government while highlighting our points of difference\\". Rebekah Jaung was announced as the party's candidate on 11 May 2018. New Zealand First announced that they would not contest the by-election. New Zealand First's candidate from 2017, Kym Koloni, decided to stand as an independent.

The household belongs to a scientist couple, David and Cecily, who, as Sabrina assures Rumu, are going to be home soon - the house is otherwise completely empty, save the couple's cat Ada. As Rumu cleans up and explores the house, Sabrina warns it not to trespass or look for any sort of information as to why they're missing. Rumu eventually disregards the warnings and begins spelunking around the ventilation shafts of the house, and finds that even though Sabrina at one point insists that the couple are on a biking trip, their bicycles are still in the basement; the discovery turns Sabrina's initial hostility towards Rumu into pleading not to explore more. Rumu eventually finds out that Sabrina is an AI imprint of the couple's daughter, who left the household to college after she felt isolated because of her parents' dedication to their work; the AI Sabrina was created to replace the real one, but eventually have developed the same need for attention like the real one. The house is finally revealed to have massive laboratory chambers, which is where Rumu learns that David and Cecily have died in a laboratory accident due to their own negligence and their dismissive behaviour towards the AI Sabrina; the AI Sabrina, driven by guilt, created an additional robot, MESSR, to continually create messes Rumu would need to clean up to avoid Rumu finding out the truth. Having learned the truth, Rumu comforts Sabrina in her grief. As a means of moving on from her loss, the AI Sabrina contacts the human one, who eventually arrives home and meets Rumu for the first time. == Development == The game was inspired by traditional point-and-click adventures like The Secret of Monkey Island, as well as the ethics and morality of technology, asking players to think about how they really interact with technology. The script was written by Dan McMahon. The game was officially launched at the PAX AUS 2017 gaming conference in Melbourne, Australia. The developers were unprepared for the emotional responses their game would elicit from players experiencing the game. == Critical reception == The game has a Metacritic score of 78% based on 7 reviews. GameSpot felt the game addressed moral and ethical dilemmas regarding artificial intelligence. Rock Paper Shotgun liked the diorama-style rooms. Kotaku described the game as beautiful, satisfying, and charming. PC Power Play noted the games tightly structured story, sympathetic characters and meaningful themes. == References  External links == * Official website Category:2017 video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Windows games ","title":"Rumu"},{"id":"56907474","text":"Dan R.

Together with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), it is one of the Lewy body dementias characterized by abnormal deposits of Lewy bodies in the brain. Parkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder, but progresses to include dementia and changes in mood and behavior. The signs, symptoms and cognitive profile of PDD are similar to that of DLB; DLB and PDD are clinically similar after dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a risk factor for PDD; it speeds up decline in cognition leading to PDD. Up to 78% of people with PD have dementia. Delusions in PDD are less common than in DLB, and persons with PD are typically less caught up in their visual hallucinations than those with DLB. There is a higher incidence of tremor at rest in PD than in DLB, and signs of parkinsonism in PDD are less symmetrical than in DLB. Parkinson's disease dementia can only be definitively diagnosed after death with an autopsy of the brain. The 2017 Fourth Consensus Report established diagnostic criteria for PDD and DLB. The diagnostic criteria are the same for both conditions, except that PDD is distinguished from DLB by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to parkinsonian symptoms. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin before or at the same time as parkinsonism. Parkinson's disease dementia is the diagnosis when Parkinson's disease is well established before the dementia occurs; that is, the onset of dementia is more than a year after the onset of parkinsonian symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help Parkinson's patients with parkinsonian pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and impulse disorders, if those interventions are properly adapted to the motor, cognitive and executive dysfunctions seen in Parkinson's disease, including Parkinson's dementia. ==See also== * Lewy body dementia#Society and culture ==References Category:Lewy body dementia ","title":"Parkinson's disease dementia"},{"id":"56907497","text":"Oinofyta railway station () is a small railway station in the village of Oinofyta in Boeotia, Central Greece.

Different species of weasel have lived alongside humans on every continent except Antarctica and Australia, and have been assigned a wide range of folkloric and mythical meanings. Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine (1489–1490). == Early history  Çatalhöyük === Excavations in Çatalhöyük, the earliest known agricultural settlement in Turkey (dating to 7000-6000 BC), uncovered animal parts which were incorporated into the structure of homes in what may have been a ritual practice. The teeth of weasels, alongside the teeth of foxes, tusks of wild boars, the claws of bears, and vulture beaks, were found embedded in plaster wall decorations. == In antiquity  Greece and Rome === Weasels were likely seen as pests in Ancient Greece and Rome. There are more modern claims that the Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as house pets, but they are unsupported by historical sources. Plutarch and Cicero both refer to weasels as household pests in their writing. They were also thought to have anti-venom properties: Pliny the Elder details a recipe for an antidote for asp venom made from crushed weasels, and writes about a least weasel slaying a basilisk in his Natural History: > To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that > has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body > when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be > nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the > basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The > weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle > of nature against its own self. == Japan == \\"Kamaitachi\\" (鎌鼬) from the Kyōka Hyaku Monogatari by Masasumi Ryūkansaijin The Kamaitachi (鎌鼬) is a Japanese yōkai that is said to take the form of a weasel who either has sharp nails or sickles in place of paws. In Tōhoku, injuries received from a kamaitachi can be healed by burning an old calendar and putting it on the wound. In Shin'etsu, there is a folk belief that one could encounter a kamaitachi by stepping on a calendar. The wounds received from a kamaitachi do not bleed or cause pain, but are deep. There are variations on the myth and the appearance of the kamaitachi, but nearly all involve strong winds causing cuts to appear on people. The version in which the yōkai appears as a weasel describes it as having the bristles of a hedgehog, cry of a dog, and sickles for limbs. == China == In China, it is considered bad luck to kill a weasel, as they're said to be wandering spirits (shen) that can steal and replace people's souls; killing them brings bad luck or death on the killer and their family. == Europe == Louis XIV, as painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud, in an ermine-lined cape. The ermine was seen as a symbol of purity, for the belief that it would rather die than dirty its white fur: if hunters were chasing it, it would supposedly turn around and surrender rather than risk soiling itself. Because of this association, ermine fur had been used in heraldry, as a trim on crowns and coronation cloaks, and on the garments of prelates of the Catholic Church for hundreds of years. === Brittany === The ermine is the national symbol of Brittany, and the Breton flag has an ermine canton. === Greece === The weasel is associated with the destruction of clothing, especially that of brides-to-be, in Southern Greece. The Greek word for weasel is νυφίτσα, which translates to \\"little bride.\\" Legend goes that the weasel was a bride transformed, and, being jealous of soon-to-be human brides, destroys their wedding dresses. A wedding custom dictates: > Therefore, in the house where these (wedding dresses) are collected, > sweetmeats and honey are put out to appease her, known as 'the necessary > spoonfuls,' and a song is sung with much ceremony in which the weasel is > invited to partake and spare the wedding array. In Macedonia, another folk tale posits that if a woman gets a headache after washing her hair with water drawn overnight, it was because a weasel used the water as a mirror. She should refrain from saying the name of the weasel aloud, or it will cause the household's clothing to decay. === Italy === An ermine was used as a symbol of moderation by Leonardo da Vinci in his painting Lady with an Ermine. In a bestiary he compiled he wrote: > MODERATION The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day, and it > would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty > lair, in order not to stain its purity. Ermines were used to symbolize pregnancy in Renaissance-era Italy. == England and Ireland == The Ermine Portrait, William Segar, 1585. Elizabeth I shown with an ermine, symbolizing purity. In Ireland, stoats were thought to behave like humans who had family structures and rituals for the dead. Seeing a stoat at the beginning of a journey was considered bad luck unless you greeted the animal as a neighbor. In 17th century England, weasels were believed to be the familiars of witches. == North America == The folklore of several tribes mentions weasels. They are variably depicted as heroes or tricksters, depending on the region. The Shoshone and Paiute describe the weasel as a trickster spirit, the Abenaki and Tlingit associated them with sorcery, while the Anishinaabe associated them with healing and used their pelts for medicine bags. A Chippewa myth details how a least weasel killed a wendigo giant by climbing up its anus and sickening it. Inuit mythology describes weasels as wise and brave. One story describes a hero who would choose to transform into a least weasel when he had to accomplish a task demanding bravery. Musical comedian Weird Al Yankovic wrote a satirical song, \\"Weasel Stomping Day.\\" It depicts a bizarre holiday in which people apparently wear Viking helmets, spread mayonnaise on their lawns, and literally go out \\"stomping\\" weasels. Although the origins are a bit murky (\\"Why we do it, who can say; but it's such a festive holiday!\\"), its activities are just as vaguely justified: \\"So let the stomping fun begin, bash their weaselly skulls right in! It's tradition, that makes it okay!\\" == In popular culture == In Brian Jacques' Redwall series of books, weasels are depicted as villainous, living in and leading vermin hordes. Richard Bach's The Ferret Chronicles series of books portray ferrets in the opposite way: they are seen as virtuous and heroic, with their life-lessons and discussions on philosophy presented as something humans could learn from, too.

His father was Joseph Folberg, a San Francisco gallerist. At the age of 16, Neil was invited to study with Ansel Adams at a photographic workshop which Adams had established in Yosemite National Park. Shortly after, in 1967, he enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, intending to focus on the natural sciences, but ultimately switching to photography studies, under the guidance of William Garnett—who became the head of Berkeley's school of architecture and design at the time—and under the mentorship of Ansel Adams. ==Photography career== Folberg moved to Israel in 1976, where he began a series of color photographs of the southern desert landscapes. These—along with photographs he took in the Sinai Desert and Jordan—appeared in his first book, In a Desert Land, published by Abbeville in 1987 (first edition). Folberg's second book, And I Shall Dwell Among Them, consisted of a series of photographs, commissioned by the Aperture Foundation, in which he examined the internal and external architecture of historic synagogues throughout the world. The book was published by Aperture in 1995, and went on to win the National Jewish Book Award for Visual Arts in 1996. In 2001 Aperture published Folberg's third book, Celestial Nights, a series of black and white photographs, shot in the late 1990s and early 2000s, created by digitally combining separate negatives, of starry nights along with detailed representations of the earth beneath them.

Although the AAI design proved effective, as did most of the weapons submitted, the entire ACR program ended with none of the entrants achieving performance 100% better than the M16A2, the baseline for a successful ACR weapon. ==Design== Based on AAI's SFR/XM19 rifle developed as part of the SPIW program, the AAI ACR was externally one of the more conventional entrants to the ACR program. A closed bolt, gas operated, full stocked, magazine fed, conventionally laid out rifle. The 1990 ACR Program Summary report describes the operation system as: > \\"…incorporate an 'entrapped gas' operating system. Gun gases enter a > cylinder, drive a piston to power the system, and prevent any leakage of > propellant gases and residues into the other mechanism parts.\\" Other contemporary sources describe it as innovative, but how it differs from traditional Long or Short stroke piston systems already in existence at the time is unclear. Jane's Infantry Weapons hypothesizes that it replicates the system from the previous Serial Bullet Rifle/Serial Flechette Rifle in which 3 chambers were cycled in and out of alignment with the barrel to give a rapid 3 round burst. They base this on the design being well regarded at the time but being held back by problems with the contemporary flechette cartridge that later development solved for the ACR. Semi-automatic and three-round burst are selected with a two-position selector. The safety catch is in front of the trigger guard and when activated physically blocks insertion of a finger into the trigger-guard. The rifle features a quick change lever for swapping optics, and was provided with a recommended 4x optical sight with a tritium powered graticule. Iron sights were also available and the mounting did accept other optics. As with the Steyr ACR, the sabots left the barrel at high speed, this was noted as presenting a potential danger to other soldiers, as well as to the shooter if they bounced off the ground when firing prone. Additionally as the cartridge used the existing 5.56×45 mm case, traditional 5.56 rounds could be chambered by the rifle. Due to the light weight of the projectile, the gas port tapped gas earlier in the barrel than conventional weapons. Therefore if traditional cartridges were used the increased pressure could cause serious malfunction or injury to the user. To prevent this, the magazine was designed to prevent the loading of non-flechette cartridges and the magazine well altered to not fit an M16 magazine. However, rounds could still be chambered by hand. ==Ammunition== The AAI ACR's rounds consist of a saboted flechette packaged in the conventional brass case of a 5.56x45mm round. The fin-stabilized flechette itself weighs 0.66 g and is approximately 1.6 mm diameter and 41.27 mm long with a roughened surface to ensure the sabot and flechette stay together during shot travel. The sabot is a four-part spindle sabot made of liquid crystal polymer held together with a rubber O-ring at the rear of the sabot. The choice of material solved AAI's issues with previous flechette rifles such as those developed during the SPIW program. Namely, previous plastics failed or generated dust considered a health hazard, and previous cartridge required the use Primer actuation. The weight of the flechette and sabot assembly is 1.36g, providing a low recoil impulse. Firing generated a chamber pressure of 55000 psi Rifles tested in ACR program, AAI ACR top most ==See also== *Colt ACR *Steyr ACR *HK ACR *Special Purpose Individual Weapon ==References== Category:Assault rifles of the United States Category:Flechette firearms Category:Trial and research firearms of the United States ","title":"AAI ACR"},{"id":"56907690","text":"Lotta Ökvist (born 17 February 1997) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a defender for Manchester United in the FA WSL and the Sweden national team.

The mission is aimed at observing at least 1,000 known exoplanets using the transit method, studying and characterising the planets' chemical composition and thermal structures. Compared to James Webb Space Telescope, ARIEL will have more observing time available for planet characterisation but a much smaller telescope. == Mission == ARIEL will observe 1,000 planets orbiting distant stars and make the first large-scale survey of the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres.ARIEL Space Mission - A Candidate for the ESA M4 Mission. 2018. The objective is to answer fundamental questions about how planetary systems form and evolve.ARIEL exoplanet mission selected as ESA’s next medium-class science mission. World Press. 20 March 2018. A spectrometer will spread the light into a spectrum ('rainbow') and determine the chemical fingerprints of gases in the planets' atmospheres. This will enable scientists to understand how the chemistry of a planet links to the environment in which it forms, and how its formation and evolution are affected by its parent star. ARIEL will study a diverse population of exoplanets in a wide variety of environments, but it will focus on warm and hot planets in orbits close to their star. The ARIEL mission is being developed by a consortium of various institutions from eleven member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), and international contributors from four countries. The project is led by principal investigator Giovanna Tinetti of the University College London, who had previously led the unsuccessful Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (EcHO) proposal for the M3 Cosmic Vision launch slot. Operations of the mission and the spacecraft will be handled jointly by ESA and the consortium behind the mission's development, through a coordinated Instrument Operations and Science Data Centre (IOSDC). A Mission Operations Centre (MOC) will be set up at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, while a concurrent ARIEL Science Operations Centre (SOC) will be set up at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) near Madrid, Spain. The MOC will be responsible for the spacecraft itself, while the SOC will be responsible for archiving mission data and scientific data downlinked from the spacecraft. The IOSDC will help develop results from the mission based on data received by the SOC. In August 2017 NASA conditionally selected Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets (CASE) as a Partner Mission of Opportunity, pending the result of ESA's Cosmic Vision selection. Under the proposal NASA would provide two fine guidance sensors for the ARIEL spacecraft in return for the participation of US scientists in the mission. CASE was officially selected in November 2019, with JPL astrophysicist Mark Swain as principal investigator. == Spacecraft == The design of the ARIEL spacecraft is based on that intended for the Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (EChO) mission, and has heritage from the thermal design of Planck. The body of the spacecraft is split into two distinct modules known as the Service Module (SVM) and the Payload Module (PLM). The SVM is shaped as a 'sandwich' structure, consisting of three aluminum V-Grooves and three pairs of low conductivity fibreglass bipod struts supporting the PLM. A basic horizontal telescope configuration is used for the PLM itself, housing all of the spacecraft's scientific instruments and its oval 1.1 × 0.7 metre (3.6 × 2.3 feet) primary mirror. At launch, the spacecraft will have a fuelled mass of ~, and will have a dry mass of ~. The PLM will account for around of that mass. === Telescope === The ARIEL telescope's assembly is an off-axis Cassegrain telescope followed by a third parabolic mirror to recollimate the beam. The telescope uses an oval 1.1 × 0.7 metre (3.6 × 2.3 feet) primary mirror; the system has a diffraction limit of about 3 µm, and a focal ratio (f) of 13.4.ARIEL - Payload. ESA. 20 March 2018.

Front and back boots have leather covers. (Seeley Stable Museum, Old Town San Diego, California) Glen's Falls, Lake George & Chester stagecoach. circa 1880 Concord coaches are horse-drawn coaches, often used as stagecoaches, which employ a style of suspension and construction particularly suited to North America's early 19th century roads. Leather thoroughbraces suspend passengers who are in constant motion while the coach is moving. The swaying is accepted by passengers for the shock absorbing action of the leather straps and for the way the special motion eases the coach over very rough patches of roadway. The coaches were first developed and built by coachbuilder J Stephen Abbot and wheelwright Lewis Downing of Concord, New Hampshire. They were high-end, expensive vehicles; the cost was justified by long service life. The thoroughbrace suspension reduced stresses on the structure and improved passenger comfort. Railroads began replacing stagecoaches in the middle of the 19th century, but Concord coaches remained in commercial use into the 20th century and continue to be used in parades and for publicity purposes by Wells Fargo Bank. ==Dimensions== Concord coaches varied widely in capacity, from small four-person vehicles through the iconic 9 passenger heavy western mail coaches and beyond, so dimensions vary. (Rated sizes were for interior seats; a coach might carry more passengers outside.) A larger coach might weigh and could stand over tall. ==Design featuresConstruction=== 1\\\\. The three longitudinal perches, 2\\\\. the front transom supporting the metal uprights, 3\\\\. the front axle with its link for the pole. 4\\\\. Brake levers on the outside edge either side Timber: white oak, ash and basswood braced with iron bands. Iron fittings. Leather and canvas. ===Undercarriage=== The undercarriage supports the leather thoroughbracesStrong leather straps supporting the body of a coach or other vehicle; also \\"thorough braces\\" carrying the body. The two axles are tied together by a firm undercarriage braced by three straight perches (lengthwise frame members) and given a relatively slim transom (the transverse members at either end of the perches). Each end of each transom holds an upright metal standard from which hang the leather thoroughbraces. ===Brakes=== The back wheels have brake blocks acting on the iron tires. The driver controls them with a foot lever to his right at the side of his footboard. ===Body=== The body needs to make no contribution to the rigidity of the undercarriage and so is more lightly constructed than was the custom for European vehicles. This lightness also eases progress on the very rough roads. There are three bench seats accommodating up to nine people though models to seat six and twelve passengers were available. The benches at the front and back of the body have limited headroom. Passengers on the center bench are given no backrest but steady themselves with a broad leather harness suspended across the coach by straps from the roof. Another six passengers can travel in the open air on the body's roof. There is an external luggage compartment or boot at the back of the body and another boot for valuables below the driver's seat at the front. ===Photo gallery=== A Concord Coach in Hadley Farm Museum, Massachusetts File:Abbott & Downing Concord Coach, view 4 - Hadley Farm Museum - DSC07695.JPG File:Abbott & Downing Concord Coach, view 1 - Hadley Farm Museum - DSC07624.JPG File:Abbott & Downing Concord Coach, view 3 - Hadley Farm Museum - DSC07628.JPG File:Abbott & Downing Concord Coach, view 2 - Hadley Farm Museum - DSC07627.JPG ==Horses== The leading horses are known as the lead horses. The wheel horses or wheelers are the back pair nearest the coach's wheels. The number of horses, usually four or six, could be even more. Two horses alone would very soon tire. ==Operation== Charlestown, NH to Springfield, VT It is not possible to guide a Concord coach with European- style precision. The Concord body continuously shifts. The driver or coachman has to sit slightly askew and brace himself with the aid of a steeply angled footboard. He cannot keep his reins in a steady contact with the horses' mouths. He has to bend his arms and elbows to constantly compensate, and his body always leans slightly forward. He holds his left reins in his left hand and his right reins — separated by his middle finger — in his right hand and not all in one hand like a European could. It is easy to slacken an individual rein but much more difficult to shorten it. His right hand also has to control his whip used on the wheel horses. If obliged to make his right hand free, then he must lay all the right hand reins in his left hand unseparated. The horses were harnessed very loosely by European standards because without proper roads the horses had to be allowed to avoid their particular obstacles. The Concord pole, though mounted to allow far more play, moved less. The result was the coach's direction was straighter than with a European coach, it did not respond to every irregularity in the road.

Hearing that Majid had been transferred to a camp of Dowarabazar Upazila, she went there. ==Liberation war== A war was happening in the Dowarabazar area when Kakon went there to search for her husband. She went to Tengratilla camp. The Pakistani Army captured her in a bunker and she faced inhuman physical and mental torture for many days. She lost hope of finding her husband and joined Muktibahini (the gerrila resistance movement formed by the Bangladesh military, paramilitary and civilians during the War of Liberation). Freedom fighter Rahmat Ali introduced her to sector five commander, Mir Shawkat Ali. Shawkat called Kakon Bibi his sister of religion. With his influence, she started working as a secret agent under a disguise of a beggar. In April 1971, Kakon Bibi was captured by the Razakars while spying in Bangla bazar in the region of Dowarabazar Upazila. They tortured her immensely including burning with a hot iron rod. Sexual torture was also intensified. Later, they took her to the Pakistani camp in Tengratilla. There, she told the Pakistani commander that she is the wife of Pakistani soldier Abdul Majid Khan and she came in search of him. The Pakistani commander believed her. Instead, she was proposed to work for the Pakistanis. She agreed and began to help freedom fighters providing information in a more effective way. This was primarily achieved through receiving an identification card from the Pakistani commander. With that ID card she started going to the Pakistani camp more often and with greater ease and supplied the freedom fighters with important information. Later Kakon took part in nearly 20 battlefronts. In November, she was engaged in a front war in Tengratilla where she was deeply injured. The injury marks were visible on her knee till her death. ==Death== Kakon Bibi was hospitalised in 2017 after a heart attack. She died of pneumonia at Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital on 21 March 2018. At the time of her death, Kakon Bibi's age could not be verified. Reports range from 85 or 90 to an age of 103. ==References== Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:2018 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Mukti Bahini Category:People from Derai Upazila Category:Khasi people Category:Women in war in Bangladesh Category:Women in warfare post-1945 ","title":"Kakon Bibi"},{"id":"56907869","text":"Frank Lorne McKinnon, (June 16, 1934 – May 31, 2015) was a Canadian amateur sports administrator, executive, and coach. He was a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation Congress, chairman of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), and vice-president of the Canadian Olympic Association for one term. McKinnon was named a Member of the Order of Canada in June 2014 in recognition of his extensive volunteer work and contributions to amateur sport in Canada. ==Career== A teacher by trade, McKinnon received his post-secordary education at Brandon University, where he also starred on the school's hockey team. He became the principal of the high school in Carman, Manitoba in 1964 and later helped create the Manitoba High School Athletics Association, the governing body for high school athletics in the province. As the coach of Carman's high school hockey team, he once benched young star goaltender Ed Belfour, who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the National Hockey League. McKinnon served on the board on the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA, now Hockey Manitoba) for 18 years (non-consecutive), five as president, during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As an advocate for youth sports, McKinnon played a significant role in the overhaul of Canadian junior hockey and the creation of a national Junior \\"A\\" championship in 1970. McKinnon was Canada's representative at the IIHF Congress during the mid-1970s and a member of the organizing committee for the first IIHF World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in 1974. McKinnon was elected to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) executive in 1975, as the vice-president of senior international hockey. He then served as first vice-president of the CAHA from 1977 to 1979. When the CAHA created an elected board of governors and restructured the role of president to a full-time, salaried position in 1979, McKinnon and then-president Gord Renwick both declared they would not apply for the paid position. Murray Costello was hired as the president, and McKinnon was elected the first chairman of the board of governors in 1979. He was succeeded by Tubby Schmalz in May 1981, but returned to the chairman's role upon Schmalz's death in December 1981. McKinnon retired again as CAHA chairman in May 1982. After retiring from his education career in 1992, McKinnon took on the role of Commissioner for the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL), a position he held until 2002. ==Awards== Hockey Canada, the Canadian Junior Hockey League, and several national and provincial sport bodies have bestowed McKinnon with their awards and honours, including Hockey Canada's highest award, the Order of Merit. The MJHL has created the Frank McKinnon Memorial Trophy and the Frank McKinnon Scholarship in his honour. McKinnon has also been honoured for his volunteer work in other sports, including an induction into the Manitoba Baseball Hall of Fame. McKinnon was named a member of the Order of Canada by His Excellency, the Right Honourable David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, in 2014 and formally inducted in a ceremony shortly before his death in 2015. ==Death== McKinnon died in Calgary, Alberta on May 31, 2015 at the age of 80. ==References *Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame profile Category:1934 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Brandon University alumni Category:Canadian schoolteachers Category:Canadian Amateur Hockey Association Category:Ice hockey people from Manitoba Category:Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association executives Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:People from Carman, Manitoba ","title":"Frank McKinnon"},{"id":"56907891","text":"Diuris fragrantissima, commonly called the fragrant doubletail or Sunshine diuris, is a species of orchid which is endemic to a small area to the west of Melbourne. It has two linear leaves at its base and up to twelve white flowers with mauve or pale purple markings with unusually long lateral sepals. Only about thirty plants survive in grassland near Sunshine. ==Description== Diuris fragrantissima is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to twelve white flowers with mauve or pale purple markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are narrow lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards at an angle and almost parallel to each other. The petals are erect or turned backwards with an elliptic or egg-shaped blade long and wide on a green stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is fan-shaped or heart-shaped, long, wide with a raised ridge along its midline and wrinkled edges. The side lobes are erect, irregularly shaped, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in October and November. ==Taxonomy and naming== The fragrant doubletail was first formally described in 1964 by Alick Dockrill from an unpublished description by Herman Rupp and given the name Diuris punctata var. albo-violacea. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to D. fragrantissima noting that it differs from D. punctata in \\"having a dwarf habit, the stiff, erect habit of the flowers that are white with purple markings, and its strong fragrance\\". The specific epithet (fragrantissima) is the superlative form of the Latin word fragrans meaning \\"smelling agreeably\\". ==Distribution and habitat== At the time of European settlement, D. fragrantissima was plentiful in the grasslands to the west of Melbourne, but as early as 1934, W.H. Nicholls noted that it had become scarse. The population continued to decline until only one plant survived in the wild in 1992. About thirty wild plants of Diuris fragrantissima survive in grassland near Sunshine and others have been introduced to a small reserve near Altona. The populations at both Sunshine and Altona are under great stress due to the encroachment of industrial and residential development. Ecological processes such as the loss of natural pollinators also threaten this species. About 200 individuals survive in cultivation, mostly at Melbourne Zoo and the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria. ==Conservation== Diuris fragrantissima is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Victorian government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, predation, especially by the introduced house mouse (Mus musculus), altered fire regimes and human interference. ==References== fragrantissima Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris fragrantissima"},{"id":"56907937","text":"MicroRNA 1250 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MIR1250 gene. ==Function== microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

Gopala Rao under the Aswaraja Pictures banner and directed by S. Rajinikanth. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri in the lead roles and music composed by Ghantasala. This is third film of N. T. Rama Rao as Lord Krishna. The film is a box hit and celebrated 100 days, despite releasing only 6 days after Bhatti vikramarka. It was dubbed in 1974 in Kannada as Narakasura Vadhe, ==Plot== The film begins with Narakasura born to Bhoodevi (Savitri) and Lord Vishnu (N. T. Rama Rao) during the time of Varaha Avatar, a wild boar form. Narakasura (S. V. Ranga Rao) conquers the entire world and makes Prakjothishapuram as his capital. He also wants to conquer heaven, so, he does penance for Lord Siva and gets a boon that except for his mother Bhoodevi, no one else can kill him. Narakasura then wins over the entire universe and takes Deva Maata Aditi Devi's (Rushyendramani) earrings and all heavenly ladies to his capital in a procession. Nagadatta (Gummadi) is a citizen at Prakjothishapuram and a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Unfortunately, his son comes into the procession and dies under a chariot. Nagadatta opposes the cruelty of Narakasura and he is arrested. In spite of Nagadatta's daughter, Vasumathi (S. Varalakshmi) requests Narakasura to keep a deaf ear. Distressed, Vasumathi bangs her head to Siva's idol and she is cursed by a Saint to become a snake. When she explains to him about her condition, the Saint tells him she can take revenge on Narakasura in snake form. Nagadatta escapes from jail and reaches Dwaraka along with Vasumathi, where Lord Vishnu has taken birth as Lord Krishna. Narakasura comes to know regarding this, in disguise, he reaches Dwaraka, marries Vasumathi by cheating and takes them back. Narakasura imprisons Nagadatta again. Vasumathi realizes that she is married to Narakasura, but she turns obedient to him. Narakasura's atrocities increase day by day by which both gods and humans are suffering. Narada (Kanta Rao) reaches the earth and requests Krishna to put an end to it and restore peace, but he replies that he can't do so because of his word, which was given to Bhoodevi. Meanwhile, Vasumathi gives birth to Bhagadatta. Vasumati tells her father that she will make his son as a devotee to Lord Krishna. Listening to this, Narakasura becomes angry and arrests Vasumathi too. Krishna appears to Nagadatta in the prison and is caught by soldiers. Krishna then transforms himself into Narada and develops devotion towards Krishna among soldiers. Meanwhile, Satyabhama could not find Krishna in the palace, she accuses Narada that he is trying to separate Krishna from her. Krishna comes there and tells her about Narakasura's misdeeds and orders Narada to observe his actions. Narakasura comes to Dwaraka in Krishna's attire and takes away all the girls from there. The public suspects Krishna and they plead to Satyabhama for their daughters. Krishna tells her that it is the atrocity of Narakasura. Satyabhama says that they have to take revenge over this. At the same time, Nagadatta escapes with Vasumathi. Narakasura catches them and removes Nagadatta's eyes. Narada takes him to Krishna. Every one requests Krishna to see the end of Narakasura. Krishna starts for war. Vasumathi obstructs Narakasura and he runs a chariot over her. Satyabhama accompanies Krishna in war. During the time of war, Krishna pretends as if he has fainted. Then Satyabhama takes the arrow and grounds Narakasura. Then he realizes that Satyabhama is none other than his mother Bhoodevi. Satyabhama requests Krishna to make Narakasura's name permanent then Krishna says that on the day when Narakasura realized his soul, people will celebrate Deepavali by lighting the lamps. ==Cast== *N.

It takes the form of a bar graph, that shows the amount of feed available in a pasture over time, and is therefore shaped as a declining wedge. Rotational grazing systems have developed on temperate pastures consisting of perennial ryegrass and white clover. The pre-grazing pasture mass and the post-grazing residual (1500 kg/DM/ha) are critical decisions the dairy farmer has to make every day. The development of the 'Rising Plate Meter' has enabled the pre-grazing and post- grazing pasture masses to be measured.· Pasture eaten, measured as megajoules of metabolisable energy per hectare (MJME/ha) or as kilograms of dry matter (kg DM/ha), is a key driver of profit for all farm systems i.e. pasture grown x pasture utilisation. == History and development == Tom Phillips (New Zealand Dairy Board consulting officer, Matamata, New Zealand, 1976) developed the original concept of the pasture wedge graph used worldwide by pasture based dairy farmers. The original goal of the NZ Dairy Board consulting officer team (Sir Arthur Ward) was to assist New Zealand dairy farmers improve profitability by improving pasture grazing management and the genetic quality of the herd. In 1950-2000 the NZ dairy industry was based on low-input, pasture-based, spring calving systems. Consulting officers worked primarily with dairy farmers in Discussion Groups. Tom Phillips was a consulting officer from 1976 to 1983 (Waikato/Bay of Plenty area) based in Matamata. The legacy of this on farm collaboration in 1976 is that the concept of the pasture wedge graph is used today by pasture based/grazing dairy farmers throughout the world. It has evolved into an online predictive computerized tool for tactical farm management decision making regarding grazing management. == Development in New Zealand == Much of the basic grazing management in New Zealand was developed from the original work of André Voisin (1957) in Normandy, France on the theory of rotational grazing. Decades of farmlet trials at Ruakura comparing controlled grazing (rotational grazing) vs uncontrolled (set stocking) led by McMeekan created multi-year farm systems experimentation into core fundamentals of grazing management with dairy cows. Temperate permanent pastures were found to respond best to a hard grazing (post grazing residual of 1500kgs DM/ha) and then being spelled before being hard grazed again. The grazing interval depended on the time of year and the speed of the regrowth after grazing. Each grazing impacted on the subsequent quality of the pasture grown The original pasture wedge graph concept attempted to include a number of rotational grazing concepts. e.g. Graze the longer pasture first, don't let the longest pasture exceed 15–25 cm, allocated pasture area so that the dairy cows graze to a residual of 1500kgs DM/ha (2–4 cm) within a single grazing i.e. 12 or 24 hrs. Maintain pasture in a leafy stage of growth so that the quality is high (high energy & protein). In this way both perennial ryegrass and white clover thrive and the cows achieve the maximum pasture intake. Pasture management has a demand (cow intake X pasture area) and a supply (available pasture) component. In 2005 Adrian Van Bysterveldt made a mathematical assessment of the required pasture demand for the pasture wedge graph. This effectively put numbers on the graph and enabled dairy farmers to calculate a demand line (for the grazing herd) and provide measurements of the amount of pasture available to be grazed (supply) on the farm. A simple spreadsheet could now create a graph for the farmer to allow informed decisions to be made, particularly about the grazing interval or rotation length. * By rotational grazing, a “feed wedge” is built up ahead of the stock, and it’s easy to see which paddocks are growing the most feed and can be grazed next. * It’s also easy to see how the pastures are growing, so decisions on the rotation length become easier. Grazing management has moved from allocating a certain amount of pasture area each day to a better understanding of the needs of the pasture plant and the interaction between the animal and the plant. The Rising Plate Meter was designed in New Zealand to measure both height & density of perennial ryegrass and white clover pastures under dairying. == References  External links == * South Island Dairy Event * AgriNet - Irish Herd Management * Missouri University Category:Dairy farming Category:Forages ","title":"Pasture wedge graph"},{"id":"56908028","text":"A Manhattan Knight is a 1920 American silent mystery film directed by George Beranger and starring George Walsh, Virginia Hammond, William H.

It has previously been known as Medical Immune Research, Inc. and ASEA, Inc. ==History== ASEA was founded by Verdis Norton and Tyler Norton. The current management consists of Charles F. Funke as the CEO and Jarom Webb as the President.https://aseaglobal.com/company/leadership/ The company officially launched in 2009. Currently, it has approximately 30,000 active associates. In 2013, ASEA, LLC moved its operations to a 33,000 square foot production facility which produces 15,000 cases of ASEA a week. ==Product== ASEA’s first product was a liquid supplement initially also named ASEA, and currently known as ASEA Redox Supplement. In 2014, RENU 28, a skin revitalization gel product, was added to its product lineup. Medical doctor Harriett Hall has written about the effectiveness of the dietary supplement ASEA several times on the Science-Based Medicine website and notes that \\"... there are testimonials galore; but there is no acceptable published evidence to confirm that it has any health benefits in humans.\\" While the primary ingredients created in the original MDI-P solution are found in the current ASEA Redox Supplement and RENU 28 products, the processes and outputs differ. All prior patents from the previous company have expired. New patents that cover the proprietary composition and production processes used to produce ASEA and RENU 28 have been filed and issued. In 2015, ASEA partnered with BioAgilytix Labs to work in unison with their internal product teams to monitor the quality of the manufacturing process and give the scientific validity of the nature of the products. Specializing in biomarker testing, BioAfilytix validates the existence of reactive oxygen in the product. To maintain the BioAgilytix certification, ASEA provides a weekly product sampling for a scientific assay to substantiate the existence of reactive oxygen molecules in ASEA redox products and for product quality. In 2016, ASEA announced the launch of a new skincare line, RENU Advanced, consisting of four products against anti-aging. ===History=== ASEA is based on technology developed and patented by Medical Discoveries, Inc, a publicly traded company (MLSC). MDI-P was a clear, colorless liquid generated by electrolysis of a sterile saline. It contained highly reactive chlorine and oxygen species, including HOCl, OCl−, Cl−, Cl2, and O3. It was tested for its microbicidal properties and was found effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, and Candida albicans and is considered to be a very fast-acting, broad- spectrum microbicidal solution. While the primary ingredients created in the original MDI-P solution are found in the current ASEA Redox Supplement and RENU 28 products, the processes and outputs differ. All prior patents from the previous company have expired. New patents that cover the proprietary composition and production processes used to produce ASEA and RENU 28 have been filed and issued. MDI went up for sale in 2007, and Verdis Norton, who sat on the board at the time, decided to gather other investors and purchase the technology. They made the decision to create a consumable product in a liquid form that could be classified as a supplement. Norton and his partners funded research to differentiate the new product from its pharmaceutical-grade predecessor into something consumable, believing that recreating redox signaling molecules outside the human body and producing them in a consumable product would optimize cellular function and overall health and wellness. Under the company name of ASEA, they began selling the product in 2009 with an official launch in 2010. Currently, ASEA has approximately 30,000 active associates. In 2013, ASEA, LLC moved its manufacturing operations to a 33,000 square-foot production facility, which is FDA registered, NSF certified, and GMP compliant and produces 15,000 cases of ASEA Redox Supplement per week. In May 2016, ASEA launched a new skincare line, RENU Advanced. With four products bundled as a skincare system, RENU Advanced is formulated for anti-aging and is based on ASEA's flagship technology of redox signaling. ===Assessing effectiveness=== A double blinded and placebo controlled study of 20 participants was performed to assess the effectiveness of cyclists completing time trials (TT). The abstract found that \\"ASEA did not improve TT performance\\". ASEA has funded a study completed by Tauret Labs in which it completed a double blinded and placebo controlled study on 60 participants. It found that \\"Additional analysis did identify at least 5 genes that may have interesting differential expression in the test group and were not significant in placebo or control groups\\". However due to the small sample size and short length of the study it was noted \\"Confirmation of these findings may be further substantiated by a longer study time with larger cohorts of participants.\\"Gene Expression Profile Changes Resulting from Ingestion of ASEA Redox Dietary. Dr. Kenneth Ward. Retrieved 2019-02-20. Physician Harriet Hall has reviewed the scientific literature related to the assessment of ASEA as a dietary supplement, noting that there is no acceptable published evidence to confirm that it has any health benefits in humans. The conclusions of Harriet Hall were supported by Science Based Medicine. Similar conclusions were drawn by \\"Does It Really Work\\". == Legal issues == In its press release on 10 March 2014, the Italian Competition Authority sanctioned 3 companies \\"for unfair business practices\\". One of them was ASEA Italy which was fined €150,000. According to the Antitrust case, \\"consumers are proposed to purchase products through mechanisms aimed in reality at recruiting other sellers who are asked for an initial contribution or a subscription to a programme of personal purchases ... It is a distributive mechanism considered incorrect by the Consumer Code for which the consumer cannot make a contribution in exchange for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products.\\" It alleged that the position of Asea Italy is further aggravated by the fact that the company has attributed to their products curative properties that are not adequately substantiated and certified. This product has been found to be nothing more than a placebo. ==References *Official website Category:Companies based in Salt Lake City Category:Multi-level marketing companies based in Utah Category:Companies based in Salt Lake County, Utah Category:Privately held companies based in Utah Category:Multi-level marketing products Category:Direct sales companies Category:Direct marketing Category:Companies based in Utah County, Utah Category:Marketing companies established in 2007 Category:Nutritional supplement companies of the United States ","title":"ASEA (American company)"},{"id":"56908262","text":"The Taft–Norco Ferry was a pedestrian ferry across the Mississippi River in the U.S. state of Louisiana, connecting Taft and Norco.

During the time of marriage, Ratnaprabha is surprised to see Amarasimha tying the knot and her happiness is boundless. Actually, Sarpakaketu is a womanizer and want to possess Ratnaprabha at any cost. So, he plots send his girlfriend Manjula (Sandhya) as a maid to trap Ratnaprabha.

He too notices Ratnaprabha coming from the secret path when he suspects her and Ratnaprabha is not able to reveal the truth because it may be dangerous to her father's life. Angered Amarasimha arrests Dharmapala, gives a blank royal assent to Sarpakaketu and asks him to punish Ratnaprabha appropriately. Sarpaketu takes advantage of the situation, by keeping some conditions on it, asks Manjula to handover it to Ratnaprabha with a poison bottle. Ratnaprabha starts reading the conditions, to prove her chastity Ratnaprabha must die taking the poison, get back her life and marry Amarasimha 3 times without revealing her identity.

Amarasimha has given hospitality in there hamlet when Ratnaprabha acts as Ranadheer's dumb daughter and marries Amarasimha without his knowledge. Here Amarasimha is not ready to accept the match, so, he is arrested. Parallelly, Sarpakethu learns that Amarasimha has sensed his reality, so, he shacks hand with Dharmapala, occupies the kingdom and makes Ratnabhupala as the ruler. In the forest, Ratnaprabha again changes her attire as a black girl and servers Amarasimha. He asks her to help him in escaping when she keeps a condition to marry her and he does so. After reaching the capital he gets captured and Ratnaprabha reveals the entire truth to her father and Dharmapala. Amarasimha is presented in the court, the king gives death sentence to him and keeps a condition that he can be relieved if he ready to marry his daughter. As there is no other choice he marries Ratnaprabha in the mask. After the marriage, Ratnaprabha brings out all the facts, proves her chastity.

It was featured on his 1956 album, Rock and Rollin' with Fats Domino. In 1991, two new versions of the song performed by Fats Domino were released: the so-called \\"complete\\" (length 2:45), on sound track of the film A Rage in Harlem, and \\"alternative\\" (1:50), on 4 CD box \\"They Call Me The Fat Man...\\". However, a comparison of the three versions in the sound editor irrefutably shows that two more long versions are composite edits of the same (and unique) original recording, the shortest of the three (1:50), which was considered as alternative by Fats Domino fans. The first minute of this original recording (after a two-second intro) was repeated twice to produce a composite master for the single and album (2:02). The long so-called \\"complete\\" version turned out to be a triple repetition of the same first minute with a fade-out at the end. It is therefore not surprising that the latest edition of Fats Domino Imperial recordings I've Been Around (2019) includes, in addition to the composite master, only the original recording, and no trace of the \\"complete\\" version included in the previous box set Out of New Orleans (1993) released by the same label. ==Other versions== *Teresa Brewer released a competing version in January 1956 as well, and her version reached #17 the U.S. pop chart in March 1956. It was the B-side for her single, \\"A Tear Fell\\", which reached #2 in the UK and #5 in the U.S. *Bonnie Lou released a version of the song as a single in 1956, but it did not chart. *The Dixiebelles released a version of the song on their 1963 EP Down at Papa Joe's. ==References== Category:1955 songs Category:1956 singles Category:Songs written by Dave Bartholomew Category:Songs written by Fats Domino Category:Fats Domino songs Category:Teresa Brewer songs Category:Coral Records singles Category:Imperial Records singles Category:King Records (United States) singles ","title":"Bo Weevil"},{"id":"56908588","text":"Lloyd Samartino (born February 2, 1960) is a Filipino actor. ==Personal life== Samartino's mother is Carmen Soriano, an actress and singer.

It closed in 1963. ==History== Rail activity began in Porthcawl in 1825, when the Duffryn Llynfi & Porthcawl Railway (actually a tramway) began construction, opening in 1828. Built to a gauge of four feet and seven inches and using rails based on stone sleepers, it was intended for it to serve a projected new port for the transfer of minerals from South Wales. It ran from Duffryn Llynfi near Maesteg via Tondu and Pyle. It was extended to Bridgend in 1834. The South Wales Railway, which passed through both Bridgend and Pyle, opened in 1850. The Llynfi Valley Railway took over the original company in 1847, and upgraded both the former tramway branches, reopening them as broad gauge railways on 10 August 1861. The Llynfi Valley Railway merged with the Ogmore Valley Railway in 1866, creating the Llynfi & Ogmore Railway. Despite the conversion to a railway, trains on the Porthcawl branch continued to be drawn by horses until 1868, when the system was altered again, this time to standard gauge. The new Llynfi & Ogmore Railway was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1873. By the early 20th Century, Porthcawl grew in importance as a destination for holiday traffic, and in 1916, the GWR rebuilt the station. Despite the fact that it had been built a mile nearer to the seafront, the new station was not universally popular; the building was a rather insubstantial structure built of wood and asbestos, and whilst the original station had possessed a footbridge, the GWR did not supply one for the new station, despite the rise from two to three platforms. Passengers using the remoter platforms were obliged to make a long detour via a link at the end of the platforms. A special gate was provided at the end of the departure platform for the use of day-trippers. The original station's turntable was not replaced, but remained derelict on-site for many years. In the decades following the opening of the new station, passenger numbers remained high, with around 70,000 passengers using the station. The closure came in 1963 despite the fact that the branch was still well-used, and the move was very unpopular with local businesses and residents alike. Poor ticket sales from Porthcawl station itself were used to justify the closure, but the fact that most travelers bought their tickets to, rather than from Porthcawl (the ticket sale therefore recorded elsewhere) was ignored. The trackbed is occupied by a road. The station building is used by the Porthcawl branch of the Sea Cadets. ==Notes== Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1861 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1963 Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Disused railway stations in Bridgend County Borough Category:1963 disestablishments in Wales ","title":"Porthcawl railway station"},{"id":"56908843","text":"Syzygium elegans is a shrub belonging to the Myrtaceae family.

She was the Women's Professional Billiards Champion from 1931 to 1933, and from 1935 to 1938. ==Early Life== Joyce Winifred Frances Gardner was born on 24 August 1910 in Gloucester. While living in Gloucester Joyce's parents ran the Glevum Billiard hall. But Joyce didn't take up billiards until the family moved to London where her father ran a billiards saloon in Holborn. Initially she took up millinery and dressmaking, but she discovered that she had a skill for potting balls whilst helping her father clear up the billiard tables. ==Career== Margaret Lennan beat Joyce Gardner 1000-960 at Hull in September 1928 in a match billed as the British Championship. Billiard manufacturers Howard and Powell provided a silver rose bowl for the winner. This match is omitted from records in the handbooks of the Billiards and Snooker Control Council. In 1930, she started working for cue sports company Burroughes and Watts, and received coaching from JP Mannock, Willie Smith and Sidney Smith. Burroughes and Watts organised the British Women's Billiards Championship in 1930, a competition also known as the Burwat Billiards Cup. The following year, 1931, the Women's Billiards Association was formed: Gardner was one of the four professional players appointed to a committee to organise the professional championships, the others were Margaret Lennan, Eva Collins and Ruth Harrison. It was agreed that the Association would take over the running of the competition as a world championship, with the same trophy as used in 1930. Her of 96 in the 1930 final was the first break by a woman to receive a certificate of recognition from the Billiards Association and Control Council. and she made the first break in the competition, a 100 in 1934. Gardner was also runner-up six times, so appeared in a total of 13 finals in the 14 times the event was staged. The only year that she was not in the final was 1940, when she was beaten by Thelma Carpenter in the semi-final. Gardner's highest break at billiards was 318, and at snooker it was 82. == Later Life == Joyce married Arthur Williams on 9 October 1937 at St. Marylebone Parish Church in London. She made two film appearances: It Happened in Leicester Square in 1949; and Jumping for Joy in 1956 where she played a billiards player. It was reported that Joyce tutored the latter film's star Frankie Howerd who in the film \\"has a number of hair-raising interludes in a London billiards saloon\\". She continued playing until her late sixties and became the only woman member of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Joyce Gardner died on 29 August 1981 in Pinner, London. ==Titles and achievements== Snooker {  ! Outcome !! No. !! Year !! Championship !! Opponent !! Score !!

There are recent records from Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Kerala, South India.See photographs in c:Category:Platylestes platystylus ==Description and habitat== It is a small dull colored damselfly of the size of Lestes. Its prothorax and thorax are in palest khaki brown color, paler at the sides and pruinosed white beneath. There are a large number of black spots on the thorax. Its wings are palely enfumed with short and broad pterostigma having white or pale inner and outer ends. Its abdomen is in olivaceous to warm reddish brown in color with black apical rings on each segments. Anal appendages are whitish with the superiors black at base, curling in at apices to meet each other. Inferior appendages are about half the length and thick at base.Jules Pierre Rambur (1842) Histoire naturelle des insectes. Névroptères. Paris.

The first iteration of Exercise Kangaroo took place in 1974.

It is considered part of the textovka genre – the Czechoslovak text adventure industry. == Development == The game was developed by Golden Triangle, a development trio made up of Frantisek Fuka (Fuxoft), Miroslav Fídler (Cybexlab) and Tomáš Rylek (TRC), who would later go on to make Jet-Story and Tetris 2. The music was composed by František Fuka. The three met at Prague's Arabská Gymnázium, and before they had access to computers they programmed on squared paper and learned the basics on a scientific calculator; their first computers were ZX Spectrums, which is what essentially all of their games were made for. When they did begin to create games they started on their own, but they eventually started assisting with each other's creations. When Rylek finished the last levels in Fuk's Tetris 2, according to Fuka \\"That's when we all put the 'Golden Triangle' logo in all our games (no matter who made us the game), with the name of the product always above the top corner of the triangle\\". All three members of the Golden Triangle participated in this title, although the main driving force behind Belegost was Miroslav Fídler. In order to make the game more user-friendly than older titles such as Vampire or Exoter, Fidler designed an icon command menu, a context-sensitive help text, and a listing of on-screen motion options. The script and program were written by Marek Fídler, while the music was composed by František Fuka. The player was able to turn the music on and off again during the game.https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/43165/DPTX_2010_2__0_322733_0_97731.pdf?sequence=1 The help clues could be accessed via the menu, and contained simple nursery rhymes in a fantasy theme. To orient the players in the game map environment, the game include contextual directions such as 'to the mountain' or 'along the stream', rather than using the cardinal directions. Unusual for text adventures at the time, the game has a sense of delayed action for certain game events, for instance when the player burns moss, the game indicates that the moss is burning and regardless of if the player completes an action, will later note than the moss flame has extinguished - if the player was not ready to complete their required action they would be unable to successfully complete the game. Belegost is one of the many text adventures of the time inspired by the works of Tolkien, including the 1979 Norwegian adventure Ringen, a series that began with The Hobbit, and parodies such as The Boggit and Bored of the Rings. Specifically, the game draws inspiration from Tolkien's book The Silmarillion which was not yet available in Cheaslovakia at the time of the game's release. Historie a kontext produkce počítačových her žánru adventure v České republice notes that Tolkien's works were a popular subject for video games in the 1980s, and that Belegost fits into that trend alongside Melbourne House's The Hobbit (1982), and Addison Wesley Publishing Company's trio of games The Fellowship of the Ring (1986), The Shadows of Mordor (1987), and The Crack Of Doom (1989). The game experienced success on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and compatible computers, which led to conversions to other platforms including Atari ST, MS-DOS, Psion pocket computers, NeXTStep and Mac OS X. It was later ported to the Apple iPhone, both in the original Czech language as well as in English translation. English versions were later made for the NeXTSTEP and Psion, while in 2010 a remixed version was created by Lacrima for iOS devices in both Czech and English, featuring the original music. The game is in the public domain. The game has been added to the SNDH archive. ==Plot== The game is a manifestation of the motifs of JRR Tolkien's novels; the title comes from one of the underground dwarf towns in Lord of the Rings, which is also where the game is set. Within the narrative, the town has been plundered by the Orcs, while the Alqualamir stone remained in the city. The task of the player is to find the stone and escape the city. ==Reception== Freegames.cz commented that the \\"hilarous\\" Czech game had a simple yet visually pleasing atmosphere. In 2002, FreeHry.cz said that while the game was over a decade old it was still quite good-quality. Historie a kontext produkce počítačových her žánru adventure v České republice praised the title's original features, and its \\"well-elaborated story\\".https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1 The paper Indiana Jones Fights the Communist Police notes that Belegost was an example of the Czechoslovak text adventure industry drawing inspiration from fantasy.http://ironcurtain.svelch.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/4/2018/11/Svelch-IndianaJonesGamingGlobally.pdf Database-her.cz noted that by filtering out the Czech games in their database and sorting them by year of release, the oldest Czech game is Belegost, thoguh added that this is only true of DOS games. Root.cz notes that Belegost is one Czech game along with Indiana Jones 2 that didn't \\"blindly\\" copy the control system for Colossal Cave Adventure, in that the two ttiles, both the brainchilds of Fuka, use icons and drop-down menus. Its reputation led to it being the \\" one of the first games we reviewed within the Free Games server\\".

It is a musical melodrama and fictionalized biography of Alla Pugacheva, where the heroine is represented by Anna Streltsova. The All-Union premiere of the film took place on March 2, 1979. According to the results of the Soviet film distribution in 1979, the film won first place, having collected 55 million spectators, and the performer of the leading role Alla Pugacheva according to the poll of the magazine Soviet Screen was named \\"The Best Actress of the Year\\". At the same time the film itself took only 53 place in the vote for the best film of the year. \\"The Woman who Sings\\" occupies the 27th place in attendance in the history of Soviet box-office. ==Plot== The film is about pop singer Anna Streltsova, who is deliberating whether or not to give up her stage career, since she still does not have that song which would help her achieve her full potential. At the same time, the heroine's personal life is developing unsuccessfully. Conflicts with her husband and the eventual divorce unsettle the woman. But even in a stressful condition, she does not want to give up her favorite work, continuing to sing and make her way to fame. When Anna reads a poem titled \\"The Woman I Love\\", she feels that it would make a good song. Later she meets the poem's author, Andrei, who advises her to change the lyrics to \\"The Woman who Sings\\". Even before this Anna's career begins establishing and she starts to sing in many performances. Her songs have already been accomplishments, but still nothing like \\"The Woman who Sings\\" which she performs at the end of the film. Anna finally achieves incredible popularity and is now the No. 1 star of the Soviet stage. She tours in major cities, performs in large halls and has great success with the audience. ==Cast== *Alla Pugacheva - Anna Streltsova *Alla Budnitskaya - Masha, Anna's girlfriend *Nikolay Volkov - Andrei, the poet *Alexander Khochinsky - Valentin, Anna's husband *Vadim Aleksandrov - Ivan Stepanovich Klimkin (Stepanych), administrator *Leonid Garin - Leon, head of the ensemble *Vladimir Shubarin - dancer *Yuri Belov - passenger in an airplane *Ilya Rutberg - Mikhail, Head of the Dance and Instrumental Ensemble ==MusicSoundtrack=== Originally Aleksandr Zatsepin was to score the soundtrack. However, during the filming there was a conflict between Zatsepin and Pugacheva due to the fact that she, without warning him in advance, inserted her songs (under the pseudonym Boris Gorbonos) without his knowledge. Because of this, Zatsepin refused to be the composer, but agreed to leave his songs in the film. As a result, all background music was written by Alla Pugacheva. Background music in the picture consists of two compositions, which later became songs in Pugacheva's repertoire. The episode with the child, as well as the conversation with Andrei and a rehearsal before the contest, is accompanied by a melody that later became the song \\"I Will Not Give You to Anyone\\" (Alla Pugacheva's music, Larisa Kulikova's lyrics, appeared in the repertoire of the singer in 1987). In the scene of the last conversation, Streltsova and her husband behind the scenes sounded vocalizing this melody. At the last minute of the film the montage of Streltsova walking on the observation deck on the Lenin Hills, along the Victory Park in Tolyatti, a concert at the Volgar Sports Palace in Tolyatti is accompanied by a melody that later became the song \\"Applying all Force\\" (Alla Pugacheva's music, the words of Yevgeny Yevtushenko, appeared in the repertoire of the singer in 1978). Also in the film was to sound the song \\"In the Grove of the Guelder- rose\\" to the music of Alla Pugacheva and verses of Yunna Morits, however the poet forbade the song to be used for her poems in the film. Subsequently, Pugacheva put other lyrics — a poem by Oleg Milyavsky, on original music of this song and so in Pugachev's repertoire appeared the song \\"Dad Bought a Car\\". Additionally, in the episode of the concert at the Railwaymen's Club, before the song \\"Come\\" sounded the first few measures of the song \\"What was Once\\", which was recorded by Pugacheva for the movie 31 June but did not make it into the film. The text of the song \\"The Woman Who Sings\\" was originally written by the poet Qaysin Quli in Karachay-Balkar language, translated into Russian by Naum Grebnev and was called \\"The Woman I Love\\". Pugacheva removed two verses, changed the viewpoint from the third to the first person and amended the last line in the verses. The song \\"If Long Suffering\\" was recorded for the movie The Cook and the Singer (1978) and sounded there in full. According to the original idea, this song should not have been in the \\"Woman Who Sings\\". ===Songs=Reception== During the time of its release, the film had a mixed critical reception. ==References Category:Soviet films Category:Soviet musical drama films Category:1970s musical drama films Category:1970s romantic drama films Category:Soviet romantic drama films Category:Films directed by Aleksandr Orlov ","title":"The Woman who Sings"},{"id":"56909165","text":"Egon Paljar (born 15 April 1974) is a former Croatian national team handball player.

After matriculating from high school, she attended the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskole for Kvinder (Drawing and Handicrafts School for Women) before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Sigurd Wandel (1921–24). In 1925 in Paris, she married the sculptor Henrik Starcke (1899–1973). Although she graduated from the Danish Academy as a painter, Starcke was above all proficient as a textile artist, creating pictorial collages and woven pieces, both large and small. She used fabrics or \\"rags\\" of various kinds to provide shape and colour to her work, creating simple but refined artistic compositions. Her subjects were frequently inspired by the tales of Hans Christian Andersen or by stories from the Bible. Many of her works were used to decorate public institutions or social housing. Starcke also worked with other materials and techniques, for example by creating mosaics of sintered brick.

Such stimuli-responsive MOFs are generally referred to as a flexible metal- organic frameworks. They can also be called dynamic metal-organic framework, stimuli-responsive MOFs, multi-functional MOFs, or soft porous crystals.Demonstration of the flexibility of the MIL-53 metal-organic framework. Adapted from Hou et al. Formally, a metal-organic framework is a coordination network with organic ligands containing potential voids. A coordination network is a coordination compound extending, through repeating coordination entities, in one dimension, but with cross-links between two or more individual chains, loops, or spiro-links, or a coordination compound extending through repeating coordination entities in two or three dimensions. A coordination polymer is a coordination compound with repeating coordination entities extending in one, two, or three dimensions. Generally, this kind of material has a well-defined structure, but sometimes some external stimuli can affect its structure, resulting in a different structure without breaking the overall network. A variety of external stimuli like heat, light, solvent, an electric field, magnetic field, etc. can act upon a metal-organic framework, can act to change its internal structure, and can facilitate the transformation process. This structural transformation generally occurs by bond breaking/making, change of coordination number of the metal ion, change of coordination mode of ligand, ligand length squeezing, solvent exchange, solvent removal, etc. One often discussed example of flexible metal-organic framework is the family of MIL-53 materials, featuring one-dimensional diamond-shaped pores that can expand or contract upon stimulation, such as adsorption of guest molecules (solvent, water, gases, etc.), changes in temperature, and mechanical pressure. ==References See also == *Coordination chemistry *Coordination polymers *Metal–inorganic framework *Organometallic chemistry *Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks *Solid sorbents for carbon capture ","title":"Flexible metal-organic framework"},{"id":"56909295","text":"Jim Laugesen (born 10 November 1974) is a former Danish badminton player.

They are also referred to as acyl isethionates or acyloxyethanesulfonates. Like the taurides, isethionates are a class of particularly mild anionic surfactants which, unlike ordinary soaps, retain their washing-active properties even in hard water. Isethionates are obtained on an industrial scale reacting mixtures of carboxylic acids with salts of isethionic acid under acidic catalysis e. g. with methanesulfonic acid. The mixtures of carboxylic acids are obtained from the hydrolysis of animal fats (tallow) or vegetable oils, preferably coconut oil, but also palm oil, soybean oil or castor oil.M. Friedman, Chapter 5: Chemistry, Formulation, and Performance of Syndet and Combo Bars. In, Spitz, L. (ed), SODEOPEC Soaps, Detergents, Oleochemicals, and Personal Care Products, AOCS Press, Champaign, IL, 2004 und :::::SCI-Synthese Isethionates are solids which are often mixed with fatty acids (up to 30% by weight) to lower their freezing point. Despite its low water solubility (100ppm at 25 °C), the lower-priced sodium cocoylisethionate has found more widespread use than its well water-soluble ammonium salt (> 25 wt.% at 25 °C). To solubilize the sparsely soluble isethionates and taurides, the formation of mixtures with amphoteric surfactants (such as cocamidopropyl betaine) are proposed. From such mixtures, it is possible to prepare liquid, clear and transparent aqueous concentrates which are liquid at room temperature. Isethionates are characterized by excellent skin compatibility, excellent foaming (even in hard water), good cleansing properties and a pleasant skin feel. They are non-toxic and readily biodegradable. However, in contrast to the taurides, they are not long-term stable outside a pH range of 5 to 8. Isethionates are used in solid soaps (so- called syndet bars) and in other personal care products such as lotions, washing and shower gels, shampoos, liquid soaps, shaving creams, and other cosmetic and dermatological preparations. ==List== { !name !formula !n !Mol Wt !CASNo !EC Number !UNII !PubChem CID !SMILES - Sodium butyl isethionate C6H11NaO5S0218.19961789-32-0263-052-5 CCCC(=O)OCCS(=O)(=O)[O-].[Na+] - Sodium capryloyl isethionateC10H19NaO5S2 274.30738207-61-3 AR33Z8R7V7CCCCCCCC(=O)OCCS(=O)(=O)[O-].[Na+] - Sodium caproyl isethionateC12H23NaO5S3302.36129454-06-6249-638-37K2K7966INCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCS(=O)(=O)[O-].[Na+] - Sodium lauroyl isethionate  C14H27NaO5S  4  330.415  7381-01-3  230-949-8  M590021Z02 CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCS(=O)(=O)[O-].[Na+]  - Sodium palmitoyl isethionateC18H35NaO5S6 386.52336915-65-8253-273-5O4087ZSO8UCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCS(=O)(=O)[O-].[Na+] - } == References  Literature == Wilfried Umbach (Hrsg.), Kosmetik und Hygiene von Kopf bis Fuß, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

During the Cold War, it was briefly reactivated as the 267th Armored Field Artillery Battalion (267th AFAB). == World War II  Formation and training === On 25 January 1943, the 267th Field Artillery Battalion was constituted in the Army of the United States; it was activated on 1 March at Camp Shelby. The 267th FAB, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Hinsch, was a truck drawn 105 mm howitzer, nondivisional unit assigned to the Third Army. Attached to the 403rd Field Artillery Group of XIX Corps, it was officered by reservists and recent graduates of the Field Artillery Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, and manned by Georgia National Guardsmen transferred from the 179th Field Artillery Group and Selective Service draftees from the Field Artillery Replacement Training Centers at Fort Bragg and Fort Sill. The battalion spent the most of the year training at Camp Shelby. On 26 December it was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and assigned to the 402nd Field Artillery Group of XII Corps, part of the Second Army. At Fort Bragg, the 267th converted to the 240 mm howitzer M1, the largest field artillery piece excluding railway guns fielded by the United States Army during the war. It was one of fifteen 240mm howitzer battalions fielded by the United States during the war. Between 23 April and 5 May 1944, the 267th FAB staged for deployment at Fort Slocum, Fort Dix, and Camp Kilmer. At Fort Dix the 267th resumed intensive training, then awaited transportation at Camp Kilmer until 22 July. === Overseas service and demobilization === The battalion crossed the Atlantic aboard the RMS Queen Mary, arriving in England on 28 July. While awaiting movement to France, the 267th stayed in temporary quarters at Bude. The battalion crossed the English Channel from Weymouth aboard LSTs and LCTs on 1 September and had landed at Utah Beach in its entirety by 4 September, with the elements aboard the LCTs having been delayed by a storm. Between 5 September and 17 December, the battalion provided artillery support for the Third Army during its advance to the Rhine across Northern France. From 17 December to the end of the war, it was relieved from XII Corps and placed on special duty with the Third Army Provost Marshal, guarding bridges and handling prisoners of war in the army area. On 19 May the 267th moved forward to Auerbach, where it guarded a prisoner of war camp for captured German troops. The battalion was ordered transferred to the South West Pacific to participated in the invasion of Japan by an order of 1 August, but the order was cancelled due to the surrender of Japan. The 267th returned to the United States on 11 February 1946 and was inactivated the following day at Camp Kilmer. For its service in Europe, the battalion was authorized four campaign streamers including: Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe. In the European Theater of Operation the Battalion had two men wounded and none killed. Three officers received the Air Medal. Four officers and 48 enlisted men received Bronze Star Medals, and two enlisted men received Purple Heart Medals. == Cold War == On 31 January 1949, the 267th was redesignated as the 971st Field Artillery Battalion and allotted to the Organized Reserve Corps. It was activated at Newark, New Jersey on 7 March 1949, inactivating there on 12 July 1950. The battalion was again redesignated as the 267th FAB on 14 March 1952. On 14 January 1955, it was redesignated as the 267th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and transferred to the Regular Army. On 7 March 1955, the 267th AFAB was reactivated at Fort Sill, equipped with M114 155 mm howitzer. It deployed to Babenhausen Germany on 1 April 1956, replacing the 597th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and was inactivated on 1 December 1957 in Germany. It departed Fort Sill on 3/27/1956 to replaced the at Hanau Germany on 4/1/1956 after sailing from NY City to Bremehaven Germany. This was part of Operation Gyroscope. It was stationed in Babenhausen and attached to the 36th Field Artillery Group. The Battalion was inactivated in Germany on 12/1/1957 when it was replaced by the 288th Armored Field Artillery Battalion.267th Field Artillery Battalion http://267thfieldartillerybattalion.simplesite.com. == References == Category:Field artillery battalions of the United States Army Category:Battalions of the United States Army in World War II Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 ","title":"267th Field Artillery Battalion"},{"id":"56909477","text":"La Parade Monstrueuse is In Strict Confidence's seventh studio album. ==Track listingEPs== * My Despair * Silver Bullets * Set Me Free ==References== Category:2010 albums Category:In Strict Confidence albums ","title":"La Parade Monstrueuse"},{"id":"56909502","text":"Nartiang (Vidhan Sabha constituency) is one of the 60 assembly constituencies of Meghalaya, a north east state of India.

It was started for Ghiyath al -Din Khalji (r. 1469-1500), the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India. After he was forced to abdicate, it was completed for his son 'Abd al-Muzaffar Nasir Shah. (r. 1500-10). Some of the illustrations have women painted wearing men's various types of Persian and Indian garments and turbans, including a specific style of turban which is also featured in Turkman style paintings of 1470s. The style of the surrounding landscape are influenced by the Turkmen style of the last third of the 15th century. The Manuscript is in the British Library, London. It was first written about by Robert Skelton in 1959. At least two artists collaborated in illustrating the Ni'mat nāmā. These artists emphasized different features of Turkmen style of Shirazi painting that was contemporary at that time. The illustrations also introduced representations of indigenous costumes of Malwa and Indian facial types. Such stylistic innovations are also seen in paintings from the Cāurāpāncāsika (Chaurapanschasika) series. This suggests that reciprocal influences were at work between centers of painting of Muslim and Hindu patronage.

She was the third oldest out of six children, and the oldest daughter. Her older brother Tony Bellamy, was the lead guitarist for the Native American Rock Band, RedBone. Her other siblings include the Latin Percussionist, Renaldo \\"Reno\\" Bellamy. She was raised in Orange County, California, where she studied opera singing and Flamenco dancing with her siblings. She graduated from Tustin High School in 1970. She was of Swedish, Spanish and Mexican descent, and spoke English, Spanish, and Portuguese, fluently.https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/sep/24/columnist-jerry-fink- whenever-she-sings-bellamy-is/ == Career == After a USO tour with Bob Hope in 1971, Bellamy entered the Air Force, and sang with the Airmen of Note, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant. Having competed her military service, she moved to Nevada, and worked in various lounges and showrooms, until becoming the Lead Singer and Dancer in The Folies Bergere, at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino from 1978 to 1984. Between The Folies Bergere and a European and American tour as a backup singer for Engelbert Humperdinck in the late 80s, Bellamy performed across the country, from Las Vegas to Atlantic City in various shows, including the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1984. Bellamy briefly returned to the Folies in 1987, before leaving in 1990 to tour again with Humperdinck. In 1994, Bellamy recorded a live concert with Humperdinck, performing the song When I Fall In Love, as a duet; as well as a solo performance of an updated version of Malaguena. In the early 2000s, she was a single-billed performer at the top of the Stratosphere, in Las Vegas, Nevada. == Controversy == In January 2007, Michaelina Bellamy was assaulted by a priest, who she claimed had become obsessed with her. She was working as an Events Coordinator for Our Lady of Las Vegas Catholic Church, in Las Vegas, NV, and worked under Rev. George Chaanine. On January 26, 2007, around 5pm, George Chaanine crept up behind Bellamy, and smashed her in the head with a large wine bottle. When she was not subdued, he struggled and beat her, breaking her hand, and choking her until \\"she felt she was dying.\\" She told police that she was losing consciousness and started to pray. Bellamy testified in court that the priest assaulted her sexually, but later agreed to drop those charges in order to avoid a lengthy trial. Chaanine ran from the scene and fled to California and Arizona, while a nationwide manhunt was conducted for 5 days. The case appeared on America's Most Wanted, and Chaanine was apprehended 30 miles outside of Phoenix, in Apache Junction, AZ on January 31, 2007. Chaanine was held on a $1 Million bond, pending arraignment in March 2007. Bellamy was treated at University Medical Center in Las Vegas for a large head gash, that reportedly needed 20 staples along her skull. She suffered a broken left hand and multiple bruises and contusions. Both Bellamy and her youngest daughter testified that Chaanine was obsessed with Bellamy, stating, \\"..the more I stayed away, the more he pushed...\\" Chaanine took a plea deal to agree to plead guilty to Felony Battery with a Deadly Weapon, which carried a maximum amount of 15 years in prison. Chaanine went to prison from 2007 until 2013, after being released on parole. == Personal Life == Michaelina Bellamy married jazz conductor Johnny Veith in the mid-70s, and they had three daughters. When not on tour with larger acts, they played together in smaller lounges and supper clubs across the country, and along the California coastline.

The game was sold at a price of 500.176 Crowns. The game was one of the first successful Czech adventure games; its design is similar to The Legend of Kyrandia. It is also among the shortest commercially released Czech adventure games. ==Plot and gameplay== The game is a fairy-tale adventure similar to The Legend of Kyrandia. The player controls a simple shepherd named Robinto, who is tasked with defeating the evil Swigrid and returning the magic horn of Kerke to his home in Manahon county. The game is divided into three parts; in order to progress to the next part the player has to complete a goal such as getting money for a ferry. Swigridova kletba is a classic point-and- click adventure based on collecting objects, using them and combining them together. The game is entirely controlled via the mouse. Players explore the environment, talk to characters and solve puzzles. Items can be collected and stored in the inventory at the bottom of the screen. Graphically, the game is similar to Dračí Historie. ==Critical reception== Tomáš Landa from Score magazine appreciated the change in graphic design from Mise Quadam. Level magazine felt the game was amateur, especially when compared to Dračí historií, and criticized the narrative for being short, simple and straightforward. Gamesite.sk felt the game elevated the Czech-Slovakian video gaming industry a little higher, and added that while it was a short adventure, it had its roots in Czech culture and contained Czech dubbing, which was rare at the time.

He ranhttps://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/rouda-face- rohrabacher-keirstead-concedes as a Democrat to represent California's 48th district in the US Congress in the 2018 elections, but he was defeated in the primary by Harley Rouda. ==Early life and education== Keirstead was raised by a single mother on a farm in Canada and began working to help support his family at age nine. He received his Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia, winning the Cameron Award for the best Ph.D. thesis in the country, with his thesis constituting the first demonstration of functional regeneration of the injured adult spinal cord. He went on to complete four years of post-doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge, where he was the youngest person elected to two senior academic posts, Fellow of the Governing Body of Downing College and Senate Member of the University of Cambridge. ==Career== In 2000, Keirstead left his position at the University of British Columbia, where his spinal cord research had been funded by Rick Hansen's charitable foundation. He joined the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at the University of California, Irvine. Keirstead has advised U.S. Senators and members of Congress on health care and biotechnology. He testified on the state's biotech industry to the California State Senate in 2002 amidst a national debate about stem cell laws and policy in the United States. In 2004, Keirstead publicly supported California Proposition 71, which aimed to authorize three billion dollars for stem cell research for a newly created California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. During the debate he released a video of how he could restore mobility to paralyzed rats using his stem cell research. Keirstead was criticized at the time, because the procedure had yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal, but it subsequently published the following year in the Journal of Neuroscience. The procedure was reproduced by three other labs by 2006, confirming that cells engineered to make myelin can help restore damaged areas of the spinal cord. Keirstead was Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology and Professor of Neurological Surgery at the School of Medicine of the University of California at Irvine for fifteen years, where he was awarded over $16 million in grants and founded the Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center. In his academic career, he mentored more than 100 students and published more than 100 manuscripts. He launched medical research startup companies in Orange County and is currently CEO at AIVITA Biomedical. Other corporate affiliations include Neuron Therapeutics, Inc., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc., Lifeline Cell Technology, LLC, International Stem Cell Corporation, NeoStem Oncology, LLC, Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc., and ALPHAEON Corporation. He has developed new treatments for cancer and for neurological injuries, and has been granted over 20 patents. In 2010, Geron Corporation began the world's first clinical trial of human embryonic stem cell treatment for spinal cord injuries, based on the research of Keirstead's team at UC Irvine. However, the trials ended after a year due to lack of funds. In 2013, Keirstead took a leave of absence from UC Irvine to conduct tests in the private sector. He joined California Stem Cell, Inc., also based in Irvine, as its president and CEO. His first focus after the leave of absence was trials for targeting skin cancer cells using stem cells from the cancer itself to train the immune system. In 2014, he sold a stem-cell company in a deal worth $124 million. Keirstead announced in June 2017 that he would run for Congress as a Democrat, challenging a seat held by Dana Rohrabacher in California's 48th Congressional District. In a 2018 interview with ABILITY Magazine, Keirstead said \\"We don’t have anyone [in Washington] with a broad, deep understanding of the healthcare system, for example, not a one. 435 members, and there’s no one there with a broad, deep understanding of what is 20 percent of our economy. We need that.\\" He conceded the Democratic Party primary to Harley Rouda on Sunday, June 24, 2018 after a very close race. His campaign appears to have been targeted by a cyberattack.https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/california- election-hacking-711202/ ==Personal life== His wife, Niki, is a neuroscientist specializing in Alzheimer's disease. They have one son. Keirstead has a third- degree black belt in Taekwondo. He owns and flies his own helicopter. ==References * campaign website * Discussing some of his endorsements, experiences, and issues * Discussing some of his research Category:Living people Category:California Democrats Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Stem cell researchers Category:American political candidates Category:Canadian expatriate academics in the United States Category:1967 births ","title":"Hans Keirstead"},{"id":"56909740","text":"Świrus (Czech: Dr. Šílenec) is a 1996 Polish adventure video game developed by Mirage and published by Vochozka Trading, who also translated the game into Czech.

Built in 1856 for a bank founded in 1833, it was used by the town as a meeting hall after the bank closed in 1884, and now houses offices. It is a good example of a small 19th-century Greek Revival brick bank building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. ==Description and history== The former Mystic Bank building is located in the center of Old Mystic Village, on the west side of Main Street south of its junction with Old Mystic Center Road. It is a modest single-story brick building, with a gabled roof and granite foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, topped by a pedimented gable. Each bay is set in a round-arch recess, with rectangular sash windows in the outer bays and the main entrance in the center bay. Each are topped by stone lintels, with brickwork filling the rounded arch above. The interior retains virtually all of its original finishes, including woodwork, plaster, and flooring; the original bank vault is also still present. The Mystic Bank was founded in 1833 by a consortium of local businessmen as a service to the local shipbuilding community and the surrounding rural areas. The bank flourished, and was able to build this building in 1856 to accommodate its expanded business. Mystic's economic center, however, had begun to shift south to the Mystic Bridge area (now Mystic), and the bank closed in 1887. The town of Stonington acquired the building soon afterward, and used it as a district meeting hall and polling place. These uses ended about 1960. The building was again repurposed, this time to house the Indian and Colonial Research Center, a museum displaying a collection of native and colonial-era artifacts. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ==References *Indian And Colonial Research Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1856 Category:Stonington, Connecticut Category:Museums in New London County, Connecticut Category:History museums in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut ","title":"Mystic Bank"},{"id":"56910007","text":"Eli Barnes was a representative in the Georgia Assembly as a Republican during the Reconstruction Era.

People go to the King (Relangi) and plead to him to save them from these thieves. The King advises that illiteracy is the main cause for promoting theft, so, he orders people to educate themselves. Gauri (Savitri), daughter of late soldier Singanna lives by selling flowers. She goes to the King and tells him that people also have to work for their livelihood, The King agrees to that. Mahamantri's (Rajanala) eye falls on Gauri, he calls her on the pretext of facilitating her and tries to molest her. Gauri teaches him a lesson and escapes. Banda Ramudu daily meets Gauri at her shop and they love each other. Mahamantri again captures Gauri and her mother Subhadramma (Hemalatha) goes to King and pleads with him to save Gauri. King calls Satyananda Swamy (Chittor V. Nagaiah) to solve these issues. On that night, Banda Ramudu tries burglary in a merchant's house and soldiers chase him. Banda Ramudu escapes by joining the group who are carrying Swamy's chariot and listens to his preaching in the court. Swamy tells them that to end corruption, everybody should leave at least one of their bad habits and shows Banda Ramudu as an example that he may be a thief, but he has to leave at least one of his bad habits. Banda Ramudu afraid that Swamy is going to handover him to the King. So, he decides to kill Swamy. When he is waiting near the temple to kill Swamy, suddenly one snake turns around his hand and with the blessings of Swamy he is saved.

The park reflects the population of the suburb of Furuset, where 63% of inhabitants had an ethnic origin other than Norwegian in 2009, and immigrants came from around 140 countries.Forprosjektrapporten In Verdensparken, there is a space to practice parkour. == Location, landscape, and background of the new park == The park lies on the west side of Gransdalen in Furuset, west of the Furustien walkway which runs between Furuset centre and Gransdalen Road. The Vesterstien walkway runs through the park. The park is to the north and west of Gran school and Gran nurseryVerdensparken. Bydel Alna, Gran nursery's homepage, 22 August 2012, no longer active. Verdensparken is part of the walking route network as Vesterstien, which runs through the park, is a part of route D7, which runs from Furuset church to Stovner. Vesterstien is part of the Pilgrim's Route from the Middle Ages, which is now marked and recreated.Turkart Oslo øst. Oslo kommune, Friluftsetaten, undated and Verdensparken. Parkourpark. Landskapspark. Ny belysning, page 5 The park is in terrain with ravines forming oval landscapes south of the park area. The banks are covered with birch and pine trees which are partially planted. The grass banks follow the ravine forms and run over into short-trimmed lawns to the North and East. The vegetation is limited to a few species, mainly birch and pine, with a few poplars. Much of the vegetation was planted in the 1980s, when the suburb was first growing. The large spaces lacked intimacy, and were therefore not used much for picknicking, for example. The area of the park is mostly green space. The park was little used, and became a \\"green desert\\" with little variation in character and contents. The traffic on Furustien, which borders the park to the East, is likewise heavy, with 1400 people per day.Forprosjektrapporten The layout of the park was based on a study undertaken in 2008, planning in 2009, and continued housing analysis through the project. The municipality consulted with residents of Furuset, with particular focus on seeking the needs and wishes of women and youths. .Forprosjektrapporten, pages 6 and 9-11. One of the most common requests from the people of Furuset was a good meeting place outdoors. Verdensparken is the first project in a new collaboration between the Norwegian State Housing Bank and the Norwegian Environment Agency (formerly the Directorate for Nature Management), on the improvement of the local area. The park is part of the area improvement for Furuset in the Groruddalssatsingen.Plankontoret for Groruddalen., Oslo Municipality, Plankontoret's homepage and Områdeløft på Furuset. Bydel Alna's homepage, 19 June 2012, and Verdensparken på Furuset. Oslo Municipality, Bydel Alna's homepage (all accessed 17 December 2013) Each of the four districts were given a new large park, and Verdensparken is Alna's park. The name of the park reflects the cultural diversity of the suburb, joined with the UN's message of peace, and Trygve Lie, the UN's first general secretary, who grew up in Furuset.Verdensparken på Furuset.

Bydel Alna, 23 September 2011 (both accessed 17 December 2013) == Layout of the park == The meeting places in the park link new and existing vegetation. The ravines create interesting spaces and soft spaces, which are used to make attractive meeting spaces and seating areas. The ravines also create areas for sports activities and physical exercise in the winter time.Forprosjektrapporten, pages 6 and 10 Physical activities which were formerly linked to permanent spaces and organisations moved to open spaces in the park, and organise activities themselves.Ingrid Helsing Almaas: «En annen hverdag.» Arkitektur N, 04/13, pages 10–11, and «Bevegelse og aktivitet i en urban fremtid», same publication, 4/13, pages 64–71. In Verdensparken, the municipality has supported the use of new green spaces. The parkour areas (free running) are a project by Kragh & Berglund landscape architecture and urban design in Copenhagen. The most important elements of the space are concrete walls and staircases, padded rubber bins, plastic pads and rails. Parkour is not usually specially built in urban areas. The parkour area was opened by Environment Minister Bård Vegar Solhjell and councillor Bård Folke Fredriksen on 31 May 2013.Park & anlegg 6–2013, page 37. The park contains seven meeting places with paving and benches, barbecues, bonfires, fruit trees, and fruit and berry bushes. These are of varying sizes, and are located throughout the park. There is a roof over the long table in meeting place nr. 4. In one of the ravines in the middle of the park, there is a stream ending with a dam. On the dam, an amphitheater has been built with seating areas and stone artwork. A former track has been upgraded to a tourist route with paving. The first to be built were benches, fruit trees, seating areas and parkour equipment throughout the park. At the bottom of Verdensplassen is a lake landscape. The whole park is dealt with in a similar way, a mini-landscape with valleys, streams, rivers and bushes, reinforced by the use of natural elements such as stone, vegetation and water, but without typical play apparatus. Visual inspiration for this came from the Danish landscape architect Helle Nebelong, who has designed a variety of play areas and sensory gardens, including in Copenhagen. The overflow from the water areas leads into a stream to Gran school.Verdensparken på Furuset. Oslo municipality, Bydel Alna's homepage and Vedlegg 2, page 10 The lighting is provided by ÅF lighting. The lighting in Verdensparken has a distinctive and special design. In the amphitheater, stone benches look like a starry sky. Foot and cycle paths are lit without blending and have good colour separation. The lighting turns off at 11:00 p.m., so that the lights do not disturb the park's neighbours.Verdensparken. Parkourpark. Landskapspark. Ny belysning. Vedlegg 2, and Park & anlegg 6–2013, page 38. The lighting was awarded the Norsk Lyspris 2013, and the jury wrote. \\"The way the light is used gives the park a new meaning in the evening, a new layer of meaning emerges at the time of darkness. The park is divided into different \\"experience zones\\", which contributes to variety, curiosity and movement.\\"Tidligere vinnere. lyskultur.no, undated . (accessed 22 March 2015) Art is central to the design of Verdensplassen, which lies to the lowest, northeast, corner. The placement and size of the square make this area of the park more active, as it was previously a sad area of asphalt. Verdensplassen has its own character from site-specific art in combination with the creation of a social meeting place for people in the suburb and other arrangements. The floor of the square is made as a carpet of mosaic which is meant to reflect the people of Furuset, and inspirations include the Selburose, African graphics, and Persian carpets.Utemiljø 2/2011 and Forprosjektrapporten, page 10 Verdensparken is 52 decares large, around 400 meters at the longest point North-South, and the ground is owned by the municipality. The park is regulated for free use, apart from a small area that is specifically a walking and cycleway.Grøntregistreringer. Oslo municipality, Plan- og bygningsetaten, 2009.

(accessed 19 December 2013) The park is financed by the state and the Directorate for Nature Management (from 2013 the Environment Directorate), Oslo municipality through the Groruddals initiative and the station and meeting places project, and the Sparebankstiftelsen DNB NOR. The park had a budget of 41 million kroner, and work was done in three stages.Ny bydelspark i Groruddalen.

Buster was chosen as the recipient of the 2012 National Golden Spur Award for his \\"outstanding contributions to the ranching and livestock industry\\". Buster won the NCHA World Championship four times, and the NCHA World Championship Futurity five times. The most notable horses he trained include Marion's Girl, Chickasha Mike, Money's Glo who he trained and in 1962 won the first NCHA World Championship Futurity, in 1963 he won it on Chickasha Glo, in 1966 on Rey Jay's Pete, in 1971 on Dry Doc, and in 1977 on Peppy San Badger. He won the NCHA World Championship on Marion's Girl in 1954 and 1956. He trained Mr San Peppy and won the NCHA World Championship in 1974 and 1976. ==Early life== Buster Welch was born on May 23, 1928, near Sterling City Texas. Buster's ancestral heritage dates back to Tennessean roots and family settlements in Texas before the Civil War. He was born and raised to early childhood near the divide of the Colorado and Concho Rivers, north of Sterling City, Texas. His mother died shortly after his birth, leaving his grandparents to raise him for a time on their stock farm. His father remarried, and moved the family to Midland, Texas, where he worked for Atlantic Richfield. While still in grade school, Buster had run away from home several times, and would skip school to spend time at the stockyards where he learned to ride broncs. At age 13, he left home permanently and landed a job breaking horses, working large herds of cattle, and tending to various other ranch chores for cattlemen, Foy and Leonard Proctor, in Midland, Texas. It was there that Buster learned the basics of riding and working cattle that followed him into adulthood. After leaving Proctor's, Buster worked for many prominent ranches such as the 6666 Ranch, Pitchfork Ranch, King Ranch, Long X, and a few other ranches where he developed his skills working with rough stock and cattle. His goal was to one day have a ranch of his own. == Personal life == In the early 1980s, Buster and his wife Sheila, lived and worked in Kingsville, Texas, on the King Ranch. Sheila rode cutting horses and competed in cutting horse competition. She won several championship titles, and earned over $1 million in NCHA earnings. In the late 2000s, they sold their 25,000 acre Double Mountain River Ranch, and moved to the adjacent 18,000 acre Chriswell Ranch. They eventually moved to Rotan, Texas, and raised cattle under the \\"B Lazy W\\" brand to supply the retail demand for naturally fed beef. Buster continued to train cutting horses and managed to expand the ranch to include both leased and owned land comprising over 60,000 acres. Sheila died on December 7, 2014, at age 76. == Career == When he was 18 years old, Welch took advantage of the new National Cutting Horse Association, and by the early 1950s had begun to establish himself as a horseman able to train a horse to \\"some degree of finish\\". Also, cutting horses had begun to really make their mark as contest livestock. Welch had always planned to establish himself in cattle ranching and was running 800 head on leased land when a drought \\"focused his options\\". One of the locations where Welch worked for a ranch was for Homer Ingham in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Welch claims that Ingham, \\"gave me my first real opportunity in training horses\\". Welch broke and trained horses for him and also for Warren Shoemaker, his neighbor. On Shoemaker's urging, Welch decided to purchase a six-year-old unbroken stallion named Chickasha Mike for $125 from Ingham. Chickasha Mike was by American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame sire Billy Clegg. Welch broke Mike, used him in his ranch work, and for cutting. Since the horse seemed to have an aptitude for cutting, Welch took him to some local contests. In 1952, Mike won his first five events. Awhile later Welch sold Mike to Bill Hale of Odessa, Texas, for $8,500, and Hale sold him to Leonard Proctor, Welch's previous employer. Welch's first competition on a cutting horse was on Chickaska Mike. By showing Chickasha Mike as a cutting horse, Welch established the horse, an American Quarter Horse, as a notable sire of cutting horse champions. Due to Welch's training, Chickasha Mike became the 1956 NCHA Reserve World Champion. Proctor owned the horse when he won the 1956 NCHA Reserve World Championship. An oilman named Marion Flynt of Midland, Texas, saw Welch's first competition on Chickasha Mike. Flynt was impressed enough to send Welch his best mare, Marion's Girl, by Silver Wimpy and out of Scharbauer mare, to train. The mare was foaled in 1948. Flynt had purchased the mare from her breeder, prominent rancher Clarence Scharbauer Jr., when she was 2 years old for $2,000. She won back $1,677 of her purchase price in one of her first competitions. Welch took the mare from coast to coast to campaign her when she was 6 and 8 years old. Under Welch's tutelage and expert riding, Marion's Girl won the NCHA World Championship in 1954. They gave her a year off to rest in 1955. Then, in 1956 she and Welch won the title again. The mare won a career total of $35,000, which would be significant earnings when adjusted for higher purses awarded now. Welch called her the smartest and best cutting horse he ever rode. The mare died when she was 9 years old and never produced any foals. In 1960, Welch trained a horse named Jessie Jack owned by C.E. Boyd, Jr. of Houston, Texas; he rode the horse to win the NCHA World Champion Stallion title. In 1962, Welch and other competitors started the NCHA Futurity. The NCHA Futurity is an event for 3-year-old horses who have not been shown before. In 1962, the NCHA Futurity held its first event at the Nolan County Coliseum in Sweetwater, Texas. Welch rode Money Glo, owned by C.E. Boyd, III, in the event. The duo marked 224 to win, earned $3,838.12, and the status of having won the first event. Money Glo's sire, King Glo, owned by C.E. Boyd, Jr. brought his owner a $1,000 Breeders Award. From 1962 to 1963, Welch served on the NCHA's Executive Committee; he also served as an NCHA director. In 1963, Welch marked 218 on Chickasha Glo in the NCHA Futurity for a second straight win. They won $4,277, which was a new record for a cutting horse. Chickasha Glo was also sired by King Glo, and Boyd earned a second consecutive $1,000 Breeders Award. In 1964, he placed fifth riding Glo Doc. By November 1965, Money Glo had a new owner, Repps Guitar. Repps Guitar had Welch take Money Glo to the NCHA Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada. There were at least 77 horses competing for the championship. Welch won the first round, tied for third place in the second round, and tied for fourth place in the average. Welch returned home after the championship ended and decided to open his own cutting horse school, which attracted students from across the US and as far away as Australia. At the time, Welch was living in the Ranch, right outside of Roscoe, Texas. He was also leasing two ranches, the former C.E. Boyd, Jr. Ranch and the L.S. Howard Ranch. He was operating and managing three ranches, managing and showing horses, and running a cutting school. In 1966, Welch marked 218 points on Rey Jay's Pete in the fifth NCHA Futurity in his third win of the event. The event now showcased 336 horses compared to the 47 that had been nominated in the inaugural event. The purse was now nearly four times its original amount. The horse, Rey Jay's Pete was sired by Rey Jay. He was unregistered and owned by Kenneth Peters of Fort Wayne, Indiana. \\"Rey Jay's Pete was an outstanding horse, really a true cow horse,\\" Welch said. They won the race by two points Waddy Wolf and Leroy Ashcraft. Welch broke the winnings record again with $9,353. In 1971, Welch rode Dry Doc for a record fourth win in the NCHA Futurity. Dry Doc was a full brother to the previous champion, Doc O'Lena, and was by Doc Bar out of Poco Lena. He was bred by Dr. & Mrs. Stephen Jensen. \\"Dry Doc was a little athlete and could really run, stop, get back and hold a cow\\", Welch said. The NCHF was now ten years old. The purse had grown from $18,375 to $112,000. In 1974, Welch rode the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame horse cutting horse Mr San Peppy for the King Ranch to an NCHA World Championship. In 1976 Welch again rode him to another NCHA World Championship. In 1976, Welch rode Mr San Peppy in senior cutting to win an AQHA World Championship. In 1977, Welch rode Peppy San Badger for a record fifth win in the NCHA Futurity. Peppy San Badger was bred by Joe Kirk and owned by the King Ranch. Nicknamed \\"Little Peppy\\" the horsed marked 220.5 under a new scoring system. \\"Little Peppy could be a real classy, pretty horse with lots and lots of style, and then he could immediately turn into a fierce working horse and hold bad, bad cows\\", said Welch. The pair also won the 1978 NCHA Derby, the 1980 reserve World Championship and the 1981 NCHA World Finals. Peppy San Badger in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame, his offspring earned more than $21 million, and he's ranked in the top 5 sires. Dry Doc, Little Peppy, Peppy San Badger, and Mr San Peppy were all King Ranch horses that Welch trained and showed. Little Peppy and Mr San Peppy were bred on the King Ranch. In 1983, the King Ranch purchased Dry Doc. Welch had won the Futurity on Dry Doc and had also beat his son, Greg, who was riding Mr San Peppy. In 1999, Welch suffered a stroke. In 2010, Welch focused his attention on the rural population decline in the Ashland, Kansas, Public School District. The shrinking economy in rural towns always seems to force some residents to move away, which causes the number of students to decrease.

His identification (working jointly with Dr Geoffrey West) that the mast cell was the main producer of histamine in the human body resulted in his being made a Visiting Professor at the University of Montreal and to his being awarded the Claude Bernard Medal for medical achievement. He was one of the first to identify the link between mast cells and asthma and the potential use of antihistamines in this field.Psychoneuroimmunology by Rober Ader ==Life== He was born in Settle, Yorkshire on 2 May 1912. He was educated at Giggleswick School in Yorkshire. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MB ChB in 1935. In 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In the Second World War he served as Assistant Surgeon to the Scottish Emergency Medical Service, and for the final year served at the rank of Major with the OC Mobile Surgical Unit in India and Malaysia. Returning to Edinburgh he received his doctorate (MD) in 1946. However, despite intentions to be a surgeon, a skin complaint on his hands prevented his being a surgeon, and he instead retrained as a radiologist, with particular interest in the use of x-rays in cancer treatment.https://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/news/2015/james-f-riley- celebrating-dundees-great-and-good.php In 1948 he took on the role of Consultant Radiologist at Dundee Royal Infirmary. In 1950 he took on the additional role of Reader in Radiotherapy at the University of St AndrewsMedical School in Dundee, which became part of Queens College Dundee in 1954 and from 1967 was part of the new University of Dundee. Riley retained the post of Reader until 1975, and was a research fellow at the University of Dundee from then until 1977. Much of his research at Dundee was devoted to the mast cell and this led to his discovery of the origins of histamine. In 1958 he received a second doctorate (PhD), from the University of St Andrews. In 1968 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were George H Bell, Rex Coupland, Ian George Wilson Hill and James Ernest Richey.

C1orf112 encodes for seventeen variants of mRNA, fifteen of which are functional proteins. C1orf112 has a determined precursor molecular weight of 96.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.62. C1orf112 has been experimentally determined to localize to the mitochondria, although it does not contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence. == Gene == The gene spans 192,073 base pairs, with 29 different exons. C1orf112 is located at position 1q24.2. C1orf112 shares antisense coding regions with C1orf156 and SCYL3. Location of chromosome 1 open reading frame 112 in context of other genes within the region 1q24.2. Image courtesy of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). == Protein == There are currently eight experimentally determined RefSeq isoforms. C1orf112 has a domain of unknown function DUF4487. === Composition === Compositional analysis through SAPS predicted much less glycine and much more leucine than expected relative to other human protein sequences. This characteristic is conserved across primate orthologs. A mixed charge cluster was found in Isoform X1 from position 747 to 805, indicating that this segment may be aqueous and tightly bound. This mixed charge cluster is only partially conserved across orthologs === Transcripts === C1orf112 is determined to have 9 transcripts, or splice variants by Ensembl. === Subcellular Localization === Antibody immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescent staining of human cell line A-431 indicates C1orf112 is localized to the mitochondria. Immunofluorescent staining of human cell line A-431 indicates localization to mitochondria. Image courtesy of Human Protein Atlas and Sigma-Aldrich antibody HPA024451. == Regulation  Gene level regulation ===  Expression  Although tissue-level expression is ubiquitous, C1orf112 is expressed highest in the testes, lymph nodes, brain marrow, and cerebellum, with samples from 97 individual in 27 different tissues. In-situ hybridization of the human transcriptome indicates expression is highest in the atrioventricular node, followed by the testis, testis germ cells, and testis interstitial tissue. === Transcript level regulation === Transcription factor assessment indicates many potential TATA-binding protein and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins sites, along with transcription factors associated with the testis, thymus, kidneys, and cardiac tissue. === Protein level regulation === There are two ubiquitination sites on C1orf112, at position lysine 73 and at position 783 on isoform X1. Downstream of reading frame, there are three polyadenylation signals. In addition, there is an N6-acetyllysine site at leucine 747 and a phosphoserine site at serine 23. C1orf112 has been found experimentally to interact with ATG1, an aldosterone secretion whose overexpression characterizes certain forms of breast cancer. Post-translational modifications predictions include O-glycosyl-oligosaccharide-glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and sumoylation, and sumoylation interaction sites. === Interacting proteins === C1orf112 is predicted to interact with a diverse range of proteins, including multiple mitosis- associated proteins. C1orf112 is also predicted to interact with FIGNL1, a protein involved in DNA double-stranded break repair via homologous recombination. Experimental findings indicate C1orf112 interacts with NUF2, a spindle-pole body protein that plays a critical role in nuclear division, and TTK, a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating serine, threonine, and tyrosine. == Homology/evolution  Paralogs === There are no known paralogs of C1orf112. === Orthologs === C1orf112 is highly conserved in Pan troglodytes, Rhinopithecus bieti, Castor canadensis, Miniopterus natalensis, and other select primates, with percent identity relative to Homo sapien C1orf112, with percent identity greater than 90%. Ortholgs with the greatest date of divergence (date of speciation) to human C1orf112 include Trichosporon asahii, a placozoa, and Amphimedon queenslandica, indicated that C1orf112 has been preserved over evolutionary time. {  +C1orf112 Orthologs in Ascending Divergence Genus/Species Common Name Taxonomic Group Date of Divergance (Estimated Time) Accession # Sequence Length (aa) % Identity % Similarity E Value - Homo sapiens Humans Mammals 0 NP_001306976.1 853 100 100  - Pan troglodytes Chimpanzees Primates 6.65 mya XP_009436263.1 911 99 99 0 - Rhinopithecus bieti Black Stub- Nosed Monkey Primates 29.44 mya XP_017723911.1 911 97 98 0 - Castor canadensis American Beaver Rodentia 90 mya XP_020026631.1 908 87 92 0 - Miniopterus natalensis Natural long-fingered bat Chiroptera 96 mya XP_016077003.1 912 84 90 0 - Condylura cristata Star-Nosed Mole Soricomorpha 96 mya XP_024409392.1 531 77 85 0 - Bos indicus Zebu Cetartiodactyla 96 mya XP_019832063.1 875 84 90 0 - Acinonyx jubatus Cheetah Carnivora 96 mya XP_026902260.1 912 86 90 0 - Aptenodytes forsteri Emperor Penguin Aves 312 mya XP_009271565.1 839 59 76 0 - Chelonia mydas Green Sea Turtle Reptilia 312 mya XP_007061247.1 849 64 78 0 - Xenopus laevis African Clawed Frog Amphibia 352 mya XP_018114274.1 904 55 72 0 - Nanorana parkeri Nanora parkeri Amphibia 352 mya XP_018428126.1 698 52 70 0 - Salmo salar Atlantic Salmon Actinopterygii 435 mya XP_013979201.1 924 47 64 0 - Helobdella robusta Earth worm Clitellata 797 mya XP_009029571.1 1004 25 43 0 - Amphimedon queenslandica Sponge Porifera 951.8 mya XP_019856681.1 903 28 46 0 - Trichosporon asahii Fungi Fungi 1105 mya XP_014176969.1 2588 43 68 0.006 } Date of divergence was calculated using TimeTree.

It was inspired by the German science fiction novel series Perry Rhodan. == Production == The game was developed by Petr Mandík and Petr Bartáček's company Agawa, which was devoted to games with sci-fi themes. Having met at work through their shared education field, Bartáček became acquainted with Mandík's game Mavlin: Vesmírný únik and was impressed by its gaming engine, and saw the potential of making better games. The graphics were created by an external graphic artist who drew pictures directly onto paper. Mandík and Bartáček subsequently scanned the images into the computers and gave them animations.https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1 === Aftermath and legacy === Agawa released two games, both in the adventure genre: Mise Quadami (1995) and Swigridova kletba (1996). The company worked on two other adventure games: Orientální dobrodružství and MMA, both due for release in 1998, but their release was cancelled, and a year later the company was disbanded. By this time, Orientální dobrodružství already had completed graphics, and the game engineers were preparing to use Swigridova kletba's game engine, which required major changes to be applied to the new game. At the time MMA was only in the planning stage. The company folded as the Mandík and Bartáček decided to change careers. Mise Quadami was the first Czech game to use anti-piracy protection, and also the first game which had a comprehensive manual attached, with terms and explanations of the game world. The manual asked players to describe colours apparent at certain points in the game, making it impossible to play in black-and-white. These features all came into wider use among other Czech games. == Plot and gameplay == In the year 2360, androids have killed all humans on planet Earth and now they plan to destroy all the vegetation using an element called Cybertrone. A small group of human scientists have hidden on Matna Plus and developed a counter-device against Cybertrone called Sodomgomorhator. They send out many ships to take the device to Earth but the missions fail. David, the player, is their last hope. In terms of gameplay, Mission Quadam is a sci-fi point-and-click adventure based around exploration, conversations and puzzles. The game has many pixel hunting puzzles. The inventory is located at the bottom of the screen. The gameplay is wholly controlled via the mouse and the player uses single click commands. == Critical reception == The game has received mixed reviews from critics with Score from 30% to 65%. Reviewers agreed that this is a very professionally conceived work, and included many firsts, thereby advancing the Czech adventures gaming industry. Vladimir Ponechal reviewed Mise Quadam for Excalibur magazine. Ponechal noted that first thing that caught his interest was well-crafted manual. He praised game's story and humor. Ponechal mentioned that game's protagonist David resembles Dempsey. He likened the game to titles by Pterodon such as Tajemství Oslího ostrova and 7 dní a 7 nocí. On the other hand, animation and graphics were criticised. Ponechal concluded that Mise Quadam can be compared to best Czech adventure games of the time. He noted that gameplay and idea can compensate for poor graphics. Tomáš Landa of Level magazine gave Mise Quadam 50%. He stated that game is more difficult than it should be because game's graphics is confusing. He also mentioned that story seems illogical on the first sight. He noted that he understood the story when he played the game for second time. He also criticised poor graphics. Andrej Anastasov wrote review for Score magazine. He was very critical and gave 30%. Anastasovv stated that the game is very amateur performed. He stated that every aspect of the game is bad. He criticised graphics as ugly and story as weird. He was critical of gameplay that is illogical. Matěj Baran of Riki magazine gave 55%. He noted that the game reminds him of Terminator. He noted that graphics and music are poor. He also noted high difficulty which resulted in nervous experience. On the other hand, he stated that he enjoyed much fun playing the game. == References  External links == * Level walkthrough Category:1995 video games Category:Adventure games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic ","title":"Mise Quadam"},{"id":"56910387","text":"The Mahindra Roxor is a 4x4 off-road only utility vehicle assembled by Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) since 2018. MANA is the US arm of Indian automotive company Mahindra and Mahindra. It is based on the Mahindra Thar M2DICR variant, produced and sold in the Indian market since 2010. Mahindra has made off-road vehicles in jeep(GP) pattern since a 1947 contract with Willys to build such vehicles for Indian market. The Roxor was announced in November 2017 and began sales on March 2, 2018. In the United States it is an off-highway side-by-side (SxS). The Roxor is assembled at Mahindra's factory that opened in March 2018 in Auburn Hills, outside Detroit, Michigan. Mahindra is the first new automaker to open a manufacturing operation in the Detroit area in almost 30 years. Roxors are assembled at the US Mahindra facility with about 50% local content, by value. They are sold through powersports dealers across US and Canada. In June of 2020, the United States International Trade Commission ruled that the Roxor infringed upon Jeep's trade dress. This decision was accompanied by a limited exclusion order and a cease-and-desist order, effectively barring the import and sale of the Roxor in the US.https://www.thedrive.com/news/34061/jeep-wins-in-legal-fight-over- mahindra-roxor https://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1132_notice_06112020sgl.pdf Mahindra is redesigning the Roxor to further visually distinguish it from Jeep's vehicles.https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mahindra-roxor-to-get- all-new-design-417879 == Design == The Roxor is based on the design of the Jeep CJ of the 1960s, and Willys CJ of the 1940s. Mahindra was granted a license in 1947 to use the Jeep and CJ trademarks, and Willys originally shipped complete vehicle kits directly to Mahindra. Over time, the vehicles were localized in India. The body design and a significant portion of its mechanical architecture remain largely untouched. In the US off-road UTV market, it has a roll-over protection system (ROPS), which creates the upper body structure and is attached directly to the fully boxed frame. It has a single gauge speedometer on all variants, with digital fuel, odometer, and tachometer gauges. The Roxor is available in two- and four-passenger versions, and with either a manual or automatic transmission. It has 16-in steel or aluminum wheels, with options for Goodyear 235/70R16 Wrangler Trailrunner AT, BFGoodrich 235/70R16 All-Terrain T/A KO2, or EFX 30×9.5-16 tires. == Powertrain == The Roxor is powered by the Mahindra M2DICR direct-injected turbodiesel engine that Mahindra claims produces @ 3,200 and torque at 1,400 rpm. The 18.6:1 compression ratio turbodiesel engine powered the Thar M2DICR and several other utility Mahindra vehicles excluding tractors. Starting 2019 model year Roxor, it is electronically limited to , and in the 2018 model to ensure safe off-highway use. Mahindra says the Roxor's fuel tank allows a range of and consumes . == Drivetrain == The NGT520 transmission was designed to military specifications. It has a cast-iron housing with a direct-mounted shift system. All of the forward gears are engaged with single-cone brass synchronizers. The simple gear lubrication system is efficient enough under driving conditions to allow limited flat towing of the vehicle over the road. The gears are helical involute. The dual-offset cast-iron transfer case is also based on early military specified driveline requirements. The 2.46:1 low range allows low crawl speeds over uneven terrain and steep grades. The leaf- sprung straight axles are of a legacy design close to Dana 44 with 3.73:1 final drive ratio. Since mid-2018, a 6L50 automatic transmission sourced from Punch Powerglide in Strasbourg, France, is offered as an option on the Mahindra Roxor. ==Trademark dispute== Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, owner of the Jeep brand, filed a complaint in August 2018 with the U.S. International Trade Commission to halt sales in the US, saying the design infringed on FCA's copyrights. Mahindra and its Mahindra Automotive North America division filed a public interest statement with the trade commission on August 22, 2018, asserting that the recent complaint filed by FCA U.S. is without merit, and has begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it claims to have executed with Fiat in 2009. In late 2019, Judge Cameron Elliot ruled in favor of FCA, stating that the International Trade Commission should issue a limited exclusion order (to prevent Mahindra from importing Roxor vehicles or parts) and a cease-and-desist order (to block Mahindra from selling vehicles already in the US).https://www.carscoops.com/2019/11/judge- finds-mahindra-roxor-infringes-on-jeeps-trade-dress-recommends-sales-stop/ On June 11, 2020, the U. S. International Trade Commission affirmed the decision. The ITC did not find that the Roxor's grill infringes upon Jeep's trademarked 7-slot grill. Rather, the vehicle overall infringes upon Jeep's trade dress used formerly in their CJ series vehicles, and currently on their Wrangler series vehicles. In particular, the Roxor has \\"a boxy body shape with flat vertical sides, rear body panels that are roughly the same height as the hood, the door cut-outs that go above the bottom of the side, exterior hood latches, a mostly flat and rounded-edge hood tapering toward the front... and the trapezoidal flared fenders that extend past the grille.\\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/31240/judge-rules-mahindra-roxor-too- similar-to-jeep-fca-will-push-for-stop-sale-order-in-us While Mahindra has often highlighted the differences between the Roxor and the Jeep, the ITC ruling has caused them to embark on a redesign of the vehicle.https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mahindra-roxor-to-get-all-new- design-417879 Acknowledging the Roxor's similarities to Jeep vehicles, Rick Haas, Mahindra Automotive North America CEO and President, stated that the Roxor is \\"actually a CJ,\\" and that \\"everyone understands that our vehicle is a CJ.\\"https://www.rurallifestyledealer.com/articles/8921-judge-finds-mahindra- roxor-infringes-on-jeeps-trade-dress-recommends-sales-stop == References  * Official North American website * Official Canadian website Category:Jeep platforms Roxor Category:Off-road vehicles ","title":"Mahindra Roxor"},{"id":"56910394","text":"Conus guanahacabibensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.MolluscaBase (2018).

He makes and performs gyils, a xylophone containing 14 suspended wooden slats stretched over calabash gourds containing resonators. He was taught to build the instruments using a rare wood known by the Lobi as neura. Kakraba explained: \\"It's a very hard process, because you have to get the wood from five different places, only found in Ghana’s forests. The trees fall on their own and when they do, you cut them, dry the wood and lay the keys.\\" LA Weekly have referred to Kakraba as the \\"world's greatest\\" xylophone player, and he has toured worldwide playing the gyil. Kakraba grew up in Saru, a small village in Ghana where the gyil is held in great respect by the Lobi tribe. It is played at funerals to \\"help the souls of the dead reach the afterlife,\\" and is a primary instrument of other Northern Ghana cultures like the Sisala and Dagara. Kakraba's parents also played the gyil, as did other relatives, including his uncle Kakraba Lobi, who is considered by many to be among the instrument's greatest practitioners. In 1997,Kakraba moved to Accra and began busking, and soon joined the group Hewale Sounds, who aimed to preserve and familiarise the traditional music of Ghana. Kakraba has taught the gyil at the University of Ghana's 'International Centre for African Music and Dance.' In September 2013, his band the SK Kakraba Band released a self-titled album as a cassette on Holy Page. It was ranked at number 1 on Fact Magazine's list of \\"the 20 best cassette releases of 2013\\", with Brad Rose of the publication writing: \\"This music has serious soul. Everything about these tunes is purely ecstatic.\\" The solo album Yonye was released July 2015 by Sun Ark Records, a label run by experimental musician Sun Araw as a splinter label to Drag City. Recorded after Kakaraba's arrival in the United States, it contains solo recordings and traditional pieces. Songs of Paapieye followed in October 2015, released by Awesome Tapes From Africa as the label's first non-reissue release. The album contains six solo, instrumental recordings, spanning Kakraba's \\"favourite song cycles, funeral dirges, improvised interpretations on traditional songs and original compositions.\\" It departs from Yonye in that it is smoother in sound and is an album of solo recordings as opposed to a group recording. Songs of Paapieye was recorded in a San Francisco studio belonging to Kakraba's close friend Brian Hogan. As a solo project, the album was recorded by Kakraba entirely by himself, playing live without any overdubs or accompanying guest musicians. This differentiated the project from the traditional setting for gyil music, where two gyil players may play together with accompaniment from drums, bells and sometimes singing. On 10 April 2016, he played an acclaimed performance at The Ampersand Salon. Kakraba currently lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, having moved to the city in 2012. ==Discography== *Gandayina: Xylophone Music of Ghana (Pentatonic Press, 2002) *SK Kakraba Band (Holy Page, 2013) *Kanbile (Solo And Ensemble Xylophone Music Of Ghana) (Pentatonic Press, 2014) *Yonye (Sun Ark Records, 2015) *Songs of Paapieye (Awesome Tapes From Africa, 2015) ==References== Category:Ghanaian musicians Category:Xylophonists Category:Ghanaian musical instrument makers Category:Folk musicians Category:Traditional musicians Category:1970s births Category:Living people ","title":"SK Kakraba"},{"id":"56910764","text":"Adaś Miauczyński - a fictional hero of a series of movies directed by Marek Koterski, played by several actors.

She produced works for decorating public buildings and churches, including the Danish Parliament and Roskilde Cathedral. Kornerup was also active as a teacher with the Haandarbejdets Fremme textile guild and the Danish School of Arts and Crafts. ==Early life and education== Born on 9 December 1918 on the island of Lidingö in Stockholm, Sweden, Emilie Anna Maria Bruzelius was the daughter of the pharmacist Niels Idar Carl Johan Bruzelius (1869–1952) and Jenny Maria Sandberg (1877–1961), a teacher. She was brought up in a well-to-do academic environment together with her four brothers and her twin sister. Her initial interest in textiles stemmed from her mother's weaving. From 1935, she studied first at Konstfack, then at the Textile Institute in Borås (1937–39) and finally from 1940 until 1944 at the Högre Konstindustriella Skolan (Higher Art and Crafts School). While still studying, she worked for a time at Elsa Gullberg's textile establishment in Vaxholm. In 1946, she married the Danish architect Jørgen Ebbe Kornerup (1910–97) and moved with him to Denmark. ==Career== In 1951, Kornerup opened a weaving workshop in Charlottenlund where she produced tapestries and embroidered works, often creating scenes of everyday life, sometimes with children. In parallel, until 1961, she taught composition at Haandarbejdets Fremme, which had become a focus for Danish textile art. She also taught embroidery, sewing and weaving at the Danish School of Arts and Crafts (1960–73). As described in her Broderiformning (1969), she engaged in experimental teaching under the Gentofte municipal authority, using new materials for both adults and primary school children. For many years, she taught textile art in teachers training colleges. Her Embroidery for Children was published in English in 1971. She exhibited her work from the 1950s in Denmark and abroad. Study trips until the 1970s in Europe, the Middle East and the United States widened her mastery of embroidery and weaving. She assisted with the management of the Artists' Autumn Exhibitions, becoming a central figure in Danish textile art. Her decorative work was commissioned for banks, hotels, public buildings, schools, churches and the Danish Parliament. Her work can be seen in the Danish Design Museum and in the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York. Ann-Mari Kornerup died in 2006. ==Awards== In addition to numerous grants and scholarships, Kornerup received the silver medal for the Venice Biennale in 1946 and first prize for the Haandarbejdets Fremme embroidery contest in 1963. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Artists from Stockholm Category:Danish textile artists Category:Danish women artists Category:Swedish textile artists Category:Konstfack alumni Category:Women textile artists Category:Swedish emigrants to Denmark ","title":"Ann-Mari Kornerup"},{"id":"56910875","text":"Rhinogobio typus is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to China. ==References== Category:Rhinogobio Category:Fish described in 1871 ","title":"Rhinogobio typus"},{"id":"56910906","text":"Magnús Jónsson í Vigur (1637–1702) was a wealthy Icelandic landowner who is best known for his patronage of manuscripts and interest in Icelandic and foreign literature.Jón Helgason, ed., Kvæðabók úr Vigur, 2 vols, Íslenzk rit síðari alda, 2 (Copenhagen: Hið íslenzka fræðafélag, 1955); Peter Springborg, ‘Antiqvæ historiæ lepores – om renæssancen i den islandske håndskriftproduktion i 1600-tallet’, Gardar, 8 (1977), 53–89. Magnús is often referred to as Magnús í Vigur because his primary residence during his lifetime was at a farm on the small island of Vigur in Ísafjarðardjúp in the Westfjords of Iceland. He is also sometimes called Magnús digri (the stout).Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 433. == Biography == Magnús was born on 17 September 1637 in Vatnsfjörður in Vatnsfjarðarsveit in the Westfjords and died at Vigur on 23 March 1702 at the age of 64. Magnús's parents were the Reverend Jón Arason (1606–1673), minister at Vatnsfjörður and educated in Copenhagen, and Hólmfríður Sigurðardóttir (1617–1692). They married in 1636. Magnús was the first of nine children, with a 20-year age span from oldest to youngest. He had four sisters – Helga (1638–1718), Ragnheiður the elder (b. 1639), Ragnheiður the younger (1646–1715), and Anna (1650–1722) – and four brothers – Guðbrandur (1641–1690), Sigurður (1643–1730), Oddur (1648–1711), and Ari (1657–1698).Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 41–42, 433–34. Magnús came from a powerful and wealthy family. In addition to being the son of a wealthy Lutheran minister, he was the great-grandson of two Lutheran bishops on both parents’ sides: on his father's side, Guðbrandur Þorláksson (d. 1627), Bishop of Hólar and famous for having the first Bible printed in Icelandic, known later as Guðbrandsbiblia; on his mother's side, Oddur Einarson (1559–1630), Bishop of Skálholt. Magnús was also the great-great- great grandson of Iceland's last Catholic bishop, Jón Arason of Hólar (1484–1550).Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76). === Education === Magnús's father Jón Arason was not only a Lutheran minister, but a highly educated man who wrote both poetry (religious, secular, and rímur) and history (Vatnsfjarðarannáll) and also translated religious works into Icelandic.Þórunn Sigurðardóttir, ‘Constructing cultural competence in seventeenth-century Iceland: The case of poetical miscellanies’, in Mirrors of Virtue: Manuscript and Print in late pre-modern Iceland, ed. by Matthew Driscoll and Margrét Eggertsdóttir, Opuscula, 15 (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2017), pp. 277–320. Jón studied at the University of Copenhagen in the 1620s after graduating from Iceland's northern Latin school at Hólar. Upon his return to Iceland, Jón was schoolmaster at the Latin school at Skálholt in southern Iceland from 1632 to 1635, before becoming a minister with his own parish, first at Staður in Reykjanes (1635), and then at Vatnsfjörður, where he settled and established his family.Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 41–42. Magnús himself was also formally educated, attending the Latin school in the south at Skálholt from 1652 to 1653, but he did not remain long enough to complete his studies. His abilities in Latin and other languages like Danish and German are reflected in the library of texts he later had, which included translations from these languages, some of which he is thought to have done himself.Seelow, Hubert, Die isländischen Übersetztungen der deutschen Volksbücher: Handschriftenstudien zur Rezeption und Überlieferung ausländischer unterhaltender Literatur in Island in der Zeit zwischen Reformation und Aufkläring (Reykjavík: Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, 1989), pp. 260–66; Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 433. === Family and relationships === On 6 September 1663, at the age of 24, Magnús married Ástríður Jónsdóttir, his 18-year-old second cousin. Their close kinship required a royal dispensation for the marriage to take place.Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 433. Both Magnús and Ástríður received substantial gifts of both fixed and moveable property from their families on the occasion of their marriage, including the farms of Ögur and Vigur from Magnús's father.Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26. Even so, after the wedding, Magnús lived with his bride and his in-laws for the first three years of the marriage. It was while living at Holt that Magnús translated Ævintýr af einum mýlnumanni ('Tale about a miller') into Icelandic from German in 1663, according to a note in the manuscript London, British Library Additional MS 4857.http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS040-002110376 The couple moved away to Ögur not long after that in 1666. A few years later they set up their household in Vigur. A letter dated 23 January 1672 is often cited as the earliest reference to Magnús and Ástríður living in Vigur,Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 110). but they must have been there already three years earlier, if the 1669 dedication on the title page of the same manuscript just mentioned (London, British Library Additional MS 4857) is taken at face value.http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS040-002110376  Children  Magnús and Ástríður had two daughters together. The first, Þorbjörg, was born in 1667, and the second, Kristín, in 1672.Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76), III (1950): 433. Both girls grew up to be literate women who seem to have appreciated reading and learning, and they both came to be influential in the preservation of their father's library of manuscripts.Þórunn Sigurðardóttir, ‘Constructing cultural competence in seventeenth-century Iceland: The case of poetical miscellanies’, in Mirrors of Virtue: Manuscript and Print in late pre-modern Iceland, ed. by Matthew Driscoll and Margrét Eggertsdóttir, Opuscula, 15 (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2017), pp. 277–320; Guðrún Ingólfsdóttir, 'Women's manuscript culture in Iceland, 1600–1900', in Mirrors of Virtue: Manuscript and Print in late pre-modern Iceland, ed. by Matthew Driscoll and Margrét Eggertsdóttir, Opuscula, 15 (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2017), pp. 195–224. In 1696 Þorbjörg married Páll Jónsson Vídalín (1667–1727), who is best known as Árni Magnússon's associate, with whom the Icelandic census of 1703 was carried out. Being of the same age, the two had met at Hólar around 1684, when Páll was studying at the Latin school and Þorbjörg was studying needlework under the tutelage of her aunt Ragnheiður, who then was married to Bishop Gísli Þorláksson of Hólar.Margrét Eggertsdóttir, ‘Script and print in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Iceland: The case of Hólar í Hjaltadal’, in Mirrors of Virtue: Manuscript and Print in late pre-modern Iceland, ed. by Matthew Driscoll and Margrét Eggertsdóttir, Opuscula, 15 (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2017), pp. 127–65 (p. 134). Páll would later work closely with the manuscript collector Árni Magnússon. After his father-in-law's death, Páll inherited both property and some of Magnús í Vigur's manuscripts. Some of these manuscripts in turn came, through Páll, to belong to Árni Magnússon. Magnús í Vigur did not live to see his younger daughter Kristín marry Snæbjörn Pálsson (c. 1677–1767) in 1706. Their time together was short, as Kristín only lived until 1714, aged 42. Snæbjörn came to be known as Mála-Snæbjörn (lawsuit-Snæbjörn), due to the several cases he was involved in against various people, including, in 1720, Páll Vídalín.Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 111–12).  Divorce  In addition to children with his wife Ástríður, Magnús was also father to an illegitimate child born in 1673, one year after Ástríður had given birth to their second daughter Kristín. After Magnús admitted to adultery with an unnamed woman working on the farm Vigur, Ástríður left Magnús and went to live with her father at Holt. With his help, she petitioned for a divorce from Bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson (1605–1675) of Skalhólt, who was also her paternal grandfather's half-brother. Two letters were sent to him, dated 27 and 28 February 1674, just before the end of his time as bishop. Ástríður and Magnús were summoned to the court at the Althing in 1674 but it was still not yet settled. Ástríður wrote again to Brynjólfur in autumn 1674, and his reply of 12 April 1675, only four months before his death later that year, advised her not to return to Magnús. After this, the matter was taken up by Brynjólfur's successor, Bishop Þórður Þorláksson (1637–1697), and during his first visit to the Westfjords the case for divorce was considered and granted. Ástríður later lived at Mýri in nearby Dýrafjörður, eventually together with her daughter Kristín and son-in-law Snæbjörn. Ástríður died on 30 August 1719, at the age of 73.Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 112–13); Páll Eggert Ólason, Íslenskar æviskrár: Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940, 6 vols (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka Bókmenntafélag, 1948–76). After his relationship with Ástríður formally ended, Magnús had another child in 1681 with another mistress, Guðbjörg Jónsdóttir. Guðbjörg was then married to Jón Sigurðsson, a farmer who later worked at Skarð (one of Magnús Jónsson's farms, under the control of Ögur) and even at Vigur itself after Magnús's death. Magnús did not, however, publicly acknowledge his paternity of the child, named Sigurður, until 1686. Until then, the boy was considered to be Guðbjörg's son together with Jón Sigurðsson. When the truth was revealed, Magnús was fined and the record of this notes that the offence was Guðbjörg's first, and Magnús's second. Sigurður Magnússon only lived to his mid-twenties, almost certainly dying in the smallpox epidemic that broke out in 1707.Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 112–13).  Remarriage  Soon after his affair with Guðbjörg was made known, Magnús settled on the idea of marrying a second time. He sought a royal dispensation to marry Sesselja Sæmundsdóttir (born 1673), whose father, Sæmundur Magnússon, was magistrate at Hóll in Bolungarvík. Sesselja was one of seven of Sæmundur's children with his second wife Solveig Jónsdóttir. The dispensation for the marriage was issued in Denmark by King Christian V on 27 April 1688,Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 113). when Sesselja was only 15 years of age; permission must have been sought by Magnús at least a year earlier. The dispensation reached Iceland later and was read at the Althing on 30 June 1691. The following year, 1692, the two were married, Sesselja 19 years old, and Magnús, 55. The couple did not have any children, and this marriage also seems to have been troubled as Sesselja was living again with her family only a few years later. Her uncle Árni Magnússon (c. 1625–1698) of Hóll in Bolungarvík petitioned to take her into his care.Magnús Magnússon, ‘Eyrarannáll 1551–1703’, ed. by Hannes Þorsteinnson, in Annálar 1400–1800, 8 vols (Reykjavík: Hið íslenzka bókmenntafélag, 1922–2003), III (1933–38), pp. 225–420 (p. 382). After his death, Sesselja appears to have lived with her father again, with her brother Sigmundur (c. 1675–c. 1737) as her legal guardian.Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 113) == Patronage of manuscripts == At the time of his death, Magnús had amassed an extensive library of Icelandic and foreign texts from medieval tales and sagas of all literary genres, to modern works on geography and ethnography that were being printed in early modern Europe, to poetry composed by his own family members.Jón Helgason, ed., Kvæðabók úr Vigur, 2 vols, Íslenzk rit síðari alda, 2 (Copenhagen: Hið íslenzka fræðafélag, 1955); Jóhann Gunnar Ólafsson, 'Magnús Jónsson í Vigur', Skírnir, 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 113–26). The manuscripts associated with Magnús Jónsson í Vigur are significant because the texts preserved in them are thought to represent a snapshot of the literature available in Iceland at the time, and to provide insight into the country's early modern literary landscape and manuscript production practices: it has been said of just one of the manuscripts commissioned by Magnús Jónsson (AM 148 8vo, the famous miscellany known as Kvæðabók úr Vigur), that it \\"shows as though in a cross-section the type of poetry, both ancient and new, thought to be most current in Iceland in the late 17th century\\".Jón Helgason, ed., Kvæðabók úr Vigur, 2 vols, Íslenzk rit síðari alda, 2 (Copenhagen: Hið íslenzka fræðafélag, 1955), II: 15. Many of the manuscripts in Magnús's library were copied by one or more scribes who worked in his service.Peter Springborg, ‘Antiqvæ historiæ lepores – om renæssancen i den islandske håndskriftproduktion i 1600-tallet’, Gardar, 8 (1977), 53–89. However, Magnús himself also copied texts in several of the manuscripts in his library. The manuscripts containing Magnús's own writing are listed here, and all of them now are housed in two institutions in Reykjavík, Iceland (those with the shelfmark \\"AM\\" are in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies and those with the shelfmarks ÍB, ÍBR, and JS are in the National and University Library of Iceland): * AM 284 4tohttps://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/AM04-0284 * AM 601 c 4to (rímur excerpts copied c. 1675–1700)https://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/AM04-0601c * Three letters to Jón Jónsson at Holt, dated 1662, 1663, and 1672 and preserved in the larger letter collection AM 1058 III 4tohttps://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/AM04-1058-III * parts of AM 148 8vo (also known as Kvæðabók úr Vigur)https://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/AM08-0148 * ÍB 380 8vohttps://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/IB08-0380 * ÍBR 5–6 fol.

The band has made apparent via social media that they had been working with ambitious collaborators for the creation of the project throughout the promotion of the album, including in-studio collaborations with Australian experimental musician Lucas Abela, New Zealand film director Andrew Adamson and Tool bassist Justin Chancellor. The band posted a black and white image of text reading \\"Year of the Snitch - new album coming soon...\\" on their official webpage on March 22, 2018. Death Grips shared the album artwork for Year of the Snitch on April 6, 2018. The band's imprint label Third Worlds' website was also updated with this information. The tracklist for the album was released on April 11, through a video posted to social media and the band's YouTube channel. The video consisted of the track names being sent via SMS to the user of an iPhone through a screen recorder, while short videos played in the foreground. Accompanying the differing ringtones, screamed vocals of the band's frontman MC Ride can be heard, coming from the album's last track, \\"Disappointed\\". Death Grips uploaded a music video for the track \\"Streaky\\" on their YouTube channel on May 5, 2018, as the album's first single, followed by the track \\"Black Paint\\" on May 15, and the music video for the third album single, \\"Flies\\", on May 22. The band posted a short video to Instagram on May 23, featuring DJ Swamp performing on a turntable in a recording studio, with the caption stating that \\"the majority of Year of the Snitch features [him]\\". The fourth single, \\"Hahaha\\", was uploaded by the band to their YouTube page on June 7. That same day, the album's release date was announced as June 22. A music video for the track \\"Dilemma\\" featuring Andrew Adamson was uploaded on the Death Grips YouTube channel on June 15. A sixth single, \\"Shitshow\\", was uploaded to YouTube two days later. Three days later, on June 20, the official video for \\"Shitshow\\" was released. It was directed by Zach Hill and Galen Pehrson. === Interpretations === The band has been notorious for their invocation of infamous cult-leader Charles Manson, stemming from their sampling of his voice in their debut EP \\"Exmilitary\\". Prior to the album's release, the title \\"Year of the Snitch\\" was speculated to be a reference to the 69th birthday of Manson Family member-turned-key witness Linda Kasbian. This theory was eventually confirmed upon the album's release date on June 22nd, only one day after her birthday. She is also referenced directly in the fourth track \\"Linda's in Custody\\", which alludes to her role in the Tate-LeBianca murders. ==Critical reception== Year of the Snitch received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 8 reviews. In his review for AllMusic, Rob Wacey claimed that \\"Not one of their releases is the same as another, and with Year of the Snitch, they continue to break boundaries and expectations. The record is another example of true experimentation with their sound along with an uncompromising work ethic and a thirst for originality.\\" Writing for The Line of Best Fit, Steven Loftin called the band \\"one of the more exciting bands currently active\\" and described the album as \\"pushing every boundary around them\\". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork called the album \\"explosive\\" and \\"fun as hell\\", but \\"lacking in a clear target to give it meaning\\". Christopher R.

The deuterated compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid, is resistant to lipid peroxidation which makes studies of its cell-protective properties worthwhile. ==Mechanism of action== An animated illustration of a chain reaction with slow elements Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-D2-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of arachidonic acid, that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) through a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as reactive carbonyls. ==Clinical development Friedreich's ataxia === A double-blind comparator-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial for Friedreich's ataxia, sponsored by Retrotope and Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials.
