In 1949, he was deported from his native village to Beylagan city with his family (then the city was called Zhdanov). In 1955, he entered the State Art school named after Azim Azimzade. Later he worked in Beylagan as a teacher. From 1962 to 1965, he studied at All-Russian State University of Cinematography named after S.A.Gerasimov, in Moscow.

This was one of the first attempts of the writer, but despite that, it was full of appeals and freethinking ideas. \\"The last exhibit\\" (; 1961) and \\"A wedding sheep\\" works were also dedicated to the Great Patriotic War. \\"The last exhibit\\" narrative is a touching story about a poor mother who lost her son in the war. Now seeing in the museum her son's shirt, sewed by her, the mother feels pain, because custodians of the museum have yet looked after the exhibits and her lovely son's shirt is fully moth-eaten. The 1980s were the most productive years in Farman Karimzade's literary creativity.

Although the performance of the band showed some flaws, it mattered little to Oswald who simply carries on. Suddenly, the musicians decided to have a break inside the tavern, much to the rabbit's surprise. Oswald tries to follow them to that adult place, only to be pushed back out. Without a group to lead, the lonely Oswald wonders further on the street. He then notices a flock of birds on some powerlines, chirping and making various sounds. In no time the rabbit was elated, knowing he found something he could conduct as he starts swinging his hands. But the beautiful sight did not last long when a disturbed squirrel comes out of a post and pulls up a switch that electrocutes the birds. Somewhere within the area, a nurse tells her son to stay put in the stroller just before leaving. The boy isn't accustomed to being left alone, even for a few minutes, and therefore starts bawling. Oswald came by and decides to cheer up the child. The rabbit then picks up a discarded water pipe and plays it like a wind instrument. Various objects came to life and went dancing to Oswald's music, but the infant was less impressed. The nurse returns to the scene after several minutes. The naive nurse thought Oswald is disturbing the child with the sound, and therefore pounds the rabbit in the noggin. While Oswald remains dazed on the pavement, the boy, however, has become a delighted character and begins to giggle. ==References *The Bandmaster at the Big Cartoon Database * Category:1931 films Category:1931 animated films Category:1930s American animated films Category:American films Category:1930s animated short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films directed by Walter Lantz Category:Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:Animated films about animals Category:American animated short films ","title":"The Bandmaster (1931 film)"},{"id":"35250275","text":"Bridge End railway station served Bridgend in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland.

He has also performed at festivals with others such as B.B. King, John McLaughlin, Pat Metheny, Paco de Luc√≠a, John Williams, Tommy Emmanuel, and Tomatito. Tempered and precise, he is one of the most versatile guitarists and composers in Spain. ==Biography== Early work Gonz√°lez was born in Barcelona. In the 1980s he studied with A. F. Serra and Juan Trilla and won the Premio al Toque por Buler√≠as and first prize in the Certamen de Guitarra flamenca. His first steps as a professional guitarist were supporting Toti Soler, Feliu Gasull, and Ovidi Montllor. He then played in a group with classical guitarists Yoshimi Otani, Alex Garrob√©, and Xavier Coll. 1990s In 1990 he began working with El √öltimo de la Fila, playing Spanish guitar for the album Nuevo peque√±o cat√°logo de seres y estares. From there he would begin an important relationship with the band, accompanying them on their next albums and most of their concerts. In 1992 he formed the band Arrebato with flamenco singer Rafael Maya and released the album Rumba canalla (EMI). The style is close to the nuevo flamenco that appeared in the early 1990s. He then recorded on the albums Astronom√≠a razonable and La rebeli√≥n de los hombres rana with El √öltimo de la Fila. On both, Gonzalez played electric and Spanish guitars and accompanied the group on tour. The group was the top-selling act in Spain. Astronom√≠a razonable sold 600,000 copies during its 64-week chart run, and La rebeli√≥n de los hombres rana sold 228,000 copies. During the second half of the 1990s, Gonzalez released three albums featured cover versions of songs by the Eagles, John Lennon, Dire Straits, Supertramp, Simon and Garfunkel, and Eric Clapton, the Police, Bob Dylan, Queen, the Beatles and others. In early 1997, he recorded the album Callej√≥n del gato. The album contains thirteen instrumental songs, featuring sevillanas, tangos, and buler√≠as. Before returning to record another album with original compositions, Gonz√°lez made several collaborations, playing the Spanish guitar on Arena en los bolsillos (1998) with Manolo Garc√≠a and Cansiones (2000) with Joan Manuel Serrat. He also produced the debut albums of Tomasito and Zalamera. As a session musician has worked in hundreds of albums for artists such as Toti Soler, Feliu Gasull, Victoria de los √Ångeles, El √∫ltimo de la fila, Joan Manuel Serrat, Llu√≠s Llach, Maria del Mar Bonet, Manolo Garc√≠a, Paco Ortega, M√≥nica Molina, Angelo Branduardi, Roberto Alagna, Charles Aznavour. 2000s‚Äìpresent In 2001, Gonz√°lez returned to record a studio album, √Årboles nuevos. In parallel, co- produced and played the Spanish guitar in Nunca el Tiempo es Perdido (2001) and Para que no se duerman mis sentidos (2004) with Manolo Garc√≠a. The latter album earned him the nomination of the Premios de la M√∫sica for \\"Best Music Arranger\\", shared with Manolo and Nacho Lesko. He collaborated with Serrat in Versos en la boca (2003), in which he performed as a flamenco guitarist. In 2005 he re-recorded and reinterpreted the themes of his first solo album, Callej√≥n del gato under the Alia Records label, and in 2007 published a new album of original compositions called Verdades ocultas y medias mentiras, this time under the GTK label, with 10 instrumental tracks including a cover of Camar√≥n de la Isla's La leyenda del tiempo. Gonz√°lez, with Roger Blavia (drums) and Toni Terr√© (bass) then performed under the name Tr√≠o for a series of concerts in Europe. They released a DVD with the live recording in Vicenza, on October 28, 2006. There performances included traditional Spanish flamenco and classical and Spanish versions of classic international pop and rock. The trio performed at the International Kaunas Jazz Festival in Lithuania in October 2011. Recently he has performed with the double-bass player Horacio Fumero, formed Transversal, with Ra√∫l Rodriguez (Cuban tres), Trilok Gurtu (percussionist) and Guillem Aguilar (bass) and appeared on the French tenor Roberto Alagna‚Äôs new album.

Sky & Telescope magazine has called him, \\"among the most important figures shaping the last half century of amateur astronomy.\\" Johnson was born in 1923. He served as a military radar technician during World War II. In 1955, Johnson, an engineer, established Valor Electronics, which produced electronics for military and industrial use. Valor, which was headquartered in Gardena, California, had more than one hundred employees by the early 1960s. Johnson, who had a strong interest in amateur astronomy, originally created Celestron as the \\"Astro-Optical\\" division of Valor Electronics in 1960. Around 1960, Johnson had been looking for a telescope which could be used by his two sons, but found no such child- friendly models on the market at the time. Johnson built a new telescope, a 6-inch reflector telescope, by himself, in 1960. On July 28, 1962, he publicly unveiled a new invention, a portable -inch Cassegrain telescope, at the party held by the Los Angeles Astronomical Society on Mount Pinos. The new transportable telescope proved so groundbreaking that Johnson's invention was featured on the cover of a 1963 issue of Sky & Telescope. Johnson's interest in telescopes soon became a full-fledged business. Johnson's new company, Celestron, which descended from the \\"Astro-Optical\\" division of Valor Electronics, soon began selling more sophisticated Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescopes in models ranging from just 4 inches to 22 inches. However, the Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope proved difficult to mass-produce because the models needed Schmidt corrector plate, an advanced aspheric lens, which could be hard to manufacture. To solve this production problem, Johnson and the company's engineers invented a new type of telescope, the Celestron 8, in 1970. The Celestron 8 was more compact, affordable and easier to manufacture than traditional telescopes, like the Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain. Johnson's new telescope proved very popular in the amateur astronomy and educational industries, allowing the hobby to rapidly expand and reach more consumers. Johnson sold Celestron in 1980. Johnson was awarded the David Richardson Medal from the Optical Society of America in 1978, the Bruce Blair Medal from the Western Amateur Astronomers in 1993, and the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Small Telescope & Astronomical Society in 2009. Tom Johnson died at 5 a.m. PST on March 13, 2012, at the age of 89. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American electronics engineers Category:American astronomers Category:Amateur astronomers Category:American technology company founders Category:American company founders Category:American military personnel of World War II ","title":"Tom Johnson (astronomer)"},{"id":"35250341","text":"Adscita mannii is a moth of the family Zygaenidae.

Four years later, however, on 6 April 1872, the fort was, with the entire Dutch Gold Coast, again transferred to the United Kingdom, as per the Gold Coast treaty of 1871.

Montgomery, Joshua L. Bandfield, Scott K. Becker, JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 117, E03005, 12 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2011JE003970, accessed 28 March 2012 by Professor David R. Montgomery, Joshua L. Bandfield, and Scott K. Becker of the University of Washington. Evidence for sediment transport and erosion by wind is widespread over the surface of Mars today and was likely a major geomorphic process for much of its geological past. Although Martian surface features resembling aeolian dunes and ripples have been recognized since the Mariner and Viking missions, such features have been interpreted previously as active, indurated, or exhumed sedimentary forms. The authors reported evidence based on High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment images flown on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, that show some megaripple forms are eroded into cohesive substrate rather than being composed of loose granular material or fossilized dunes. Exposure of stratigraphic continuity within layered, cohesive material extending crest to trough through features with mean wavelengths of to demonstrates the primarily erosional formation of what they termed periodic bedrock ridges (PBRs). Thus, some surfaces on Mars previously considered to be covered by wind-deposited material are actually wind-carved exposures that offer insights into Martian history. PBRs lack the distinctive streamlining associated with wind-parallel yardangs, and comparison of PBR orientation to yardangs, megayardangs, and active sedimentary dunes in the same vicinity confirm that these PBRs formed transverse (across, or 90 degrees) to prevailing winds. Observed wavelengths of PBRs are comparable to those predicted by a simple model for erosional wavelengths of periodic transverse bed forms owing to the spacing of flow separations within the flow. Recognition of these transverse aeolian erosional forms brings up the question of how widespread Martian PBRs are and how many have been misinterpreted as active or indurated (fossilized) sedimentary dunes. PBRs are not known on Earth. Montgomery has said that there could be landforms on Earth that are somewhat similar to PBRs, but to date there's nothing exactly like it, largely because there are not many bedrock landscapes on Earth in which wind is the main erosion agent. \\"There are very few places ... where you have bedrock exposed at the surface where there isn't also water that is carving valleys, that's shaping the topography. Mars is a different planet, obviously, and the biggest difference is the lack of fluvial action, the lack of water working on the surface.\\"Geologists discover new class of landform - on Mars, Vince Stricherz, Seattle WA (SPX), MarsDaily.com, 23 March 2012, accessed 28 March 2012 ==References * WIND-CARVED TRANSVERSE EROSIONAL RIDGES ON MARS - Manuscript draft of JGR-P paper (includes images) * HiRISE images: ** megaripple forms - HiRISE image of the floor of Ius Chasma - browse version Category:Geology of Mars ","title":"Periodic Bedrock Ridges"},{"id":"35250415","text":"Allada Barbara Grenville-Wells (15 July 1920 ‚Äì 25 August 1998), known professionally as Barbara Mandell, was a British journalist, broadcaster, newsreader and travel writer. She became the United Kingdom's first female newsreader after she was recruited to present the Midday News on the newly launched Independent Television in 1955. ==Life and career== Mandell was born in London, England, but was raised in South Africa after her family relocated to that country in 1924. Her father was the deputy editor of South Africa's Rand Daily Mail and Mandell followed him into journalism, working for the same newspaper. She later worked for the South African Broadcasting Company as a radio news editor, but subsequently returned to the United Kingdom in the early 1950s after a brief stay in the United States. After working for the BBC's Television Newsreel as a script editor she joined ITV upon its launch in 1955, and was one of three people chosen to present its news bulletins. The independent broadcaster's news strand, ITN was keen to set itself apart from the rival BBC. For the first time news bulletins were written and read by onscreen presenters, as opposed to the BBC's then preferred method of showing news footage with a voiceover. Mandell was selected from 150 candidates along with former Olympic runner Christopher Chataway and journalist Robin Day to read news bulletins, and she presented the Midday News. Mandell was one of two female reporters to work for ITN in its early days (the other being Lynne Reid Banks), and helped to pioneer the use of so-called Vox pop reports in the United Kingdom ‚Äì whereby one conducts interviews with ordinary members of the public in the street. Although Mandell was the UK's first regular female television news presenter, her tenure lasted only a few months. By January 1956 ITV was experiencing financial difficulties, and the budget for its news strand was reduced, meaning the Midday News was dropped. However, Mandell continued to be seen on screen throughout the 1950s, usually fronting weekend news bulletins, and she was a regular reporter. Then later in her career she returned to scriptwriting, and ended her career as Chief Copyeditor of the weekday early evening News at 5.45 bulletin before retiring in 1980. Following her retirement she moved to Luxembourg with her partner where she wrote travel books. She later returned to England and died in Holsworthy, Devon in 1998. ==Personal life== She met Alan Mandell (better known as broadcaster Alan Dell) while working for SABC, and the couple were married in 1945. However, they were divorced a decade later. She later met ITN cameraman Martin Gray with whom she lived until his death in 1998. ==See also== *Nan Winton, the BBC's first female newsreader in 1960 *Geraldine McInerney, RT√â's first female newsreader in 1975 ==References== Category:1920 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Writers from London Category:British journalists Category:British television journalists Category:BBC newsreaders and journalists Category:ITN newsreaders and journalists Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Barbara Mandell"},{"id":"35250423","text":"Moyeni is a town in Uthukela District Municipality in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Okhahlamba Local Municipality ","title":"Moyeni"},{"id":"35250435","text":"No. 18 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit was formed on 27 October 1942 at RAF Church Lawford.

The Muslim Brotherhood had announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the constitution on 29 November 2012. The Constituent Assembly will be able to avoid its possible dissolution by voting on the constitution earlier than the release of a ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court on the assembly's legitimacy; the ruling was expected to occur on 2 December 2012. The court has postponed the verdict in response to protests. The Constituent Assembly approved the constitution on 29 November 2012; more than 16 hours were spent voting on its articles. In a 31 March to 4 April opinion poll Al Ahram opinion poll, 82.3 percent of the 1200 respondents said they wanted the constituent assembly reformed, to represent all political forces, while 17.7 percent expressed contentment with the current composition. The Supreme Constitutional Court is expected to continue proceedings on the legitimacy of the assembly on 3 February 2013. The lawsuits on the legitimacy of the assembly have been dismissed on 3 March 2013. The Administrative Judiciary Court dismissed more lawsuits on 28 May 2013. The High Constitutional Court ruled that the Constituent Assembly was unconstitutional on 2 June 2013; the Administrative Court is expected to eventually rule on the constitution. ==First Constituent Assembly== Egypt's first Constituent Assembly, elected by the Islamist-led parliament, was criticized by many observers due to the preponderance of Islamist members (66 out of 100) it contained: 38 out of the 50 parliamentary members of the constituent assembly were members of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (part of the Democratic Alliance) and of the salafi Al Nour Party (part of the Islamist Bloc). There were only 6 women and only 5 Copts (part of Egypt's Christian minority) out of 100 Members in the constituent assembly. Out of its 100 elected members, only 75 attend the assembly. Many of the liberal, leftist and social democratic parties like the Free Egyptians Party, the Socialist Popular Alliance, the Dignity Party, the Social Democrats, the Tagammo Party and the Freedom Egypt Party boycotted the election to determine the makeup of the Constituent Assembly because they saw it as an Islamist's attempt to strengthen their power. After the election in 2012, most of them also withdrew from the constituent assembly itself. The liberal New Wafd Party also participated in the boycott. The first Constituent Assembly was then dissolved when a court rendered it unconstitutional in April 2012. The Supreme Administrative Court had dissolved it in April for including members of parliament in its membership. The court said that according to the March 2011 Constitutional Decree, MPs were responsible for electing the Constituent Assembly, but could not elect themselves. On 10 April, Cairo's administrative court suspended the assembly, judging that the assembly was \\"unrepresentative\\" for involving too few women, young people and minority representatives. Liberals and secularists had filed a suit out of fear the constitutional panel could implement a strong role for Islamic religious law in the new constitution. == Second Constituent Assembly == An agreement to form a more balanced assembly was reached on 7 June 2012. 39 seats would be filled by Members of Parliament, six by judges, nine by law experts, one each by a member of the armed forces, the police and the justice ministry, 13 seats by unions, and 21 by public figures. Five seats would be filled by the Al- Azhar University, one of Sunni Islam's most important institutions, and four by the Coptic Orthodox Church. A satisfactory deal was thus reached between Islamist and non-Islamist parties over the membership ratio, but the non- Islamist figures accused their Islamist counterparts of breaking the deal and attempting to secure a voting majority of Islamists once again in the assembly. MPs then elected a second Assembly, but this one also included parliamentarians, which is why the Assembly faces another court case. The Constituent Assembly however has been given a second chance after the Supreme Administrative Court postponed on 26 June 2012 a decision on dissolving it to 4 September. It can conceivably now finish drafting the constitution before that date rendering a dissolution ruling moot. However, as per the supplementary constitutional decree released in June 2012 by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the Constituent Assembly still faces difficulty. The decree gives several parties, including the head of SCAF, the right to veto any clause the assembly drafts if it conflicts with the \\"goals of the revolution\\" or constitutional principles from Egypt's previous constitutions. If the assembly overturns the veto, the issue is referred to the Supreme Constitutional Court for deliberation. If the assembly does not finish drafting the constitution in time for the court date and is dissolved, then according to article 60 B of the decree, SCAF gets to appoint another assembly. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a lawsuit has been filed against the second assembly on the grounds that members of the parliament voted some of their own members into the body. Nathan J. Brown of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted: \\"Although that might sound normal and innocuous, the first assembly was disbanded on the basis of a similar argument.\\" A ruling on the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Administrative Court in Cairo was postponed until 9 October 2012 to allow the judges to look into documents regarding the case. The hearing was adjourned until 16 October. The Cairo Administrative Court would give its verdict on the legality of the Constituent Assembly on 23 October. The Supreme Administrative Court referred the lawsuit to the High Constitutional Court. This might give the Constituent Assembly enough time to finish drafting the constitution. Mohamed Morsi's constitutional declaration issued in November 2012 bars the Constituent Assembly from being dissolved by the judiciary.  Boycott  A number of parties have embraced Mohamed ElBaradei's and Hamdeen Sabbahi's calls for a boycott of the Constituent Assembly. The parties and organizations that have signed a statement calling for a boycott include \\"the Nasserist Party, Karama Party, the Constitution Party, the Egyptian Democratic Party, the Socialist Popular Alliance, the Free Egyptian Party, the pro-democracy Kefaya Movement, the Egyptian Socialist Party, and the Revolutionary Democratic Coalition\\". Mohamed Ghonim, the coordinator of Egyptian Popular Current and liberal Amr Hamzawi have also signed the statement calling for a boycott. A number of activists, public figures and politicians announced during a press conference on Wednesday 3 October 2012 that they do not recognize the constitution as it is currently being written by the Constituent Assembly and instead seek to draft a constitution that is built upon popular consensus. The name of the group is the Egyptian Constitutional Front.  Withdrawals  The constituent assembly had a number of groups and individuals withdrawing from it as of November 2012. Numerous church representatives withdrew from the Constituent Assembly on 17 November 2012. The church representatives that withdrew from the Constituent Assembly included Bishop Paula of Tanta of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Bishop Yohana Qalta, who is the Assistant to the Catholic Patriarch in Egypt and Safwat al-Bayadi, who is the head of the Anglican Communion in Egypt. The acting Coptic Pope \\"wanted to withdraw from the assembly to make sure the church's stand was known and that officials knew the Coptic Church would not allow such a narrow-minded constitution to be drafted with its name on it.\\" The New Wafd Party withdrew its representatives on 17 November 2012. Ahmed Maher, a member of the April 6 Youth Movement, withdrew on 18 November 2012. Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat, the leader of the Reform and Development Party, also withdrew on the same day.

He utilized many traditional designs in his projects. In this aspect, he is seen as a follower of the neoclassical architect Alexander Tamanian. He also borrowed from the architecture of Mesopotamia (Sumer, Babylon, and Assyria).Architecture + Design, 1988, vol. 5, p. 25 \\"Rafael Israelyan. He has developed links with the Armenian tradition by drawing upon its origins which are close to ancient Assyrian forms\\" However, his work is considered to be contemporary (modern).

The better known monument is located at Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin and was inaugurated on April 24, 1965. It features several crosses inspired by traditional khachkars and a sword and shield, symbolizing Armenian self-defense efforts during the genocide. The second memorial is located Yerevan's Erebuni District. The latter was sculpted by Ara Harutyunyan.

In 1972 the summer residence of the Catholicos of All Armenians, known as \\"Haykashen\\", was built in Byurakan according to Israyelian's design. Israyelian designed several Armenian churches both in Armenia and abroad. In Yerevan he designed reconstructions of two churches: St. Sargis and Saint John the Baptist. Both were completed after Israyelian's death. St. Sargis, which was entirely reconstructed, was completed in 1976. Architect Artsrun Galikyan further contributed to the design after Israyelian's death. The reconstruction of Saint John the Baptist church, designed by Israyelian, was completed in the 1980s. The reconstruction works were further developed by Baghdasar Arzoumanian and engineer Avetik Teknejian. Israyelian designed and co-designed three churches in the Armenian diaspora: Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Milan, Italy (1958), St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral in New York City (1968), and Surp Nerses Shnorhali Cathedral in Montevideo, Uruguay (1968). The church in Milan was co-designed with Armenian- American architect Zareh Sourian, while the church in Montevideo with Varazdat Harutyunyan.

John Dudley (November 1569 ‚Äì 1645), formally John Sutton otherwise Dudley, was the brother of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley and was briefly Member of the Parliament of England for Staffordshire.History of Parliament Online: 1558-1603 Members - DUDLEY, alias SUTTON, John (Author: J.E.M.) during the reign of Elizabeth I. ==Background and early life== John Dudley was the son of Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley. His mother was Jane Stanley, who was a daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby and the 4th Baron's second wife. John Dudley was their second son, born about two years after his brother Edward, who became the 5th Baron. He was baptised on 30 November 1569, so born shortly before that date. At the very early age of 11, he was sent to Lincoln College, Oxford. The 4th Baron was able to recover the family estates after they were obtained, as a result of debt, by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland a distant relative, and forfeited to the Crown on Northumberland's execution in 1553. However, he was unable to make progress with the huge outstanding debts. In order to ensure creditors were paid by his heir, his will earmarked the proceeds of his coalmines for 21 years to his creditors, who were also given prior claim over his wife and over John. When the 4th Baron died in 1586, John received only his father's best clothes and ¬£300, with an annuity to be paid by his brother, but no house or land. As late as 1592 John had never received his annuity. In about 1590 John married Elizabeth Whorwood, daughter of a Thomas Whorwood, a wealthy Staffordshire landowner and politician, apparently against the wishes of Edward, the head of the family. He settled at the Whorwood family seat, Compton Hallows, near Kinver, with his new wife. Thomas Whorwood received a large inheritance at that point and began to build a new family home at Stourton Castle. John is therefore referred to as \\"Hon. John Dudley of Compton Hallows\\", as it seems he and Elizabeth retained the old family home. Having no freehold property of his own, he was not entitled either to stand or to vote in parliamentary elections for the county. ==Parliamentary career== John Dudley's election to parliament came about as a result of the notorious Staffordshire election scandal of 1597.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1558-1603 - Staffordshire Baron Dudley prevailed on Whorwood, John's father-in-law, and at that time High Sheriff of Staffordshire, to conspire in the return of a false electoral indenture. He was placed, as John Sutton, first in order of precedence over Sir Christopher Blount, step-father of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Edward Littleton, another Essex client, who had clearly won a seat in the voice vote, was excluded altogether. John Dudley thus became knight of the shire or MP, although Littleton launched actions against him, his brother and Whorwood in the Star Chamber, the most feared instrument of Tudor government. John was protected by parliamentary privilege during the parliament and it assembled on 24 October 1597. However, he played no recorded part in its proceedings, making no speech and attending none of the committees consistent with being a Staffordshire county member. The parliament was dissolved, after little more than three months, on 9 February 1598, leaving Dudley exposed to investigation and punishment. By May Essex had him answering questions before the Privy Council. Lord Dudley's main motivation in standing his brother for election had been to spite Littleton's relatives in Worcestershire, particularly Gilbert Lyttelton, with whom he had several property disputes. Two of Lyttelton's sons, Stephen and John, attacked John Dudley in revenge for the electoral fraud, probably in June or July, and were referred by the Privy Council to the Worcestershire assizes. It is not known whether John Dudley himself was punished for his part in events, but he played no further part in public life, retiring to Compton. ==Marriage and family== John Dudley married Elizabeth Whorwood, daughter of Thomas Whorwood by 1590. They had one son, who predeceased them both, and four daughters, including;Henry Sydney Grazebrook, 'An Account of the Barons of Dudley', Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 9 (1880), p. 108. * Anne Dudley, married Edward Gibson, a son of Sir John Gibson of Welburn.Henry Sydney Grazebrook, 'An Account of the Barons of Dudley', Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 9 (1880), p. 108. * Elizabeth Dudley, said to have died before 1660.Henry Sydney Grazebrook, 'An Account of the Barons of Dudley', Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 9 (1880), p. 109.

In 1660 Anne Gibson's son Edward Gibson, a soldier who had served in Holland, claimed to be the heir of Baron Dudley.

It forms one part of the Fediverse, an interconnected and decentralized network of independently operated servers. ==Features== Friendica users can connect with others via their own Friendica server, but may also fully integrate contacts from other platforms including Twitter, Diaspora, Pump.io, StatusNet and more recently ActivityPub (Mastodon, Pleroma, Pixelfed...) into their 'newsfeed'. In addition to these two way connections, users can also use Friendica as a publishing platform to post content to WordPress, Tumblr and Libertree. Posting to Google+ was also supported until its shutdown. In addition, e-mail contacts and RSS feeds can be integrated. Because users are distributed across many servers, their \\"addresses\\" consist of a username, the \\"@\\" symbol, and the domain name of the Friendica instance in the same manner email addresses are formed. Most functionality from major microblogging and social networking platforms are also available in Friendica, for example tagging users and groups via \\"@ mentions\\", direct messages, hashtags, photo albums, \\"likes\\", \\"dislikes\\", comments and reshares of publicly visible posts. Published items can be edited and updated across the network. Comprehensive settings for privacy and the public visibility of posts allow users to regulate who can read which contributions or see specific information about the user. Users can also create multiple profiles, allowing different groups of people (such as friends, or work mates) to see a different profile entirely when viewing the same page. User accounts can be downloaded or deleted, and can be imported to a different Friendica server if so required. Public forums can be created under different accounts, which can be switched between if the accounts are registered with the same email address. Many extensions and themes exist for Friendica, including \\"connectors\\", which can be used to connect to the platforms mentioned above. However, for the sake of simplicity, a lot of new features are also created as extensions and later incorporated into the \\"core\\" of Friendica. == Development == There is no corporation behind Friendica. The developers work on a voluntary basis and the project is run informally, the platform itself is used for the communication between the developers. There are different forums within Friendica, such as \\"Friendica Developers\\" and \\"Friendica Support\\". The source code of Friendica is hosted on GitHub. == Installation == The developers aim to make installation of the software as simple as possible for technical laymen.

Payne [◊¥Bobbie◊¥] (born September 18, 1932) is a former infielder and reliever who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 118 lb, she batted and threw right-handed. A Shreveport native, Barbara Payne was the only girl born in the state of Louisiana to join the league in its twelve years history.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295 pp. Language: English. At age of 11 Payne was the youngest girl to play on the Shreveport Garmet softball team. She then joined the Elite Cleaners in 1949, when the AAGPBL rookie touring teams stopped in Shreveport for exhibition games. The Chicago Colleens and the Springfield Sallies traveled together over much of the eastern half of the United States playing games against each other to recruit new players. The tour gave these new recruits an opportunity to play and also gave the league the opportunity to develop new baseball talent around the country. The teams held a tryout at Shreveport and signed Payne up. She was assigned to the Springfield team and made her debut in her hometown before going on an exhausting tour of 22 states.1949 Springfield SalliesThe Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1950, Payne was allowed to graduate from high school a month early so that she could be able to join the Muskegon Lassies at the spring training camp. She was called ‚Ä≥pepper pot‚Ä≥ by her teammates, because she was not afraid to go after any ground ball. Although the 1950 season became a nightmare for her team, after registering the worst record in the league and a relocation during the midseason to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where it was renamed the Kalamazoo Lassies. Payne hit a .190 batting average in 100 games, playing mainly at shortstop, but she filled in at other infield positions and eventually was used as an emergency pitcher. Payne opened 1951 with Kalamazoo, but was sent to the Battle Creek Belles during the midseason and ended up playing with the Rockford Peaches during the postseason. She batted a combined .173 average in 85 games, while tying for eight in the league for the most triples (5). Rockford blanked the Grand Rapids in the first round in two games, but lost to the South Bend Blue Sox the final round three games to two. She went 0-for-5 in two playoff appearances.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 294pp. Language: English. In 1951 the league suffered its three- year attendance slide and began having financial difficulties. The Kenosha Comets and the Peoria Redwings were forced to fold after the season, leaving the league with six clubs. Some players, Payne among others, were seeing the beginning of the end and they were cautious. Many of them made their move to others leagues and others opted to retire. Then, she took up a career as a radiology technician that would take her to work for a government office for 40 years. After retiring in 1992, she embarked on a career as a golfer that led her to get a number of local titles to her credit. Finally, the league folded at the end of the 1954 season. It was not until 37 years after her stint in the AAGPBL that Payne became a notoriety. In the early 1980s, a group of former members of the league led by June Peppas created the AAGPBL Players Association and lobbied to have the circuit recognized in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York. After that, she attended the league reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display at the Hall, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Yet it was not really a well known fact until 1992, when filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her film A League of Their Own, which was a fictionalized account of activities during the first season of the league. This film brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league, while many of the real players began to earn a rebirth of celebrity over the years for coming.IMDb.com ‚Äì A League of Their Own (1992 film) At age , Barbara Payne currently resides in Surprise, Arizona.Intelius.com ‚Äì Barbara Payne report ==Career statistics== Batting { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!AB!!R!!H!!2B!!3B!!HR!!RBI!!SB!!TB!!BB!!SO!!BA!!OBP!!SLG -align=center  194  593  57  108  12  6  0  49  17  132  62  92  .182  .260  .226 } Fielding { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"9\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!PO!!A!!E!!TC!!DP!!FA -align=center  195  347  424  115  886  43  .879 } Note: Since the league counted the 1950 tour as exhibition games no official statistics were kept. ==Sources== Category:All-American Girls Professional Baseball League players Category:Baseball players from Louisiana Category:Sportspeople from Shreveport, Louisiana Category:1932 births Category:Living people ","title":"Barbara Payne"},{"id":"35250801","text":"Nematopogon sericinellus is a moth of the Adelidae family.

Built in the first half of the 19th century for the naval base which used to occupy the grounds, they have now been adapted for other use. They were listed in 1964. ==History== Battle between the frigate HMS Tartar and Danish gunboats The Gunboat Sheds owe their existence and name to the so- called gunboats which were built after the Danish naval fleet had been captured at the Holmen Naval Base by the Royal British Navy on 21 October 1807. The gunboats were used in the last stage of the English Wars, now known as the Gunboat War. The small gunboats were employed against the conventional Royal British Navy. Built to provide on-land protection for the gunboats when they were not in use, the sheds were mainly built in around 1830. Each shed could accommodate two gunboats. When the gunboats were replaced by more modern vessels, the sheds remained in use for storing motor boats and other smaller vessels. They were listed in 1964 but had fallen into a state of neglect by the time the Navy left Holmen in 1996. They were sold in 1998 and in 1999 to S√∏tofteg√•rd A/S and Keops A/S. The new owners undertook a thorough restoration and adapted the buildings for use as office space with the assistance of PLH Architects. On 18 August 2006 a fire destroyed five sheds in the middle of the row but they were subsequently rebuilt.

Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description Adults are active by day and are on wing from mid April to early May, flying around willows. ==Life cycle== The moths are univoltine (i.e. one generation a year) and visit the flowers of sallows, usually high up. In some years, they can be numerous and in other years, scarce or absent. The females lay their eggs on the catkins of sallows. On hatching, the larvae drop to the ground and feed on dead leaf litter from a flat, portable case built from leaf fragments. The case is an elongate-oval shape with each half made of several, roughly crescentic pieces of dead sallow leaves. The larvae feed from May onwards and can overwinter two or three times.

Like his father, he was educated at the University of Strasbourg. His Grand Tour led to England (from 1759 to 1766), and the Netherlands, France, and Germany. On 30 October 1766 Louis married at Schwarzburg Castle to Princess Wilhelmine of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1751‚Äì1780). The marriage was an unhappy one, and Wihelmine retreated to Hallberg Castle, where she raised their son: * Henry Louis (1768‚Äì1797) Outside his marriage, Louis fathered two illegitimate children with Baroness Amalie Frederike of Dorsberg, Frederika Louisa (1771), who married Fran√ßois Leclerc d'Alteville, and Louis Charles Philip (1774-1871). On 28 February 1787, he married her maidservant Katharina Kest (1757‚Äì1829). Since she was a commoner, Louis rose her to Countess of Ottweiler. From this morganatic marriage, he had seven other children, including his youngest son Adolph: * Louis Albert (1775‚Äì1784) * Charles Louis (1776‚Äì1799) * Louise (1778‚Äì1855) * Henry (1779‚Äì1781) * Louis (1785‚Äì1796) * Catherine (1786‚Äì1818) * Adolph Louis (1789‚Äì1812) In 1787, the Emperor legitimized their marriage. In 1789, Louis XVI of France conferred upon Katharina the title Duchess of Dillange. After his father's death in 1768, Louis took up the business of government in Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken. He largely continued his father's economic policies, but was increasingly subject to financial constraints, so that he had to mortgage the Lordsip of Jugenheim to the principality of Nassau-Usingen from 1769 until 1777. In 1770, he requested Emperor Joseph to appoint a Debt Commission. This commission was dissolved in 1782. Since his financial position was still tight, Louis moved his seat of government from the palace in Saarbr√ºcken to his smaller hunting lodges in the surrounding area. Despite his tight financial position, Louis was able to complete some construction projects. In 1769, he constructed the palace and garden on the . In 1775, he completed the by Friedrich Joachim Stengel, which his father had begun. He was an enlightened absolutist ruler. He issued new regulations for agriculture and forestry and reformed the school system. He also reformed the penal code and abolished torture. In 1793, his health was failing when he fled before the French Revolution to Aschaffenburg. He died there in exile, and was buried in the Evangelical St. Lawrence Church in Usingen. On 23 November 1995, his body was transferred to the Castle Church in Saarbr√ºcken. == Ancestors  References == * Albert Ruppersberg: Geschichte der Grafschaft Saarbr√ºcken,vol. 2, Saarbr√ºcken, 2nd ed., 1910 (reprinted: St. Ingbert, 1979), p. 295-372 == External links == * The funeral of Prince Louis of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken * Louis of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken in the Saarland biographies Category:Princes of Nassau Category:People from Saarbr√ºcken Category:House of Nassau Category:1745 births Category:1794 deaths Category:18th-century German people ","title":"Louis, Prince of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken"},{"id":"35251197","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" + National Camogie League 1980 ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Championship Details - Dates colspan=\\"2\\" - Competitors colspan=\\"2\\" - Sponsor colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\" National Camogie League winners - Winners colspan=\\"2\\" Kilkenny (2nd title) - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" Bridie McGarry - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  National Camogie League Runners-up - Runners-up colspan=\\"2\\" Tipperary - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - Matches played colspan=\\"2\\" } The 1980 National Camogie League, the second most important elite level inter- county competition in the women's team field sport of camogie was won by Kilkenny, who defeated Tipperary in the final, played at Roscrea. 978-1-908591-00-5National Camogie League on Camogie.ie ==Arrangements== Kilkenny defeated Limerick, Cork and Galway en route to the final.

The cause of the crash could never be determined with certainty, the flight recorder was not working at the time of the crash, but that it was most probably due to the flight crew being unaware of the aircraft's actual altitude during the final approach and allowing the aircraft to come below safe height when not in visual contact with the ground.

The album was originally planned as a companion to or even as part of a deluxe version of Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before (a greatest hits album released in September 2011); however, the release was pushed back to May 8, 2012, making it a standalone release. The twelve-track album contains ten never-before- released tracks, as well as two previously released rarities. The album was released by Rhino Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group which is also the parent company of Reprise Records. Reprise was Barenaked Ladies' record label from their first album, Gordon in 1992, through Everything to Everyone in 2003. As a result, Warner holds the rights to the band's recordings made during that period, notwithstanding the fact that the band has been independent since that time. ==Album contents== Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before contains 12 songs spanning 1992 to 2003. It contains four final studio recordings (B-sides not included on albums), three live recordings, three demos, an \\"outtake\\" and a remix. Two tracks (\\"One Week\\" (Pull's Break Remix) and \\"Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!\\") were previously released as B-sides on singles, and in other releases. \\"I Don't Get It Anymore\\" is the only final studio recording included for which the song was not later re-recorded and released on an album. \\"Second Best\\" appears on Everything To Everyone, and \\"Adrift\\", \\"Half A Heart\\" and \\"I Can, I Will, I Do\\" were subsequently re- recorded for Barenaked Ladies Are Me/Men. Much of the material on Stop Us comes from late in the band's Reprise period. Four of the tracks come from 2003's Everything to Everyone (their final Reprise album), two more come from the sessions for 2001's Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991-2001), and one track comes from the sessions of 2000's \\"Maroon\\". The remaining tracks include three live recordings from 1992 to 1994, a demo of The Old Apartment (final version released in 1996) and the \\"One Week\\" (Pull's Break Remix), (previously released in 1999). The early live recordings include \\"Same Thing\\" from 1992, a song later released (somewhat rewritten) on Born on a Pirate Ship in 1996; \\"Teenage Wasteland\\" from 1993, an original song of which only bootleg live recordings exist, and which is not known to have ever been recorded in-studio; and \\"Shake Your Rump\\" from 1994, a cover of a Beastie Boys song which Barenaked Ladies performed during their 1994‚Äì95 tour. ==Release versions== Aside from the standard CD and digital releases, on May 1, 2012, an advertisement briefly appeared on the band's homepage for \\"The Deluxe Rarities Package\\" which included Stop Us and Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before in a special 2-disc tall package which also displays two souvenir BNL guitar picks.

The logarithmic behavior of the circuit is its main differentiator in comparison with digital- to-analog converters in general, and traditional R-2R Ladder networks specifically. Logarithmic attenuation is desired in situations where a large dynamic range needs to be handled. The circuit described in this article is applied in audio devices, since human perception of sound level is properly expressed on a logarithmic scale. == Logarithmic input/output behavior == As in digital-to-analog converters, a binary word is applied to the ladder network, whose N bits are treated as representing an integer value according to the relation: :\\\\mathrm{CodeValue} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N s_i \\\\cdot 2^{i-1} where s_i represents a value 0 or 1 depending on the state of the ith switch. For a conventional DAC or R-2R network, the output signal value (its voltage) would be: :V_{out} = a \\\\cdot (\\\\mathrm{CodeValue} + b ) \\\\cdot V_{in} where a and b are design constants and where V_{in} typically is a constant reference voltage. (DA-converters that are designed to handle a variable input voltage are termed multiplying DAC.) In contrast, the logarithmic ladder network discussed in this article creates a behavior as: :\\\\log (V_{out} / V_{in}) = a \\\\cdot (\\\\mathrm{CodeValue} + b ) where V_{in} is a variable input signal. == Circuit implementation == Circuit diagram This example circuit is composed of 4 stages, numbered 1 to 4, and an additional leading Rsource and trailing Rload. Each stage i has a designed input-to-output voltage attenuation ratioi as: :Ratio_i = \\\\text{if}\\\\; sw_i \\\\;\\\\text{then}\\\\; \\\\alpha^{2^{i-1}} \\\\;\\\\text{else}\\\\; 1 For logarithmic scaled attenuators, it is common practice to express their attenuation in decibels: :dB(Ratio_i) = 20 \\\\log_{10} \\\\alpha^{2^{i-1}} = 2^{i-1} \\\\cdot 20 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} \\\\alpha for i = 1 .. N and sw_i = 1 This reveals a basic property: dB(Ratio_{i+1}) = 2 \\\\cdot dB(Ratio_i) To show that this Ratio_i satisfies the overall intention: :\\\\log (V_{out}/V_{in}) = \\\\log (\\\\prod_{i=1}^N Ratio_i) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\log (Ratio_i) = a \\\\cdot (CodeValue + b ) :for b = 0 and a = \\\\log(\\\\alpha) The different stages 1 .. N should function independently of each other, as to obtain 2N different states with a composable behavior. To achieve an attenuation of each stage that is independent of its surrounding stages, either one of two design choices is to be implemented: constant input resistance or constant output resistance.  Constant input resistance  The input resistance of any stage shall be independent of its on/off switch position, and must be equal to Rload. This leads to: :\\\\begin{cases} R_{i,parr} = (R_{i,b} \\\\cdot R_{load}) / (R_{i,b} + R_{load}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{i,a} + R_{i,parr} = R_{load} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{i,parr} / (R_{i,a} + R_{i,parr}) = Ratio_i \\\\end{cases} With these equations, all resistor values of the circuit diagram follow easily after choosing values for N, \\\\alpha and Rload. (The value of Rsource does not influence the logarithmic behavior)  Constant output resistance  The output resistance of any stage shall be independent of its on/off switch position, and must be equal to Rsource. This leads to: :\\\\begin{cases} R_{i,ser} = R_{i,a} + R_{source} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{i,ser} \\\\cdot R_{i,b} / (R_{i,ser} + R_{i,b}) = R_{source} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{i,b} / (R_{i,ser} + R_{i,b}) = Ratio_i \\\\end{cases} Again, all resistor values of the circuit diagram follow easily after choosing values for N, \\\\alpha and Rsource. (The value of Rload does not influence the logarithmic behavior) == Circuit variations == * The circuit as depicted above, can also be applied in reverse direction. That correspondingly reverses the role of constant-input and constant-output resistance equations. * Since the stages do not influence each other's attenuation, the stage order can be chosen arbitrarily. Such reordering can have a significant effect on the input resistance of the constant output resistance attenuator and vice versa. == Background == R-2R ladder networks used for Digital-to-Analog conversion are rather old. A historic description is in a patent filed in 1955. Multiplying DA-converters with logarithmic behavior were not known for a long time after that. An initial approach was to map the logarithmic code to a much longer code word, which could be applied to the classical (linear) R-2R based DA-converter. Lengthening the codeword is needed in that approach to achieve sufficient dynamic range.

The film depicts a stylized, retro future in an unspecified year, in which genetically engineered organic androids, visually indistinguishable from humans, are manufactured by the Empathtek Corporation. The latest and most advanced model they have designed, soon to be released, is the PX-50. The plot focuses on a young Socionics Engineer named Ermus Daglek who has retired from Empathtek, but who has turned down the millions he is owed in residuals in exchange for the company donating him a defunct factory and asking no questions. He uses the factory to manufacture androids based on key individuals from the time in his life when he experienced his greatest heartbreak, and runs simulations to see if any other courses of action on his part could have produced an outcome with romantic success. ==Plot== Ermus Daglek (Jeff Sinasac), retired Empathtek Socionics Engineer, uses the defunct factory he's been given by the company in exchange for waiving the rights to his residuals, to manufacture androids based on his lost love, Candy Droober (Sarah Silverthorne), her father, Franklin Droober (Bill Poulin), her mother, Maureen Droober (Melissa Cline), and his romantic rival, Trace Mayter (Adam Buller). Deciding that the key moment where he lost any chance of becoming Candy's lover was a dinner party where the real life Trace Mayter humiliated Ermus in front of Candy and her family, he recreates Candy's dining room in a test lab, and goes about simulating the dinner several times, trying different conversational tactics and outfits. Frustrated that no attempt yields any result but Candy and Trace becoming lovers, he reprograms the Franklin android to murder the Trace android over dinner. Having vented his anger, Ermus repairs Trace and goes back to new simulations, unaware that the damage inflicted by Franklin has set off malfunctions in Trace, gradually allowing him to remember the prior simulations and realize what and who he is. Trace eventually goes berserk over dinner, beheading Franklin and damaging Maureen, before Candy and Ermus escape to the main laboratory. Ermus deactivates Candy and, armed with an Ion Disruptor (a ray gun designed to disable androids), goes in search of Trace elsewhere in the lab. After battling the headless Franklin android, he confronts Trace and forces him to deactivate himself. Ermus attempts to repair the androids and reprograms Candy to be a nymphomaniac. His attempted seduction of her fails, though, as, even though Ermus has wiped her memory banks, she retains preview files of Trace and is still in love with him. Enraged, Ermus chains up Trace before reactivating him. Trace tells Ermus that he's infiltrated the mainframe computer and broadcast his personality via wireless signal to all the androids. Ermus sets about to dismember him to sell for scrap, but Trace seals the laboratory, cuts off the oxygen supply and begins filling it with carbon monoxide. He agrees to let Ermus live if Ermus will unchain him and re-initiate his motor functions, but when Ermus does so, Trace destroys the mainframe before escaping the complex. Ermus is forced to call in Kray Facer (Todd Thomas Dark), an Empathtek android hunter, to retrieve Trace. The two go in search of Trace, but can't find him. Kray gives Ermus a revolver with explosive tipped bullets, instructing him to shoot Trace in the face if he sees him again. Ermus returns to the lab which, after the mainframe was destroyed, lost all of its security systems. He finds the doors unlocked and sees signs of an intruder within. When he goes to the deactivated Candy android, he finds her inactive form being raped by an apparent transient (Dean Tedesco). A fight ensues and Ermus winds up shooting the transient with one of the explosive shells. He finds the transient to be wearing a gold cross which was always worn by Trace. Not knowing that Trace had discarded the necklace after fleeing the lab, he comes to the idea that the transient must be Trace wearing a new facial mold. Ermus drags the transient back to the lab and attempts to remove his main processor chip by drilling into the transient's ear. He realizes his mistake when he finds only blood and brain matter within and, panicking, calls Kray again. Kray shows up but refuses to have anything to do with what is a blatant murder by Ermus. After Kray leaves, Ermus finds an empty photograph frame that used to contain a picture of the real Candy Droober, and realizes Trace has likely gone in search of his real-life counterpart's former wife and daughter. Ermus rides his scooter to New Jersey, where Candy lives with her daughter, Tristan. The real life Trace died in a car accident some time ago. Barging into their home, he doesn't find Trace, but Tristan lets slip that the android version was there previously and Ermus decides to wait for his return. When Trace does come back, Ermus shoots him in the face, as instructed. Trace says goodbye to his family before dying messily when his head explodes. Ermus returns to the laboratory, and wires up the corpse of the transient to take Trace's place at dinner. He recommences the simulations with his heavily damaged family. == Cast  Production == Principal photography started in early July 2008, and extended until late October 2008, mostly in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, with some limited filming also occurring in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

He was also a scriptwriter, and as such the three times TEFI laureate (1996 and 2004, twice). ==Biography== Anninsky was born in Rostov-on- Don, to Alexander Anninsky, a cossack from stanitsa Novo-Anninskaya, and Anna (Khana Zalmanovna) Alexandrova, born in Lyubech, Ukraine. Vladimir Nordwick Lev Anninsky's Last Interview. April 2016 [re-issued 6 November 2019]. Rodina Magazine His grandmother Bronislava Gershenovich was murdered in 1921 on a country road by members of the Chernigov-based Ivan Galaka's gang, for being Jewish. In his early years he read a lot, mostly Russian classics and history books, but also philosophers like Hegel and Kant. In 1939, as a five-year-old, he appeared on screen, cast as a kindergarten boy in the film The Foundling (–ü–æ–¥–∫–∏–¥—ã—à). Anninsky's father, originally a school teacher, later a Mosfilm producer, in 1941 went to War and was gone missing. As Anninsky learned years later, he got injured during the German aviation raid in mid-1942 near Polotsk, was captured and later shot dead by the Ukrainian polizei. Anninsky's mother taught chemistry in a technical college for the rest of her life. In 1956, still a student at the Moscow University philological faculty, Anninsky debuted as a literary critic with the analysis of Vladimir Dudintsev's novel Not by Bread Alone. After the graduation he was about to join the post- graduate courses, but this coincided with the events in Hungary. Since the uprising there has been instigated by this country's literary elite, the CPSU decided to \\"brush the ideology up\\" in the Soviet academic circles and Anninsky found out that to re-join the University he'll have to do some practical work first. He spent half a year in the Sovetsky Soyuz magazine, got fired, joined the Literaturnaya Gazeta (1957-1960), then Znamya magazine (1960-1967). In 1965 The Nut's Core, his first major collection of critical essays came out. Upon signing a letter supporting the dissident Andrey Sinyavsky, his former university tutor, he was evicted from Znamya. In 1968-1972 Anninsky worked in the Institute of Sociological research at the Academy of Science, then joined Druzhba Narodov magazine (1972-1991), starting a career of a freelancer which brought him the reputation of an insightful and original author whose essays were welcomed both in Oktyabr and Novy mir, the two magazines belonging to the competing ('patriots'/'liberals') factions. Anninsky has never joined the Soviet Communist Party. The 1970s saw the publication of several books by Anninsky, among them Betrothed to the Idea (on Nikolai Ostrovsky‚Äôs How the Steel Was Tempered, 1971) and Vasily Shukshin (1976).

A. dementjevi belongs to the Ornithuromorpha (the group containing modern birds but not enantiornithes), according to all published cladistic analyses. However, the exact position of the species within this group has been controversial. Most analyses have found it to be either an unresolved member of the Ornithurae, or a more primitive member of Ornithuromorpha. One 2006 study, for example, found it to be more primitive than Yanornis but more advanced than Hongshanornis, or even a member of the specific group containing both Yanornis and Yixianornis.You, Lamanna, Harris, Chiappe, O'Connor, Ji, Lu, Yuan, Li, Zhang, Lacovara, Dodson and Ji, (2006). \\"A nearly modern amphibious bird from the Early Cretaceous of Northwestern China\\".

The institution serves various peace projects as a stage. == John Rabe Award == Since 2009 the John Rabe Communication Centre annually awards the Peace Prize of John Rabe (John Rabe Award) to people who have worked in a special way on their own history, for international understanding and peace in the relationship with China. The first winner was the Japanese actor Teruyuki Kagawa: \\"The actor will be honoured, for having demonstrated the courage and the civil courage, for playing the role of HIH-Prince Asaka as a Japanese actor in the movie ‚ÄòJohn Rabe‚Äô.

He met Mark Selby in the first round and, despite taking the first two frames, Lu lost 3‚Äì5. Lu continued to show his talent in the next local ranking tournament, the 2012 China Open. He was awarded a wildcard to compete against Welsh player Jamie Jones, where Lu won 5‚Äì3. He produced a tremendous match by knocking out 2005 world snooker champion Shaun Murphy by 5‚Äì2, with two centuries. However, in the second round Ali Carter proved to be too tough for the Chinese player, winning 5‚Äì1. 2012-13 Season In the 2012/2013 season Lu was awarded a place in the wildcard round for five ranking events, losing at this stage in four of them. At the International Championship he beat Barry Pinches 6‚Äì5, before losing in the first round 6‚Äì4 to Ricky Walden. He played in all three of the new Asian Players Tour Championships, but could not advance beyond the third round in any of them to finish 45th on the Asian Order of Merit. 2013-14 Season In July 2013 he became the IBSF Under 21 World Champion, defeating Zhou Yuelong 9‚Äì4 in the final. He came through the wildcard round of the Wuxi Classic by beating Adam Duffy 5‚Äì3, before losing 5‚Äì1 to Matthew Stevens. His Under-21 title earned him a two-year main tour card starting with the 2014/2015 season. 2014-15 Season Lu failed to qualify for any ranking events besides the UK Championship and the Welsh Open for which all players on the tour gain automatic entry at the venue stage. Lu lost 6‚Äì2 to Stephen Maguire in the first round of the UK and 4‚Äì0 to Ricky Walden at the Welsh. He was placed world number 114 after his first season as a professional. 2015-16 Season It was a similar story in the 2015/2016 season as Lu only reached the UK Championship and Welsh Open, losing in the first round of both. He was relegated from the tour at the end of the season due to being ranked 101st in the world, well outside of the top 64. 2018-19 Season Lu won his place on the snooker tour back for the 2018/19 season at the second event of Q School in May 2018.http://www.worldsnooker.com/brown- earns-tour-return/ losing only 7 frames in six matches. He stated that he felt 'mentally ready' to resurrect his professional career after two years playing only on the Chinese tour. He reached his first last 16 in the Northern Ireland Open, beating Craig Steadman, Alan McManus and Hammad Miah, before losing to David Gilbert. He repeated the feat in next tournament, the UK Championship, where he beat Anthony McGil, Mark Joyce and Luca Brecel, before losing 6‚Äì5 to Tom Ford despite missing several chances to win.https://www.rtbf.be/sport/dossier/actu-des-athletes-belges/detail_luca- brecel-elimine-au-troisieme-tour-de-l-uk-championship?id=10088725 In February, Lu reached his first ranking quarter-final at the Indian Open, beating Robert Milkins, Liam Highfield, Yan Bingtao and Stuart Bingham, before losing to eventual champion Matt Selt. The win against Bingham featured an amazing final frame clearance including a fluked blue and a fortunate kiss on the black. In the following tournament, the Gibraltar Open, Lu went one better, beating three amateurs and professionals Shaun Murphy and Tian Pengfei before losing to defending champion Ryan Day. This semi-final lifted him inside the top 50 on the one-year ranking list. ==Performance and rankings timeline== {  style=\\"font-size:85%;\\" - efefef;\\" !

The reform that took place during the Gwangmu Era from 1897 to 1907 showed, in the long term, Korean potential for starting and continuing modernisation, even in the face of adversity. This sort of development was unseen until the Myon Chang-era of the 1960s and 70s. The Gwangmu reform of Emperor Gojong later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development by building infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern bureaucracy and military. ==Reforms== A cartoon during the Korean Empire that shows Yu Gil-jun, the former Yangban and a commoner using the same speech level with each other. Abolition of the status system Following the collapse of the Gabo government proclaiming the abolition of the status system, the loyalists‚Äô cabinet was formed in 1896. The new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One of these was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal social equality, which was implemented by the loyalists‚Äô cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894-1910 Although most Koreans by that time had surnames and even bongwan, a substantial number of cheonmin, which mostly consisted of serfs and slaves, and untouchables still did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters‚Äô surnames, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term Inmin (people), and later, Kukmin (citizen). The modernised army of the Korean Empire. Lifestyle During the Gwangmu period, Western-style official uniforms were introduced in Korea. At the start, the Korean Emperor had begun to wear Prussian-style royal attire along with Korean diplomats, who wore Western suits. In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for the Korean civil officials. Several years later, all Korean soldiers and policemen were required to wear Western style uniforms. Military In the military sphere, the Korean army as it existed in the early 1890s consisted of about 5,000 soldiers and was increased to an immense amount of 28,000 right before the Russo-Japanese War. Training by Russian officers beginning in 1896 led to the organization of a 1,000-strong royal bodyguard armed with Berdan rifles that served as the core of an improved army. From this core unit, soldiers were sometimes transferred to other units, which included five regiments of about 900 men each. Finance The building of Office of Crown Property under Imperial Household Ministry of the Korean Empire. In 1897, the cadastral survey project was launched by the Gwangmu government, aiming at modernizing the landownership system. In order to apply Western surveying methods, U.S. surveyors were hired. After the survey, a property title ‚ÄúJigye‚Äù, showing the exact dimension of the land, were supposed to be issued by the authorities concerned. That reform was closely involved to the reform of land tax system, which was conducted under the leadership of Yi Yong-ik, who also carried out the monetary reforms in Korea. The project was interrupted due to the Russo- Japanese war of 1904 and 1905, after having finished about two-thirds of the whole land. Infrastructures Seoul, capital city of the Korean Empire in 1905, showing contrast between tradition and modernity. A streetcar in Seoul, 1903. In that time, modern urban infrastructures were built by the Gwangmu government. In 1898, Gwangmu Emperor authorized the creation of a joint venture with American businessmen. In consequence, Hanseong Electric Company, operating a public electrical lighting network and an electric streetcar system was founded. Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company had an American connection as well. In 1902, six years after the first introduction of the telephone in Korea, the first long-distance public phone was installed. Industries During the Gwangmu period, the industrial promotion policy was also conducted by the Korean government. It gave support to found technical and industrial schools. In that time, along with modernized weaving factories which were established to meet demand for textiles on the domestic market, technological innovations in the field of weaving industry occurred in Korea. For instance, spinning and weaving machines were made for producing silk, so as to be substituted for high-cost machines from abroad.Jae-gon Cho The Industrial Promotion Policy and Commercial Structure of the Taehan Empire. Seoul: Jimoondang Publishing Company (2006) Education The building of Jejungwon (Severance) Hospital in 1904. After Gojong proclaimed a new education law, elementary schools were established by the government. Along with these modern public schools, a number of Western-style schools, consisting of elementary and/or secondary education section(s), were established by Western missionaries. During the Gwangmu period, modern secondary schools were opened by the Korean government as well, along with private secondary schools established by rich Korean civilians or Korean modern intellectuals. And several years later, modern higher education was first introduced to Korea: In 1904, the Jejungwon(Severance Hospital) in Seoul, added Severance Hospital Medical School and the attached School of Nursing. In 1905, Bosung College was established under Yi Yong-ik, Chief of the Imperial Treasury: the Commerce Department and the Law Department were the first two departments of the college. The Soongsil Academy, started at Pyongyang in 1897, had opened a college section in 1905 and was authorized as the Soongsil University by the Korean government in 1907.Abe, Hiroshi (1971), Higher Learning in Korea under Japanese Rule The Developing Economies, 9. Under the Education Ordinance of 1911 issued by Japanese Governor-General of Korea, however, these institutions lost college status. During the period of 1885-1910, a total of 796 schools, from elementary to college levels, were established and maintained by the Western missionaries. This is a significant number in that it comprises about thirty-five percent of the entire number of formal schools (2,250) in the Korean Empire.Insoo Sohn, History of Korean Education, 2 vols.

Health care system The modern health care system in Korea had been formed for about 30 years since opening the country in 1876. Most of the system had been achieved during the Gwangmu Reform period directed by the Emperor and his followers.D.W. Shin, S.I. Hwang (1996). The Historical Interpretation on the Formation of the Modern Health Care System in Late Choson. The new system consisted of three sectors: public health, medical care, and monitoring of private practitioners and drug-sellers. The Sanitary Board was set to provide systematic public health care such as vaccination, sanitation and quarantine and the police were created to enforce many sanitary affairs. Hospitals for Western medicine were established in the medical care sector. Licensing for herbal doctors and pharmacists was taken in order to control the quality of private practitioners. ==See also== * Korean Empire * Timeline of the Gwangmu Reform * Meiji Restoration, the similar process in neighboring Japan ==NotesReferences== *Dong-no Kim, John B.

The aim of these documents is to compile information on toponymic issues of a certain country, especially from the perspective of standardization of geographical names. ==Origin== At the Third United Nations Conference on the Standardization of geographical Names held in August/September 1977 at Athens (Greece), gathering and dissemination of toponymic information was discussed. The great variation in approaches from country to country led Josef Breu, who was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts (UNGEGN) on that very Conference, to initiate the compilation of more or less standardized Toponymic Guidelines. As a sample for these guidelines he elaborated Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography of his native Austria and presented them as Working Paper Nr. 5 at the Eighth Session of The UNGEGN, held in February/March 1979 at New York. This sample sticks to the table of contents which Breu had already outlined in 1977. ==UN resolutions promoting Toponymic Guidelines== The echo on Breus proposal was positive. In the years to come four resolutions were adopted in favour of the promotion of Toponymic Guidelines. At the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (Geneva, August/September 1982) resolution nr. 4 was drafted,Report of the Fourth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 29 concerning the Publication of Toponymic Guidelines for map and other editors: This resolution presents a checklist on the contents of Guidelines and recommends that the Toponymic Guidelines submitted by Austria should serve as a sample of format and contents. It also recommends that a correspondent should be appointed by the UNGEGN to coordinate the work of developing national Toponymic Guidelines and to maintain communication with national experts involved in their elaboration. At the 5th United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (Montreal, August 1987) another two resolutions were passed that concern Toponymic Guidelines: Resolution nr. 11 recommends that a clear typographical distinction should be made on national maps between toponyms and text items for other purposes. The methods of differentiations should be explained in the national Toponymic Guidelines.Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 37 Resolution nr. 14 of this Conference recommends that countries should be strongly encouraged to publish and keep up to date Toponymic Guidelines, and that the United Nations Secretariat should provide appropriate assistance for their publication and dissemination.Report of the Fifth United Nations Conference on The Standardization of Geographical Names, page 38 At the 6th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (New York, August/September 1992) resolution nr. 14 recommends Toponymic Guidelines in combined volumes, in at least one of the working languages of the United Nations, and that provision should be made to issue the Guidelines in the World Cartography bulletin. The title of the Toponymic Guidelines has been modified in 1982 and 1986. Whereas Breu in his sample used the title Toponymic Guidelines for International Cartography, the above-mentioned resolution nr. 4 of the 4th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names uses the title Toponymic guidelines for map and other editors.

It was developed in the 1930s, and is similar in arrangement to a contemporary series of German Junkers aircraft diesels. The engine was used extensively in US diesel electric submarines of the 1940s and 1950s, as backup power on most US nuclear submarines, as well as in other marine applications, stationary power generation, and briefly, locomotives. A slightly modified version, the 38ND 8-1/8, continues in service on Los Angeles-, Seawolf-, and Ohio-class nuclear submarines of the US Navy. The 38 8-1/8 has been in continuous production since its development in 1938, and is currently manufactured by a descendant of Fairbanks-Morse, FME, in Beloit, Wisconsin. == Specifications == alt=Fairbanks Morse cylinder liner at the Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston liner and water jacket. The 38 8-1/8 engines are inline diesel engines, with combustion occurring between two opposed pistons within a single cylinder liner. The engine has a bore of 8 1/8 in and the cylinder height is . The engine block is of dry block construction. They have been manufactured with between four and twelve cylinders, depending on application. Vertical force is transmitted from the opposed trunk style pistons to either an upper or lower crankshaft. The two crank shafts are geared together by a vertical drive shaft. Pistons are removed by either removing the top crankshaft, and removing from the top, or by removing through the lower crank case access doors. The lower crankshaft is timed 12 degrees before the upper crankshaft in order to expel exhaust gasses prior to the admittance of scavenging air. Fresh air cleanses the cylinders of remaining exhaust prior to the exhaust ports being covered by the rising lower piston. As this is a engine is 2-stroke, opposed-piston, unlike other two stroke engine, the engine has no cylinder head or mechanical valves (slots/ports in the cylinder liners provide incoming air and exhaust). The two camshafts on the engine provide timing for two injection pumps per cylinder. Porting allows exhaust gases to be expelled and scavenge air to be taken in by a positive air box pressure. Intake air is provided by an engine driven Roots blower or turbo-supercharger. ==Applications== North America World War II 38 8-1/8 diesel engines. Historically, the opposed-piston engine was used in U.S. diesel-electric submarines of World War II and the 1950s. Surviving diesel-electric submarines with these engines include , , , and . This engine was also used in surface ships, notably in the diesel-electric s and in the geared s. When the innovative but faulty \\"pancake\\" engines of the 1950s proved unworkable, they were replaced with World War II-style Fairbanks-Morse engines, and these remained standard on US diesel-powered submarines through the early 1960s. Variants of the 38 8-1/8 and other Fairbanks-Morse engines provided (and continue to provide) backup power on US nuclear submarines commissioned through the 1990s. During the 1940s and 1950s, Fairbanks-Morse attempted to market their opposed-piston powered line of diesel-electric locomotives, with limited success, leaving the market in 1963.Pinkepank(73) pages 323-324 The locomotive market share was eventually dominated by products from GM's Electro-Motive Division (EMD), American Locomotive Company (ALCO), and General Electric Transportation Systems (GE). Certain ice-breaking class vessels of the Canadian Coast Guard used Fairbanks Morse opposed piston engines in the operation of a diesel electric/gas-turbine electric operation. The former CCGS Norman McLeod Rogers, currently sailing under the Chilean flag as is one such example. Current marine Opposed-Piston applications include use as main propulsion engines and service generators. The USCG s use the 38 8-1/8 engine in a CODOG arrangement, where the diesel engine provides cruise propulsion, and a gas-turbine provides propulsion where high speeds are required. The Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston engine is also used as a stationary power generator engine, both in primary and standby duties. The and the , currently in service, use four as their primary source of electrical generation. Soviet Union The 38 8-1/8 was reverse-engineered in the USSR and used as a primary engine for railroad locomotives. The first Soviet mass-produced diesel locomotive, TE3, was powered by a 1470 kW (2000 hp) 2D100 engine, direct descendant of the marine 38 8-1/8 engine. The TE3 was produced in high numbers (up to 7600 units), and proved to be a reliable mainline freight locomotive. Later this engine evolved to the turbocharged 10D100, rated at 2200 kW (3000 hp). It was used as powerplant for later 2TE10L, 2TE10M, 2TE10U series locomotives. Unfortunately, 10D100 became infamous for its high rate of failures and low operating resource. Currently, plenty of TE10 locomotives remain in service in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Kazakhstan. But during rebuilding program they are often re-engined with more modern and fuel- efficient 4-stroke engines. ==Developments== The 38 8-1/8 has undergone further development to provide for better fuel efficiency and lessen emissions. In the 1990s, Fairbanks-Morse applied their \\"Enviro Design\\" technology to run the opposed piston engine as a dual diesel and natural gas engine. This system injects a small 'pilot' amount of diesel fuel to aid in the combustion of natural gas within the combustion chamber while being controlled with computerized electronics. ==See also== * FM H-12-44 ==References * Official Fairbanks Morse Website * Category:Marine diesel engines Category:Diesel locomotive engines Category:Two-stroke diesel engines Category:Opposed piston engines Category:Piston ported engines ","title":"Fairbanks Morse 38 8-1/8 diesel engine"},{"id":"35251986","text":"Ra√∫l Caneda P√©rez (born 21 January 1969) is a Spanish football coach.

Research and development has advanced so that smart low-speed diesel engines are being installed in new ships. ==Intelligent System== The concept of the intelligent engine revolves around the idea that the engine is thinking for itself. The brain of the system is an electronic control system that analyzes the condition of the engine and the operation of the engine‚Äôs system (The fuel injection, exhaust valve, cylinder lube oil and turbo charging system). Along with the control and timing needed to make the diesel run smoothly, the intelligent diesel goes beyond that by monitoring and evaluating the condition of the engine, based on engine conditions the smart system can actively protect the engine from damage due to overload, lack of maintenance and maladjustment. The intelligent engines‚Äô finite control gives the bridge the ability to manually adjust more variables than the current camshaft system. Along with manual controls, operators can specifically design programs that optimize fuel economy, emission, turbo output, allowing for high performance under different loads. File:Intelligent engine controls.png ==Replacing the Camshaft== The convenience of the camshaft is that not only does it keep the timing of the opening and closing valves and injecting fuel through its cams, it is also responsible for the mechanical force that is required to actually open and close the valves and power the port and helix fuel pump. The camshaftless intelligent system uses the rotation of the engine to power an axial piston pump that pressurizes a hydraulic oil system. The potential energy from the hydraulic pressure is directed by the electronically controlled servo system to drive InFI (Intelligent Fuel Injection) and InVA (Intelligent Valve Actuation) systems. ==Improving the Marine Diesel Engine== The Intelligent, Camshaftless, diesel engines offer several potential improvements for marine diesel main engines. Variable electronically controlled timing of fuel injection and exhaust valves for lower specific fuel consumption and better performance parameters. The electronic controls also offer lower RPM for manoeuvering, including better astern and crash stop performance. With the smarter InFI system the ship operator can more precisely control fuel consumption and improve emission characteristics. The highly integrated monitoring system allows for the potential of longer time between overhauls by equalizing the thermal load between cylinders. ==The Smart Diesel in Service== The Bow Cecil chemical tanker was one of the first ships built with an Intelligent main propulsion engine. The success of the MAN diesel 7S50ME-c engine in Bow Cecil, proved to the industry that intelligent diesel is a viable option. ==References== Category:Diesel engines ","title":"Intelligent Diesel Engine"},{"id":"35252013","text":"Skipskop is a town in Overberg District Municipality in the Western Cape province of South Africa.

The tower has angle buttresses, a stair turret at the northeast corner, a plain parapet, and a pyramidal roof. It has a three-light west window with Perpendicular tracery, a north doorway, and two-light bell openings with inscriptions above them. The windows on the sides of the church have two or three lights. In the chapel is a circular east window. The east window in the chancel has four lights with Perpendicular tracery. Inside the church is a two-bay arcade leading to the chapel. In the chancel is a sedilia and a piscina. The font stands under the tower and consists of a large bowl with buttressed sides. The stained glass in the windows was designed by Shrigley and Hunt of Lancaster. The two-manual pipe organ was made in about 1875 by Henry Ainscough and was originally in Barnacre Lodge. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Barnacre-with-Bonds *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) ==References== Citations Sources * * Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Diocese of Blackburn Category:Grade II listed churches in Lancashire Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Buildings and structures in the Borough of Wyre ","title":"All Saints Church, Barnacre"},{"id":"35252076","text":"Judge Dr. Helmut T√ºrk Helmut T√ºrk (born 24 April 1941 in Linz) is an Austrian jurist and a judge at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

The technique as applied to a group of TV satellites from a single operator was pioneered by SES with the Astra satellites at 19.2¬∞E.High Above - The untold story of Astra, Europe's leading satellite company Broadgate Publications April 2010 ==Satellite separation== Communications satellites' orbital positions are normally spaced apart along the geostationary orbit to provide for frequency reuse for both uplink and downlink transmissions. By separating adjacent satellites by a distance greater than the at-orbit beamwidth of the uplink antennas, the same carrier frequencies can be used to uplink to both satellites without interference. Similarly, a sufficient separation so that the beamwidth of the receiving dishes on the ground can distinguish one satellite from its neighbours, allows the same frequency spectrum to be used for adjacent satellite downlinks. Communications satellites are positioned in orbital 'slots' allocated under international treaty by the ITU and a separation between slots of 2¬∞ or 3¬∞ of orbital longitude is common.Luis Germ√°n Aponte Reyes, Shen Shi Tuan and Tan Zhan Zhong A Study for an Adaptive Anti-Jamming Antenna for the User Receiver of the GEO Satellite Communication System IACSIT Press, Singapore 2011 ==History of co-location== Co-location of two satellites has long been used on a temporary basis for the transfer of services from a retiring satellite to a replacement satellite, and for pairing of two partially malfunctioning satellites to operate as a single satellite.Dorsey, WW; Neyret, P; Lo, GJP; Ozkul, A. Colocation of geostationary communication satellites 11th Communication Satellite Systems Conference 1986 The planned co-location of two satellites was used by the TDF-1 and TDF-2 and TV-Sat 1 and TV-Sat 2 DBS satellites launched 1987-1990 to provide national DBS broadcasting to France and Germany. The first co-location of a group of satellites (reaching eight in number) was by SES with the Astra satellites at 19.2¬∞E. Astra 1A was launched in 1988 and followed by Astra 1B (1991), Astra 1C (1993), Astra 1D (1994), Astra 1E (1995), Astra 1F (1996), Astra 1G (1997), Astra 1H (1999),Krebs, Gunter Gunter‚Äôs Space Page Accessed March 28, 2012 all co-located at the same orbital slot of 19.2¬∞E (although Astra 1D was only co-located with all the other satellites at this position for short periods). Co-location is now employed at orbital slots across the geostationary orbit by many satellite operators, and is used by SES for multiple satellites at two of its Astra slots, 19.2¬∞E and 28.2¬∞E. ==Benefits of co-location== The greatest benefit of co-locating satellites at one orbital slot is that the capacity for traffic at that orbital position can be built-up in commercially manageable stages as demand dictates. In this way, when SES first brought DTH satellite TV to Europe it was not known what the demand for the services would be and therefore how many transponders would be required. The first satellite, Astra 1A, had just 16 transponders (for 16 analogue TV channels) and this capacity was doubled with the arrival of Astra 1B without any requirement for changes to viewers' equipment. Similarly, the use of multiple co-located satellites at more than one orbital position allows for an operator to vary the capacity allocation at each position by moving individual satellites between positions in orbit to reduce or increase the capacity at each position without the delays and costs associated with launching additional satellites.Bains, Geoff The Failsafe Family What Satellite & Digital TV April 2012 pp29 Another key benefit of co-location as exercised by SES is that of reliability of service, and it is a crucial defence against satellite failure. In the group of co-located Astra satellites at 19.2¬∞E, each craft has additional backup capacity to be used in the case of a partial or complete failure onboard another satellite in the cluster. In the event of a problem, spare transponders on one or more of the co-located craft can be switched in to take over, without interruption of the transmissions.SES/Astra online glossary item. Accessed August 29, 2017 ==How it works== Co-located satellites cannot actually be positioned at the same point on the geostationary satellite arc. In fact, they are just close enough together to appear to be at the same position so far as the beamwidth of the receiving dish is concerned. SES maintains its co-located satellites within an imaginary 150 km cube in space, centred on the notional orbital position. All geostationary satellites are influenced by gravity of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun, and tend to drift from their initial orbital position. They are maintained on-station with on-board thrusters fired under the control of the operations centre on the ground. With a group of co-located satellites, the task is complex as each satellite must be maintained within the 150 km box but kept at a suitable distance (typically over 5 km) from the other satellites in the group to avoid collision or mutual interference, at the same time expending the least possible fuel to prolong the life of the satellite.Eckstein, MC; Rajasingh, CK; Blumer, P Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics 1989 ==See also== * Geostationary Orbit * Communications satellite *SES S.A. *Astra (satellite) *High Above (book) ==References * OnAstra - Official consumers/viewers' site * SES - Official trade/industry site * SES fleet information and map Category:Satellites Category:Satellite broadcasting ","title":"Co-location (satellite)"},{"id":"35252242","text":"Swartkops is a town in Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

He created a series of images that were used on First World War recruitment posters in Great Britain. During the 1920s and 1930s he created a range of posters for the Schweppes advertising campaign and in 1921, he was contracted to work for Waddingtons, producing work that was used for posters and later a series of playing cards, these works being keenly sought after today. His bold Art Deco posters designed in the 1920s and 1930s for the London and North Eastern Railway are also well known. His wife, Gertrude Louisa Fannie Pitt, was his principal model and his work also included cigarette cards on which she appeared. Barribal also worked for various magazines, including the leading fashion journal Vogue, and between 1919 and 1938, he regularly exhibited his work.

He is known for his work as producer of The Last Detail (1973) starring Jack Nicholson and as writer of Rich and Famous (1981) the last film directed by George Cukor. ==Early life and education== Ayres was born in San Diego, California to US Navy seaman Bickings Ayres and Madeline Brown Ayres; he had one brother who died as a young man. Ayres received a scholarship to Yale University. During this time a number of his plays were produced. He dropped out a few months short of graduation to take up a career as a theatre writer in New York. ==Career== Film Ayres worked in New York in 1957 as a theatre writer and play doctor. Between writing jobs he worked in a zipper factory in the garment district and as a story analyst for the New York office of Columbia Pictures. In 1964, he was brought to Columbia's Hollywood studio as assistant to new studio chief, Mike Frankovich. During the next five years a number of years the studio released a number of successful films, including Lawrence of Arabia, A Man for All Seasons, Guess Whose Coming to Dinner, In Cold Blood, Georgie Girl, Oliver, To Sir With Love, and Funny Girl. When Frankovich left in 1971, Ayres was made creative head of the studio. In 1970, Ayres served as producer of The Model Shop directed by French author Jaques Demy and starring Anouk Aimee and Gary Lockwood, but was not credited because of his position as studio executive. At that time he tried unsuccessfully to secure financing for Demy's wife, Agnes Varda, to direct a script she had written, Peace and Love. Ayres next produced for Columbia the small film, Cisco Pike in 1972, starring Kris Kristofferson, Gene Hackman and Karen Black. In 1973, he produced The Last Detail, which was nominated for three Academy Awards: Jack Nicholson as actor, Robert Towne as screenwriter and Randy Quaid as supporting actor. The film won BAFTA's best picture award and Nicholson won best actor laurels at Cannes. Columbia executives considered the film \\"un-American\\", and Ayres took the production to Toronto.Easy Riders, Raging Bulls by Peter Biskind page 30, 1999 Bloomsbury edition Inc. In 1979, Ayres wrote the script for Foxes, starring Jodie Foster which he co-produced with David Puttnam.\\"Review: ‚ÄòFoxes‚Äô\\". Variety, December 31, 1979. He wrote the screenplay for Rich and Famous, which as released in 1981, starring starred Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen. He was awarded the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium. Television Ayres worked on a television adaptation of The Last Detail in 1981. The pilot was directed by Jackie Cooper, but it did not get picked up. Ayres wrote the shooting draft of the 1992 ABC film Stormy Weathers, starring Cybill Shepherd. For TNT Ayres wrote1993's Crazy in Love, starring Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand, Bill Pullman and Julian Sands.\\"Review/Television; A Family 'Paradise' Without Men\\". New York Times, By WALTER GOODMAN August 10, 1992 He received nominations for Artois, Golden Globe and CableAce awards. Ayres developed some material which was never produced, including a pilot for Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, a pilot for Paul Witt & Tony Thomas, a screenplay for Richard Dreyfuss, John Avildson and Mike Medavoy. He developed another original for David Field and Stephen Bach at United Artist; a long-form HBO script for Rick Rosenberg and Robert Christiansen on the life of Dorothy Parker. In 1995 Ayres wrote a four-hour mini-series for NBC on the life of Elizabeth Taylor, which was released as Destiny. The producer, Lester Persky, radically changed the script during production and Ayres elected to use a pseudonym on the produced work. ==Personal== Ayres married at 21 to Anne Bartlett Ayres. They have two children and two grandchildren. His marriage ended in 1971 having in great part to do with Ayres‚Äô growing acceptance of his preference for a gay life. He left Hollywood in 1971 to join a gay commune in the Sierras. He returned with a lover, Nick Kudla, and lived an openly gay lifestyle. Gerald Ayres' second marriage took place in Watertown New York on September 4, 2013, to Guy Briscoe Ayres whose nom de guerre as an artist is Nicola Filippo. ==Filmography== Writer Film *1981 Rich and Famous\\"Rich and Famous\\", *1980 Foxes Television *1995 Destiny (TV mini-series on the life of Elizabeth Taylor) written under the pseudonym of Burr Douglas *1992 Crazy in Love (TV movie) (teleplay) *1992 Stormy Weathers (TV movie) (teleplay) *1982 Rumpelstiltskin (1982) (teleplay) *1979 The Rockford Files, \\"The Return of the Black Shadow\\" aired 17 February 1979 Producer *1980 Foxes\\"Foxes\\".

The town is located in the Langkloof (Afrikaans for \\"long valley\\"). Twee Riviere (Afrikaans for \\"two rivers\\") takes its name from the Diep River (historically known as Klipdrif) and the Dwars River which arise in the Tsitsikamma Mountains to the south, flowing through the town. Like so many other rivers in the Langkloof, these modest streams head inland for a considerable distance, before joining larger watercourses and gradually turning coastward. The village of Twee Riviere is one of the earliest communities in the Langkloof, the original farm having been surveyed and registered under that name already on 14 February 1765. Originally a loan farm issued by the V.O.C. to Jacobus Scheepers, Twee Riviere was subsequently and briefly owned by Jacobus du Preez during the early 1780s, followed by Kritzinger and thereafter sold to Ockert Olivier in 1793. The Olivier family endures to this day, though during the 1800s and beyond holdings were increasingly also surrendered to families such as the Schreibers, Murrays, Ferreiras and others. Numerous descendants of these founding families formally acquired landholding by way of subdivision during the last century, and many have remained as citizens of the town. As the subdivision of land increased within the close, valley geography, the trend soon gave rise to a notable concentration of dwellings and households, which in time assumed the beginnings of richly varied Twee Riviere village, as it exists today. Today, 125 families (representing approximately 60 surnames) comprise this historic and scenic village. As home to many young families, Twee Riviere is partly characterized by a prevalence of homesteading families, many of whom favour a homeschooling education and pursuing lifestyles of hands-on endeavour, taking various forms. While agriculture, and apple production in particular, remains its economic backbone, Twee Riviere is also home to other notable features of interest, such as the campus grounds of the South African Institute for Heritage Science and Conservation, a formal institution of higher learning (postgraduate diploma level). Of further interest to horticulturists, landscapers and tree collectors, is the campus's Skrijwershoek Arboretum. The arboretum houses a tree collection of uncommon landscape oaks and other tree specimens, and is renowned for exceptional autumn colouration. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Kou-Kamma Local Municipality ","title":"Twee Riviere"},{"id":"35252424","text":"*List of secondary schools in Mauritius *List of tertiary institutions in Mauritius == See also == *Education in Mauritius Schools Mauritius Schools ","title":"List of schools in Mauritius"},{"id":"35252435","text":"The Offences within the Court Act 1541 (33 Hen 8 c 12) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

The ground reaction force vector represents the sum of all forces acting between a physical object and its supporting surface. Analysis of the center of pressure is common in studies on human postural control and gait. It is thought that changes in motor control may be reflected in changes in the center of pressure. In biomechanical studies, the effect of some experimental condition on movement execution will regularly be quantified by alterations in the center of pressure. The center of pressure is not a static outcome measure. For instance, during human walking, the center of pressure is near the heel at the time of heelstrike and moves anteriorly throughout the step, being located near the toes at toe-off. For this reason, analysis of the center of pressure will need to take into account the dynamic nature of the signal. In the scientific literature various methods for the analysis of center of pressure time series have been proposed. ==Measuring CoP== CoP measurements are commonly gathered through the use of a force plate. A force plate gathers data in the anterior-posterior direction (forward and backward), the medial-lateral direction (side-to-side) and the vertical direction, as well as moments about all 3 axes. Together, these can be used to calculate the position of the center of pressure relative to the origin of the force plate. ==Relationship to balance== CoP and center of gravity (CoG) are both related to balance in that they are dependent on the position of the body with respect to the supporting surface. Center of gravity is subject to change based on posture. Center of pressure is the location on the supporting surface where the resultant vertical force vector would act if it could be considered to have a single point of application. A shift of CoP is an indirect measure of postural sway and thus a measure of a person‚Äôs ability to maintain balance. All people would sway in the anterior-posterior direction (forward and backward) and the medial-lateral direction (side-to-side) when they are simply standing still. This comes as a result of small contractions of muscles in your body to maintain an upright position. An increase in sway is not necessarily an indicator of poorer balance so much as it is an indicator of decreased neuromuscular control, although it has been noted that postural sway is a precursor to a fall. ==NotesReferences== * Benda, B.J., Riley, P.O. and Krebs, D.E.

The series started in 2011 with the short story \\"Wool\\", which was later published together with four sequel novellas as a novel with the same name. Along with Wool, the series consists of Shift, Dust, three short stories and Wool: The Graphic Novel. ==Background== Howey first began the series in 2011, initially writing Wool as a stand-alone short story. He published the work through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing system, choosing to do so due to the freedom of self-publishing. After the series grew in popularity, he began to write more entries for it. Howey began soliciting international rights in 2012, and has since signed a deal for dramatic rights in Brazil. Film rights to the series were sold to 20th Century Fox; Lionsgate also expressed interest. Howey signed a print-only deal for around $500,000 with Simon & Schuster to distribute Wool to book retailers across the US and Canada. Howey retains full rights to continue distributing Wool online himself. ==Plot== The story of Wool takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth. Humanity clings to survival in the Silo, a subterranean city extending one hundred forty-four stories beneath the surface. The series initially follows the character of Holston, the sheriff of the Silo, with subsequent volumes focusing on the characters of Juliette, Jahns, and Marnes. An ongoing storyline of the series is the focus on the mystery behind the Silo and the secrets it holds. The mystery is eventually revealed at the end of book five; Shift, which encompasses books six through eight, comprise a prequel to the series. Book nine, Dust, pulls the storylines together. Several studies frame the story within the dystopian genre, since Howey includes several of the main features of that type of literature, i.e. a totalitarian rule, rebellion of the main characters or a planned separation between the manned areas and wild natural spaces. Wool The intro teaser for the book is: \\"If the lies don't kill you, the truth will.\\" Book 1 - Holston Wool initially follows the story of Holston, the Silo's sheriff. All residents of the Silo have been taught that the outside world is toxic and deadly, and anyone who expresses any desire to go outside is sent to clean the external sensors. Those who are sent outdoors this way inevitably clean the sensors as instructed, but they also inevitably die a few minutes later. Three years prior to the events of the story, Holston's wife became convinced that the outside world was actually livable and that the IT department (which runs the external sensors) had deceived the rest of the silo. She went to cleaning willingly, but apparently perished. Three years later, still grieving the loss of his wife, Holston also asks to go outside. He is given a protective suit and sent outside, but when he exits the silo he sees a healthy, vibrant world. Encouraged by this sight, he happily cleans the silo's external sensors and then starts to explore the environment. However, he is forced to remove his helmet when he runs out of air, and at that point he discovers that the world actually is toxic and his wife is dead. The suit's visor had been masking reality with a computer-generated image. Holston dies near his wife's abandoned body. These events serve as a catalyst for the remaining books. Book 2 - Proper Gauge A new sheriff is needed to replace the recently- deceased Holston. Mayor Jahns and Deputy Marnes embark on a trip to the silo's lowest region in order to interview Juliette, their top candidate for sheriff. Along the way they encounter various areas of the silo, including the mysterious IT department. Bernard, the head of IT, demands his own preferred candidate for sheriff but Jahns dismisses his concerns. Privately, Jahns also contemplates a relationship with Marnes. Jahns and Marnes meet Juliette in the Machinery zone, the lowest level of the silo. Juliette quickly proves herself to be responsible, stubborn and independent, which impresses Jahns. After expressing some hesitation, Juliette agrees to take the job. On the return trip, Jahns and Marnes privately begin a romantic relationship. Bernard is incensed to learn that Jahns has formally appointed Juliette to be the new sheriff, and is likewise angry with Marnes for supporting this decision. Soon afterward, Jahns falls ill. In her final moments, she realizes that she had consumed a fatal poison from Marnes's canteen. Marnes's canteen and hers were poisoned by Bernard. Meanwhile, Juliette completes an important maintenance project on the silo's primary generator, but soon receives the news of the mayor's sudden death. Books 3-5 The saga is continued in Casting Off and runs through The Stranded, as Juliette continues to explore the mysteries of the Silos, bringing her into contact with the head of IT and Lukas, a young astronomer and member of IT. The growing relationship between Lukas and Juliette serves as a backdrop for the remaining three novellas, as the mystery of the Silos is gradually revealed. Shift ;Book 6 - Legacy First Shift is a prequel to the story in the first five Wool novels, where the actions that led to the status quo of the world are explained through the eyes of Donald Keene, a young congressman, and Troy, a silo chief. ; ;Book 7 - Order Second Shift follows a few of the characters of Book 6 when they are woken from cold-sleep 100 years later to be consulted on some unresolved problems, as well as a young new character in silo 18 named Mission, where they are experiencing internal fighting which threatens their survival. ; ;Book 8 - Pact Third Shift brings a close to the prequel trilogy. It tells the story of the fall of Silo 17, and the transformation of Jimmy into Solo, as well as the continued story of Donald Keene in Silo 1. Dust ;Book 9 - Dust Dust is the third and final act in the Silo stories. It brings together the lives of Donald, Juliette and the other people in Silo 18, and the survivors from Silo 17. Short stories These are part of The Apocalypse Triptych collection of short stories. # In the Air from The End is Nigh # In the Mountains from The End is Now # In the Woods from The End Has Come ==Reception== A reviewer for Wired praised the omnibus, stating that it \\"clears away the grime of the past and reveals the new truth\\" about change in publishing. Fans have been inspired to write their own scenes, chapters and novels. ==Comic book adaptation== In July 2013, it was announced that Amazon's new comic book imprint Jet City Comics would be releasing a comic book adaptation of the series. Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray will adapt the story and Jimmy Broxton will create the artwork. On July 9, 2013, Howey released a preview of the comic book's cover on his blog. The graphic novel was published in August 2014. ==Film rights== On May 11, 2012, the film rights to the story were sold to 20th Century Fox; director Ridley Scott and Steve Zaillian are producing the film adaptation. In July 2018, AMC announced LaToya Morgan would be adapting Wool for the network as a series. ==Bibliography== #Wool (July 30, 2011) #Wool: Proper Gauge (November 30, 2011) #Wool: Casting Off (December 11, 2011) #Wool: The Unraveling (December 26, 2011) #Wool: The Stranded (January 25, 2012) #First Shift ‚Äî Legacy (April 14, 2012) #Second Shift ‚Äî Order (November 12, 2012) #Third Shift ‚Äî Pact (January 24, 2013) #Dust (August 17, 2013) *Wool Omnibus (2012, contains books 1-5) *Shift Omnibus (2013, contains books 6-8) *Gald√≥n Rodr√≠guez, √Ångel (2014). \\"Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios\\". √Ångulo Recto.

Chamberlain has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Fife since 2019. She was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Fife in the 2019 general election. She served as the Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Northern Ireland and International Development from January 2020 to September 2020. ==Early life and career== Born in Greenock, Inverclyde, Chamberlain was the older of two daughters. She studied at the University of Edinburgh, and was a member of the Edinburgh University Footlights, a student-run musical-theatre group, and performed in a show with the group at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The daughter of a police officer, after finishing university she joined the police force. During her twelve years as a police officer, Chamberlain worked for the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the Scottish Police College. After leaving the police, Chamberlain worked as a Communications Lecturer at Fife College, before becoming a Training Manager for the Scottish Resettlement Centre, a Ministry of Defence contractor in Rosyth, and then a Capability Manager for British multinational alcoholic beverages company, Diageo. While working in the private sector, Chamberlain was a Member of the Chartered Management Institute and an Associate Member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. In 2017, Chamberlain became a member of the board of the Camanachd Association, the world governing body of the Scottish sport of shinty, becoming the first female director of the Association. ==Political career== Chamberlain joined the Liberal Democrats after the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw the party lose 49 of its 57 MPs. After standing in an \\"unwinnable\\" seat (Fife Council, in which she finished fifth) in the 2017 Scottish local elections, Chamberlain was asked by Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie to consider putting herself forward to stand in the 2017 general election. Chamberlain stood as a paper candidate in Stirling finishing fourth in the constituency, winning 3.4% of the vote with a small increase in vote share and absolute votes as compared to the result in 2015. Chamberlain was selected as the prospective Parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrat target seat of North East Fife in June 2018, and in March 2019 was appointed as the Scottish Liberal Democrats' spokesperson for Constitutional Relations by Willie Rennie. Chamberlain stood for the party in the 2019 general election, comfortably overturning the Scottish National Party's slim two-vote majority in North East Fife by winning 1,316 more votes than the incumbent, Stephen Gethins. With the Liberal Democrat contingent in the UK Parliament reduced following the general election, Chamberlain was appointed tan party spokesperson in three areas: Political and Constitutional Reform; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; and International Development. In a wide-ranging maiden speech, Chamberlain spoke about her constituency, gender equality, the European Union, and electoral reform, while also paying tribute to her predecessors. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chamberlain expressed her belief that \\"civil liberties mustn‚Äôt be curtailed more than necessary, and the powers mustn‚Äôt be used disproportionately against minority communities\\", and called for vigilance \\"to ensure that those [emergency] powers are used properly and evenhandedly\\". Chamberlain wrote a letter calling for the resignation of Catherine Calderwood, the then Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, following reports that Calderwood had failed to follow coronavirus guidelines by visiting her second home, which was located in Chamberlain's constituency. In April 2020, following the decision to limit the number of MPs sitting in the House of Commons, Chamberlain led a group of opposition MPs (from Plaid Cymru, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Green Party of England and Wales) in calling for the establishment of a COVID-19 select committee. Chamberlain stated that the creation of such a committee was \\"the only way to guarantee smaller parties from across the political spectrum the opportunity to scrutinise and ask questions of Ministers at this critical time\\". Chamberlain was one of three Liberal Democrat MPs (alongside Jamie Stone and Wera Hobhouse) to endorse Layla Moran in her ultimately unsuccessful campaign to become leader of the party. ==Personal life== Though originally from Greenock, Chamberlain has lived in Fife since 2003. She is married, and has two children with her husband, Keith, who is a member of the Scottish National Party. Chamberlain has stated that her father encouraged her to get involved in politics, and recalled his words in an interview with The Herald in 2020: \\"When I found out you were getting involved in all this politics stuff I thought you were aff yer heid, but then I look at those eejits on the telly and I think you can be just as good as them\\". ==References External links == * - Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Fife constituencies Category:Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Scottish police officers Category:British women police officers Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:People from Greenock ","title":"Wendy Chamberlain"},{"id":"35252547","text":"Umbumbulu is a town in the EThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in the KwaZulu- Natal province of South Africa.

Working in the High Wavy range, he discovered a species of pit viper that is now named after him as Hutton's pit viper (Tropidolaemus huttoni ). He also collected a species of bat that was later named as Salim Ali's fruit bat (Latidens salimali ) after Indian ornithologist Salim Ali. Until his death is 2016, Hutton was the oldest living member of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). He helped set up butterfly gardens in Southeast Asia before settling in Queensland, Australia. ==Life and work== Hutton was born in Mysore on 8 April 1928. His father had served in World War I and came to South India to work with a large British Tea Estate in 1921. He was sent back to Britain at the age of eight but returned to India when the Second World War broke out. He then studied at a number of schools, completing his matriculation in 1944 from Bishop Cotton Boys' School in Bangalore. He then went to Lawrence Memorial Royal Military College in Ooty. At 16 he joined the Southern Provinces Mounted Rifles (AFI Cavalry) and because of his knowledge of Tamil was placed in the South Indian Labour Units with the Madras Sappers & Miners. After the war he joined the tea plantations at Karamallai Estate working under C.R.T. Congreve. He later moved to the High Wavy Mountains to work as an assistant with Tea Estates India Ltd. which was owned by Brooke Bonds. After meeting Salim Ali who was then conducting a bird survey, he joined the Bombay Natural History Society on 29 November 1945 and, until his death in 2016, was the oldest living member and only \\"Diamond\\" member. He moved to Uganda in 1952, then to Kenya and Papua New Guinea before settling in Queensland. He set up a butterfly farming venture in Papua New Guinea. In Queensland, Hutton established a farm near Gympie, a large part of which was later gazetted as the Mt Monty Nature Refuge. As well as operating his own farm, he helped establish one of Australia's first Landcare groups in 1988 and worked as the Gympie district's produce inspector for the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. He was also a leader in establishing one of Australia's first integrated catchment management organizations - the Mary River Catchment Planning Association. The Gympie and Districts Landcare Group centre and nursery is named in his honour. Hutton died in Maleny on 30 October 2016 from heart failure, two years after the death of his wife Gem, his partner of over 60 years. ==Discoveries== In 1948 Hutton collected a species of bat which had been preserved in the collection of the BNHS, misidentified as the common short-nosed fruit bat. The specimen was re-examined later by Kitti Thonglongya who recognised it as a new species that was named as Latidens salimali after Salim Ali. Salim Ali's fruit bat is considered as one of the rarest fruit bats in the world even entering the Guinness Book of World Records in 1993 for its rarity. In 1949 Malcolm Smith described a new species of viper from two specimens collected by Hutton. It is now called Hutton's pitviper Tropidolaemus huttoni (Smith, 1949)Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. (\\"Hutton\\", p. 128). and is one of the rarer species of pit vipers. First described from two juveniles found in the High Wavy Mountains, it has not been seen in the wild since. Earlier included in the genus Trimeresurus, it is now the only species of temple pit viper, genus Tropidolaemus, outside its main distribution range in the Malay Peninsula. Hutton also collected the rare long-haired brown hyena in Kenya. == References == Category:British naturalists Category:Australian people of British descent Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:Indian emigrants to Australia Category:People from Gympie Category:Bishop Cotton Boys' School alumni Category:1928 births Category:2016 deaths ","title":"Angus Finlay Hutton"},{"id":"35252660","text":"The Leases by Corporations Act 1541 (33 Hen 8 c 27) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

The ground floor is abandoned and the upper floors contain 10 flats, partially occupied by the Slovak National Theatre employees. Since 1963 the building is a culturally protected monument and it is one of the more striking examples of neo-renaissance architecture in Bratislava. Pharmacy Salvator is located across the street from the monumental St. Martin's Cathedral and it is part of most guided tours of the city. ==History of the pharmacy== In the 17th century archbishop of Esztergom Georg Lippay founded a pharmacy for his own personal use. In 1658 he donated the pharmacy to the Jesuit Order, where it resided in the building of the Jesuit Collegium on Kapitulsk√° Street No. 26. In 1735 it was auctioned and bought by pharmacist Karol Sessel, who renamed it to Pharmacy Salvator still keeping it in its location on Kapitulsk√° Street. In 1833 the pharmacy was moved into the Cs√°ky Palace at Pansk√° Street No. 33. All of the pharmaceutical tools and furniture from the year 1727 were also moved. In 1904 the owner of Pharmacy Salvator, pharmacist Rudolf Adler constructed a purpose-built house for the pharmacy on the neighboring narrow parcel and the pharmacy together with its furniture moved for the last time. ==History of the building== The building was constructed by the company Kittler a Gratzl (Kittler and Gratzl) in 1904. Compared to neighboring structures at that time the building was rather high, having five above ground floors. Having survived both World Wars, Pharmacy Salvator was nationalized in 1950 becoming the property of the Medika state company, the communist government continued to operate the pharmacy. In the mid-1990s the building was privatized and the City of Bratislava acquired half of the building. The state pharmacy operated according to a contract between the Bratislava City Magistrate and Faculty hospital of Bratislava (FN). In October 1995 FN cancelled the contract. At that time the rent was 250 SKK per meter squared per year and the pharmacy did not comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Health due to its size and humidity. In 1998 the Mayor of Bratislava Peter Kres√°nek as the statutory representative of the city rented the building for 9 years and 11.5 months (until 31 July 2008) to the company Spectrum Reality of Slovak-Monacan businessman Du≈°an Koll√°r, without the consent of the City Parliament. The rent was set at 250 SKK per meter squared per year, altogether 38,000 SKK per year for the whole building. Spectrum Reality immediately rented the building for 300,000 SKK per year to Slovak footballer ≈†tefan Maixner, who was the boyfriend of Eva Majsk√°, the daughter of businessman Jozef Majsk√Ω. Maixner in turn immediately rented the building for 400,000 SKK per year to an unknown company. There was a demand in the original contract between the city of Bratislava and Spectrum Reality which stipulated that only a pharmacy may be operated in the building. In 2001 the Bratislava City Magistrate was planning to operate a tea house in the premises with the sale of homeopathics. In 2002 Spectrum Reality started reconstructing the interior of the pharmacy and turning it into a caf√©. The unauthorized destruction of a culturally protected monument was stopped by the Monument Inspection () and the Construction Office of Old Town. In 2002, Mayor of Bratislava Jozef Moravƒç√≠k, publicly blamed his predecessor Peter Kres√°nek for the contract damaging the city. The contract could be voided only if the building was to be used for commercial activity other than a pharmacy operation. Since no pharmacy can operate in the building due to environmental reasons, Moravƒç√≠k suggested that the city has a weak position in any possible lawsuit and that it would probably lose at court. In 2006 a lawyer contacted the city of Bratislava and informed that the lawful heirs of Rudolf Adler (who died in Austria in 1954) are five citizens of Hungary who became owners of half of the building based on the decision of Regional Court Bratislava II. In 2007 the heirs decided to sell the building and even though the City of Bratislava had the right to buy before any other buyers, the City Council at its meeting in August 2007 declined. The whole building was valued at this time at 823,209 euro and the heirs demanded 1,493,726 euro for their half of the building. The building was afterwards sold to the company Spectrum Reality for an undisclosed amount of money. It has to be noted that with the legislative framework valid in Slovakia at that time (as well as until present) if at any moment the city becomes the sole owner of the building, it is by law mandated to sell the building to the people renting the flats as soon as they would officially demand the sale. ==History of the pharmaceutical furniture== For over a hundred years the building contained rare baroque pharmaceutical tools and furniture from the year 1727. These objects included a huge marble pharmaceutical desk supported by six lions, an antique cash register, gas chandelier, a set of pharmaceutical containers and various other furniture. The price of the collection was determined by a court-appointed expert in 1995 to be 1,700,000 SKK. The furniture together with the entire interior of the pharmacy including all drugs was sold by the Faculty hospital of Bratislava to pharmacist J√∫lia Seleck√° for this expert-determined price, the contract was signed in September 1995. For half a year she continued to operate the pharmacy before closing, not able to pay rent. She first tried to sell the furniture to the city, which did not satisfy her undisclosed offer. In 1996 J√∫lia Seleck√° sold the collection to the company Araver of Jaroslav Z√°vodsk√Ω, a businessman from Trenƒç√≠n. He had to move the furniture out of the building because then Mayor of Bratislava Peter Kres√°nek increased rent to 20,000 SKK per meter squared per year, altogether to 3,000,000 SKK per year, forcing him to move out of Bratislava. This amount is 80 times higher than the price later to be accepted by the city in the contract with Spectrum Reality. Jaroslav Z√°vodsk√Ω had the collection valued at 20,000,000 SKK and offered it to the Ministry of Culture for this amount, the Ministry however declined, citing lack of funds and other priorities. He then offered it to the City of Bratislava, which declined as well. The Ministry of Culture of Slovakia obtained the promise of then Mayor of Bratislava Jozef Moravƒç√≠k to buy back the collection on two separate occasions, in 1999 and in 2001. Both times Moravƒç√≠k claimed that he could not come to an agreement with the other party.http://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/najnovsie-spravy-z-bratislavy/kultura- skolstvo/minister-sa-obava-o-lekaren-u-salvatora.html?page_id=7040 In 2002, Moravƒç√≠k claimed he would do everything in his power to return the pharmaceutical furniture back into the historical building and that there was already a \\"certain agreement\\" with Jaroslav Z√°vodsk√Ω. ==Current state== The abandoned interior of the Pharmacy Salvator ground floor, as seen in 2012 Currently the non-residential part of the building is abandoned. The upper- floor flats are rented out to citizens for an unspecified time (e.g. indefinitely) or the time of renting is connected to employment in the Slovak National Theatre. As of 2010 nine flats were inhabited, one flat was empty. The collection of pharmaceutical tools and furniture remains in ownership of Jaroslav Z√°vodsk√Ω and the collection is inaccessible and locked in a deposit in Trenƒçianske Teplice. As a Slovak Cultural Monument, the collection cannot legally leave Slovakia. ==See also== * Red Crayfish Pharmacy * Old Town, Bratislava * Tourism in Slovakia ==References== Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1904 Category:Buildings and structures in Bratislava Category:Pharmacies of Slovakia ","title":"Pharmacy Salvator"},{"id":"35252696","text":"Kharman Sukhteh (, also Romanized as Kharman S≈´khteh; also known as Sukhta- Khirman and S≈´khteh Kharman) is a village in Eqbal-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

He is an active emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics , Heidelberg (Germany), research associate at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Boulder (Colorado), and was a Professor at the University of Heidelberg until his retirement in 2007. Eberhard Gr√ºn has a leading role in international cosmic dust science since over 30 years. == Education == Eberhard Gr√ºn studied Physics at the University of Heidelberg and received his degree in 1968. After his studies he did his PhD in the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, and he received his doctoral degree in 1970 from the University of Heidelberg. The topic of his thesis was \\"Mass Spectroscopy of Impact Induced Ions\\". From 1970 until 1974, he was a research assistant in the MPIK, developing dust detectors for spaceborne missions and doing research on impact ionization for these dust detectors. During this period, he spent 6 months as a visiting scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center focusing on data analysis of cosmic dust experiments, and 6 months as a visiting scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center, doing research on hypervelocity impact phenomena. In 1974, he became a senior research scientist at the MPIK. Eberhard Gr√ºn habilitated in physics in 1981 at the University of Heidelberg and he became a lecturer (\\"Privat-Dozent\\") at this same University in 1983. In 1981 he went back to the US for 6 months as a senior research associate of the US National Research Council (NRC), while working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There he concentrated on dust-magnetosphere interactions and on data analysis of the Voyager 2 spacecraft. This stay abroad was followed in 1982 by a 6-months stay at the Lunar and Planetary science Institute (LPI) in Houston, for studying dynamics of interplanetary dust. Since 1989 he is a professor at the University of Heidelberg. In 2000, he became researcher at the Hawaii institute of Geophysics and Planetology, at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu (until 2007), while remaining a senior research scientist at the MPIK. In 2004 Eberhard Gr√ºn was a visiting scientist (\\"Erskine Visitor\\") at the Physics and Astronomy department of the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand where he gave several lectures on the solar system, orbital dynamics, and the cosmos. In 2007 he became a research associate at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado in Boulder (USA). In 2007, he retired from the MPIK after having worked there for 37 years. He remains active in dust science as an emeritus at the MPIK, and as a research associate at LASP. == Scientific work == His research currently focuses on Lunar dust processes, development of space instrumentation (LDEX, DUNE, SARIM) and dust accelerator research. During his over 40 year long scientific career the main fields of work were: * Dust accelerator experiments to study impact processes and calibrating space instruments * Development for in situ space instrumentation for dynamical and chemical analysis of interplanetary and interstellar dust grains * In situ investigation of interplanetary and interstellar dust * Astronomical and in situ investigation of comets and cometary dust * Dynamics and chemistry of meteoroids * Dynamics of planetary rings From 1981 until his retirement in 2007, he guided over 100 undergraduate and 50 graduate students towards their diploma and PhD-degrees. He wrote more than 50 first-author papers and collaborated with other scientists on more than 300 papers. More than 10 of his publication were issued in the worldwide leading journals Nature or Science. His research has an unmatched impact on dust science in the solar system. Eberhard Gr√ºn was the Principal Investigator (PI) of dust instruments on many space missions like Helios 1 (1974), Helios 2 (1976), Galileo (1989), Ulysses (1990), and Cassini‚ÄìHuygens (1997). Moreover, he was a PI and Co- Investigator (Co-I) for numerous other observations and instruments. Among the most prominent are the dust instruments on board the Mars mission Nozomi (1998), ESA's first cometary mission Giotto (1985), and the IR photometer on ISO (1995). Currently he is active as Interdisciplinary Scientist for ESA's Rosetta mission to comet Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko where he is Co-I for several Instruments on the spacecraft. == Main discoveries == His work on detection techniques of dust in the solar system has led to a thorough understanding of the dust distribution of dust in the solar system. His scientific work is most known on the size distribution of interplanetary dust at 1 AU, which is a reference for many studies and known as the Gr√ºn distribution. Moreover, his dust detector on board the Ulysses space craft discovered the flow of interstellar dust (ISD) sweeping through the solar system and the hyper- velocity streams of nano-dust which are emitted from Jupiter and than couple to the solar magnetic field. Further important discoveries: * Predictions and detection of ISD focusing and defocusing cycles * Prediction of dust rings around Jupiter, and how they are fed from Jovian satellites * Propagation and evolution of dust emitted from comets * Prediction and detection of ‚Äûbeta meteoroids‚Äú * Leading developer of impact ionization dust detectors in space * Development of the ESA meteoroid model == Memberships == Eberhard Gr√ºn is affiliated to the following professional societies: * Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG, member of the executive board of subcommittee AEF, 1988‚Äì1993) * Astronomische Gesellschaft AG * American Geophysical Union AGU * American Astronomical Society AAS * Committee on Space Research COSPAR (interdisciplinary scientific commission B, secretary 1986-1990 and B.1 (chairman 1980-1984) * International Astronomical Union IAU == Honors == Prof. Dr. Gr√ºn received numerous prizes in recognition of his scientific work. Since 1976, he received several NASA and ESA awards. He was elected as a fellow of the American Geophysical Union, and as foreign associate of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1996, the asteroid 1981 EY20 was named after him \\"4240 Gr√ºn\\". Eberhard Gr√ºn was the recipient of the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize of the Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS) of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in 2002, for \\"outstanding contributions to the field of planetary science\\". The DPS mentions: \\"His career is an unbroken record of high quality work that has provided us with a good fraction of what we understand about the smallest bodies in the solar system.\\". In 2003 he received the David Robert Bates Medal from the European Geosciences Union (EGU) for his \\"Innovative experimental and wideranging scientific contributions to dust research throughout the heliosphere\\". In 2006 he received the Space Science award of the COSPAR for outstanding contributions to space science. Eberhard Gr√ºn received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in April 2011 for his leading role in dust science for over 30 years.

Initially inspired by Junimea leader Titu Maiorescu, he was later a dissident of Junimism, a Positivist and a supporter of literary realism. Politically, Xenopol also moved away from conservatism and was embraced by the liberal current, serving as editor of two liberal newspapers: Rom√¢nul and Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ. He had a successful career in electoral politics, which began within the National Liberal Party and later saw him joining the Conservative-Democratic Party. In 1912, he was Minister of Commerce, and helped create an Academy of Economic Studies. Xenopol was the author of two realistic novels criticizing the social environment of his day. His campaign for realism and his positive coverage of urban civilization pitted him against the conservative author Mihai Eminescu. Their violent debate of the 1880s is one of the highlights in Xenopol's career in cultural journalism. His passionate involvement in support of the liberal cause was another topic of controversy, and, on several occasions, he dueled with his colleagues in the press. Late in his life, N. Xenopol supported Romania's involvement in World War I alongside the Entente Powers. He died while carrying out his final mission, as Romania's first Ambassador to Japan. ==Biography== Early life The Xenopol brothers were of foreign origins: their father, known locally as Dimitrie (and allegedly born Xenopoulos), Dania-Ariana Moisa, \\" 'Ce citeau, cum citeau' locuitorii secolului 19\\", in Ramuri, Nr. 1/2008 was a British and Greek subject of the Protestant faith, who settled in the port of Gala»õi and converted to Romanian Orthodoxy.George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ √Æn prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986, p.441 According to various sources, including Junimea memoirist Iacob Negruzzi \\"CƒÉr»õi - Reviste. Amintiri de la Junimea de Iacob Negruzzi\\", in »òcoala NoastrƒÉ, Nr. 6/1940, p.259 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) and literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, Ionel Savitescu, \\"Memoriile »ôi coresponden»õa unui cƒÉrturar\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, January 2002 he may have been Greco-Jewish. Dimitrie opened the way for his son's political, literary and diplomatic career: he was a Dragoman for the Prussian mission to Moldavia, a tutor of the Rosetti family children, a boarding house manager, and ultimately a prison warden.Cuble»ôan, p.20 The Xenopols' mother, n√©e Vasiliu, was of Greco-Romanian origins. Nicolae was born in the Moldavian capital, Ia»ôi, as one of Dimitrie's six children: he had two brothers (Alexandru and Filip, the future architect) and three sisters.Vorovenci, p.652 He completed his secondary education in that city. By 1877, he was affiliated with Junimea, a conservative literary society founded by Maiorescu, Petre P. Carp, Iacob Negruzzi and other Moldavian men of letters. The club members responded to his quest for affirmation, and provided him with money to study abroad: after attending the University of Paris, he took his Doctor of Law diploma at the University of Li√®ge.Cuble»ôan, p.20-21; Vorovenci, p.652-653 It was during his training period that Xenopol met and befriended other young Romanian students, including the future dramatist and theater manager Alexandru Davila. Vera Molea, \\"Alexandru Davila »ôi revolta studen»õeascƒÉ din 13 martie 1906\\", in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Nr. 3/2009, p.9 The grant did not meet all of his needs. He worked during most of college, and, for a while, gave up, trying to enlist in the Romanian Land Forces, or concentrating on writing his novel Brazi »ôi putregai (\\"Fir Trees and Rot\\"). Xenopol made his debut as a novelist and a realist writer with the humorous work PƒÉsurile unui american √Æn Rom√¢nia (\\"The Griefs of an American in Romania\\"), serialized by Junimeas Convorbiri Literare journal from late 1879 to mid 1880.Cuble»ôan, p.20, 21-22 Brazi »ôi putregai first saw print as a series in the Junimist tribune Timpul (1880). By 1882, N. Xenopol had drifted away from Junimea, and, as the Junimists noted, may have lured Maiorescu's prot√©g√©, Ion Luca Caragiale, to join him in anti- Conservative politics.Ornea, I, p.94 He was at the time involved with the newspaper Rom√¢nul, a mouthpiece of left-wing liberalism, and became its main editor. Working under liberal chief C. A. Rosetti, he was seconded for a while by Constantin Bacalba»ôa, who came from the liberal gazette Telegraful. Constantin Bacalba»ôa, \\"Contrabandele bucure»ôtene\\", in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Nr. 8/2008, p.5 Xenopol's Rom√¢nul chronicles there pleaded for a realistic literature, capable of describing class conflict‚Äîfor Xenopol, the model to follow was a young novelist from Transylvania, Ioan Slavici.Alex Drace-Francis, The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity, I.B. Tauris, London, 2006, p.189. Another author highly praised by Xenopol was the Junimist Nicolae Gane: both Xenopol and his former patron Maiorescu believed that Gane's short story set the standard for a new literary language. Ilie TrƒÉilƒÉ, \\"Bibliograf√≠e\\", in Familia, Nr. 19/1882, p.224, 226 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Xenopol called for Slavici's novels to be studied by other writers, and then be used in creating an urban-themed, fully modern, literature. The pillar of Junimist poetics, Mihai Eminescu, responded to this argument with a virulent article, which identified Xenopol's theories with cosmopolitanism and alienation. Initially overwhelmed by Eminescu's tone, Xenopol replied with a mordant piece in Telegraful (April 1882), where the focus was on Eminescu's own ethnic origins.Cuble»ôan, p.21 According to literary historian Constantin Cuble»ôan: \\"Politically, [Xenopol] became noted as a Junimea adversary, writing unusually violent lampoons against its members, with coarse and demeaning language\\". PNL and Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ In short time, Xenopol affiliated with the National Liberal Party (PNL), whereas Junimea had become an inner faction of the Conservative group. For a while in 1884, he was Head of the Bucharest Public Library. \\"Sc√≠ri din Rom√¢n√≠a\\", in Familia, Nr. 28/1884, p.339 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In 1885, PNL Prime Minister Ion BrƒÉtianu made Xenopol his personal secretary.Cuble»ôan, p.21; Vorovenci, p.653 Also then, Xenopol welcomed the Belgian visitor √âmile Louis Victor de Laveleye, arranging him a meeting with C. A. Rosetti.√âmile Louis Victor de Laveleye, The Balkan Peninsula, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York City, 1887, p.342 (online copy at the University of Michigan Library) This period marked the start of another open conflict between Xenopol and the Junimists: the former took over as editor of the PNL mouthpiece Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ, and began publishing essays denouncing the backwardness of Junimist ideology. By October 1886, Xenopol even sided with Junimeas Marxist adversaries at Contemporanul, and allowed Marxist leader Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea to publish anti-Maiorescu pieces in Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ. He collected such articles, adding his own, into the brochure Contrazicerile d-lui T. Maiorescu (\\"Mr. T. Maiorescu's Contradictions\\").Ornea, II, p.319-320 During 1885, Xenopol also directed the antisemitic campaign against the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, with unsigned articles which may or may not have been written by Caragiale.»òerban Cioculescu, Caragialiana, Editura Eminescu, Bucharest, 1974, p.21. Another target for Xenopol's attacks was his former Rom√¢nul colleague C. Bacalba»ôa. The latter demanded satisfaction for claims made about him in Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ, and the two journalists dueled each other at the racecourse in BƒÉneasa. The understanding was that the loser would be the first to shed blood: Bacalba»ôa's blade touched Xenopol's finger, and Xenopol conceded defeat.

As a result, Xenopol was visited in his home by two Epoca men, Nicolae Filipescu and A. A. Bal»ô, who threatened him with physical harm; Xenopol pulled a gun on them, and the authorities were called in‚ÄîFilipescu and Bal»ô were received prison terms, but were pardoned 3 months into their sentences. Xenopol himself was still a passionate duelist, and, in one other instance, is said to have charged an adversary with a blade after their duel of pistols ended in a draw. N. Xenopol's activities reached into other fields. He and the Bukovinian composer Ciprian Porumbescu wrote a choral, Erna, published by the Armonia Music Society in 1885. \\"Salon. Teatru »ôi musicƒÉ\\", in Familia, Nr. 14/1885, p.167 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The same year, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum in Bucharest. His conference, published as a booklet later in the year, was a satire of Romanian politics, and carried the title Hat√Ærul (\\"The Favor\\"). \\"Salon. LiteraturƒÉ »ôi arte\\", in Familia, Nr. 16/1885, p.189 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) N. Xenopol married, in 1887, the daughter of BƒÉicoianu (Baycoiano), Prefect of Mehedin»õi County.Vorovenci, p.653 In 1891, the young author collected his satirical articles into a single tome, Cronici glume»õe (\\"Funny Chronicles\\"); PƒÉsurile unui american √Æn Rom√¢nia was first published as a volume the following year.Cuble»ôan, p.20, 21 Still a PNL man, Xenopol was first elected to the Assembly of Deputies during the 1895 suffrage, and preserved his seat for several mandates, before moving to a similar position in the Senate. He was a member of all successive Romanian legislatures until 1917. In parallel, N. Xenopol carried on with his cultural initiatives. In March 1895, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum on the topic of \\"crowd psychology\\", criticizing Scipio Sighele's ideas on the topic. \\"Salon. Dela Bucure»ôci\\", in Familia, Nr. 11/1895, p.129-130 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In 1898, he accepted an invitation from art patron Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, and joined the steering committee of his Ileana art society, which grouped independent painters reacting against academic art.Jacques Lassaigne, Theodor Enescu, »òtefan Luchian, Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1972, p.51. N. Xenopol made his return to journalism in 1904, when he founded a French-language magazine, Le Mouvement Economique (\\"The Economic Movement\\"), directed by him until 1915. By 1906, he had left the PNL and joined the Conservative Party. The Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino made Xenopol a member of its delegation, which negotiated a new trade agreement between the Kingdom of Romania and the French Republic. \\"D√©p√™ches t√©l√©graphiques\\", in Le Temps, December 27, 1906, p.1 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Well regarded by his superiors, he was later a Romanian negotiator of economic treaties with the Ottoman Empire and Austria- Hungary. PCD, »öarƒÉ NouƒÉ and ministerial term In January 1908, Xenopol affiliated with a Conservative splinter group, which became the Conservative- Democratic Party (PCD) and had Take Ionescu for leader.Ornea, I, p.371, 381; Vorovenci, p.653 Later that year, his analysis of land reform in Romania was published by the √ñsterreichische Rundschau in Austria-Hungary. \\"CronicƒÉ. »òtiri\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 5/1908, p.110 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Also then, Xenopol was made Officer of the French Republic's Legion of Honor. \\"Distinctions honorifiques\\", in La Revue Diplomatique, Nr. 54/1908, p.9 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) His conferencing on Romanian economic subjects earned him international exposure: in May 1910, he lectured in Paris, invited by the Revue G√©n√©rale des Sciences. \\"La Roumanie au point de vue economique\\", in Archives de la Chambre de Commerce de Roubaix, Vol. XXXXI (1910), p.62 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) In 1911, Xenopol joined his brother Alexandru and fellow critic Mihail Dragomirescu in editing the journal »öarƒÉ NouƒÉ (\\"New Country\\"). It hosted contributions by some acclaimed writers, such as I. Dragoslav, Victor Eftimiu, Leon Feraru, Corneliu Moldovan, Cincinat Pavelescu and Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu. DelaflƒÉm√¢nzi, \\"Revista revistelor\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 12/1912, p.4 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Although it received contributions from numerous Romanian academics and made special efforts to reach the Transylvanian public, \\"CƒÉr»õi »ôi reviste\\", in Cultura Cre»ôtinƒÉ, Nr. 19/1911, p.639 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) »öarƒÉ NouƒÉ eventually closed down in 1912. In parallel, his merits as an economist were recognized internationally, and he was made a member of France's Soci√©t√© d'Economie Politique. \\"Liste des membres par √©poque d'admission\\", in Annuaire de la Soci√©t√© d'Economie Politique, Vol. 95, 1936, p.69 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Nicolae and Alexandru Xenopol were both involved in nationalistic agitation for the cause of Romanians in Transylvania and other regions of Austria-Hungary. In 1911, some of their books had been censored in Transylvania, and were subject to confiscation by the Hungarian Gendarmes. \\"Un proces monstru contra literaturei rom√¢ne\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 63/1911, p.1 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The same year, in May, N. Xenopol was called upon as an expert witness in the trial between antisemitic academic A. C. Cuza and lawyer Emil Socor. Xenopol was supposed to testify as to whether Socor had been right to call Cuza a plagiarist, but he recused himself. V. T., \\"Coresponden»õe din Rom√¢nia. Scrisori din Ia»ôi\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 110/1911, p.5 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) N. Xenopol's political career peaked in 1912. That year, after the PNL and the PCD toppled the Conservative-Junimist Premier Petre P. Carp, and Maiorescu formed a governing alliance with Take Ionescu, Xenopol joined the administration. Ionescu, Constantin Dissescu, Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu and Xenopol, who took over the Ministry of Commerce, were the four PCD ministers in Maiorescu's cabinet. \\"Le Nouveau cabinet roumain\\", in La Jeune Turquie, Nr. 44/1912, p.3 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library); Ornea, I, p.381 His time in office saw the adoption of some major labor laws, whereby he structured the professions, regulated trade unions (including the Civil Servants' Chamber) and provided for workers' compensation. His major accomplishment was the establishment of an Academy of Economic Studies, independent from the university system. The irregular character and the staff appointments by government were rather controversial, and Xenopol's policies earned much criticism in the Romanian media of the 1910s.Vorovenci, p.653-655 A protectionist, Xenopol was interested in opening up new markets for Romanian products, but also favored France's economic interests over those of Germany.

Like other members of the PCD and PNL, and like his historian brother,Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\". Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn anii Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, p.106, 109, 118. he clamored his belief that Romania should renounce her neutrality and join the Entente nations. Their adversity was aimed at Austria-Hungary and the Central Powers, and their hope was that the Entente would help Romania to annex Transylvania. N. Xenopol was a guest speaker at the major pro-Entente rally of early October 1915, where Take Ionescu was also present. Constantin Stan, \\"Rom√¢nii americani √Æn anii neutralitƒÉ»õii Rom√¢niei (1914-1916)\\", in the University of Gala»õi Anale. Seria Istorie, Vol. III, 2004, p.106 He joined a trans-party irredentist group called Federa»õia UnionistƒÉ, presided upon by his former Conservative enemy Nicolae Filipescu, with Ionescu as Vice President.Goga, p.18-20; Francesco Guida, \\"Il compimento dallo stato nazionale romeno e l'Italia. Opinione pubblica e iniziative politico-diplomatiche\\", in Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento, IV/LXIX, October‚ÄìDecember 1982, p.444 (online copy at the Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano ) One of the regular members, Transylvanian poet-activist Octavian Goga, remembered Xenopol as \\"intelligent and industrious\\", but of dubious honesty.Goga, p.19 In 1916, Xenopol returned to publishing with a French-language study, La Richesse de la Roumanie (\\"Romania's Wealth\\"). It was in effect a condemnation of Romania's attachment to Germany and Austria-Hungary, beginning with the bilateral trade agreements of the 1870s. Xenopol contended that the imports from Austria-Hungary had destroyed branches of the Romanian economy, such as the shoe-making industry, and that Germany had sabotaged the Romanian export of cattle; he also argued that the Austrians were working to force Romania into becoming their vassal, as part of a Balkan Zollverein. Ren√© Moreux, \\"La Roumanie sous le joug austro-allemand\\", in Journal des Chambres de Commerce, Nr. 22/1916, p.318-319 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Filipescu's Federa»õia happily dissolved itself in September 1916, shortly after Romania sealed an agreement with the Entente. In his closing speech, Filipescu welcomed the declaration of war as the dawn of a Greater Romania.Goga, p.20 In 1917, as Romania made efforts to recover from a German invasion, Xenopol was dispatched to the Empire of Japan (a fellow Entente country). Although fatigued, he took the perilous journey through the Russian Empire, and, as a tribute to the war effort, refused to take money for his services.Vorovenci, p.655 He was Romania's first Ambassador to Tokyo, but died there, only months after taking over his post.Vianu, p.111Cuble»ôan, p.21; Vorovenci, p.655 One of his last efforts was helping a stranded group of Romanian Transylvanians sail for the US West Coast. In hindsight, literary historian Dan MƒÉnucƒÉ notes that Xenopol, like his World War II successor Gheorghe B√¢gulescu, was among the few Romanian diplomats who \\"also went earnestly about their duties in propagating our culture\\". Dan MƒÉnucƒÉ, \\"Eliade lusitanul (II)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, January 2007 ==Literary work== Views and polemics Already as a Junimea participant, Nicolae Xenopol cut a liberal and rebellious figure. Historian Alex Drace-Francis refers to him as a culture critic \\"from the liberal, progressive wing of Junimea\\". Among the Junimist intellectuals, Xenopol and George Panu stood out for being fully committed to the Positivism of Auguste Comte‚Äîthe others were more interested in German idealism, evolutionism or metaphysical naturalism.Ornea, I, p.5 Unlike the elitists and the misanthropists, he believed that \\"crowd psychology\\" was generally a constructive factor in the course of human civilization. Xenopol's ideas were also more permeated by new trends in literary theory‚Äîaccording to cultural historian Z. Ornea, he was \\"exasperated\\" by \\"the ossification of the Junimist aesthetic doctrine\\".Ornea, II, p.13 Constantin Cuble»ôan refers to Xenopol as not just a realist writer, but also \\"a fine analyst\\" of the realist current, citing his ideas on Ioan Slavici: \\"It is enough for a novel to be about national life, whatever the character types [...]. The essential is that those types should be truthful, and, as far as the events are unfolded, never stray from reality\\". Ornea suggests that Xenopol's rebellion against first-generation Junimism and Maiorescu was first evident in 1878, when the young man came into direct contact with contemporary French literature.Ornea, II, p.128-129 The resulting conflict with the Junimists was bitter and spiteful. Eminescu attacked in him the \\"superimposed stratum\\" of foreign intruders, calling him \\"Mr. N. Xenopoulos\\", and cautioning him that the \\"defects of one's race\\" were showing in Xenopol's praise of urban literature. Xenopol replied in kind. According to his account (also taken up by the liberal poet Alexandru Macedonski at Literatorul magazine), Eminescu was of Bulgarian origin, and therefore not of pure Romanian stock. Tudor Nedelcea, \\"Eminescu »ôi Macedonski\\", in Caiete Critice, Nr. 5-6-7/2009, p.135; Vianu, p.357 His own 1882 portrait of Mihai Eminescu (whom he called by his birth name, Eminovici) was purposefully grotesque and inflammatory, but, as Cuble»ôan notes, particularly colorful. It reads: \\"[Eminescu has] an odd head with four edges, such as Bucharesters have surely seen among Bulgarian laborers [...]. This individual wears purple trousers, a borrowed black frock and a large black hat, exactly like those of Germans who walk about with the street organs on their backs; he is always covered in mud and his face and hands carry countless traces of purple ink\\".Cuble»ôan, p.21; Liviu GrƒÉsoiu, \\"Din nou despre Eminescu\\", in Convorbiri Literare, January 2003 In reply, Eminescu stated that, regardless of the Slavic suffix in Eminovici, his own lineage was Moldavian and aristocratic. Mihai Cimpoi, \\" 'Evul miez' eminescian\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 2/2003 Author and psychologist Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th- century Romania: \\"The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But who do you think you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, to give yourself such superior airs?\\" Vlad Mixich, \\"Obiectivitate √Æns√ÆngeratƒÉ\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 401, October 2011 (republished by Rom√¢nia CulturalƒÉ ) Writings Literary historian Tudor Vianu writes that, in his beginnings, Xenopol was \\"a lyrical poet, swift in his rhymes\\". According to Cuble»ôan, that part of Xenopol's career should be dismissed, as his patriotic poetry, including a piece about Drago»ô VodƒÉ, is in general pastiche from better known writers. Instead, Xenopol's prose was directly inspired by what Vianu calls \\"the direct observation of local realities\\". Vianu classifies Xenopol and the Junimist Leon C. Negruzzi in the same realist subgroup of Junimist literature, but adds that Negruzzi had always been a romantic. Iohnson Blackwurst, the Yankee protagonist of PƒÉsurile unui american √Æn Rom√¢nia, is the voice through which the paradoxes of Romanian society are evidenced with sincere bemusement. Xenopol noted that his was a satire of Romanian life, intended to show how \\"the disgusting reality\\" of Romania is perceived in advanced \\"bourgeois\\" societies. As Vianu suggests, the ultimate inspiration for Xenopol's work was an 18th-century model, Montesquieu's Persian Letters. Written as a journalistic parody of Romantic travel literature, Iohnson Blackwurst's story begins with his naive quest to study the Romanians, Europe's \\"bravest people\\", and ends in bitter disappointment: during his visit to Ia»ôi, Blackwurst is humiliated, cheated and confused.Cuble»ôan, p.21-24 The work is sketchy, and the narrated episodes have morals that are largely illustrations of Xenopol's political views. The narrator believes that the Jewish community is parasitical and destructive, that the political class is endemically corrupt, and that the only productive class, on whose backs Romania herself was erected, are the peasants.Cuble»ôan, p.23 Building on the conclusions of various other critics, Cuble»ôan notes that, although PƒÉsurile... is incomplete as a novel, its biting wit remains interesting.Cuble»ôan, p.24 Philologist Ioana Costa suggests that Blackwurst's story is far from being a great novel itself, but that, as a \\"mixture of frivolity, localized satire [and] current events\\", it contains \\"the seeds of that classical literature that has given Convorbiri Literare its unmistakable imprint\\". \\"Ancheta revistei ‚Äì O sutƒÉ patruzeci de ani de Convorbiri Literare\\", in Convorbiri Literare, March 2007 Brazi »ôi putregai is seen by Cuble»ôan as more ambitious, more rigorous and more meticulous project, in effect \\"a faithful mirror of late 19th-century Romanian society\\", midway between the proto-realism of Nicolae Filimon and the complex narratives of Duiliu Zamfirescu or Mihail Sadoveanu.Cuble»ôan, p.22, 24-26 At its core, Brazi »ôi putregai is about the downfall of an aristocratic (boyar) family, unable to maintain its status in a modernized society.Cuble»ôan, p.22 The central character, Alecu Negradi, is a sternly patriarchal boyar who has rebuilt his family's fortune, and who attempts to break in his rebellious son Iorgu by forcing him to manage an isolated mountain estate. From this point on, Alecu Nagradi's entire universe falls apart: his son finds new ways to disobey him, his wife commits adultery, and his peasants rise up in revolt; Iorgu's sister, Maria, bequeathed to a much older man, elopes. She escapes the manor just as the buildings go up in flames, without realizing that the peasants have murdered her father.Cuble»ôan, p.24-26 The book is foremost noted for its complex descriptions of nature scenes and people interacting. According to an admirer, the historian and writer Nicolae Iorga, Xenopol portrays his characters in such detail as to \\"compete with the barbers\\".Cuble»ôan, p.26 However, Xenopol's use of antiquated Romanian has led some to suggest that Brazi »ôi putregai is no longer digestible. As early as 1925, novelist Cezar Petrescu concluded that the novel's atmosphere is \\"oldish and obsolete\\". Cezar Petrescu, \\"Idei, oameni & fapte. Un roman franco-rom√¢n\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 12-13/1925, p.383 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Writing in 1955, critic Teodor V√¢rgolici also assessed that Brazi »ôi putregai \\"is mostly of interest as a literary document\\" (a verdict seen by Cuble»ôan as \\"too drastic\\"). Xenopol's criticism of Romania's political system was also given expression in Hat√Ærul. According to Xenopol, favoritism and corruption were undermining the strength of Romanian society, since they detoured well-meaning projects, allowing one to interfere with the course of justice, or even to talk the Railway Company into servicing one's private residence. ==Legacy== Largely forgotten by the general public, Nicolae Xenopol was better remembered in professional circles: in 1929, he was dedicated a monograph, published by the Academy of Economic Studies, with contributions from Alexandru Averescu, Dimitrie Gusti, Take Ionescu, Mina Minovici, Gheorghe Ta»ôcƒÉ, Nicolae Vasilescu-Karpen etc.Vorovenci, p.652, 655 Ta»ôcƒÉ, Henri Cihoski and various Academy graduates collected money for a Xenopol statue, but the project was put on hold and only taken up by the Academy in 2011. Xenopol's dispute with Eminescu was revisited in a 2002 book by critic Alexandru Dobrescu: Detractorii lui Eminescu (\\"Eminescu's Detractors\\", second edition 2006).Bogdan Cre»õu, \\" 'Detractorii' lui Eminescu?\\", in Ziarul Financiar, May 27, 2010 Emilian Marcu, \\"Vitrina cƒÉr»õilor\\", in Convorbiri Literare, March 2007 Poet and Convorbiri Literare book critic Emilian Marcu notes: \\"[The detractors] are in fact intellectuals of great amplitude, who express opinions that are somewhat in contraction with those imposed officially. [Dobrescu's] book gives us a chance to rediscover [...] texts by authors who are at least honorable, over which, alas, the dust of oblivion has set. Their return into an intellectual circuit can only be beneficial for all those who truly wish to know more about the great Eminescu\\". Similarly, critic Bogdan Cre»õu notes that Dobrescu managed to overturn the \\"poltroonish\\" classification of Xenopol and others as \\"detractors\\": \\"the new anthology [is] an honest exercise in the reevaluation of an epoch that is much more nuanced and rich than the books of literary history or the dictionaries will have us know\\". Contrarily, other experts routinely list Xenopol as mainly an anti-Eminescian‚Äîhis has an entry among the \\"detractors of Eminescu\\" in SƒÉluc Horvat's dictionary of Eminescu exegetes (published in 2010). Viorel Mure»ôan, \\"Un dic»õionar de eminescologi (I)\\", in Caiete Silvane, June 2010 N.

Internationally recognized for his work with tuberculosis (TB), he was a medical advisor to the Royal Netherlands Tuberculosis Association, and was named director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) in 1979. He is known as the \\"father of modern TB epidemiology\\" and the \\"father of modern TB control\\". ==Personal life== Styblo was born in Czechoslovakia in 1921. Toward the end of World War II, he was imprisoned at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, where he contracted tuberculosis. After his recovery and release, Styblo entered Charles University in Prague. Obituaries say Styblo studied under Sir John Crofton at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1950s; the IUATLD says Crofton and Styblo worked together in Edinburgh in the early 50s. Crofton said in an interview that they met in 1960 while Styblo was still in Czechoslovakia. Styblo moved to the Netherlands after the unsuccessful Prague Spring, and became a Dutch citizen in 1971. He was still active when he died suddenly on 13 March 1998 at the age of 76; his wife, Lida, predeceased him. ==Career== Styblo's life's work was to develop, pioneer, and demonstrate the \\"proof of principle\\" for the strategy used to control TB by the World Bank and promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Called Directly Observed Therapy ‚Äì Short Course (DOTS), the TB therapy revolutionized the fight to control TB throughout the world. DOTS has been employed by 187 of the 193 members of WHO as of 2008. Styblo applied this methodology to the national TB control programs of Tanzania, Benin, Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and China; DOTS has been described as the \\"most effective means of controlling the current tuberculosis epidemic\\" and had been applied in over 90 countries as of 2001. Styblo was responsible for a guiding epidemiological rule of thumb for TB known as \\"Styblo's rule\\", which stated that \\"an annual incidence of 50 sputum-smear-positive TB cases in a population of 100,000 generates an annual risk of infection of 1%\\" (the rule is no longer used to estimate prevalence of TB). He was also responsible for instituting a systematic feedback method for analyzing outcomes of TB cases, known as the \\"cohort review\\" principle (CR), which was adopted in London and outside of the UK. ==Legacy== In a historical review of tuberculosis, Murray (2004) writes: > In the mid-1970s, a redoubtable Czech, Karel Styblo, harnessed the meager > resources of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease > and showed that, contrary to expert opinion, tuberculosis could be > controlled in extremely poor countries: beginning in Tanzania, one of the > poorest of them all. According to the World Health Organization: > The role of Dr Karel Styblo, IUAT Scientific Director, in the development of > these innovative programmes cannot be understated. He combined an > astonishing knowledge of the epidemiology of TB with a remarkable > understanding of the management principles of TB control and a tenacious > commitment to excellence in his work. His contribution to TB was immense, > and he will go down in history as the father of modern TB control and one of > the heroes of public health of the 20th century. The principles developed by > him in Africa were later adapted and promoted by WHO as DOTS, and adopted in > places as diverse as China, New York, and India. (see also the 2011 - 2015 > version) Of Styblo, Crofton said: > He was a quiet man, but wonderfully persistent and an enormous worker. > Several east African countries had asked for help with tuberculosis and > Styblo was sent there. He proved to have a genius for persuading governments > that tuberculosis was a major economic problem as well as a public health > concern. He was also able to convince them that they could handle diagnosis > and treatment through their routine health services, without special > tuberculosis clinics and services. Above all he stressed the importance of > monitoring patients throughout the course of treatment, as he had seen done > in Edinburgh. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, credits feedback from Styblo for leading Frieden to initiate programs that led to a marked reduction in tuberculosis in New York City. In addressing graduates at the Harvard School of Public Health in 2014, Frieden said that Styblo's query about how many patients the New York City program had cured shamed him into \\"implementing a program to track the outcomes of every single patient diagnosed\\", adding that the question \\"changed my life.\\" Frieden said that Styblo's \\"way of treating tuberculosis has saved millions of lives around the world\\". ==Recognition== Styblo was a recipient of a 1982 Gold Medal award of the Robert Koch Prizes. The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD) instituted the Karel Styblo Public Health Prize after his death, to recognize a \\"health worker (physician or lay-person) or a community organisation for contributions to tuberculosis control or lung health over a period of 10 years or more\\". ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:1921 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Czech pulmonologists ","title":"Karel Styblo"},{"id":"35252938","text":"The Feigned Recoveries Act 1542 (34 & 35 Hen 8 c 20) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

The institution consists of two entities; the Accreditation Council, which serves as the decision-making authority, and Accreditation Institution, which serves as the accreditation operator. The Council makes decisions on the accreditation of all higher education study programmes in Denmark, both new and existing. ==The Accreditation Council== right As the decision-making authority, the Council is an independent unit in the Accreditation Institution. The chairman and members of the Council must between them possess knowledge and experience on quality assurance, higher education, research and labour market conditions for graduates. The decisions of the Accreditation Council fall under the auspices of the following ministries: *Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Higher Education *Ministry of Culture (Denmark) The Council has nine members. At least one member must have international experience and one must be a student. Women and men are equally represented. The Council's decisions are made public in Danish on www.akkr.dk. ==Operators== The Council's decisions are based on recommendations from the two accreditation operators, the Accreditation Institution and EVA. Accreditation Institution The Accreditation Institution is the accreditation operator for bachelor, master's and professional master's programmes. The Accreditation Institution is an independent government institution made up of three secretariats and a management team. The Professional Secretariat facilitates the accreditation of all Danish university study programmes. This involves preparation of a rotation plan for the study programmes, setting-up and preparation of expert panels to assess the study programmes, organising university visits and authoring the concluding reports. The Council Secretariat prepares the Council's meetings and facilitates its contact and dialogue with stakeholders in different areas. These include the operators ACE Denmark and EVA as well as professional organisations, universities, student organisations, public authorities and the political environment, e.g. in the Danish Parliament. The Administrative Unit reports to the director and undertakes assignments relating to communication, law, finance and general service functions. EVA EVA is the accreditation operator of professional bachelor, academy profession and diploma programmes as well as the specialisation courses (adult education and continuing training). In addition, EVA undertakes evaluations, development activities and studies of early childhood education, primary and lower secondary education, upper secondary education, higher education and adult education. ==Accreditation method== The accreditation method involves a direct assessment of whether a study programme or an institution meets a number of predefined quality criteria. Accreditation is characterised by resulting in an authoritative approval/non-approval of a study programme or an institution. As a further result of the authoritative approval, the subject may obtain special rights such as the right to offer new study programmes and degrees. Quality and relevance criteria Danish accreditation involves both existing study programmes and new study programmes which must be accredited before they may be set up. In Denmark, the quality and relevance of a study programme are assessed on the basis of five predefined criteria. #Demand for the study programme in the labour market #The study programme is based on research and connected with an active research environment of high quality #Academic profile of the study programme and learning outcome targets #Structure and organisation of the study programme #Continuous internal quality assurance of the study programme Accreditation may result in three different decisions: *Positive accreditation: The study programme is approved for up to six years. *Conditional positive accreditation: The study programme is given one to two years to rectify shortcomings. (New study programmes cannot receive conditional positive accreditation ‚Äì only approval or refusal). *Refusal: The study programme is closed. The minister must prepare a plan for how the students can complete their education. ==International standards== The accreditation method is based on the European standards and guidelines for quality assurance, the so-called ESGs. The ESGs were approved at the Bologna Ministerial Meeting in 2005 in Bergen, which set up a separate focus on professionalisation of quality assurance within higher education. The standards contain requirements for the universities, for external quality assurance and for external quality assurance institutions such as the Accreditation Institution and EVA. The Accreditation Institution and EVA are both members of ENQA, the European Association of Quality Assurance Agencies. The Accreditation Institution has also been included in the European Register for Quality Assurance Agencies, EQAR. == References  * (English) * (Danish) *EVA - The Danish Evaluation Institute *Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education *Ministry of Culture Denmark Category:Organizations established in 2007 Category:School accreditors Category:Educational organizations based in Denmark ","title":"Accreditation Institution"},{"id":"35252989","text":"The Western Sahara national football team represents Western Sahara, a disputed territory, in association football.

DC Nation workers were told about the action by fans. Later that day, Cartoon Network and DC Nation's Facebook and Twitter profiles stated that the block had been put on hiatus and will resume airing in January 2013.

He has been described as the bridge between the projects of 17th- century Europe concerned with a universal language, and those concerned with a philosophical language. He has also been called a pioneer of faceted classification.Hans G. Schulte-Albert, Cyprian Kinner and the Idea of a Faceted Classification Publication Date: 19-10-2009 . ==Life== Kinner was a pupil of Melchior Lauban in Brieg who also taught Samuel Hartlib and Abraham von Franckenberg,EMLO letter. who both were to be important in Kinner's life; Lauban had previously been a professor of philology in Danzig, and was an admirer of Bartholom√§us Keckermann. Kinner became physician in ordinary at the court of the Duchy of Brieg.Martin Mulsow, Who was the Author of the Clavis apocalyptica of 1651? Millenarianism and Prophecy between Silesian Mysticism and the Hartlib Circle (PDF). Kinner's career as physician and jurist was interrupted by the invasion of Silesia by troops of the Habsburg Empire. Around 1630 he was supported by the Dutch church in London. In 1631 he turned down an invitation from the Racovian Academy, instead going to the Imperial court in Prague at the request of Michael Sendivogius. In 1634 to 1635 he worked with Johann Heinrich Bisterfeld and Johann Heinrich Alsted. From about 1644 to 1647, Kinner worked with Comenius, but the relationship was troubled. In the period 1645-6 the patronage of Louis de Geer, who said the salary was too high, looked uncertain; then Kinner was held up in Schleswig- Holstein.Maurice Walter Keatinge (editor), The Great didactic of John Amos Comenius: Now for the First Time Englished ... (1896) pp. 59‚Äì60; archive.org. In the end he succeeded Georg Ritschel as assistant to Comenius, but suffered in the same way, being told that finances precluded keeping him on.John T. Young, Faith, Medical Alchemy and Natural Philosophy: Johann Moriaen, Reformed Intelligencer, and the Hartlib Circle, Chapter Four: Panaceas of the Soul: Comenius and the Dream of Universal Knowledge (2007). Kinner spent further time in Poland. There he knew the astronomer Maria Kunicka, and in Elbing in 1647 he associated with von Franckenburg and the Danzig astronomer Johan Hevelius. Right at the end of his life, in 1649, he visited England, where William Petty was set by Hartlib to translate one of his books into English. He died suddenly in May 1649.Benjamin DeMott, The Sources and Development of John Wilkins' Philosophical Language, The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 1958), pp. 1‚Äì13. Published by: University of Illinois Press Article Stable URL: ==Works== Paolo Rossi considers that Kinner was the first to make a detailed formulation of the idea of a constructed language. Further, his motivations included mnemonics and botanical classification: and the relationship generally between scientific classifications and memory.Paolo Rossi, Logic and the Art of Memory (2000 translation), pp. 168‚Äì9. He worked on botanical names alone as a pilot for a larger language project. Kinner has been suggested as an influence on John Wilkins and An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language. The connection depends on ideas unpublished at the time, though communicated to Hartlib in letters; Petty set to work on a botanical scheme, not long after hearing of Kinner's ideas via Hartlib. Kinner had the idea of composite signs, rather than letter combinations.

Historically, this has happened when elderly people outlive their spouses, and when men have migrated for work. In modern times, large numbers of people have begun to live happily alone in cities and with the help of communication technologies like the telephone, email, and social networking services. Klinenberg has found that the ability of women to work, own property, and initiate divorce creates more opportunities for living alone; in countries like Saudi Arabia where women do not have autonomy, relatively few people live alone. Single people may live alone before their first romantic partner, after a divorce, or after their partner has died. When unmarried or married couples maintain separate residences as an alternative to cohabitation, it may be a long distance relationship, a temporary separation due to troubles in the relationship, or simply living apart together. The number of people who live alone is correlated with how wealthy their country is. In wealthy countries, people are more likely to choose the privacy, individualism, and sometimes the loneliness of living alone. In poor countries, most people live in extended family groups, which provide material, social, and emotional support to each other, as well as imposing the responsibility of similarly caring for other family members. ==See also== * Hipster * Incel * Living apart together * MGTOW * Parasite single * Recluse * Sloane Ranger * Single person * Yuppie * Young professional ==References *PopMatters Category:Subcultures Category:Social groups Category:Youth culture Category:Social class subcultures Category:Postmodernism ","title":"Singleton (lifestyle)"},{"id":"35253169","text":"Niaq (, also Romanized as Nƒ´ƒÅq) is a village in Eqbal-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

However, already in his early years he felt attracted to Judaism and studied Talmud and Kabbalah with his friend from school: Alfred Fuchs. At the age of 19 he decided to leave his family home and went alone to Belz to join the Hasidic court of Yissachar Dov Rokeach. He later described this journey and his experience in the Hasidic shtetl in the book Nine Gates to Hasidic Mysteries (cz. \\"Devƒõt bran\\"). At the outbreak of World War I he was drafted to the Austro-Hungarian army, but refused to obey military orders because of his religious beliefs. For refusing to obey orders he was imprisoned in military jail. After being released he came back to the Rokeah's court upon its exile to Hungary during the war years. In this time he deepened his studies of Torah, Talmud, Midrash, and Kabbalah and lived the hasidic life together with the community.The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe: Langer, Ji≈ô√≠ With the end of World War I Ji≈ô√≠ Langer left the hasidic court and decided to move to Vienna, where he studied at the Hebrew Pedagogic Academy. This was also a time when his philosophy turned into the direction of religious Zionism. Later he came back to Prague, where he joined the work of Zionist institutions and worked as teacher of Jewish religion in Czech schools. This was also a time when he developed his friendship with Franz Kafka and Max Brod.

It is found in shallow waters on the eastern coast of North America. ==Description== The carapace of the longnose spider crab is nearly circular in outline. The shell grows to an average diameter of with the males being larger than the females. There are about six spiny protuberances on each edge of the shell and another six down the midline. The upper surface is covered with short setae (bristles) which are hooked and resemble velcro. To these the crab sticks pieces of seaweed and other organisms as camouflage. There are two small stalked eyes and between these the carapace extends forward in a forked rostrum. There are five pairs of long, thin, jointed walking legs. The front pair end in rather small pincers and the terminal joint of the others legs is a curved claw. The longnose spider crab may be confused with the portly spider crab, Libinia emarginata, but that species usually has nine spines on the margin at each side of the shell. ==Distribution== The longnose spider crab is found on the eastern seaboard of the United States at depths down to about . The range is from Cape Cod to southern Texas, including Cuba and the Bahamas. In the Indian River Lagoon, adults are found on sandy bottoms and juveniles in seagrass meadows. In the late 1900s this crab was identified off the coast of Tunisia, but by what means it had managed to cross the Atlantic Ocean is unclear. ==Reproduction== When breeding, the male transfers bundles of sperm called spermatophores to the female. Fertilisation is internal and afterwards the female broods the eggs under her abdomen until they hatch. The larvae then become part of the zooplankton, having two zoeal stages and one megalopal or post-larval stage. After that the larvae settle on the sea bed and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile crabs. ==Ecology== The longnose spider crab is a scavenger and detrivore. In seagrass meadows it eats the seaweeds that grow there. It is eaten by predatory fish such as the pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), the gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis) and the oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau). It attempts to avoid being eaten by sticking unpalatable seaweeds and invertebrates onto its carapace. These include the brown alga, Dictyota menstrualis and the sun sponge (Hymeniacidon heliophila). Along the East Coast of the US, where Dictyota menstrualis is present, these crabs recognize and preferentially select this chemically noxious algae. However, in places where the D. menstrualis is absent, L. dubia has an alternative camouflage method and does not appear to recognize the D. menstrualis. As it grows larger it no longer needs to disguise itself in this way because its shell is too large for the predators to ingest. It is sometimes associated with the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), living as an epibiont on its carapace. Longnose spider crabs are often found living inside the bells of cannonball jellies, Stomolophus meleagris. It is thought they gain access as juveniles when the jellyfish happens to drift near the seabed or possibly they may metamorphosise from larvae directly inside the bell. It may be a symbiotic relationship with the crabs gaining protection from predators and obtaining food from their hosts but any benefit to the jellyfish is unclear, especially as its tissues may be nibbled. ==References== Category:Majoidea Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1834 Category:Taxa named by Henri Milne-Edwards ","title":"Libinia dubia"},{"id":"35253424","text":"Taratun (, also Romanized as TarƒÅt≈´n) is a village in Eqbal-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

K. Bose, is an electrical engineer, artificial intelligence researcher, scientist, educator, and currently a professor emeritus of power electronics in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. == Life and career == Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. Bose received his B.E. degree (1956) from Bengal Engineering College under University of Calcutta, (Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur (IIEST Shibpur)), M.S. degree (1960) from University of Wisconsin, Madison, and PhD degree (1966) from University of Calcutta. Bose started his career in India in 1960 and emigrated to USA in 1971 to join Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY as faculty member (1971‚Äì1976), then to GE Corporate Research and Development in (now GE Global Research Center) Schenectady, NY as research engineer (1976‚Äì1987), and then he joined the University of Tennessee as a Chaired Professor (1987‚Äì2003). Concurrently, he was the Distinguished Scientist (1989‚Äì2000) and the Chief Scientist (1987‚Äì1989) of EPRI-Power Electronics Applications Center. Bose held the Condra Chair of Excellence in Power Electronics at University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Bose organized its power electronics teaching and research program for 15 years. He is recognized as world-renowned authority and pioneer in power electronics for his many contributions that include high frequency link power conversion, advanced control techniques by microcomputers, fuzzy logic and neural networks, transistor ac power switch for matrix converters, adaptive hysteresis-band current control, etc. He also pioneered power electronics applications in environmental protection that help solving climate change problems. He was a Visiting Professor in Aalborg University, Denmark (1997), University of Padova, Italy (2003), Federal University of Mato Grosso Sul, Brazil (2006), Savilla University, Spain (2008), and European PhD School on Power Electronics, Italy (2010).

He has been a reference for many engineers and scientists working in the area of power electronics and motor drives. Bose has contributed to the global promotion of power electronics by his books, publications, patents, tutorials, invited seminars and keynote speeches around the world. In an article \\"Eleven Years in Corporate Environment\\" he writes: \\"Research ideas do not necessarily come within the 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work day office. The thoughts linger most of the time beyond the office hours, and often new ideas come when I am taking bath, walking alone in the evening, or even in the midnight when I suddenly wake up with the flash of new idea. There is no difference between scientific research and transcendental meditation.\\". Bose is a powerful presence in the world of power electronics. Dr. Bimal Bose received the Honorary Doctor of Science degree from the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, on 19 January 2013.\\"In recognition of his outstanding contribution in Engineering and his dedicated service to the nation.\\" The IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Magazine published a special issue (June 2009) \\"Honoring Dr. Bimal Bose and Celebrating His Contributions in Power Electronics.\\" The IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES) established the annual Dr. Bimal Bose Energy systems Award from 2014 which was funded by IES and IEEE Foundation. Dr. Paul Johnson, President of Colorado School of Mines, gave an eloquent introduction of Dr. Bose while he was delivering the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Distinguished Lecture (23 November 2015) in the Denver Chapter with the following quotation \\"Coming from a remote village of Bangladesh (then part of India) and being born into a large poor family, it was my dream to see the whole world with my own eyes and make important contributions to the world. I had to overcome mountainous hurdles, step by step, to fulfill the ambitious goals in life and reach where I am today. Although my goals are yet unfulfilled, I often feel that I am the happiest person on earth. Achieving the goals of life requires persistent ambition, courage, and hard work, but when you reach the top of the Himalayan mountain, the mind remains filled with perennial pleasures. My advice to young engineers: have a dream in life and try to realize that dream with hard work. Have a long-term ambition and short-term career goals, with the fire always burning in your mind\\". Bose established the foundation of University of Tennessee Power Electronics Program and built it to the center-point of the world. Dean of Engineering Wayne Davis comments, \\"He strengthened the program and paved the way for landing the National Science Foundation-backed CURENT program. His efforts have helped both our college and the world at large\\". ‚ÄúI have helped pioneer the advancement of artificial intelligence applications in power electronics and motor drives. In any technology advancement, our goal should be its application solely for the benefit of mankind‚Äù. ‚ÄúA truly successful person should have a blend of professional expertise and human qualities‚Äù, comments Bose\\". He is married to Arati Bose and they have two children: daughter Papia Ferguson and son Amit Bose == Work == Bose is the sole author/editor of seven books in power electronics some of which have been translated into several foreign languages, and some of which are widely used as texts throughout the world.

The film was produced by Daniel Louis, Denise Robert, and Gerry Flahive. ==Subject matter== The film is structured as a series of interviews, interspersed with footage from all over the world. The film is said to be \\"inspired by\\" Wright's lectures: Unlike the book, which focused on ancient civilizations, the film focuses on the present-day impact of civilization, including the impact of concentrated wealth. The underlying message here is that current models and strategies of economic growth have no practical connections with the real world. That is to say, the lack of an ethical underpinning in modern global economic practices is directly responsible for the overconsumption and exploitation of natural resources to the extent that the increasingly more probable future population collapse would take modern society right along with it. ==Interviewees== *Ronald Wright ...

He was a member of Colchester's outstanding 1961‚Äì62 promotion-winning team, which was also the highest-scoring team in the U's history, as Colchester hit the net 104 times in 44 league games and King struck up a prolific understanding with Hunt. The pair scored nearly 200 goals between them in under four seasons, before Hunt moved to Northampton Town in 1964. In 1964, King was sold to Wrexham by Colchester manager Neil Franklin, where he scored 15 goals in 45 league appearances. King holds the Colchester United record for most league goals (130 between 1959 and 1965) and jointly holds the record for most goals scored in a match (4 - shared with Bobby Hunt and Chris Iwelumo). He also jointly holds the record for most hat-tricks scored (5 - shared with Arthur Pritchard, Arthur Turner and Tony Adcock). ==After football== In December 2008, King was due to be Colchester's guest for a game with Scunthorpe United, but a ruptured aortic aneurysm left him seriously ill with severe bleeding to his stomach. He was later allowed home to begin his path back to full health. King died on 25 December 2019, aged 82. ==Honours== Club ;Colchester United * Football League Fourth Division Runner-up (1): 1961‚Äì62 ==ReferencesCategory:1937 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Martyn King"},{"id":"35253868","text":"Frank Jordan (19 August 1932 - 13 March 2012) was an Australian water polo player.

Prince Louis G√ºnther grew up as the thirteenth and youngest child, among seven sisters and three brothers in Rudolstadt (two sisters had already died before he was born). In his youth, Louis G√ºnther traveled to Italy. In this way, the Prince could marvel at the artistic heritage of Italy. He also took a job as colonel in Milan from 1726 to 1731 a Colonel Agent in Milan. Between 1722 and 1731, he visited Rudolstadt only twice. His military career was ended by problems with his ear. In 1767, Louis G√ºnther inherited the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt at the age of 59. Most government business was transacted by his Chancellor, Christian Ulrich von Ketelholdt, with whom he had a good working relationship. One might say that the Chancellor was regent. The prince had various occupations; among other things, he was very enthusiastic about horses. In 1784, Louis G√ºnther granted a trade concession to three Jewish families from Dessau, thus creating the bases for the Jewish community in Rudolstadt.Th√ºringer Landesmuseum in Heidecksburg - Regional Historic Collection, viewed on 9 October 2011 When he was born, Louis G√ºnther II was fourth in the line of succession. By 1726, two of his elder brothers had died and he had moved up to the second place. Between 1734 and 1741, a Baroque palace named Ludwigsburg Castle was built for him below Heidecksburg Castle. After his nephew, Prince John Frederick had died in 1767, he moved up from Ludwigsburg Castle to Heidecksburg Castle. After he left, Ludwigburg palace served as a princely art school and it housed the natural history collection owned by Hereditary Prince Frederick Charles and Louis G√ºnther's collection of coins, which he had started in 1738. His mother, who owned collection of rarities herself, had aroused his passion for collecting. He had been shown the coin collection of his uncle, Duke Frederick II of Saxe- Gotha-Altenburg during a visit to Gotha. This collection, which had been extended in 1712 by purchasing the collection of Prince Anton G√ºnther II was among the most important coin collections in the 18th century and included a separate collection of over 600 medieval bracteates. Louis G√ºnther moved his coin collection to the Heidecksburg Castle and further extended it by purchases. In 1776, he archived his collection. However, his successors had little interest in the collection and sold off some of it. By 1919, 1,710 pieces were left; they are now part of a collection of 5,000 coins still housed in Heidecksburg Castle.Doreen Winker: Die M√ºnz- und Medaillensammlung, viewed on 9 October 2011\\"Coin collection\\" at the Heidecksburg Residence In 1778, Louis G√ºnther II established a court library in the west wing of Heidecksburg Castle, thereby laying the foundation for the Palace Library which today contains approximately 7,000 volumes.\\"Palace Library\\" at the Heidecksburg Residence, viewed on 9 October 2011 In addition to folios Louis G√ºnther II had brought with him from Italy, he also purchased works of art by renowned artists.

D.variegatus will utilise almost any kind of pre-existing cavity including dead plant stems, dead wood, masonry cavities and even old snail shells. The nest cavity is plugged with sand grains, soil or plant debris which is bound together by spider silk collected by the female using the maxillar bristles which give the genus Dipogon its name. In small cavities single cells may be constructed but if space permits multiple cells will be built.

According to historians Suetonius and Plutarch, the Roman leader Octavian (later renamed Augustus) permitted their burial together after he had defeated them. Their surviving children were taken to Rome, to be raised as Roman citizens. Shakespeare, inspired by Plutarch, briefly alludes to this common entombment in the voice of his character Caesar (Octavian), in the last verses of his play Antony and Cleopatra (Act V, scene II):, p. 368, the last page of the play, facsimile by SCETI - University of Pennsylvania; original doc. Horace Howard Furness Memorial (Shakespeare) Library. Folio PR2751 .A1.) ::: She shall be buried by her Antony: ::: No grave upon the earth shall clip in it ::: A pair so famous. [...] Reports in 2008 and 2009 focused on an announcement by the noted Egyptologist Zahi Hawass that he might find the tomb in Taposiris Magna, a temple to Osiris, located west of Alexandria, Egypt. Excavations carried out by Kathleen Mart√≠nez have yielded ten mummies in 27 tombs of Egyptian nobles, as well as coins bearing images of Cleopatra and carvings showing the two in an embrace. So far, the tomb itself remains elusive, but the temple excavations continue, with additional sites below the surface identified using ground-penetrating radar in 2011. In January 2019, controversy arose over the possibility that the discovery of the tombs was imminent, attributed to remarks by Zahi Hawass at a conference at the University of Palermo. The Egyptologist denied the news in an article in the newspaper Al-Ahram, affirming that the thesis that the tombs were in Taposiris Magna was not his but that of Kathleen Mart√≠nez, and that he did not believe Mart√≠nez's hypothesis because \\"the Egyptians never buried inside a temple\\", given that \\"the temples were for worshiping, and this was for the goddess Isis. It is therefore unlikely that Cleopatra was buried there.\\" The search seeks to find Antony's mummy as well, despite Plutarch's statement that Antony was cremated: \\"After Cleopatra had heard this, in the first place, she begged Caesar that she might be permitted to pour libations for Antony; and when the request was granted, she had herself carried to the tomb, and embracing the urn which held his ashes.\\" ==In popular culture== The tomb is featured heavily in the first season of Blood & Treasure (2019). In the story, the tomb is located in a secret room inside the Pyramid of Khafri. ==See also== *Early life of Cleopatra *Reign of Cleopatra *Death of Cleopatra ==References== Category:Mausoleums in Egypt Category:Tombs of ancient Egypt Category:Cleopatra Category:Monuments and memorials to women Category:Mark Antony ","title":"Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra"},{"id":"35254300","text":"Monmouth railway station may refer to two former stations in Monmouth, Wales: * Monmouth Troy railway station * Monmouth Mayhill railway station ","title":"Monmouth railway station"},{"id":"35254302","text":"Unchained Blades, titled in Japan, is a dungeon crawler role-playing video game developed by Japanese developer FuRyu for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Portable video game consoles. It was released in Japan on July 14, 2011, and in North America exclusively as a digital download on June 26, 2012 for the PlayStation Portable, and on January 3, 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. ==Gameplay== The game is played as a dungeon crawler role-playing video game, similar to Wizardry, but with a greater emphasis on story. The purpose of the game is to direct the game's party through mazes and labyrinths while defeating opposing monster parties. A party can contain up to four characters. Additionally, it is possible to recruit enemy monsters into the player's party to assist them, and each character is allowed to have four monsters support them, allowing for a party size of up to twenty characters. ==Development== Creation Many veterans in Japanese video game design contributed to the original development of the game. The game's director is Toshio Akashi, who previously worked on Lunar, and the scenario designer is Takashi Hino, who previously worked on Grandia. Longtime Final Fantasy musical contributor Nobuo Uematsu also contributed music for the game, although most of the game's music was done by upcoming, Tsutomu Narita, who works with Uematsu. Additionally, each of the game's main thirteen characters were each drawn by different artists from different anime and manga background. The Japanese release was originally intended to be June 23, 2011, but in April, it was delayed to July 14, 2011. The Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Portable versions are almost identical, the differences being mainly visual. The 3DS version is the only one that features stereoscopic 3D graphics. Additionally, the placement of the overhead map of the levels is different platforms; for the 3DS, it's on the second, bottom screen, where on the PSP, which lacks a second screen, it is merely layered over the main screen, with the option to toggle it on or off. Localization Xseed Games originally teased the localization of the video game through a guessing game through its Twitter. Three pictures were released as hints to the game's title; a Tyrannosaurus rex, a blade of grass, and a still from the movie Ghost's famous pottery wheel scene. This was in reference to the three words, in reverse order, of the game's Japanese title Unchained Blade Rexx. The game's localization was officially confirmed through the April 2012 issue of Nintendo Power. ==Reception and sales== The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. Both versions of the game charted in their first week of release in Japan; the PlayStation Portable version charted at seventh place with 18,256 copies sold, while the Nintendo 3DS version charted at twentieth place with 5,592 copies sold. ==Sequel== A sequel titled Unchained Blades Exiv was developed and released on November 29, 2012 in Japan for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo 3DS. Xseed Games, who localized the original into English, stated that it was \\"not likely\\" that they would pursue translating the sequel. ==References External links == * Category:2011 video games Category:Dungeon crawler video games Category:FuRyu games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Unchained Blades"},{"id":"35254306","text":"Lake Inman is a small lake in McPherson County, Kansas, United States.

In addition to serving as a pilot during the war, he was a Royal Air Force instructor. == Background == Harold Francis Stackard, son of Stephen and Mary Ann Lydia Pipe Stackard, was born on 2 March 1895 in Norwich. His birth was registered in the second quarter of 1895. He was the second of five children. At the time of the 1901 census, his family was still living in Norwich and his father was described as a commercial traveller in the tea trade. However, by 1911, the family had moved to Muswell Hill, a suburb of London. His father, Stephen Francis Stackard (1861‚Äì1918), was a glass bottle manufacturer. == Military career == Sopwith Pup Sopwith Triplane Sopwith Camel Harold Stackard initially was a subaltern in the Royal Naval Division. He served for five months on HMS Oratava of the 10th Cruiser Squadron. After serving in France (1914) and Gallipoli (1915), he transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service in October 1916. On 7 December 1916, Stackard was promoted from Probationary Flight Officer to Flight Sub-Lieutenant. On 26 December 1916, he was the pilot of Bristol Scout (N5405) when its undercarriage collapsed upon landing at the Royal Naval Air Station at Redcar in Yorkshire. After his training was completed, the pilot spent eight months on the Western Front with No. 9 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service. Despite spending four years in the service, having been wounded, and having been credited with fifteen aerial victories, Stackard does not appear to have been decorated. Harold Stackard scored his first victory on 2 May 1917 when, from his Sopwith Pup, a single- seat biplane with serial number 9916, he destroyed a two-seat aircraft over Middelkerke, West Flanders, Belgium. The victory was shared with a Canadian, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Harold Mott. However, on the morning of 4 May 1917, Stackard was shot down and crashed northeast of Ypres. On 31 May 1917, while piloting a Sopwith Pup, he sent a two-seater out of control over Ostend, West Flanders. The kill was shared with Flight Commander Fred Banbury and Flight Sub-Lieutenant Shearer. Stackard scored his third victory, from the single- seat Sopwith Triplane (N5451). On 8 June 1917, he sent an Albatros D.III out of control over Diksmuide, West Flanders. On 14 June 1917, Flight Sub- Lieutenant Harold F. Stackard was reported wounded. That report may refer to the May incident. Stackard's remaining twelve victories were all from Sopwith Camel aircraft, single-seat biplanes. His next two kills were both from Sopwith Camel (B6204). On 3 September 1917, he destroyed an Albatros D.III southeast of Pervijze, West Flanders. It was shared with Flight Commander Joseph Fall, Flight Sub-Lieutenant J E Scott, and Flight Sub-Lieutenant Arthur Wood. The following day, Stackard destroyed a DFW C over the Nieuwpoort- Middelkerke area. He shared that fifth victory with Joseph Fall and J. E. Scott. Pilot Stackard had his sixth triumph on 6 September 1917, when he drove an Albatros C out of control over Middelkerke. It was shared with Arthur Wood, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Hazel Wallace, J. E. Scott, and Joseph Fall. Stackard racked up his seventh victory on 9 September 1917 while piloting his Sopwith Camel (B6204). He sent an Albatros D.V out of control east of Middelkerke, aided by Joseph Fall. Pilot Stackard scored a double kill on the afternoon of 11 September 1917 from his Sopwith Camel (B3863). He destroyed two Albatros D.V aircraft over Leke, West Flanders, one in flames. He shared both kills with Joseph Fall and Arthur Wood. His tenth victory occurred on 13 September 1917, when he sent another Albatros D.V out of control east of Leke. It was shared with Flight Sub-Lieutenant Stearne Edwards. He scored another double victory on 24 September 1917 from Sopwith Camel (B3883). First, he sent an Albatros D.III out of control over Leke, shared with Joseph Fall and Arthur Wood. Then, he drove an Albatros D.V out of control over Middelkerke. On 30 September 1917, Stackard racked up yet another double victory, again with Sopwith Camel (B3883). South of Middelkerke, an Albatros C was destroyed, and, one hour later, another was sent out of control. The first that day was a shared victory, with Joseph Fall and Arthur Wood. Stackard's fifteenth and final victory took place on 27 October 1917. From Sopwith Camel (B6327), he sent an Albatros D.V out of control. It was shared with Stearne Edwards and others. The pilot was an instructor at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire by 1918. The 2 January 1918 edition of the Supplement to the Edinburgh Gazette announced his promotion to Lieutenant. Harold Stackard transferred to the No. 157 Squadron, formed in July 1918, of the Royal Air Force. He had the opportunity to fly the Sopwith Salamander fighter before he left the service. The Salamander had been developed as a ground attack aircraft. However, the war ended before the plane saw service in the squadrons. == After the war == On 7 Nov 1920, Harold Francis Stackard of Muswell Hill, London, married Ruth Mary Savage, daughter of Herbert Francis Savage and his wife Emma Florence King Savage, of Winchester. Harold eventually became branch manager of Commercial Union Assurance Company, an insurance company, in Calcutta, India. Stackard died at age 54 on 24 November 1949 at Fittleworth, West Sussex, England. His widow survived him by nearly 46 years, and died at the age of 100, having been born on 25 July 1895, and having her death registered in October 1995. == Gallery of aircraft downed == Image:Albad3.jpgAlbatros D.III Victories 3, 4, 11 Image:ZK-DVA2 IMG 3492-Edit.jpgAlbatros D.V Victories 7‚Äì10, 12, 15 Image:Albatros C.I.jpgAlbatros C Victories 6, 13, 14 ==See also== * Aerial victory standards of World War I == References == Category:1895 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Royal Naval Air Service aviators Category:Royal Naval Air Service personnel of World War I Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:British World War I flying aces Category:People from Norwich ","title":"Harold Stackard"},{"id":"35254392","text":"Asiab Borg (, also Romanized as ƒÄsƒ´ƒÅb Borg) is a village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

He was noted for his willingness to oppose the Crown, especially on its taxation policies, and as a result he was imprisoned several times. ==Background== He was born in Dowth in County Meath, second son of Luke Netterville, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) and Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Luttrell, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas.Nolan, Pierce Laurence \\"Richard Netterville\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885‚Äì1940 Vol. 40 p.237 His father died in 1560. As he was the son and grandson of judges, and a younger son with his livelihood to earn, it was an obvious career choice for Richard to practice at the Irish Bar. He was at the Inns of Court in London in 1561‚Äì62, where he was one of a group of Irish law students who compiled a book on the misgovernment of the Pale.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.58 He had returned to Ireland by 1564 to practice law. ==Cess controversy== The cess, a tax levied for the upkeep of the military garrisons of the Pale (those four counties under secure Crown control), was always unpopular with the Anglo-Irish gentry on whom it was levied, and the book to which Richard had contributed when he was a law student in the early 1560s included an attack on it. Matters came to a head in 1576 over the plans of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, to reform and extend the cess. Richard was one of three barristers chosen to go to London to protest against what the gentry argued would be the ruinous cost of the plans, the others being Henry Burnell and the former Attorney General for Ireland, Barnaby Skurloke.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571‚Äì1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.219 The mission turned out badly: Elizabeth was angered by their attack on the royal prerogative, and imprisoned them in the Fleet Prison. In Netterville's case, her attitude was probably influenced by Sidney's deep dislike of him. The Lord Deputy wrote to the Queen- Netterville is the younger son of a mean family and (his father) second justice of one of the benches, born to nothing and yet only by your Majesty's bounty liveth in better countenance than his father ever did or his elder brother doth; and notwithstanding that all he hath, he holdeth of your Highness in effect, he is (your sacred Majesty not offended with so bad a term as his lewdness deserveth) as seditious a varlet and as great an impugner of English Government as any this land beareth and calls for severe dealing with.Nolan, p.238 The Queen, in the end, dealt leniently enough with the three lawyers: as opposition mounted to Sidney's plans, his position in the Irish government weakened accordingly. The lawyers, having made an abject apology, were released from the Fleet and soon pardoned.Nolan, p.238 ==Parliament of 1585== Nettterville's imprisonment and apology did not lessen his willingness to oppose the authority of the Lord Deputy, and he proceeded to clash with Sidney's successor Sir John Perrot. Perrot had drawn up an ambitious program of law reform for the 1585 Irish Parliament; Netterville, who was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Dublin County, was one of the leaders of the opposition and thwarted the Deputy at every opportunity. To Perrot's fury, they even demanded to see his accounts; he complained- It angers me to make this bibble-babble account, fitter to be told to boys than any that have wit or judgment, and I think foul scorn they should put me to it.\\"Crawford, p.246 He retaliated by imprisoning Nettterville and some of his colleagues, but failed to get his reforms through Parliament. ==Last controversies== In 1606, Netterville, despite his advanced age, was imprisoned yet again. Led by Patrick Barnewall, the Roman Catholic gentry of the Pale protested against the imposition of fines on those who did not attend a Church of Ireland service on Sunday, and against and the use of the Court of Castle Chamber (the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber) to enforce religious conformity,Crawford p.296 Several of them were committed to prison as a result. Netterville's imprisonment seems to have been brief; he was freed before he died on 5 September 1607 and was buried at Donabate. He had married Alison (or Alice) Plunket, daughter of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Sir John Plunket and his second wife Catherine Luttrell, but had no children.

Smith and produced by Michael Harrison. It is based on the life of Susan Boyle and her 2010 autobiography, The Woman I Was Born to Be. The score features songs recorded by Boyle, hymns, traditional songs and popular songs, mostly from the 1960s to the 1980s. The show premiered on 27 March 2012 at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, directed by Ed Curtis and choreographed by Nick Winston. Smith stars as Susan Boyle, and Boyle herself sings two songs at the end of most performances. It has received generally favourable reviews. The production's tour of the UK and Ireland continued through much of 2012.\\"Susan Boyle to hit a high note at Celtic‚Äôs crunch Champions League match\\", STV, 28 August 2012 ==Synopsis== Act I Susan muses to the audience about childhood dreams (\\"I Dreamed a Dream\\"). The adult Susan, as narrator, explains that she is a shy, sometimes awkward person who doesn't know what to say to others. But she means to tell her \\"fairy tale\\" story. It starts the birth of a baby girl, in Scotland 1 April 1961, an April Fool's Day baby. A doctor tells her parents, Bridie and Patrick Boyle, that the baby may suffer from brain damage due to deprivation of oxygen, telling them not to expect too much from her. Bridie and Pat are worried yet hopeful (\\"Joy is in the Child\\"). Couples celebrate Susan's first communion (\\"Welcome to My World\\"). Guests sing (\\"Paper Roses\\" and \\"The Wild Rover\\"), but everyone is looking forward to Patrick Boyle singing his signature song, \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\", which he dedicates to Susan. He is able to \\"stop a room\\" his singing, and Susan hopes someday to do the same. Susan's singing talent is discovered at school by the music teacher. But she suffers bullying and a beating by classmates (\\"The Four Marys\\"). Her friend John drives away the bullies. Years later, parents in tow, Susan meets John again at a parish dance, where he invites an incredulous Susan, who has never had a boyfriend, to dance him (\\"Beautiful Sunday\\", \\"Knock Three Times\\", \\"Una Paloma Blanca\\"). Their comic, awkward efforts eventually turn dreamily romantic (\\"Perfect Day\\"). Susan goes to The Happy Valley pub's karaoke night, presided over by an Elvis-imitating compere who fancies himself the best singer around (\\"Something Tells Me\\"). Several regulars attempt to impress (\\"Crazy\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\"), and Susan's old school friend Lorraine persuades her to try. Susan tentatively sings \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\". When she spots John, her confidence increases, and Susan \\"stops the room\\". The jealous compere foreshadows subsequent criticisms, saying that while Susan can sing, the only reason the pub crowd reacted as they did was because they weren't expecting it, and felt they owed her an apology for thinking she was a daftie. Their romance budding, Susan and John talk on the phone playfully, but it ends suddenly when Susan's father slams down the phone set and tells her that she isn't ready for a boyfriend. Susan is depressed and lost (\\"At Seventeen\\"), not knowing how to go on her life; the only role she knows for a Blackburn girl, marriage and having kids, is taken away from her. She decides that since singing is the only thing she's good at, she should take lessons, and goes to see voice teacher Fred O'Neil. He signs her up for the Miner's Welfare competition, and Susan wins the ¬£1000 prize (\\"Daydream Believer\\"). Patrick Boyle becomes ill and dies. Grieving, Bridie and Susan express their farewells to Patrick (Medley: \\"How Great Thou Art\\", \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\"). Susan's sister Kathleen dies unexpectedly from an asthma attack. Susan now must take care of her elderly mother. Bridie urges Susan to get on her life, to make something of her singing. She is hopeful for Susan and inspires Susan to be hopeful too (\\"This Will Be the Year\\"). Then Bridie dies. Susan is despondent, alone for the first time in her life (\\"Return\\"). Act II Susan reminds the audience that this is a fairy tale. Susan sees an ad for a national talent contest. At Britain's Got Talent auditions, Susan is almost turned away as she signs in. She meets her fellow audition hopefuls, a collection of clowns, blue-wigged tap dancers and musicians of several sorts (\\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\"). Susan waits as they succeed or fail, and then it is her turn. Onstage, mic in hand, Susan answers the sceptical judges' questions. She sings \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and is astonished but ecstatic to hear the huge crowd's standing ovation. Susan goes home to twelve weeks of waiting, not allowed to tell anyone about her success. As the broadcast time approaches, Susan tries unsuccessfully to get the priest, the crossing guard, and a neighbour to be sure to watch the show Saturday night without telling them why. Lorraine watches the broadcast of Susan's audition with her, and both are caught off-guard by her sudden popularity as her YouTube video goes viral, spreading Susan's fame worldwide. The media hounds Susan and goads her into outbursts of profanity to write about in their papers, with headlines like \\"Hairy Angel, Never Been Kissed\\" (\\"Mad World\\"). Then come the broadcasts of the semi-final and final, where after seventeen agonising seconds an exhausted Susan hears that she finished as runner-up to the Diversity dance troupe. Susan feels desolate, convinced that losing means any chance for a singing career is gone (\\"End of the World\\"). While she is hospitalised, Andy Stephens speaks to her about starting her career as a singer, but she won't listen to him (\\"Don't Dream It's Over\\"). Her mother appears to scold her for giving in to depression and not keeping her promise to make something of herself. Lorraine and Andy call on Susan at home, but Susan doesn't remember meeting Andy. He offers to be her manager, taking care of everything she needs. Susan is afraid of singing in front of people, but Andy tells her that she won't have to, because she'll be in the studio making an album. Susan is happier than she's ever been as she sets to work to record her album (\\"Wild Horses\\"). The album becomes the fastest-selling debut album in British history and races to number one on both sides of the Atlantic. Susan goes to New York to promote it, to appear in Rockefeller Plaza before an audience of a thousand people. She is terrified, screaming and crying, telling Andy that she cannot sing in front of all those people. When Andy replies that if this is what live performing does to her, then it's not worth it, Susan realises that she has a choice. She wants to sing and doesn't want to go back to her old life; her mother would be in a rage if she didn't go on. Susan conquers her fear and goes on (\\"Up to the Mountain\\"). Her journey is not over. ==Principal roles and original cast == The principal roles and original tour cast are as follows: *Susan Boyle ‚Äì Elaine C.

This production is a standalone show that should still play to audiences long after Elaine C Smith and Susan Boyle have left. ... There is no doubting I Dreamed A Dream is one of the musical events of the year.\\" Neil Norman, in the Daily Express, also gave a 5-star review, writing: \\"The script is terrific, with proper acknowledgement of the envy Boyle's success sparked in others, the toll it took on her health both mental and physical and her initial treatment by the savage apostates of the press. Smith is astonishingly good as Boyle, not impersonating her so much as capturing her essence, and she is supported by an amazingly versatile cast, among whom James Paterson stands out as Boyle's father. A hugely uplifting evening.\\" Libby Purves in The Times gave the musical a 4-star review, writing: \\"Kennedy Aitchinson's cunning arrangements and Ed Curtis' deft direction use juke-boxery better than I have ever seen.\\"Girvan, Andrew. \\"Review Round-up: SuBo is celebrated in bio- musical\\", Whats on Stage, 28 March 2012.

It passes about 5.3 arcseconds east of George Biddell Airy's 1851 transit circle or at the latitude of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.IRM on grounds of Royal Observatory from Google Earth Accessed 30 March 2012The astronomic latitude of the Royal Observatory is 51¬∞28'38\\"N whereas its latitude on the European Terrestrial Reference Frame (1989) datum is 51¬∞28'40.1247\\"N. It is also the reference meridian of the Global Positioning System (GPS) operated by the United States Department of Defense, and of WGS84 and its two formal versions, the ideal International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and its realization, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). == Location == The reason for the 5.3 arcsecond offset between the IERS Reference Meridian and the Airy transit circle is that the observations with the transit circle were based on the local vertical, while the IERS Reference is a geodetic longitude, that is, the plane of the meridian contains the center of mass of the Earth. The International Hydrographic Organization adopted an early version of the IRM in 1983 for all nautical charts. Section 2.4.4. The IRM was adopted for air navigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization on 3 March 1989.WGS 84 Implementation Manual page i, 1998 Tectonic plates slowly move over the surface of Earth, so most countries have adopted for their maps an IRM version fixed relative to their own tectonic plate as it existed at the beginning of a specific year. Examples include the North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), the European Terrestrial Reference Frame 1989 (ETRF89), and the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94). Versions fixed to a tectonic plate differ from the global version by at most a few centimetres. However, the IRM is not fixed to any point on Earth. Instead, all points on the European portion of the Eurasian plate, including the Royal Observatory, are slowly moving northeast about 2.5 cm per year relative to it. Thus this IRM is the weighted average (in the least squares sense) of the reference meridians of the hundreds of ground stations contributing to the IERS network. The network includes GPS stations, satellite laser ranging (SLR) stations, lunar laser ranging (LLR) stations, and the highly accurate very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) stations. All stations' coordinates are adjusted annually to remove net rotation relative to the major tectonic plates. If Earth had only two hemispherical plates moving relative to each other around any axis which intersects their centres or their junction, then the longitudes (around any other rotation axis) of any two, diametrically opposite, stations must move in opposite directions by the same amount. The 180th meridian is opposite the IERS Reference Meridian and forms a great circle with it dividing the earth into Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere. Universal Time is notionally based on the WGS84 meridian. Because of changes in the rate of Earth's rotation, standard international time UTC can differ from the mean observed solar time at noon on the prime meridian by up to 0.9 second.

Following their initiative, the Geologists Day was established by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on March 31, 1966 to commemorate the achievements of Soviet geologists after discovery of the West Siberian petroleum province. The timing of the holiday, the first Sunday in April, was chosen because it marks the end of winter and beginning of preparation for summer field work and expeditions. Geologists Day is traditionally celebrated in almost all geological and mining organizations of the former Soviet Union with festivities starting at the end of preceding week. With tens of thousands of geologists from the former Soviet Union working around the world, the tradition of celebrating the Geologists Day is becoming more international. In addition to geologists, many others involved in related fields also consider this day as their professional holiday and celebrate it. ==References== *Izvestiya, N76 (15164), April 1, 1966 (in Russian) *Russian Mineralogical Society - Geologist's Day (in Russian) Category:Public holidays in the Soviet Union Category:April observances Category:Holidays and observances by scheduling (nth weekday of the month) ","title":"Geologists Day"},{"id":"35254633","text":"Hesamabad (), also rendered as Hisamabad, may refer to: *Hesamabad, Fars *Hesamabad, Asadabad, Hamadan Province *Hesamabad, Famenin, Hamadan Province *Hesamabad, Khuzestan *Hesamabad, Markazi *Hesamabad, Qazvin *Hesamabad, Zanjan ","title":"Hesamabad"},{"id":"35254636","text":"Yalabad (, also Romanized as YalƒÅbƒÅd and YelƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

CPS water guns are powered by a rubber bladder inflated with water. It was patented by Bruce M. D'Andrade as \\"bladder water gun.\\" ==Design== All Constant Pressure water guns have a rubber bladder, which is either shaped like a balloon (spherical) or is a length of latex rubber tubing (cylindrical). Water is pumped from the water gun's reservoir and into the rubber bladder, inflating it. Then the trigger is pulled, which opens a valve, allowing the bladder to push the water out of the nozzle. Due to the nature of the bladder, the stream produced is fairly constant, and has almost the same range and power throughout the entire shot, most streams dropping only one foot in range towards the end of a continuous shot, unlike most air pressure based water guns which exhibit a constant loss of pressure while the trigger is pulled. Some bladder water guns, such as Speedloaders, Water Worms, and Super Chargers, are inflated with water directly from a garden hose using a quick-fill device (QFD). This allows faster filling, but makes them more limited since they require a hose to work. ==History== The Constant Pressure System was used for the first time when Larami Toys released the Super Soaker CPS 2000 in 1996. To this day, the first generation CPS 2000 is the most powerful production water gun, with an output of 30 oz. per second (~850 ml/s), and a range of 53 feet (16 m). After the CPS 2000, Larami released several CPS models from 1996 to 2002. These are the CPS 2000 (1996), CPS 1000, CPS 1500, CPS 2500, and CPS 3000 (1998), the CPS 1200, CPS 1700, CPS 2700, and CPS 3200 (2000) the CPS 1-3-5, and CPS Splashzooka (2001), the CPS 2100, and CPS 4100 (2002). During this time, some other water guns were released that also used CPS technology, under Super Soaker's Super Charger and Monster lines, these are the SC (Super Charger) 500, SC 600, and Power Pak (1999) SC Big trouble, Monster and Monster XL (2000) Monster (2001) (the prior Monster being renamed the Monster X) In 2002, the Super Soaker brand was taken over by Hasbro, along with the CPS patents. Hasbro mostly released smaller air pressure water guns, although they continued to make a few water guns with CPS technology. These included the Aquapack Devastator, the Flash Flood, the Arctic Blast, the Hydroblitz, and the Hydro Cannon. However, these blasters were not nearly as powerful as the previous ones Some other companies used rubber bladders in their water guns despite the patent. These include the Speed Loader line from 1999, the Water Worm, and a few Water Warriors blasters. In the case of Water Warriors, Hasbro ended up suing them over the patent. The \\"bladder water gun\\" patent expired in 2016. ==Legal issues== In 2010, Buzz Bee Toys Inc. was successfully sued by Hasbro Inc. for a patent infringement. Hasbro claimed that Buzz Bee Toys infringed on a patent related to its Nerf Super Soaker water toy. Although it is unknown exactly what the dispute was over, it is strongly suggested that Hasbro was suing for the Water Warriors Hydro Power water guns, which were becoming too similar to Hasbro's Constant Pressure System. Since then, the Water Warriors line hasn't contained a single Hydro Power water gun. ==References== Category:Water guns ","title":"Constant Pressure System"},{"id":"35254828","text":"Qezel Darreh () is a village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It was administrated by this organization from 2003 until 2007, from there it was organized by the local organization Ciclopolis until 2017. Nowadays the local traffic law enforcement organisation (Agencia Metropolitana de Tr√°nsito by the Spanish name) is administering the project. A route of 30 km running from the North to South of the city is closed to traffic every Sunday from 8 am until 2 pm to give preference to cyclists and pedestrians. The project is run in cooperation with the Municipality and features diverse locations of the city from Carolina Park, Ejido Park the Historic Center of Quito, Avenue Rio Amazonas, and The Panecillo. ==History== Ciclopaseo along Amazonas. The first Ciclopaseo in Quito took place in April 2003 when the path was only 9.5 km and 3,000 people participated. At that point, Ciclopaseos were only held on the last Sunday of every month but the event grew in popularity. In six months the route had grown to 20 km with 25,000 participants. The mayor of Bogota, Antanas Mockus, rode alongside Quito's mayor, Paco Moncayo, in the second monthly Ciclopaseo of May, 2003. The Ciclopaseo of June was the first themed event that emphasized children, followed by the event \\"Quito is for Everyone\\" in June, which featured the winners of the Special Olympics. In October, the Rotary Club of Quito recognized the project with the award \\"Premio Rotary Quito Metropolitano.\\" ==Ciclopaseo, founded by Biciaccion Foundation== Ciclopaseo along Amazonas. The organization that promoted the Ciclopaseo was Bicciaccion (www.biciaccion.org) under the direction of Diego Puente, Alexa Velasco, Cristian Cerda and others. There were another collaborators included the Metropolitan District of Quito, The Metropolitan Transportation and Services Administration of Quito (Empresa Metropolitana de Servicios y Administraci√≥n de Transporte in Spanish), Ecological Action ( Accion Ecologica in Spanish) and the Roadrunner Club (Club Correcaminos in Spanish). and 635 police officers. When Diego Puente founded Ciclopolis in 2008 the project moved with him. The Ciclopaseo began 2005 by doubling its frequency to every fifteen days and in May 2009 became a weekly event and takes place every Sunday. In 2016, local media had reported a perceived conflict of interest with Ciclopolis‚Äò executives and a City official (Diego Puente) working at the time for the Secretariat of Mobility, following a polemic increase in the operation cost of Ciclopaseo.https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/quito/1/funcionario-del- cabildo-renuncia-por-posible-conflicto-de-intereses In 2017, the operation of Ciclopaseo was handed to the local municipal traffic enforcement agency (AMT), who also began to administer the City's bike share program. ==Ciclov√≠a== Ciclov√≠a, ciclovia or cyclovia (; ) is term which translates from Spanish into English as \\"bike path\\" and now used worldwide to refer either to a permanently designated bicycle route or a temporary event, the closing of the street to automobiles for use by others. == References  External links == * ciclopolis.ec * vivatravelguides.com/ * Category:Community bicycle programs Category:Environmental organisations based in Ecuador Category:Transport in Quito Category:Cycling in Ecuador ","title":"Ciclopaseo in Quito, Ecuador"},{"id":"35254844","text":"Selaqai (, also Romanized as SelƒÅqa‚Äôƒ´ and SelƒÅqƒÅ‚Äôƒ´) is a village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

When they go to Isprinsessan's and her father Bj√∂rn's figure skating performance, they, and also other people, get their wallets stolen. Committed by: Isprinsessan. She was tired with moving around and wanted to use the stolen money for paying for staying in Valleby. She learnt her little monkey Sylvester to go around and take people's wallets. But Polism√§staren didn't arrest her because in the end she left the wallets back to the people. Instead he allowed Isprinsessan to handle a fog machine and play an angel in the Christmas play. Part 13-16 A well-known author, Frank Franksson, returns to his former home town Valleby for reading his new book K√§rlek p√• Pr√§rien. Suddenly he and his friend Jonas Boklund, the owner of the book shop of Valleby, become angry to each other. When Frank reads the book, he stops before the end; the end has been \\"stolen\\". Committed by: No one committed some crime. Frank and Jonas were working \\"together\\"; Jonas wrote the books they claimed that Frank was the author of the books so they could make a better business. They promised that they should betray their secret after 10 books but Frank regretted it when he came to Valleby and then Jonas refused to give him the end of K√§rlek p√• Pr√§rien. Part 16-19 One day the rich √Öker√∂ family rent a room in Ronny Hazelwood's hotel. The next day their dog Ribston disappears and they require Ronny to pay them the worth of the dog; 200 000 SEK. Ronny becomes suspected, and even Pierre, the bellhop of the hotel, who has dog-allergy and refuses to work more if the dogs stays there. Committed by: The √Öker√∂ family. Every time they travelled to hotels and changed name and claimed that the dog disappeared so they could require the hotel owners to pay. Part 19-21 The Swedish gold is put in the bank vault in the bank of Valleby. The day when it is going to be transported to Stockholm, it's stolen, despite to the very advanced security system (which included laser flashes). Committed by: Hammar, the bank director and his college Rutger Bj√∂rkhage. Rutger, who won Olympics-gold-medal in gymnastics as young, could easily press himself into the gold box where he was hidden. At the night he put the gold bars in soap so they could \\"ski\\" through the floor under the laser flashes towards the door where Hammar took them. After throwing all of the gold bars, Rutger used his gymnastic-methods for going through the lasers. Part 22-24 Someone sends a cake to the theatre which Solskensorkestern and Muhammed Karat eat. Later they are ill and can't participate in the Christmas play but they get medicine. It's the first time Polism√§staren visits LasseMajas detektivbyr√• and when he goes away home someone kidnaps him. Committed by: Pr√§sten. Every day during December she tried to talk to Polism√§staren, trying to ask for participating in the Christmas play, but he couldn't any time and then she took him to the church. Lasse and Maja caught her but Polism√§staren ordered them to let her go and he let her to play Jesus in the Christmas play. ==References *LasseMajas detektivbyr√• on Internet Movie Database Category:Sveriges Television's Christmas Calendar Category:2000s Swedish television series Category:2006 Swedish television series debuts Category:2006 Swedish television series endings Category:Television shows set in Sweden Category:Swedish-language television shows ","title":"LasseMajas detektivbyr√• (TV series)"},{"id":"35254866","text":"Qazvin-Rasht Road Construction Company ( - Sher·∏µat HƒÅƒ´ RƒÅh SƒÅzƒ´ Ma·∏•≈´r Qazvƒ´n- Rasht) is a company town and village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Gharbi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The FAST corner detector was originally developed by Edward Rosten and Tom Drummond, and was published in 2006. The most promising advantage of the FAST corner detector is its computational efficiency. Referring to its name, it is indeed faster than many other well- known feature extraction methods, such as difference of Gaussians (DoG) used by the SIFT, SUSAN and Harris detectors. Moreover, when machine learning techniques are applied, superior performance in terms of computation time and resources can be realised. The FAST corner detector is very suitable for real- time video processing application because of this high-speed performance. == Segment test detector == The pixels used by the FAST corner detector FAST corner detector uses a circle of 16 pixels (a Bresenham circle of radius 3) to classify whether a candidate point p is actually a corner. Each pixel in the circle is labeled from integer number 1 to 16 clockwise. If a set of N contiguous pixels in the circle are all brighter than the intensity of candidate pixel p (denoted by Ip) plus a threshold value t or all darker than the intensity of candidate pixel p minus threshold value t, then p is classified as corner. The conditions can be written as: *Condition 1: A set of N contiguous pixels S, \\\\forall x \\\\in S, the intensity of x > Ip \\\\+ threshold, or I_x > I_p + t *Condition 2: A set of N contiguous pixels S, \\\\forall x \\\\in S, I_x < I_p - t So when either of the two conditions is met, candidate p can be classified as a corner. There is a tradeoff of choosing N, the number of contiguous pixels and the threshold value t. On one hand the number of detected corner points should not be too many, on the other hand, the high performance should not be achieved by sacrificing computational efficiency. Without the improvement of machine learning, N is usually chosen as 12. A high-speed test method could be applied to exclude non-corner points. == High- speed test == The high-speed test for rejecting non-corner points is operated by examining 4 example pixels, namely pixel 1, 9, 5 and 13. Because there should be at least 12 contiguous pixels that are whether all brighter or darker than the candidate corner, so there should be at least 3 pixels out of these 4 example pixels that are all brighter or darker than the candidate corner. Firstly pixels 1 and 9 are examined, if both I1 and I9 are within [Ip \\\\- t, Ip \\\\+ t], then candidate p is not a corner. Otherwise pixels 5 and 13 are further examined to check whether three of them are brighter than Ip \\\\+ t or darker than Ip \\\\- t. If there exists 3 of them that are either brighter or darker, the rest pixels are then examined for final conclusion. And according to the inventor in his first paper,Edward Rosten, Real-time Video Annotations for Augmented Reality on average 3.8 pixels are needed to check for candidate corner pixel. Compared with 8.5 pixels for each candidate corner, 3.8 is really a great reduction which could highly improve the performance. However, there are several weaknesses for this test method: # The high-speed test cannot be generalized well for N < 12\\\\. If N < 12, it would be possible that a candidate p is a corner and only 2 out of 4 example test pixels are both brighter Ip \\\\+ t or darker than Ip \\\\- t. # The efficiency of the detector depends on the choice and ordering of these selected test pixels. However it is unlikely that the chosen pixels are optimal which take concerns about the distribution of corner appearances. # Multiple features are detected adjacent to one another == Improvement with machine learning == In order to address the first two weakness points of high-speed test, a machine learning approach is introduced to help improve the detecting algorithm. This machine learning approach operates in two stages. Firstly, corner detection with a given N is processed on a set of training images which are preferable from the target application domain. Corners are detected through the simplest implementation which literally extracts a ring of 16 pixels and compares the intensity values with an appropriate threshold. For candidate p, each location on the circle x ‚àà {1, 2, 3, ..., 16} can be denoted by p‚Üíx. The state of each pixel, Sp‚Üíx must be in one of the following three states: * d, Ip‚Üíx ‚â§ Ip \\\\- t (darker) * s, Ip \\\\- t ‚â§ Ip‚Üíx ‚â§ Ip \\\\+ t (similar) * b, Ip‚Üíx‚â• Ip \\\\+ t (brighter) Then choosing an x (same for all p) partitions P (the set of all pixels of all training images) into 3 different subsets, Pd, Ps, Pb where: * Pd = {p ‚àà P : Sp‚Üíx = d } * Ps = {p ‚àà P : Sp‚Üíx = s } * Pb = {p ‚àà P : Sp‚Üíx = b } Secondly, a decision tree algorithm, the ID3 algorithm is applied to the 16 locations in order to achieve the maximum information gain. Let Kp be a boolean variable which indicates whether p is a corner, then the entropy of Kp is used to measure the information of p being a corner. For a set of pixels Q, the total entropy of KQ (not normalized) is: *H(Q) = ( c + n ) log2( c + n )- clog2c - nlog2n ** where c = { i ‚àà Q: Ki is true} (number of corners) ** where n = { i ‚àà Q: Ki is false} (number of non-corners) The information gain can then be represented as: *Hg= H(P) - H(Pb) - H(Ps) - H(Pd) A recursive process is applied to each subsets in order to select each x that could maximize the information gain. For example, at first an x is selected to partition P into Pd, Ps, Pb with the most information; then for each subset Pd, Ps, Pb, another y is selected to yield the most information gain (notice that the y could be the same as x ). This recursive process ends when the entropy is zero so that either all pixels in that subset are corners or non-corners. This generated decision tree can then be converted into programming code, such as C and C++, which is just a bunch of nested if-else statements. For optimization purpose, profile-guided optimization is used to compile the code. The complied code is used as corner detector later for other images. Notice that the corners detected using this decision tree algorithm should be slightly different from the results using segment test detector. This is because that decision tree model depends on the training data, which could not cover all possible corners. == Non-maximum suppression == \\"Since the segment test does not compute a corner response function, non-maximum suppression can not be applied directly to the resulting features.\\" However, if N is fixed, for each pixel p the corner strength is defined as the maximum value of t that makes p a corner. Two approaches therefore could be used: *A binary search algorithm could be applied to find the biggest t for which p is still a corner. So each time a different t is set for the decision tree algorithm. When it manages to find the biggest t, that t could be regarded as the corner strength. *Another approach is an iteration scheme, where each time t is increased to the smallest value of which pass the test. == FAST-ER: Enhanced repeatability == FAST-ER detector is an improvement of the FAST detector using a metaheuristic algorithm, in this case simulated annealing. So that after the optimization, the structure of the decision tree would be optimized and suitable for points with high repeatability. However, since simulated annealing is a metaheurisic algorithm, each time the algorithm would generate a different optimized decision tree. So it is better to take efficiently large amount of iterations to find a solution that is close to the real optimal. According to Rosten, it takes about 200 hours on a Pentium 4 at 3 GHz which is 100 repeats of 100,000 iterations to optimize the FAST detector. == Comparison with other detectors == In Rosten's research,Edward Rosten, FASTER and better: A machine learning approach to corner detection FAST and FAST-ER detector are evaluated on several different datasets and compared with the DoG, Harris, Harris-Laplace, Shi-Tomasi, and SUSAN corner detectors. The parameter settings for the detectors (other than FAST) are as follows: {  - ! Detector !!

Although denied by the Dutch, reports and letters sent at the time indicated that the Dutch instigated the attack and that some plundered goods were taken to Castle Orange next-door. Attempts were made to rebuild it in 1700, though these had to be abandoned because of hostility from the indigenous population. A new second fort had been built before 1726 as it was drawn by Smith (see picture top right), an African Company surveyor, and a floor plan given. In 1782 the fort was taken by the Dutch and destroyed, according to Claridge: \\"The only success scored by the Dutch during this war was the capture of the English fort at Sekondi, which they completely destroyed.\\" Though later transfers occurred, the fort was not rebuilt.

It was named after the late NASA astronaut and Orbital Sciences executive G. David Low. The flight was carried out by Orbital Sciences under contract to NASA as Cygnus' demonstration mission in the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The mission launched on September 18th, 2013 at 10:58 AM. Cygnus was the seventh type of spacecraft to visit the ISS, after the crewed Soyuz and Space Shuttle, and uncrewed Progress, ATV, HTV and Dragon. ==Spacecraft== The Orb-D1 mission was the first flight of the Cygnus spacecraft and used the standard configuration with a Pressurized Cargo Module. Orbital named this mission's Cygnus spacecraft the G. David Low after the former NASA astronaut and Orbital employee who died of cancer on 15 March 2008. During a media briefing for the CRS Orb-1 mission, Orbital Sciences executive vice president Frank Culbertson stated, \\"We were very proud to name that the G. David Low.\\" ==Launch and early operations== Cygnus Orb-D1 was launched by an Antares 110 rocket flying from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. The launch took place at 14:58:02.2 UTC on 18 September 2013, and successfully inserted the Cygnus into low Earth orbit. The launch marked the second flight of the Antares rocket and the final flight of the interim Antares 110 configuration. ==ISS rendezvous== Rendezvous with the ISS was originally scheduled for the fourth day of the mission. However, the rendezvous was postponed due to a computer data link problem. The exact error related to small discrepancies between the way the ISS and Cygnus each use GPS for timekeeping purposes. A further delay was necessary to allow for the arrival of Soyuz TMA-10M with three new ISS crew members. A week late, the spacecraft conducted a series of navigation, control and safety tests as it approached the station. Following the successful completion of ten test objectives, the spacecraft was cleared to make its final approach, holding below the ISS. Then, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano grappled it at 7 a.m. EDT (GMT-4), 29 September 2013, using the Canadarm2 remote manipulator system as the two spacecraft sailed high above the Indian Ocean. Cygnus was berthed to the nadir port of the station's Harmony node. ==Payload== Cygnus carried of cargo to the ISS, including food and spare parts.

Volume 28, pp. 71 - 82 . ==Early life== A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Gus Heege was the son of a prominent member of the city's police department. He attended the district school in nearby Brecksville where he entertained his fellow students with all manner of performances, giving an early indication of his acting talents.A History of Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland by William R. Coates, (Chicago: The American Historical Society, 1924). Soon after graduating from Cleveland's Central High School, he headed East to seek his fortune on the New York stage. ==Career== A talented actor, Heege often took the leading role in his productions. Although his output was varied, he is largely remembered for the Swedish immigrant trilogy, Ole Olson (1889), Yon Yonson (1890) and Yenuine Yentleman (1895). These plays established the character of the comic Swedish immigrant in American theater. Heege, who was of German ancestry, maintained that careful observation of the newcomers had enabled him to faithfully portray them on stage. A newspaper account told of his field research in the \\"Little Scandinavia\\" of northern Wisconsin, where large numbers of Swedes, Norwegians and Danes had settled.New York Times January 28, 1895. Not everyone found his characters believable. In reviewing Yon Yonson a critic wrote: \\"The hero is a Swede who speaks English with Scandinavian dialect, the accuracy of which is vouched for by Mr. William M. Dunlevy, the enterprising manager of the Park Theatre, and Mr. Jacob Litt, the manager of this particular play, who are old log-rollers themselves. We are quite willing to accept their word for it, especially as no man would be likely to invent such a dialect. But the Swedes and Norwegians we have in the East do not speak English in the Yon Yonson way.\\"New York Times December 29, 1891. The author Willa Cather gave a decidedly negative review to Heege's Rush City in the Nebraska State Journal while conceding that Yon Yonson had been a \\"very good comedy\\".The Willa Cather Archive cather.unl.edu. Retrieved June 06, 2015. In 1931 Cather wrote that before 1913, when her novel O Pioneers! was published, \\"the Swede had never appeared on the printed page in this country except in broadly humorous sketches; and the humor was based on two peculiarities: his physical strength and his inability to pronounce the letter 'J'\\".Willa Cather on writing: critical studies on writing as an art by Willa Cather, (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1988). Ben Hendricks (1868-1930) was the actor most associated with Heege's Scandinavian dialect plays. He starred in all three of them and toured with revivals of Ole Olson until 1912, over twenty years after the play's opening. ==Later years== In time Heege's portrayal of Swedish immigrants found both popular and critical acceptance. Heege died at his home in Cleveland on February 2, 1898, of kidney disease. After the playwright's death, the American Dramatists' Club passed the following resolution: \\"That in his demise the stage has been deprived of one of its truest dialectic disciples, an actor of refined quality, a pronounced genius in the depiction of Swedish and Scandinavian character, and a cheerful, charitable spirit.\\"New York Dramatic Mirror February 12, 1898.

The objective of a terminal operating system is to provide a set of computerized procedures to manage cargo, machines and people within the facility to enable a seamless link to efficiently and effectively manage the facility. Terminal operating systems can be stand alone systems, managed as a service or utilize cloud technologies. In its simplest form, the TOS can data track cargo in and out of a terminal. == Functions == A Terminal Operating System may be used to do some or all of the following functions:  Shipping  Terminals requiring various types of ship transport Container terminals using Containerization for LO-LO (lift on Lift Off) operations such as these require plans for efficiently loading and unloading Container ships docked within their Terminal. A port using RO-RO ships require plans for efficiently loading automobiles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers or railroad cars that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels.  Rail  Terminals that require the arrival and departure of cargo on trains such as container trains or bulk cargo.  Road  Handle the receival and release of Cargo for transshipment from other modes of transport or storage.  Yard management  Creating Shipping list or keeping track of Warehouse levels. Tracking machine moves around the terminal.  Invoicing/Reporting  Invoicing and providing reports for internal and external use.  Inventory  Keeping track of Inventory and storing its movements.  Cargo Type  Various types of cargo can be managed dependent of terminal type. Containers, Logs, Bulk Cargo. The ability to Pick and pack containers. ==External Clients== Terminals may wish to communicate with the following through their Terminal Operating System: *Terminal Operators *Freight forwarder *Shipping line or shipping agent *Container Operators * Port Authority * Customs Office == See also == Electronic data interchange ==External links== * How to Choose a Terminal Operating System Category:Logistics ","title":"Terminal Operating System"},{"id":"35255292","text":"Kikhanan (, also Romanized as Kƒ´khanƒÅn) is a village in Ilat-e Qaqazan-e Sharqi Rural District, Kuhin District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The battle concluded in a Wu victory. ==Background== After the Shu emperor Liu Bei was defeated by Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting, Sun benefited from his submission to the Wei ruler Cao Pi; who would help Sun in the conflict against Liu Bei. However, on both sides of the two forces, this was never a popular concept, especially in the ranks of Sun Quan, who defeated Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs 14 years ago after resisting surrender. To make matters worse, Cao Pi and his officers were uneasy about Sun's titles and ranks (such as King of Wu) because it was quite inappropriate since they were considered a vassal state under Wei. It was even considered within Sun Quan's forces that the alliance with Wei was pointless, because the defeat they caused Liu Bei at Xiaoting was so critical that it meant that their alliance with Wei was no longer necessary for survival. Sun Quan also appeared as if he was planning to have this alliance go not much longer than it was supposed to. In a matter of time, Cao Pi's plan to keep Sun Quan and Shu's relations sour backfired as Sun Quan and Liu Bei rekindled their alliance. In an attempt to improve his own relations with the Sun clan, he demanded Sun Deng (Sun Quan's eldest son) to be sent to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage. However Sun Quan declined this request, and later apologised to Cao Pi, stating his son was still very young and vulnerable in his health to be away from his home and family. Cao Pi did not bring up or press the matter. However Cao Pi demanded Sun Deng as hostage again soon. This was also declined. Diplomatic ties between the two continued to sour until finally, Cao Pi decided to attack Sun Quan. Sun Quan would repetitively send envoys to negotiate peace between the two, but resulted in failure. Soon after, Sun Quan would proceed to declare independence in November 222. ==The battle== First moves In late October 222, Cao Pi ordered Cao Xiu, Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to attack Dongkou (Ê¥ûÂè£); Cao Ren to attack Ruxu (Êø°È†à); and Cao Zhen, Xiahou Shang, Zhang He and Xu Huang to besiege Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°).(Áßã‰πùÊúàÔºåÈ≠è‰πÉÂëΩÊõπ‰ºë„ÄÅÂºµÈÅº„ÄÅËáßÈú∏Âá∫Ê¥ûÂè£ÔºåÊõπ‰ªÅÂá∫Êø°È†àÔºåÊõπÁúü„ÄÅÂ§è‰æØÂ∞ö„ÄÅÂºµÈÉÉ„ÄÅÂæêÊôÉÂúçÂçóÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 47. In response, Sun Quan put L√º Fan in command of five armies to resist Cao Xiu; Zhuge Jin, Pan Zhang and Yang Can (Ê•äÁ≤≤) were dispatched to relieve the siege on Nan Commandery which was being defended by Zhu Ran while Zhu Huan defended the fortress of Ruxu from Cao Ren.(Ê¨äÈÅ£ÂëÇÁØÑÁ≠âÁù£‰∫îËªçÔºå‰ª•ËàüËªçÊãí‰ºëÁ≠âÔºåË´∏ËëõÁëæ„ÄÅÊΩòÁíã„ÄÅÊ•äÁ≤≤ÊïëÂçóÈÉ°ÔºåÊú±Ê°ì‰ª•Êø°È†àÁù£Êãí‰ªÅ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 47. Wei offensive Initially, the Wei forces easily penetrated the Wu front lines, no doubt because of their strength. In addition, L√º Fan's forces were hit by a storm, causing serious damage, although Cao Xiu also achieved little out of his initial efforts because of the storm. He was hot-headed, and he had to be advised strongly by his troops. Dong Zhao also assured Cao Pi that Cao Xiu's troops would do this. Sun Quan was afraid when he heard that Zhang Liao was participating in the campaign, and said to his subordinates, \\"Zhang Liao may be ill, but he is still a foe to be reckoned with. Be careful!\\" Zhang Liao and the Wei generals later defeated L√º Fan.(Ê¨äÁîöÊÜöÁÑâÔºåÊïïË´∏Â∞áÔºö„ÄåÂºµÈÅºÈõñÁóÖÔºå‰∏çÂèØÁï∂‰πüÔºåÊÖé‰πãÔºÅ„ÄçÊòØÊ≠≤ÔºåÈÅºËàáË´∏Â∞áÁ†¥Ê¨äÂ∞áÂëÇËåÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

By this time it was early 223, and Cao Xiu ordered Zang Ba to attack Sun's small stronghold at Xuling. However, Zang Ba achieved nothing and was quickly defeated. Nonetheless, Cao Xiu eventually managed to gain the advantage as L√º Fan's forces were beginning to struggle. Turn of events and Wei retreat Miraculously, reinforcements arrived and L√º Fan's generals Sun Shao and Xu Sheng managed to resist the Wei forces, continuously gaining morale due to the Wei struggle at Nan commandery and other locations along the western area of the Yangtze. Eventually, Cao Xiu and the Wei forces at Dongkou were repelled and withdrew to the Wei capital Luoyang. ==Aftermath== Following the Wei defeat at Dongkou and failed invasion of the western Yangtze region, Sun Quan took his chance to launch an offensive during the summer of 223, successfully destroying the new Wei Commandery at Qichun. The success of Sun Quan during his resistance against the Wei invasions would soon inspire Sun Quan to declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu, being the last to establish the three dynasties during the Three Kingdoms period. Sun Lang, also was banished from the Sun clan, and had to change his name to Ding Lang and was expelled from the army. ==Order of battle== Wei forces * Senior General who Conquers the East (ÂæÅÊù±Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) Cao Xiu ** Military Adviser (ËªçÂ∏´) Zhao Yan * General of the Vanguard (ÂâçÂ∞áËªç) Zhang Liao * General Who Guards the East (ÈéÆÊù±Â∞áËªç) Zang Ba * Yin Li Sun Quan's forces * General of the Vanguard (ÂâçÂ∞áËªç) L√º Fan * General Who Stabilises the East (ÂÆâÊù±Â∞áËªç) He Qi * General Who Builds Martial Might (Âª∫Ê≠¶Â∞áËªç) Xu Sheng * General Who Spreads Might (ÊèöÂ®ÅÂ∞áËªç) Sun Shao * Lieutenant-General (ÂÅèÂ∞áËªç) Quan Cong * Sun Lang ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== In the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Wei general Zhang Liao was killed in this battle while defending Cao Pi from an attack by the Wu general Ding Feng.

Cao Pi held a grand funeral for Zhang Liao.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 86. ;Historicity Zhang Liao's biography in the Sanguozhi stated that he died of illness. In 222, he participated in the Battle of Dongkou against Wu forces even though he was ill. When Sun Quan heard that Zhang Liao was involved in the battle, he warned his men to be careful. Zhang Liao and other Wei generals defeated the Wu general L√º Fan in that battle.

For modern usage see Public health funeral. In the United Kingdom, a pauper's funeral was a funeral for a pauper paid for under the Poor law. This policy addressed the condition of the poor people Britain such as those living in the workhouses, where a growing population of the British ended their days from the 1850s to the 1860s. This period saw between 32 and 48 percent increase in the proportion of the elderly and the sick paupers in these institutions. An account described how poor people could not avail themselves of the funeral relief until they entered the workhouse. The phrase is still sometimes used, both in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, to describe a public health funeral (or equivalent service outside the UK): a basic burial paid for by the local authority when funeral arrangements cannot (or will not) be made by the family of the deceased. For instance, due to the inability of some families to pay for funeral costs the local authorities pay for the expenses of around 4,000 burials in the country every year. ==See also== * Potter's field ==References== Category:Funerals in the United Kingdom ","title":"Pauper's funeral"},{"id":"35255616","text":"Back to the Blues is a 1963 studio album by Dinah Washington, arranged by Fred Norman. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow said that \\"...after her unexpected success on the pop charts, most of Washington's sessions for Mercury and Roulette during the last four years of her life were quite commercial, with string arrangements better suited to country singers and Dinah nearly parodying herself with exaggerated gestures...In general, this is a more successful date than Washington's earlier investigation of Bessie Smith material, since the backup band is more sympathetic and the talented singer is heard in prime form.

The trains have since been phased out following a rationalisation of country branch line rail services in November 1983. The 400 Class power cars were built in 1938 at the Eveleigh Carriage Workshops, while the 500 Class trailer cars were built by Ritchie Brothers at Auburn. ==Power Cars== The 400 Class power cars followed the same general lines as the Silver City Comet powers vans, although they were slightly shorter in length at . They were fitted with two underfloor Leyland Diesel in-line six-cylinder, petrol engines coupled to Leyland Lysholm-Smith hydraulic transmissions. This was a repeat of the installation used in the earlier Rail Motor No.38. No multiple unit capability was provided. Each power car was capable of hauling one or two trailer cars. The mechanical equipment was mounted underfloor and a passenger compartment seating 19 Second Class passengers was provided at one end while the other was occupied by a large luggage compartment with a capacity of . FPH 404 was destroyed by fire at Narrandera in 1944. The remaining three were fitted with diesel engines between 1953 and 1957. They were fitted with two 150 horsepower GM Detroit Diesel 6/71 in-line six-cylinder, diesel engines and Twin Disc hydraulic torque converter transmissions. When built, the power cars had a toilet located in the front opposite the driver and the front window was covered by a metal plate which gave the driver limited vision at level crossings. The cars had a 'one-eyed' appearance and this earned them the nickname 'Lord Nelson'. The toilet was later moved to the rear of the passenger compartment and replaced by passenger seating. FPH 402 was modified in 1972 with the installation of a compartment seating eight First Class passengers and a toilet at the opposite end to the main passenger compartment and coded HPC. It was planned to extend this modification to 401 and 403 but with the decline in passenger numbers, it was considered too expensive to be repeated. The others simply had four seats in the main compartment allocated to First Class. With the decline in branch line patronage, the use of trailers became rare and some were reassigned to Sydney for suburban working, while those remaining in the country received little use. ==Trailer Cars== The 500 Class trailer cars were the same as those used on the Silver City Comet except that air-conditioning was not provided. The cars had two basic configurations, a composite sitting car (CT 501-504 and 506) and a Second Class sitting car (FT 505, 507 and 508). These last three were stored on completion in 1938 and finally entered service between 1941 and 1944. The trailer cars were initially delivered from the builder with Comet trailer numbers (213-220) but were renumbered into the 500 series before entering service. FT 505 was sent to Sydney to work with 42-Foot rail motors in 1951. The end doors were sealed and CPH operating equipment fitted. From 1951 onwards 501, 502, 504, 507 and 508 were fitted with a luggage compartment and coded as HCT. FT 506 and HCT 501 were later sent to Sydney and modified to work with CPH rail motors along the same lines as FT 505. ==Deployment== Two units were initially deployed to Dubbo for working to Coonamble, Molong and Gwabegar and two to Narranderra for working services to Junee, Tocumwal, Hay and Hillston. The Dubbo-based units were transferred Narrandera in the early 1940s and along with Rail Motor No.38 worked the southern branches until the 1970s. The three surviving 400 Class and No.38 were then transferred to north west with units being based at Werris Creek, Narrabri and Moree, where they remained until their retirement in November 1983. My name Is Gary Martin I was the Train equipment officer at Moree from 1969 to 1973, then Werris Creek 1973 to 1976, during my time a 400/500 class unit commenced working at Moree about 1971, replacing a 620 class set, probably due to passenger decline. In my time at these depots the 400 class was never stationed at Narrabri or Werris Creek. However it may have after my resignation in December 1976. ==Radio Test Car== HPC 402, along with trailer FT 501, was purchased by the Rail Motor Society, Paterson in 1984. In August 1986 HPC 402 was leased back to the State Rail Authority and after an overhaul used as a radio system test unit operating across NSW.\\"Rail Motor 402 Back to the SRA\\" Railway Digest October 1986 page 324 Initially for six months it would not be until July 2000 that it returned to the society after travelling 200,000 kilometres.History of the Rail Motor Society Rail Motor Society It has continued to see regular main line use often being hired by train companies as a route learner of for executive inspections.

Trailers HCT 504 and 508 and reprieved from the sale and were converted to parcel trailers for the Silver City Comet. They were painted in the Comet's distinctive silver and blue livery and recoded PT. They were withdrawn with the other Comet vehicles in 1989. HPC 401 and 403 and trailer CT 503 are preserved at the Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum, while HPC 402 and trailer FT 501 are preserved in the collection of the Rail Motor Society.

Mother Catherine Cauch√©s (centre) and her two daughters Guillemine Gilbert (left) and Perotine Massey (right) with her infant son burning for heresy ==Trial== Guillemine Gilbert and Perotine Massey were sisters, who lived with their mother, Catherine Cauch√©s (sometimes given as \\"Katherine Cawches\\"). Perotine was the wife of a Norman Calvinist minister, who was in London, possibly to avoid persecution. The three women were brought to court on a charge of receiving a stolen goblet. Although they were found to be not guilty of that charge, it emerged that their religious views were contrary to those required by the church authorities. They were returned to prison in Castle Cornet and later found guilty of heresy by an Ecclesiastical court held in the Town Church and handed over to the Royal Court for sentencing where they were condemned to death. ==Execution== The execution was carried out on or around 18 July 1556. All three were burnt on the same fire; they ought to have been strangled beforehand, but the rope broke before they died and they were thrown into the fire alive.Guernsey Museums and Galleries: The Story of Catherine Cauch√©s and her Daughters John Foxe recorded that Perotine was \\"great with child\\" and that \\"the belly of the woman burst asunder by the vehemence of the flame, the infant, being a fair man-child, fell into the fire\\". The baby was rescued by a W. House and laid on the grass, taken by the Provost to the Bailiff, Hellier Gosselin who ordered that \\"it should be carried back again, and cast into the fire\\". The Acts And Monuments Of The Christian Church By John Foxe: 350. Katharine Cawches, Guillemine Gilbert, Perotine Massey, and an Infant, the Son of Perotine Massey ==Legacy== On the death of Queen Mary (1558), the Bailiff and the Roman Catholic √©lite of the island were subjected to a series of commissions and investigations encompassing not only the circumstances of the execution of the women, but also embezzlement; James Amy, the Dean, was committed to prison in Castle Cornet and dispossessed of his living. Gosselin was dismissed from his post in 1562 but along with the Jurats managed to obtain a pardon from Elizabeth I. Reactions to the executions played a role in the rise of Calvinism in the Channel Islands.Compare: Ogier, Darryl Mark (1997), Reformation and Society in Guernsey, Boydell Press, (p. 62) In 1567 Thomas Harding criticised Foxe's account, not for his description of the event, for which Foxe quotes eye-witnesses and official documents, but on the grounds that Perotine Massey was responsible for the death of her own child; had she revealed in court that she was pregnant, the execution would have had to have been postponed until after the birth. Levin, Carole (1981), Women in The Book Of Martyrs as Models of Behavior in Tudor England, University of Nebraska - Lincoln (pp. 202 - 203) A memorial plaque to the martyrs can be found on the Tower Hill steps in Saint Peter Port, near the site of the execution.

Chinwangtao is a strategic deep water port near where the Great Wall of China meets the sea.

After World War II, the base was again used by the Marines until 1947, when it was caught up in the Chinese Civil War and evacuated. There is a possibility that Camp Holcomb is the location of the missing Peking Man fossils.

It is regarded as an intermediate-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C language. == What type of language is C++? == C++ can be described as all of the following: * Programming language ‚Äî artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely. ** Compiled language ‚Äî programming language implemented through compilers (translators which generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no translation takes place). ** General-purpose programming language ‚Äî programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains. ** Intermediate language ‚Äî language of an abstract machine designed to aid in the analysis of computer programs. The term comes from their use in compilers, where a compiler first translates the source code of a program into a form more suitable for code- improving transformations, as an intermediate step before generating object or machine code for a target machine. ** Object-oriented programming language - programming language based on \\"objects\\", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, known as methods. An object's procedures can access and modify the data fields of the objects. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. ** Statically typed programming language == General C++ concepts == * Name resolution ** Argument-dependent name lookup ‚Äî applies to the lookup of an unqualified function name depending on the types of the arguments given to the function call. This behavior is also known as Koenig lookup, named after its inventor Andrew Koenig (programmer). * Auto-linking ‚Äî mechanism for automatically determining which libraries to link to while building a C or C++ program. It is activated by means of \`#pragma comment(lib, )\` statements in the header files of the library. * Classes ‚Äî Classes define types of data structures and the functions that operate on those data structures. Instances of these datatypes are known as objects and can contain member variables, constants, member functions, and overloaded operators defined by the programmer. The C++ programming language allows programmers to separate program-specific datatypes through the use of classes. * Exception guarantees * Header file * Inner class * One Definition Rule * Opaque pointer * Plain old data structure * Rule of three (C++ programming) * Run-time type information * Sequence point * Single Compilation Unit * Special member functions * Substitution failure is not an error * Template (C++) * Template metaprogramming * Traits class * Undefined behavior * Virtual function calls == Issues == * Compatibility of C and C++ == C++ Toolchain ==  C++ compilers   C++ libraries  C++ Standard Library The C++ standard library is a collection of utilities that are shipped with C++ for use by any C++ programmer. It includes input and output, multi-threading, time, regular expressions, algorithms for common tasks, and less common ones (find, for_each, swap, etc.) and lists, maps and hash maps (and the equivalent for sets) and a class called vector that is a resizable array. Many other functions are provided by the standard library, but mainly in a form designed for building on top of to create third party libraries. * Standard Template Library (STL) Other notable libraries * Active Template Library * Adaptive Communication Environment * Algorithmic skeleton * Apache C++ Standard Library * Armadillo (C++ library) * Artefaktur * Asio C++ library * AT&T; FSM Library * ATL Server * BALL * Blitz++ * Boehm garbage collector * Boost (C++ libraries) * Borland Graphics Interface * Botan (programming library) * C++ AMP * CGAL * Cinder (programming library) ‚Äî framework for advanced visualization capabilities. * ClanLib * CodeSynthesis XSD * CodeSynthesis XSD/e * CppUnit * Crypto++ * CTPP * D-Bus * Database Management Library * Dinkumware * Effi (C++) * Eigen (C++ library) * GDAL * GDCM * GiNaC * Gtkmm * HOOPS 3D Graphics System * Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) ‚Äî a multi-threaded software library of functions for multimedia and data processing applications, produced by Intel. * Juce * Kakadu (software) * KFRlib - cross-platform, optimized audio and DSP library. * LEMON (C++ library) * LevelDB * Libarc * LibLAS * Libsigc++ * Libx (graphics library) * LiteSQL * LIVE555 * Loki (C++) * Math Kernel Library (MKL) ‚Äî a library of optimized math routines for science, engineering, and financial applications, produced by Intel. * Matrix Template Library * Metakit * Microsoft Foundation Class Library * Object Windows Library * Object-oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy * ODB (C++) * OGRE * Open Asset Import Library * Open Inventor * OpenImageIO * Oracle Template Library * Orfeo toolbox * POCO C++ Libraries * Podofo * Poppler (software) * PTK Toolkit * Qt (framework) * RWTH FSA Toolkit * Sound Object (SndObj) Library * Stapl * SymbolicC++ * Threading Building Blocks (TBB) ‚Äî C++ template library developed by Intel Corporation for writing software programs that take advantage of multi-core processors. * VTD-XML * Windows Template Library * WxWidgets * Xcas * Xerces * YAAF See also * List of C++ multi-threading libraries * List of C++ multiple precision arithmetic libraries * List of C++ template libraries == History of C++ == * History of C++ * Programming languages that influenced C++ ** C ** Simula ** Ada 83 ** ALGOL 68 ** CLU ** ML * Standardisation History ** C++98 ‚Äî In 1998, the C++ standards committee standardized C++ and published the international standard ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (informally known as C++98). ** C++03 ** C++11 ‚Äî Approved by ISO as of 12 August 2011, replacing C++03.

Charm++ is designed with the goal of enhancing programmer productivity by providing a high-level abstraction of a parallel program while at the same time delivering good performance on a wide variety of underlying hardware platforms. ** Embedded C++ ‚Äî dialect of C++ for embedded systems, built \\"to provide embedded systems programmers with a subset of C++ that is easy for the average C programmer to understand and use\\".EC++ Questions and Answers *** Embedded system ‚Äî computer system designed for specific control functions for a facility, machine, or device in which it is embedded as an integrated part of the product. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. * R++ ‚Äî rule-based programming language developed by Bell Labs in the 1990s, based on C++. * Sieve C++ Parallel Programming System ‚Äî C++ compiler and parallel runtime designed and released by Codeplay that aims to simplify the parallelization of code so that it may run efficiently on multi-processor or multi-core systems. * ŒúC++  C++ language extensions  * AspectC++ ‚Äî aspect-oriented extension of C and C++ languages. * C++/CLI ‚Äî Microsoft's language specification intended to supersede Managed Extensions for C++. It is a complete revision that aims to simplify the older Managed C++ syntax (which is now deprecated). C++/CLI is standardized by Ecma as ECMA-372. It is currently available only in Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015 (also included in the Express Editions). ** Common Language Infrastructure ‚Äî open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ISO and ECMA that describes the executable code and runtime environment that form the core of the Microsoft .NET Framework and the free and open source implementations Mono and Portable.NET. * C++/CX ‚Äî language extension for C++ compilers from Microsoft that enables C++ programmers to write programs for the new Windows Runtime platform, or WinRT. It brings a set of syntax and library abstractions that interface with the COM-based WinRT programming model in a way that is natural to native C++-programmers. * Cilk Plus ‚Äî multithreaded parallel computing extension of C and C++ languages. * CUDA C/C++ ‚Äî compiler and extensions for parallel computing using Nvidia graphics cards. * Managed Extensions for C++ ‚Äî deprecated Microsoft set of deviations from C++, including grammatical and syntactic extensions, keywords and attributes, to bring the C++ syntax and language to the .NET Framework. These extensions allowed C++ code to be targeted to the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the form of managed code as well as continue to interoperate with native code.

The first Mass was celebrated on the Feast of Christ the King, October 28, 1956, in a Phoenix storefront. Several supply priests served the growing mission parish until the first vicar, the Reverend Rodney Cobb, arrived in December 1957. By 1958, the church had reached 150 parishioners and had purchased farmland property to provide ecclesiastical, office, and school facilities. In 1959, the Reverend Lewis H. Long arrived from Abilene, Kansas. Under his leadership, the mission entered a period of growth and became a full parish in 1961. A five-acre site was purchased at 39th Avenue and Maryland. In June 1964, ground was broken for the new St. Mary's church building. The first Mass was said in December 1964, with a dedication the following Spring. The Close and Memorial Garden were created in 1980. St. Mary's Manor, an adjacent retirement facility, opened in April 1993 and accommodates forty people in individual apartments. After Fr. Long's retirement in 1993, the Reverend Derrick Wedderburn was served as Interim Rector until January 1995, when the Reverend Robert Nagy was named Vicar. The Reverend William C. Rhodes became the second rector of St. Mary's in July 1999, renovating the building and retiring in 2003. The Reverend Paulette Schiff served as interim rector, until Fr. Rhodes returned as parish priest in 2005. In 2010, the Reverend R. Craig Bustrin became the current vicar of St. Mary's. On August 2, 2014, an accidental structural fire in the Hispanic Ministries office destroyed or damaged many parts of the building and forced the congregation outside. Sunday Mass was said outdoors until the congregation re-entered the building 42 weeks later on June 21, 2015. ==Music and arts== A Christmas Eve procession with choir and incense from midnight Mass in 2016. The parish organ is a Thomas W. Whalley Organ, built in Berkeley, California, in 1907. The organ features three divisions, 12 ranks, and 689 pipes. St. Mary's is known for its Anglo-Catholic liturgy, with a Solemn sung Mass celebrated every Sunday. The altar crucifix was hand-carved in Oberammergau, Germany, and the church bell is from El Buen Samaritano, after that mission closed its doors in 1960. ==References *St. Mary's parish website *St. Mary's Music *The Episcopal Diocese of Arizona Category:Churches in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Episcopal church buildings in Arizona Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Anglo-Catholic church buildings in the United States ","title":"St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Phoenix)"},{"id":"35256429","text":"Registry card of Ervin Feldheim as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp Ervin Feldheim (Kassa, September 21, 1912 - Bor, 1944) was a Hungarian mathematician working on analysis, particularly, approximation theory.

Formula 3 shows that the entry in the triangle is obtained recursively by adding numbers to the left and above in the triangle. The earliest appearance of the Catalan triangle along with the recursion formula is in page 214 of the treatise on Calculus published in 1800 by Louis Fran√ßois Antoine Arbogast.

The following shows how every path from the bottom left (0,0) to the top right (k, n) of the diagram that crosses the constraint n-k+m-1 = 0 can also be reflected to the end point (n + m, k - m). 450x450px We consider three cases to determine the number of paths from (0,0) to (k, n) that do not cross the constraint: (1) when m > k the constraint cannot be crossed, so all paths from (0,0) to (k, n) are valid, i.e. C_{m}(n,k)=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} n+k\\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{array}\\\\right). (2) when k - m + 1 > n it is impossible to form a path that does not cross the constraint, i.e. C_{m}(n,k)= 0 . (3) when m\\\\leq k\\\\leq n+m-1 , then C_{m}(n,k) is the number of 'red' paths \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} n+k\\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{array}\\\\right) minus the number of 'yellow' paths that cross the constraint, i.e. \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} (n+m)+(k-m)\\\\\\\\\\\\ k-m \\\\end{array}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} n+k\\\\\\\\\\\\ k-m \\\\end{array}\\\\right). Thus the number of paths from (0,0) to (k, n) that do not cross the constraint n - k + m - 1 = 0 is as indicated in the formula in the previous section \\"Generalization\\".  Proof 2  Firstly, we confirm the validity of the recurrence relation C_{m}(n,k)=C_{m}(n-1,k)+C_{m}(n,k-1) by breaking down C_{m}(n,k) into two parts, the first for XY combinations ending in X and the second for those ending in Y. The first group therefore has C_{m}(n-1,k) valid combinations and the second has C_{m}(n,k-1). Proof 2 is completed by verifying the solution satisfies the recurrence relation and obeys initial conditions for C_{m}(n,0) and C_{m}(0,k). ==See also== *Pascal's triangle ==References== Category:Triangles of numbers ","title":"Catalan's triangle"},{"id":"35256523","text":"Rivers and Homes is the second full-length album by J.Viewz.

Rather than directly identifying or counting individual cells in an environmental sample, these techniques show how many variants of a gene are present. In general, it is assumed that each different gene variant represents a different type of microbe. Community fingerprinting is used by microbiologists studying a variety of microbial systems (e.g. marine, freshwater, soil, and human microbial communities) to measure biodiversity or track changes in community structure over time. The method analyzes environmental samples by assaying genomic DNA. This approach offers an alternative to microbial culturing, which is important because most microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory. Community fingerprinting does not result in identification of individual microbe species; instead, it presents an overall picture of a microbial community. These methods are now largely being replaced by high throughput sequencing, such as targeted microbiome analysis (e.g., 16s rRNA sequencing) and metagenomics. ==Use== A fingerprinting analysis begins with an environmental sample (e.g. seawater or soil), from which total DNA is extracted. (Total DNA contains a mix of genetic material from all the microbes present in the sample.) A particular gene or DNA region is then selected as a target for analysis, under the assumption that each microbe species will have a different gene variant (also called a \\"phylotype\\"). Different methods (see below) can be used to visualize the phylotypes present in a sample. Because the aim of community fingerprinting is to gain an overall understanding of community structure, it is a particularly useful technique for analyzing time- series data collected from the field. For example, one could study the pattern of microbial succession in a habitat, or one could examine the response of a microbial community to an environmental perturbation, such as the release of a pollutant. Depending on what information is desired, different genes may be targeted. The most common are small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, such as 16S rRNA. These genes are frequently used in microbial phylogenetic analyses, so well-established techniques exist for their study. Other genes of interest might be those that are key in various metabolic processes. ==Advantages and disadvantages== The advantages of community fingerprinting are that it can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply, and the analyses can accommodate a large number of samples simultaneously. These properties make community fingerprinting especially useful for monitoring changes in microbial communities over time. Also, fingerprinting techniques do not require one to have a priori sequence data for organisms in a sample. A disadvantage of community fingerprinting is that it results in largely qualitative, not quantitative data. When using qualitative data, it can be difficult to compare patterns observed in different studies or between different investigators. Also, community fingerprinting does not directly identify taxa in an environmental sample, though the data output from certain techniques (e.g. DGGE) can be analyzed further if one desires identification. Some authors point to poor reproducibility of results for certain fingerprinting methods, while other authors have criticized the inaccuracy of abundance estimates and the inability of some techniques to capture the presence of rare taxa. For example, it is difficult for the DGGE method to detect microbes that comprise less than 0.5%-1% of a bacterial community. ==Techniques== This section presents three methods of community fingerprinting. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a method that uses fluorescently-labeled DNA fragments to produce a community fingerprint. This section presents a brief explanation of T-RFLP in the specific context of community fingerprinting. For a more detailed explanation, refer to the T-RFLP article. Procedure To perform T-RFLP (Figure 1), one must select a target gene (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) to amplify by PCR. At least one primer used in the PCR reaction is fluorescently labeled at the 5¬¥ end. After PCR amplification, each copied DNA segment carries the fluorescent label. Next, restriction enzymes are used to cut the amplified DNA at specific recognition sites. The underlying assumption is that each microbe in the sample will have a different sequence on the target gene, so a restriction enzyme will cut each microbe's DNA in a different place. (Each different restriction site is considered to represent a single operational taxonomic unit [OTU]). Thus, the enzyme will produce one fragment length for each type of microbe present in the sample. The result of digestion is a set of restriction fragments of different lengths, each of which is fluorescently labeled at one end. These are known as \\"terminal fragments\\" because they are labeled at the end where the PCR primer attached. (The unlabeled ends are not recorded in the final analysis.) Next, the fragments are separated by size through either gel or capillary electrophoresis. Laser detection captures the size and fluorescence-intensity patterns of the terminal fragments. DNA standards of known size and fluorescence are included in the analysis as references. By setting a minimum threshold for fluorescence, background noise will be excluded. Figure 1. Steps of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for a single microbial community with 3 phylotypes Data output and interpretation The output of the laser detection step is an electropherogram that shows a series of peaks, with fragment length on the horizontal axis and fluorescence intensity on the vertical axis (Figure 1). A second output is a data table that lists the migration time of the fragments, the size in base pairs of each peak, and the height of and area under each peak. The theoretical basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent different types of organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats must be taken into account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than absolute abundance, and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis. This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu et al. cite other possible factors that may distort results, including \\"differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification\\" (p. 4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process. Advantages and disadvantages The major advantages of T-RFLP are that it is fast and can easily accommodate many samples. Also, the visual output simplifies comparison of community structure patterns across different samples. A disadvantage is the broad, qualitative nature of the data output, which must be interpreted with the above caveats in mind. Also, direct identification of microbes in a sample is not possible through T-RFLP. Applications Disayathanoowat et al. used T-RFLP to assess the microbial gut community, or microbiome, in two species of honeybees in Thailand. They found that the two species harbor different microbial communities and that the microbiome changes over the lifetime of the bees. Joo et al. tested T-RFLP as a method for phytoplankton monitoring. The authors collected environmental water samples from reservoirs in a time series. After comparison of samples with known terminal restriction fragments (from a database built from cultures), they concluded that T-RFLP can be used effectively as a technique for monitoring changes in the phytoplankton community. However, diversity and abundance estimates were found to be less accurate than those found through other methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) Procedure Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is a microbial fingerprinting technique that separates amplicons of roughly the same size based on sequence properties (Figure 2). These properties dictate the threshold at which DNA denatures. The DGGE gel uses a gradient DNA denaturant (a mixture of urea and formamide), or a linear temperature gradient. When the fragment reaches its melting point (threshold of enough denaturant), it stops moving. This is due to the fact that a partially melted double-stranded DNA can no longer migrate through the gel. A GC clamp (about 40 bases with high GC content) is used as a special primer to anchor the PCR fragments together once they have denatured. Figure 2. The microbial fingerprinting technique called Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The diagram demonstrates how samples from different microbial communities can be compared. Data output and interpretation Each lane on a gel represents one microbial community. The shared bands among the samples are the same size and roughly the same position on the gel. The gene variants that are not shared amongst microbial community samples do not match up horizontally with others. For example, if the gene of interest is 16S rRNA, as it was when the technique was first described, the PCR-amplified fragments will be in the same vertical location because they are all roughly the same size. Another target gene may have greater variation in length, but the denaturant gradient uses a second element (of melting point) to further distinguish between the samples. The DGGE gel will separate genes of the same size based on base sequence. This technique shows to what extent microbial communities are the same or different in taxonomic composition. Each band in a different location on the gel represents a different phylotype (one unique sequence of a phylogenetic marker gene). For microbial communities this method profiles many individual 16S rRNA sequences. The number of bands at differing horizontal positions can be used to estimate the level of biodiversity in that sample and infer phylogenetic affiliation. In order to know more about phylogenetic affiliation, one could excise those bands from the gel and then sequence them. Advantages and disadvantages The use of denaturing profile serves as a way to separate DNA fragments of similar sizes. This is beneficial in assessing microbial diversity due to the fact that the 16S rRNA gene does not vary much in size across bacterial phyla. The DGGE gel provides a quick way of looking at biodiversity in a microbial sample and does not preclude the option of sequencing the bands of interest. This method does not require that the microbes be cultured in the lab and does not require any sequence data needed to design probes for hybridization methods. The main disadvantage is that this is a qualitative assessment of biodiversity and one must sequence the genes in order to make inferences about the phylogenetic relatedness. Another disadvantage is that the GC clamp can be variable each time it is synthesized. This leads to the potential for different DGGE profiles for the same 16S rRNA sequence. Applications Stephen et al. utilized DGGE for a rapid analysis of Proteobacteria in soil. They obtained an initial assessment of microbial diversity in their environmental samples from soil maintained for 36 years at the various pH values. They combined DGGE and hybridization techniques by probing the DNA fragments to obtain more detail about the natural populations. In this study, they were looking at a group of closely related bacterial types, all autotrophic Œ≤‚Äìproteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. The 16S rDNA samples yielded ambiguous overlapping bands when run out on a gel. The ambiguous overlapping bands were separated with cluster- specific radiolabelled probes, which yielded information of the relative abundance of the different genotypes in samples. Ward et al. examined cyanobacterial mat communities in a Yellowstone hot spring by using DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene segments of aerobic chemoorganotrophic populations. DGGE allowed them to profile the community gaining new insight to diversity. They characterized the bands of interest by purifying and sequencing and detected many lineages previously unknown to be present. (Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA)  Procedure (Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, or (A)RISA (Figure 3), takes advantage of the fact that prokaryotic DNA encodes for two highly conserved genes, the 16SrRNA gene and the 23SrRNA gene. These encode the small and large subunit genes in the rRNA operon. Between these two genes, there is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Due to the fact it is non-coding for proteins, it is a highly variable nucleotide sequence and length. Once DNA is isolated from a community, PCR amplifies this spacer region. The fragments can be run out on a gel (RISA), or the fluorescent primers can be translated into peaks in abundance of the different fragments lengths on an electropherogram (ARISA). Figure 3. The microbial fingerprinting technique called (Automated) Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis. The diagram shows the output of both Automated RISA (Pathway 1) or RISA (Pathway 2). Data output and interpretation Due to variable non-coding regions, the output for RISA is a gel with different banding patterns, and output for ARISA is an electropherogram with different peaks (similar to T-RFLP). The brightness of the fluorescently labeled primers correlates to how prevalent that bacterial type is in the community. The banding pattern on the gel can be interpreted as a community-specific profile. Each DNA band or peak indicates at least one representative of that organism. In RISA, the bands on gel that do not match up in length represent different organisms in the community because they have different spacer regions between the two highly conserved genes. The electropherogram shows peaks correlating to the relative abundance of that spacer region in the sample. Advantages and disadvantages ARISA can have a higher resolution in detecting microbial diversity as compared to T-RFLP. This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities can be compared to databases for overlap with culturable organisms. One can design phylum-level oligonucleotide primers to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups. One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment. Applications Ranjard et al. discuss several examples of types of studies in which RISA can be used. They cite several studies that have used this technique to fingerprint bacterial communities following such disturbances as antibiotic treatment, mercury stress and deforestation. They also demonstrated the successful use of ARISA for characterizing fungal communities, which is an aspect of microbial ecology that remains to be fully explored. Schloss et al. conducted a study examining environmental variables and linking them to changes in the microbial ecology of a compost pile. They used ARISA to profile the community structure and look at microbial succession over stages in the composting process. They took DNA samples and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify community members at the different phases of the process. Then they used ARISA to look at community-wide changes and then matched up the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the most common ARISA fragments to identify these microbial community members. ==References== Category:Molecular biology Category:Environmental microbiology Category:Biodiversity Category:Molecular biology techniques ","title":"Community fingerprinting"},{"id":"35256697","text":"Richard Neil Lyons (born January 22, 1945 in New York City, New York) is an American mathematician, specializing in finite group theory.

His parents decide to send him away to France and then Switzerland. In Switzerland, he sees a woman referred to only as \\"the Lady\\". The Lady is older, in her thirties. After several days of exchanging lustful glances, they actually meet. She invites him to her apartment, where they share a sexual relationship for three weeks. Eventually, Paul learns the Lady is actually the queen of a Russian dependency and her husband, the king, is abusive towards her. She disappears after the titular three weeks; Paul is upset and returns to England. Paul later discovers that the Lady has given birth to their son. With his father's assistance, he finds out the Lady's identity; however, before they can meet again, she is murdered by her husband. Paul is upset and spends the next five years wandering around from country to country, until he decides to make preparations to meet his son. ==Reception== Critical reception was negative in the United Kingdom and United States. The book was described as disjointed, \\"dull and stupid\\", \\"boring, vulgar and extremely silly\\". Critics also made personal attacks on Glyn, saying she was complacent, her writing immature, and she was \\"indifferent to her own reputation\\".Academy, June 29, 1907.Athenaeum, June 22, 1907.Literary Digest, October 26, 1907.Nation, October 10, 1907.\\"Prurient and Worse Yet---Dull\\", New York Times, September 28, 1907.

It was adapted again in the 1924 version, made by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by Alan Crosland under the supervision of Glyn, and starring Conrad Nagel and Aileen Pringle. ==In popular culture== * A sexual scene in Three Weeks inspired the doggerel: ::Would you like to sin ::With Elinor Glyn ::On a tiger skin? ::Or would you prefer ::To err with her ::On some other fur? * Among the funniest of S. J. Perelman's writings is his series of pieces Cloudland Revisited, in which, as a middle-aged man, he re- reads and describes the risqu√© novels that had thrilled him as a youth. Tuberoses and Tigers deals with Glyn's Three Weeks. Perelman described it as \\"servant-girl literature\\" and called Glyn's style \\"marshmallow\\".

To this, another member responds: \\"Who the hell is Elinor Glyn?\\" The Air Marshal replies: \\"Oh, just a name, you know, put in to make it rhyme.\\" This was both a snub to the Air Marshal and a literary snubbing of Glyn by Waugh. * In the 1973 film Blood for Dracula directed by Paul Morrissey, the character Rubinia (a potential \\"bride\\" of the Count) mentions that she is reading Three Weeks. This is used as a subtle comedic touch, as the Count is searching for a virginal victim. * In the 1957 musical The Music Man, the librarian asks Mrs. Shin if she wouldn't want her daughter reading a classic rather than Elinor Glyn.

B. Tolpygo, was a Soviet physicist and a corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. He was recognized for his works on condensed matter theory; the theory of phonon spectra in crystals; electronic structure and defects in insulators and semiconductors; and biophysics. He created the Department of Theoretical Physics and the Department of Biophysics at Donetsk National University.Tolpygo K. B. Visnyk Akademiyi Nauk Ukrainskoyi RSR, Kyiv, May, 1986. no. 5 p108 Tolpygo was a teacher, mentor and scientific adviser to graduate students. Tolpygo was awarded the Order of the Great Patriotic War (2nd Degree). ==Early life== Tolpygo was born during WWI in Kyiv, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. His father, Boris Nikolaevich Tolpygo (1889 ‚Äì 1958) was a jurist who received the Order of St. Stanislaus for his services to the Russian army during World War I. Tolpygo's mother, Tatiana B. Bukreeva (1889 ‚Äì 1992), was the daughter of Boris Yakovlevich Bukreev, a mathematician and geometer at Kyiv University (University of St. Volodymyr, Kyiv).\\"Bukreev\\" History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk. accessed 3 April 2012 In 1923, Tolpygo's father was arrested by the Cheka, for alleged \\"counter-revolutionary\\" activities.Golinkov D.

Through the intervention of individuals such as Raymond Poincar√©, President of France, he avoided execution and was sentenced to 10 years hard labor.Golinkov D. L. \\"Krushenie antisovetskogo podpolia v SSSR,\\" Kniga 2, Moscow, Politizdat, 1978, pp. 180‚Äì186 In 1947, Tolpygo's father was again imprisoned. It was 1957 before he would return to Kyiv, shortly before his death. Hence, Tolpygo grew up in the family of his grandfather, Boris Y. Bukreev. ==Education== Tolpygo's life was complicated by being the son of a political prisoner. Nevertheless, he was allowed to enter Kyiv University. After graduating from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty in 1939, he went on to post graduate study at the Institute of Physics of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences and started his research work in theoretical physics. His scientific adviser was Solomon Isaakovich Pekar, creator of the theory of polarons.Pekar S. I. \\"Untersuchung uber die Elektronentheorie der Kristalle\\" Akademie Verlag, Berlin (1954).Pekar S. I. \\"Research in electron theory of crystals\\". United States Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, DC (1963). ==Military service== In November 1939, Tolpygo was drafted into the Red Army and served in the artillery section during World War II from 1941 to 1945. He was wounded during the Yelnya Offensive in 1941. He returned to Kyiv in 1945 when all physicists were recalled from active duty to work on the atomic bomb and other projects, and to restore universities and research institutions destroyed during the War. ==Scientific career== On returning to Kyiv, Tolpygo restarted work on his PhD thesis and helped in restoring the University. From 1945 to 1966 Tolpygo was teaching theoretical physics at Kiev State University. One of his students was Emmanuel Rashba, who became a prominent theoretical physicist and credited his success in significant part to Tolpygo's guidance and support.Rashba E. \\"Kirill Borisovich Tolpygo: Teacher, Advisor and Scientist\\" Low Temperature Physics/Fizika Nizkikh Temperatur, 2016, v. 42, No. 5, http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:27733691 From 1963, Tolpygo was Professor of Physics, and from 1960 to 1966 he was Chair of the Department of Theoretical Physics. Concurrently, from 1948 to 1960, he worked as a Senior Scientist at the Institute of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of UkrSSR, Kiev. He received his Candidate of Sciences (PhD) degree in 1949 and his Doctor of Sciences in 1962. In 1965 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of UkrSSR. In 1966, Tolpygo moved with his family from Kiev to Donetsk, Ukraine. From 1966 to 1988 he worked as Head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at Donetsk Physical-Technical Institute (DonPTI) of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and at the same time was Professor and Chair of the Department of Theoretical Physics at Donetsk State University. ==Support of dissidents== Tolpygo joined the movement of the \\"Sixtiers\\" (shestidesiatniki) and signed a letter to the Soviet authorities in support of dissidents Alexander Ginzburg and Yuri Galanskov. As a result, his position at Kyiv University was jeopardized. At the time, academician Alexander A. Galkin was organizing a new scientific center in Donetsk, Ukraine. His aim was to decentralize scientific research and promote science and technology in regional Ukraine.Krivoruchko D. V. \\"DŒünetsk Institute for Physics and Engineering ‚Äì History\\" Donphti.ac.donetsk.ua Accessed 3 April 2012 Galkin convinced Tolpygo to join him in Donetsk and create there a new school of theoretical physics, far from political scrutiny. ==Later life== From 1988 to his death in 1994 Tolpygo worked as Principal Scientist at the DonPTI and continued to teach physics at the university. Tolpygo also enjoyed music. He practiced the piano regularly. The Beethoven piano sonatas were among his favorites. In his later years, Tolpygo developed an interest in ecology and environmentalism. ==Family life== Tolpygo had four children: Alexey (a mathematician, chess player, and political writer) and Natalia (musician and piano teacher) from his first marriage in 1946 to Oksana Fedorivna Tomasevych, a theoretical physicist, and Sergey (a condensed matter physicist) and Vladimir (a materials scientist), from a second marriage in 1959 to Yelena Isaakovna Kaplunova Tolpygo, also a physicist. ==Scientific work== Crystal lattice dynamics and polaritons Between 1949 and 1956, Tolpygo built a quantum-mechanical theory of crystal lattice dynamics. It included deformation of electronic shells of ions and effects of retardation.Tolpygo K. B. \\"Physical properties of a rock salt lattice made up of deformable ions.\\" Zh.Eks.Teor.Fiz. v.20, No 6, pp.497‚Äì509 (1950), in Russian.

B. \\"Present state of the theory on polarization of ideal ionic and valence crystals.\\" Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk, v. 74, no. 2, pp. 269‚Äì288 (1961). In the theory of crystal lattice dynamics this model is now known as Tolpygo model, a model of deformable ions, or a \\"shell model\\".Upadhyay G. K. \\"Solid State Physics (Lattice Dynamics of Ionic Solids)\\", Laxmi Publication Ltd, New Delhi, 1st Edition: 2008, p37.Kaplan H. and Sullivan J. J. \\"Lattice Vibrations of Zincblende Structure Crystals.\\" Phys. Rev. 130, 120‚Äì129 (1963). In 1950, he predicted bound states of photons and optical phonons in ionic crystals, now known as lattice polaritons. A year later the same result was independently obtained by Kun Huang using a different method. These mixed states were subsequently investigated experimentally. S.I. Pekar proposed to name these states 'light excitons.' However, this name did not stick and term polaritons proposed by Hopfield is used. Later, Tolpygo generalized his theory to describe homopolar crystals (Si, Ge, diamond, etc.), cryocrystals of noble gases, and molecular crystals by introducing long-range Coulomb interactions in their lattice dynamics.Tolpygo K. B. \\"Long-range forces and the dynamical equations for homopolar crystals of the diamond type.\\" Soviet Physics - Solid State, v. 3, no. 3, pp. 685‚Äì693 (1961).Mashkevich V. S. and Tolpygo K.

B. \\"Optical, elastic and piezoelectric properties of ionic and valence crystals with ZnS-type lattice.\\" Soviet Physics - Solid State, v. 2, no. 10, pp. 2367‚Äì2376 (1961). On this basis, he developed a microscopic theory of optical and elastic properties of crystals. A number of new effects were predicted, e.g., generation of an electric field (electromagnetic wave) in a crystal by a nonuniform deformation (wave). This effect is now known as flexoelectric effect. In 1961, Tolpygo predicted generation of sound by moving current carriers, now a well known effect in acousto-electronics. Tolpygo applied his theory of deformable ions to study the small-radius localized states of electrons in solids. This theory accounted for the interaction of electrons with phonons of all branches and wavelengths, and was applied to the theory of polaritons, F-centers, and excitons in alkali halide crystals.  Kinetic phenomena in semiconductors  Tolpygo also worked on kinetic phenomena in semiconductors and their phenomenological theory: theory of bipolar carrier diffusion,Rashba E. I. and Tolpygo K.

He developed a theory of defect formation at intrinsic optical absorption; a microscopic theory of optical absorption by crystals; and a microscopic theory of Cherenkov radiation as it results from generation of light-excitons (polaritons) by the field of a moving relativistic electron.Tolpygo E.

Biophysics In addition to condensed matter physics, Tolpygo was also interested in biophysics. He proposed an original microscopic theory of muscle contraction based on the idea that the energy of decomposition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule is transferred along the chains of hydrogen bonds between actin and myosin polymers causing their mutual motion.Tolpygo K. B. \\"Possible role of hydrogen-bonds in conformational changes in biopolymers and carrying out their macroscopic displacements.\\" Studia Biophysica, v. 69, no. 1, pp. 35‚Äì51 (1978). This theory allowed him to explain experimental features of muscle contraction, such as the relation of tension to velocity as described by Hill's muscle model.

Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether a town ordinance regulating a use of a property was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, finding the law in question was constitutional as an exercise of the town's police powers. ==Summary== In 1962, Herbert W. Goldblatt filed a complaint against the town of Hempstead, New York claiming that a town ordinance regulating dredging and pit excavating on his property prevented him from continuing his business and therefore takes his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court conceded that the law completely prohibited a prior use by Mr. Goldblatt who had operated a gravel pit for 30 years. But the Court held that depriving the property of its most profitable use does not make the law unconstitutional. ==Background== Herbert Goldblatt owned a 38-acre tract within the town of Hempstead, New York. His business, Builders Sand and Gravel Corporation, had been mining sand and gravel at this site continuously since 1927. During the first year the excavation depth reached the water table causing the excavated area to fill with water. This process continued from 1927 through 1962 so that the original crater became a 20-acre lake with an average depth of 25 feet. The town of Hempstead grew and expanded around this excavation until within a radius of 3500 feet there were 2200 homes and four public schools. In 1945 the town enacted Ordinance No. 16 in an attempt to regulate mining excavations within its limits. This ordinance provided that such pits must be enclosed by a wire fence and must comply with berm and slope requirements. Goldblatt complied with this ordinance but in 1956 the town sought an injunction against further excavation as being in violation of a zoning ordinance. The town's zoning case failed because Goldblatt was found to be conducting prior non-conforming use on the premises. In 1958 the town amended Ordinance No.16 to prohibit any excavating below the water table and to require back filling of any excavation below that level. This amendment also made the berm, slope and fence requirements more stringent. In 1959 the Town of Hempstead filed an action to prohibit Goldblatt from further mining on the grounds that he had not complied with amended Ordinance 16. Goldblatt argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not regulatory of his business but was completely prohibitory and confiscated his property without compensation, that it deprived him of the benefit of the favorable judgment arising from the previous zoning litigation, and that it constituted ex post facto legislation. The trial court decided against Goldblatt and he was enjoined from conducting further excavations on the lot until he had complied with the new provisions of Ordinance 16. Though the ordinance completely prohibits a beneficial use to which the property has previously been used, the question regarding unconstitutionality was resolved by the fact that if the ordinance was considered a valid exercise of the town's police powers, depriving the property of its most beneficial use does not render it unconstitutional. The ordinance was in fact found to be a valid example of the town's police powers. ==Opinion of the Court== Mr. Goldblatt argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it '1) was not regulatory of his business but completely prohibitory and confiscated his property without compensation, 2) it deprived him of the benefit of the favorable judgement arising from the previous zoning litigation, and 3) it constituted ex post facto legislation.' While Justice Clark conceded that the ordinance did prohibit a beneficial use that the property had provided previously, he stated that this fact in itself did not determine whether or not the ordinance was unconstitutional. If the ordinance is otherwise a valid use of the town's police powers, the fact that it deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not mean it is unconstitutional. Justice Clark wrote that the real question was whether or not it fell within the town's police power to prohibit further excavation below the water table. He defined police power as 'public encroachment upon private interests'. The guiding principles about police power that Justice Clark took from Lawton v. Steele, were: Does the public require this interference and are the remedies reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals? Justice Clark addressed the question of whether the ordinance was a reasonable one by pointing out that the ordinance was passed as a safety measure. There was concern about children burrowing under the fence but there was no indication as to whether deepening the lake would increase the danger to them. There was not any information brought in the case to show that the ordinance would be costly to Mr. Goldblatt. Justice Clark pointed out that the onus was on Mr. Goldblatt to show that the ordinance was unreasonable. Justice Clark referenced past cases of Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, , Salsburg v. Maryland, , and United States v. Carolene Products Co., , all of which were decided that similar situations regarding reasonableness had not been disproved, so he concluded that this must stand as a valid policing regulation. On Goldblatt's claim that he was subjected to ex post facto legislation, Justice Clark responded that the regulation of excavating in this case did not undermine a previous decision in favor of Mr. Goldblatt regarding zoning issues. The making of a new ordinance regarding safety was unconnected to the old ordinance regarding zoning. Justice Clark addressed Goldblatt's further claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it imposed upon him to re-fill the excavation and to erect a new fence or to face penalties or imprisonment. This claim was based on the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder and ex post facto legislation. Justice Clark found that these were not the issues being addressed in this case; the issue was regarding further excavation, and Mr. Goldblatt would need to bring a specific suit to address these issues at another time. ==Influence on other cases== *Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, - The case involves a city placing restrictions on the development of individual historic landmarks in addition to those imposed by applicable zoning ordinances without effecting a \\"taking\\" that would require the payment of just compensation. *Andrus v. Allard - This case involves the confiscation of and halting the sale of protected eagle parts. The court found that this prohibition on commerce in eagle artifacts does not constitute an unconstitutional taking because the ability to sell the property is but one strand in the owner's bundle of property rights. The denial of one property right does not automatically equate a taking. *Abraham Moskow vs. Commissioner of Environmental Management & others 384 Mass. 530 (1981) - A restrictive order of the Commissioner of Environmental Management under the Inland Wetlands Act, forbidding the dredging, filling, or other alteration of an area of wetland comprising approximately 55% of a parcel of undeveloped land, was not such an extensive interference with the use of the parcel as a whole that it constituted a taking. ==References* * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Warren Court Category:United States Fourteenth Amendment case law Category:1962 in United States case law ","title":"Goldblatt v.

The college was closed due to provincial government cutbacks in the 1993 budget. It closed in the spring of 1994. The college originally provided diplomas in Agricultural Business Management, Animal Health Technology, Food Service Management, and Home Economics.

It was one of the first pressurized water guns ever made, outselling all of the motorized blasters that had previously dominated the market. Another air pressurized water gun, the Cosmic Liquidator, was made in the late 1970s but it never was popular. ==History== In the early 1980s, a rocket scientist named Lonnie Johnson was working on a heat pump system, and was testing it in his bathroom. A powerful stream shot from his prototype, and he immediately realized that this could make a great water gun. Lonnie Johnson spent the next eight years trying to sell his idea. Eventually, Johnson sold the idea to Larami Toys, and they released the Power Drencher. The Power Drencher wasn't very popular at first, but popularity grew significantly when they renamed it the Super Soaker 50. Since then, there have been hundreds of other Super Soaker models.

Although its epicentre lay just offshore near Ch≈çshi city, the shallow magnitude 6.1 Mj earthquake produced considerable shaking inland through much of the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula and lower Ibaraki Prefecture. It occurred as a result of normal faulting in a seismically quiet region, possibly in response to the magnitude 9.0 Mw 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. ==Effects== Despite its considerable magnitude the earthquake caused only localised light to moderate structural damage in Chiba, owing in part to Japan's advanced earthquake engineering. The most significant effects occurred in Ch≈çshi and Katori cities, where a few walls collapsed and several buildings sustained damage. In Funabashi city an elderly resident suffered a fatal heart attack during the quake, and a falling object caused one minor injury in Kisarazu city. ==Background== A seismically volatile country, Japan frequently experiences natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. The entire archipelago forms a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a massive belt of volcanoes and trenches. The largest of the islands, Honshu is characterised by numerous inland fault systems and large subduction zones which are a result of the interaction between several tectonic plates. At the junction of the continental Okhotsk Plate and the oceanic Philippine Sea and Pacific plates lies the populous Kant≈ç Region, which has had a long history of devastating earthquakes. Situated on the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula in eastern Kant≈ç, Chiba Prefecture is surrounded by a region of complex tectonic settings. To the south the Philippine Sea Plate is subducted beneath Okhotsk Plate creating the offshore Sagami Trench; the Pacific Plate subducts the region from the east, forming the Japan Trench. Despite this Chiba Prefecture has experienced relatively little effects from earthquakes. Since 1923 most events have occurred well offshore, within the magnitude 5.0-6.0 Mj range, at somewhat shallow focal depths. * The most significant earthquake, known as the 1987 Chiba-ken Toho-oki earthquake, occurred on 17 December 1987. == See also == *List of earthquakes in 2012 *List of earthquakes in Japan == References  External links == * Chiba earthquake Chiba earthquake Category:Earthquakes in Japan Category:March 2012 events in Asia ","title":"2012 Chiba earthquake"},{"id":"35257480","text":"The League for Marche (Lega per le Marche, LpM) is a regionalist political party active in Marche, Italy.

It houses Trafford Council and a number of other local government authorities. The building faces Emirates Old Trafford to the south and is within 500 metres of Manchester United's Football Ground to the north. ==History== Before the construction of the town hall, the forerunner authority, Stretford Urban District Council, held its meetings in the District Council Offices on Talbot Road in Old Trafford (subsequently known as Trafford Public Hall and now known as the Trafford Hall Hotel). The building now known as Trafford Town Hall stands on a large previously undeveloped site at the junction of Talbot Road and Warwick Road in Stretford, England. It was designed by architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope of Bolton on behalf of Stretford Municipal Borough, and built by the main contractor Edwin Marshall & Sons. Work began on 21 August 1931, funded by a government grant of ¬£88,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ); the building was officially opened as Stretford Town Hall on the granting of Stretford's charter on 16 September 1933. The steel- framed building has two stories plus basement and attic floors, with a mansard roof. Set in landscaped grounds with a sunken garden, it is constructed of brick in Flemish bond with gritstone dressings. It originally consisted of a main front with a wing on each side, until a rear extension was added between the wings in 1983, enclosing an inner courtyard. The building was constructed with a portico with a doric order column and a pillar on either side and a wrought-iron parapet with a circle motif above. The design also included a clock tower which rises in stages. Inside the building, on either side of the central staircase are bronze statues, one of Electra, the symbol for sparking light, and the other of Nj√∂r√∞r, the God of wind and sea. In 1974, on the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, the new council adopted the town hall as its base, renaming it Trafford Town Hall. It was renovated in the early 1980s, in a schedule of work that included the addition of a underground nuclear fall-out shelter; the shelter was subsequently used for storage until its closure in 2011. Trafford Town Hall was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007. In 2011, the 1983 extension was demolished, and the 1933 original building refurbished, with new offices added. The refurbishment works, which were intended to create an open-plan environment, were designed by 5plus Architects and undertaken by Shepherd Developments.

It is considered to be the first example of the new style of Raumplan. Raumplan was very different from its predecessor Free Plan in its internal spatial organization. While not as well known as some of other of Loos‚Äô houses, this set the precedent for his later designs. ==Basic design== The house is an almost cube like volume and the internal space is 10m by 10m. The exterior walls are load bearing leaving the interior walls to partition space. A central column runs through the house hiding the plumbing and also acting as a framing device on the second floor. This central column is a grounding agent, connecting the entire house and acting as a point of reference. ==Rufer House and Raumplan== Raumplan sets out to emulate a natural landscape internalized through interconnecting volumes and the Rufer House does this through its multilevel organization on a single floor. While both the first and second floors of the house have this split- level distinction, the second floor is the one best seen as Raumplan. The second floor is made up of the living area on the lower level and the dining room on the higher level. The dining area is seen as a part of the living area and thus its volumes intersect. The level change gives the dining room volume a distinction from the living room volume. A small staircase connects the two levels. The central column of the building, while creating the distinction between the two volumes, also frames the space creating a diagonal view through the house between the lower and upper levels of the floor. The private study found on this floor is seen as separate. It is a solid volume that is disconnected from the continuous spaces of the living and dining areas and grounds the floor to the exterior walls. Finally, the terrace that connects to the living room is an outdoor space that was carved out from the interior space and is overhung by the floor above it. This suggests that it is both an outdoor and indoor space and blurs this threshold. ==Exterior== Loos was very adamant about the pure form of the cube above all and decoration is kept to a bare minimum. The walls are a stark white and the windows frames contain the least amount of structure. This, however, is balanced by the frieze and cornice that runs along the top of the building, and a replica of some portions of the Parthenon frieze positioned on the street side low enough for viewing. The frieze and cornice tie together the entire building while still contributing to the austere nature and seeming almost invisible. The Parthenon replications are seen to balance out the voids and surfaces on the building (windows and walls) while at the same time balancing the purist abstraction of the ideal cube form. The panels tie in the history of western architecture and seem to project the idea that Adolf Loos was a classical architect and not a radical. Another key part of the Rufer house is the seemingly random arrangement of windows. With the blank white walls giving no distraction, the most noticeable aspect of the house are the windows. While from the exterior the windows make no sense to the casual viewer, from the interior the windows make perfect sense. These interiorly programed windows give light and views where they make sense on the inside. They continue the diagonal view through the second floor previously mentioned and give light where needed in the denser spaces. ==Gallery== {  thumb  thumb  thumb } == Bibliography == #Adolf Loos, Le Corbusier.

He was selected in the fourth round, 100th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Amateur Wideman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. As a youth, he played in the 2003 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Louis Blues minor ice hockey team. Wideman played high school hockey for Chaminade College Preparatory School. In 2007, Wideman joined the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders of the USHL where he played one year of Tier I junior hockey before entering Miami University in 2008. After one season at Miami, Wideman was drafted in the fourth round, 100th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. During his four-year stint in Miami, he helped the RedHawks earn their first two Frozen Four appearances, a national championship game appearance, and their first CCHA tournament title. Professional Ottawa Senators On March 28, 2012, the Senators signed Wideman to a two-year, entry-level contract. After graduating from Miami, he joined the Senators' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators for the 2012‚Äì13 season. In his first professional season, Wideman scored two goals and 18 points in 60 games. He also skated in five games for the Elmira Jackals of the ECHL. Wideman played another two full seasons with Binghamton, and had a career-year during the 2014‚Äì15 season. After recording 19 goals and 61 points in 75 games, he was awarded the Eddie Shore Award as the league's best defenseman. On June 29, 2015, the Senators re-signed Wideman to a one-year, two-way contract worth $600,000. He made his NHL debut on October 17, 2015 against the Nashville Predators. On November 7, in his fourth game, Wideman scored his first NHL goal in a 3-2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. During the 2017‚Äì18 season, Wideman underwent surgery to repair a hamstring injury, ending his season. Despite this, Wideman signed a one-year contract extension with the Senators on June 24, 2018. Edmonton Oilers, Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins During the 2018‚Äì19 season, on November 22, 2018, Wideman was traded by the Senators to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a 2020 conditional sixth-round pick. Over the course of a month with the Oilers, Wideman featured in only 5 games for 2 assists before he was dealt for a second time within the season, leaving the Oilers along with a 2019 third- round pick, to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Alex Petrovic on December 30, 2018. Wideman made his Panthers debut in a 4-3 overtime defeat to the Columbus Blue Jackets on January 5, 2019, before he was placed on waivers the following day. He cleared waivers and was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Springfield Thunderbirds, where he collected 3 goals and 13 points through 16 games from the blueline. At the trade deadline, Wideman's journeyman season continued as he was dealt for the third time, traded by the Panthers to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Jean-S√©bastien Dea on February 25, 2019. He was assigned to report directly to AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Wideman and former Senators' teammate Matt Duchene are named Players of the Game for Team USA and Team Canada respectively at the 2016 World Championship Anaheim Ducks As a free agent from the Penguins, Wideman was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Anaheim Ducks on July 16, 2019. He did not feature for the Ducks during the 2019-20 season, assigned to AHL affiliate the San Diego Gulls, posting 31 points through 53 games before the remainder of the season was cancelled due to COVID-19. Abroad As an impending free agent from the Ducks, Wideman opted to pursue a career abroad in agreeing to a one-year contract with Russian club, Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the KHL, on June 1, 2020. ==Career statistics== Regular season and playoffs { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Involution numbers were first studied in 1800 by Heinrich August Rothe, who gave a recurrence equation by which they may be calculated,. giving the values (starting from ) :1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, ... . ==Applications== John Riordan provides the following explanation for these numbers: suppose that a telephone service has subscribers, any two of whom may be connected to each other by a telephone call. How many different patterns of connection are possible? For instance, with three subscribers, there are three ways of forming a single telephone call, and one additional pattern in which no calls are being made, for a total of four patterns.. For this reason, the numbers counting how many patterns are possible are sometimes called the telephone numbers... Every pattern of pairwise connections between subscribers defines an involution, a permutation of the subscribers that is its own inverse, in which two subscribers who are making a call to each other are swapped with each other and all remaining subscribers stay in place. Conversely, every possible involution has the form of a set of pairwise swaps of this type. Therefore, the telephone numbers also count involutions. The problem of counting involutions was the original combinatorial enumeration problem studied by Rothe in 1800 and these numbers have also been called involution numbers... In graph theory, a subset of the edges of a graph that touches each vertex at most once is called a matching. The number of different matchings of a given graph is important in chemical graph theory, where the graphs model molecules and the number of matchings is known as the Hosoya index. The largest possible Hosoya index of an -vertex graph is given by the complete graphs, for which any pattern of pairwise connections is possible; thus, the Hosoya index of a complete graph on vertices is the same as the th telephone number.. A standard Young tableau A Ferrers diagram is a geometric shape formed by a collection of squares in the plane, grouped into a polyomino with a horizontal top edge, a vertical left edge, and a single monotonic chain of horizontal and vertical bottom and right edges. A standard Young tableau is formed by placing the numbers from 1 to into these squares in such a way that the numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom throughout the tableau. According to the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence, permutations correspond one-for-one with ordered pairs of standard Young tableaux. Inverting a permutation corresponds to swapping the two tableaux, and so the self-inverse permutations correspond to single tableaux, paired with themselves.A direct bijection between involutions and tableaux, inspired by the recurrence relation for the telephone numbers, is given by . Thus, the telephone numbers also count the number of Young tableaux with squares. In representation theory, the Ferrers diagrams correspond to the irreducible representations of the symmetric group of permutations, and the Young tableaux with a given shape form a basis of the irreducible representation with that shape. Therefore, the telephone numbers give the sum of the degrees of the irreducible representations. In the mathematics of chess, the telephone numbers count the number of ways to place rooks on an chessboard in such a way that no two rooks attack each other (the so-called eight rooks puzzle), and in such a way that the configuration of the rooks is symmetric under a diagonal reflection of the board. Via the P√≥lya enumeration theorem, these numbers form one of the key components of a formula for the overall number of \\"essentially different\\" configurations of mutually non-attacking rooks, where two configurations are counted as essentially different if there is no symmetry of the board that takes one into the other.. ==Mathematical properties== Recurrence The telephone numbers satisfy the recurrence relation :T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1)T(n-2), first published in 1800 by Heinrich August Rothe, by which they may easily be calculated. One way to explain this recurrence is to partition the connection patterns of the subscribers to a telephone system into the patterns in which the first subscriber is not calling anyone else, and the patterns in which the first subscriber is making a call. There are connection patterns in which the first subscriber is disconnected, explaining the first term of the recurrence. If the first subscriber is connected to someone else, there are choices for which other subscriber they are connected to, and patterns of connection for the remaining subscribers, explaining the second term of the recurrence. Summation formula and approximation The telephone numbers may be expressed exactly as a summation :T(n) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor}\\\\binom{n}{2k}(2k-1)!! = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor}\\\\frac{n!}{2^k (n-2k)! k!}. In each term of this sum, gives the number of matched pairs, the binomial coefficient \\\\binom{n}{2k} counts the number of ways of choosing the elements to be matched, and the double factorial is the product of the odd integers up to its argument and counts the number of ways of completely matching the selected elements. It follows from the summation formula and Stirling's approximation that, asymptotically, :T(n) \\\\sim \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{e}\\\\right)^{n/2} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\sqrt{n}}}{(4e)^{1/4}}\\\\,... Generating function The exponential generating function of the telephone numbers is :\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{T(n)x^n}{n!}=\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{x^2}{2}+x\\\\right).. In other words, the telephone numbers may be read off as the coefficients of the Taylor series of , and the th telephone number is the value at zero of the th derivative of this function. This function is closely related to the exponential generating function of the Hermite polynomials, which are the matching polynomials of the complete graphs. The sum of absolute values of the coefficients of the th (probabilist) Hermite polynomial is the th telephone number, and the telephone numbers can also be realized as certain special values of the Hermite polynomials: :T(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\mathit{He}_n(i)}{i^n}. Prime factors For large values of , the th telephone number is divisible by a large power of two, . More precisely, the 2-adic order (the number of factors of two in the prime factorization) of and of is ; for it is , and for it is .. For any prime number , one can test whether there exists a telephone number divisible by by computing the recurrence for the sequence of telephone numbers, modulo , until either reaching zero or detecting a cycle.

The isotopic ratios of radionuclides are used to get an accurate measurement for the elemental analysis of a sample. Singly charged ions of the sample are formed by the thermal ionization effect. A chemically purified liquid sample is placed on a metal filament which is then heated to evaporate the solvent. The removal of an electron from the purified sample is consequently achieved by heating the filament enough to release an electron, which then ionizes the atoms of the sample. TIMS utilizes a magnetic sector mass analyzer to separate the ions based on their mass to charge ratio. The ions gain velocity by an electrical potential gradient and are focused into a beam by electrostatic lenses. The ion beam then passes through the magnetic field of the electromagnet where it is partitioned into separate ion beams based on the ion's mass/charge ratio. These mass-resolved beams are directed into a detector where it is converted into voltage. The voltage detected is then used to calculate the isotopic ratio. ==Ionization source== The filaments used are made from tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), platinum (Pt) or rhenium (Re). Conventionally, there are two filaments used in TIMS. One filament is for the sample and is called the sample filament. The liquid sample is placed on the sample filament which is then evaporated to create ions. Subsequently, these ions land on the other filament, also known as the ionization filament. Here, the ion loses an electron by ionization. Two filaments in thermal ionization mass spectrometry The single filament method is also possible. Once the sample evaporates, the ions can settle back down onto the same filament to get ionized. The use of a triple filament or multifilament set-up improves ionization efficiency and provides the rate of evaporation and ionization to be controlled separately. Filaments need to be loaded with activators. An activator represses the evaporation of the desired element and can either increase or decrease the ionization potential of the filament. This results in high ionization efficiency and a higher total yield. The most common activator is silica gel/phosphoric acid for Pb. The filaments are in a vacuum that can reach temperatures anywhere from 400-2300¬∞C. In order to prevent any damage to the filaments, they are firmly fixed onto a carousel-like sample turret which normally has 10 to 20 filament assemblies. The evaporation process is usually conducted at relatively low temperatures in exchange for long-lasting signals and minor isotopic fractionation. The ionization part requires high temperatures to ensure good ionization efficiency. The ions emitted have low spatial and energetic spread which makes a single-focusing magnetic sector mass analyzer or quadrupoles suitable. The most common detectors used for TIMS is Faraday cup, Daly detector, and electron multiplier. Customarily, TI ion sources are assembled with multicollector (MC) systems. ==Thermal ionization mechanism== When the hot filament heats the liquid sample, the fermi levels within the sample reaches parity with that of the metal. In turn, this allows for an electron to tunnel from the sample to the metal filament. As a result, positive ions are formed from the sample that lost an electron. This transferring of electrons also result in the formation of negative ions. Subsequently, there are two types of thermal ionizations. One is positive thermal ionization (P-TI) and the second is negative thermal ionization (N-TI). The production of ions is parameterized by the Saha ionization equation or the Saha-Langmuir equation. == Isotope ratio measurement == The relative abundances of different isotopes are then used to describe the chemical fractionation of different isotopes, travel in different reservoirs of non-radiogenic isotopes, and age or origins of solar system objects by the presence of radiogenic daughter isotopes.Lehto, J., X. Hou, 2011. Chemistry and Analysis of Radionuclides. Wiley-VCH.Dickin, A.P., 2005. Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 21-22 Elemental analysis is a predominant application of TIMS as it gives reliable isotopic ratios. Following the trend of decreasing ionization energy, elements located towards the bottom left of the periodic table are viable for TIMS. In addition, the high electron affinity seen towards the upper right of the periodic table makes these nonmetals excellent candidates. The technique is used extensively in isotope geochemistry, geochronology, and in cosmochemistry. Quantitative isotope ratio techniques include isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) and chemical abrasion thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS). Isotope dilution method is used because the signal intensity in TIMS isn't proportional to the amount that is placed into TIMS. For age dating, mass spectrometers with magnetic sectors have better precision than a quadrupole mass spectrometer or quadrupole mass analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole mass spectrometers allows for an even higher precision of detecting the change of isotopic ratios by radioactive decay. The more precision means the higher resolution in age dating. ==References== Category:Mass spectrometry ","title":"Thermal ionization mass spectrometry"},{"id":"35258791","text":"For 1979 in television, see: *1979 in American television *1979 in Australian television *1979 in Belgian television *1979 in Brazilian television *1979 in British television *1979 in Canadian television *1979 in Croatian television *1979 in Danish television *1979 in Dutch television *1979 in Estonian television *1979 in German television *1979 in Irish television *1979 in Japanese television *1979 in New Zealand television *1979 in Philippine television *1979 in Scottish television *1979 in South African television ","title":"1979 in television"},{"id":"35258814","text":"Liberty Hill is an unincorporated community in Greene County, Tennessee, United States.

His paternal grandfather was Los Angeles city attorney W.B. Mathews. He grew up in Hollywood, graduated from the Flintridge Preparatory School, and enrolled in Pomona College in 1948 at the age of 16. As a sophomore, he met Charlotte Dallett, a chemistry student. Mathews also played shortstop for two years on Pomona‚Äôs baseball team. In June 1952, Mathews and Charlotte were married. He then graduated summa cum laude in Mathematics. Mathews received a Fulbright Scholarship, and moved with Charlotte to England for his year of study at Cambridge University.

It was originally ordered by Steve Fossett for an attempt on the Challenger Deep, to become the first solo dive there.Virgin Oceanic, Sub (accessed 27 March 2012)CNet News, Steve Fossett's unfinished legacy: Deepest ocean exploration, Daniel Terdiman, 3 October 2008 (accessed 27 March 2012) Planning for the submarine started in 2000.New York Times, \\"The Challenger‚Äôs Deep-Sea Brethren\\", Andy Isaacson, 27 March 2012 (accessed 27 March 2012) It was put on the ordersheet in 2005, with a depth capability of 37,000 ft.Hawkes Ocean Technologies, Infosheet DeepFlight Challenger (accessed 27 March 2012) The craft was named \\"Challenger\\" after the Challenger Deep by Fossett. At the time of the order, this would have doubled the depth that a single-place sub would be capable of going. It was to have been a \\"secret project\\" of Fossett's to be the first to solo the Challenger Deep, and was secret at the time of his death in 2007.KGO- TV ABC 7, \\"Fossett's secret project was built in Richmond\\", Thursday 2 October 2008 (accessed 27 March 2012) The project was put on hold when Fossett died, and locked up in a warehouse at Hawkes Ocean Technologies, by the then owners, Fossett's estate, but was later revived when Chris Welsh of Deep Sub LLC bought the unfinished sub and restarted the program in 2010. Welsh had purchased the sub and the Cheyenne yacht from the Fossett estate for around $1 million.

The viewdome is made from quartz, while the rest of the pressure hull uses carbon/epoxy composites. The interface between dome and hull is by bonded titanium rings. The sub has a 24hour endurance, 3kt bottom speed, and 350 ft/min dive rate.CBS News, \\"With Virgin Oceanic, Branson wants to go deep, really deep\\", 5 April 2011 (accessed 27 March 2012)Composites World, \\"Deepsea submersible incorporates composite pressure capsule\\", Sara Black, 31 August 2010 (accessed 27 March 2012) Without ballast attached, the sub is positively buoyant, it uses syntactic foam for buoyancy. The submarine does not have a temperature control system for the cabin, so will tend towards ambient temperature.Virgin Oceanic, Branson Answers Kids Questions , 2012 Jan 19 (accessed 27 March 2012) The sub weighs 8000 lbs, and does not need a dedicated mothership. It has a 15 mi range, 6kt maximum speed, and 3-axis freedom of motion. It uses LED lighting instead of arc lights, and has a laser navigation system.

Virgin Oceanic had hoped to be the first team to solo to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and first team to return to the Challenger Deep since the Bathyscaphe Trieste, the first submersible to dive to the Challenger Deep, left, however, James Cameron's Deepsea Challenge project beat them to it in March 2012.

It was produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company and sponsored by the Arts Council, BP and Lottery with about 60 participating organisations including the BBC, British Museum, National Theatre, the Barbican Centre, the Almeida Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe. This festival began on 23 April 2012 and finished in November 2012. It included approximately 70 productions related to Shakespeare's plays, over half of which were performed in a language other than English (particularly those which formed part of the Globe to Globe Festival at Shakespeare's Globe). Shakespeare also featured in the BBC's 'Shakespeare Unlocked' 2012 season (particularly The Hollow Crown and in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The World Shakespeare Festival also included the Worlds Together Conference, an international interdisciplinary conference exploring the role of Shakespeare and arts learning in young people's lives.

A key and popular feature of Juke Magazine was its extensive gig guide (particularly of Melbourne's music scene), which attracted a lot of attention by bands, booking agencies and venues. Over time Juke took a more national focus as a music newspaper and the gig guide also evolved to cover more of a national perspective of gigs across Australia. Juke Magazine is now archived with the Victorian Arts Centre trust to preserve its important legacy to the history of Australian music and impact on Australian popular culture. ==Sources== * Juke Magazine Collection held in the Australian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre Melbourne ==References== Category:1975 establishments in Australia Category:1992 disestablishments in Australia Category:Music magazines published in Australia Category:Defunct magazines published in Australia Category:English-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1992 Category:Magazines published in Melbourne Category:Weekly magazines published in Australia ","title":"Juke Magazine"},{"id":"35259061","text":"Jeffrey A.

It is documented in particular by John Aubrey: he refers to it as an \\"experimental philosophical club\\" run weekly by Wilkins, who successfully bridged the political divide of the times. There is surviving evidence that the Club was formally constituted, and undertook some projects in Oxford libraries. Its historical importance is that members formed one of the major groups that came together in the early 1660s to form the Royal Society of London. Wilkins was Warden of Wadham College, and the circle around him is also known as the Wadham Group, though it was not restricted to members of the College. It included William Petty, Jonathan Goddard and John Wallis from the 1645 group in London. The term Oxford Philosophical Society may refer to this club, or at least two later societies. ==Views== A number of the Club's leading members showed a united front in opposition to Thomas Hobbes, from 1654, as they resisted external pressures for university reform. In the longer term the Hobbes-Wallis controversy developed out of the Vindiciae academiarum (1654) of Wilkins and Seth Ward. Generally Wilkins with Goddard and a few other allies were active on the traditionalist side of the debates on academia of the time, a point emphasised later by Thomas Sprat and Walter Pope, as well as trying to keep a calm approach on divisive issues. Wilkins and Ward sympathised with Puritan views, as followers of the line of John Conant, but not with the wish for open theological clashes. One of the aims of the group was in theology, however: to develop a natural philosophy which would be at the same time \\"mechanical\\" and providential. ==Participation== Those attracted to Oxford directly by the presence of Wilkins include Ward, William Neile, Laurence Rooke, and Christopher Wren. Others who became involved were Ralph Bathurst, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Boyle moved to Oxford in 1655/6 and joined the group; when Wilkins moved to Cambridge in 1659 Boyle accommodated the continuing meetings. Around 1652 Wilkins was very active on behalf of the club and Wadham as a scientific centre, bringing in technical expertise including that of Ralph Greatorex, and finding ways to finance equipment. Eventually Wadham had a laboratory area.Lisa Jardine, The Curious Life of Robert Hooke: The man who measured London (2003) pp. 69‚Äì72. Wilkins continued to assemble his group, and it came to include also Richard Lower, his relation Walter Pope, William Holder,Jardine, pp. 76‚Äì77. and Nathaniel Hodges. Robert Hooke became involved, through his work for Willis and then Boyle. It has been suggested that Daniel Coxe was also linked to the club in the later 1650s. ==References== Category:1649 establishments in England Category:1660 disestablishments in England Category:Organizations established in 1649 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1660 Category:Philosophical societies in the United Kingdom Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford Category:History of the University of Oxford Category:History of the Royal Society Category:Wadham College, Oxford ","title":"Oxford Philosophical Club"},{"id":"35259095","text":"World of Dance is a Southern California-based dance, fashion, music, and entertainment brand founded by David Gonzalez, Myron Marten, Tee Sherpa and Michael McGinn in 2008.

Since then, the brand has expanded to competitions in more than 25 countries. Each year, World of Dance Qualifier events are held around the world (40 internationally, 15 in the U.S.), bringing together street and urban dance crews to compete for two titles: winner of the Upper Division (for 18 years and older) and winner of the Youth Division (17 years old or younger). The winners of each category are invited to compete at World of Dance Finals event, where they compete for the world title. World of Dance competitions are notable for their scoring approach. Each competition is judged by a five-person panel, usually composed of dance celebrities, industry professionals, and influencers. Using an Olympic-style approach, competitors are judged according to five criteria: Performance, Technique, Choreography, Creativity, and Presentation. Each category is worth 20 points, for a total of 100 points. Once all judges have inputted their score, the highest and lowest scores are removed, and the final score is the average score of the remaining three. Those with a score above 85 move on to finals.

Executive producing are Jennifer Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Benny Medina, Kris Curry, Matilda Zoltowski, David Gonzalez and Matthew Everitt. The show features celebrity judges Jennifer Lopez, Derek Hough, Ne-Yo, and host/mentor Jenna Dewan-Tatum, along with 50 of the world's best dancers and dance teams competing for a $1 million prize‚Äîthe largest prize of any dance competition show. As Lopez told the New York Times, ‚ÄúMy whole goal with this show was to create an opportunity and a venue for dancers to actually be the stars,‚Äù Ms. Lopez said, and to get to do something they rarely have a chance to do: ‚Äúreally make some money.‚Äù World of Dance contestants were picked from qualifying events around the nation and online submissions. Contestants are divided into three divisions: * Junior: Any size act, 17 years old and under * Upper: Groups of 1-4, 18 and older * Team: Groups of 5+, 18 and older In each episode, dancers compete before the judges and are scored according to World of Dance scoring criteria: Performance, Technique, Choreography, Creativity, and Presentation. Each category is worth 20 points, for a total of 100 points. The show consists of five rounds: * The Qualifiers: In each round of the Qualifiers, the dance acts perform a 2-minute routine in front of the judges and a live audience. They are judged according to criteria, and only those who receive a combined total score of 80 or higher move forward. * The Duels: Acts are paired against each other, and the highest scoring act moves on to the next round. In each round of The Duels, two acts in the same division compete for a spot in the next round. In each division, the acts with the top qualifying scores choose their opponents, then both acts perform back-to-back, receiving feedback from the judges. After each performance, the judges score them. Unlike the Qualifiers, only the final combined total score for each act is shown. The act with the highest score at the end of the duel moves on to the next round; the other faces immediate elimination. * The Cut: In The Cut, the 15 remaining acts compete for three spots in each of their divisions. * Divisional Finals: Two acts in each division compete against each other, winners in each division move on to the next round. * World Finals: In the World Final, the final 3 acts, one from each division, compete to win the one million dollar prize. The show premiered May 30, 2016 at 10/9 central on NBC, debuting to 9.8 million viewers. It was renewed for a second season in June 2017.  Season 1 Performers  Junior Division: 801 Squad, Alaman, Boys of Temecula, D'Angelo and Amanda, Diana Pombo, Eva Igo, ImmaBEAST, JJ & Joey, Kaeli and Brandon, KynTay, Mini ReQuest, The Lab, The Maya Boys, The Mihacevich Sisters, The POSSE.

Judges  The judging lineup of Lopez, Hough, and Ne-Yo was announced in November 2016. The judges were selected both for their dance experience, as well as their passion for spotlighting dancers. Meredith Ahr, President of Universal Television Alternative Studio, called them ‚Äú‚Äúthree of the most accomplished dancers of their generation.‚Äù Lopez told Entertainment Weekly, ‚ÄúWe all love dance, we all are performers, and we all are competitive, which you have to be in this business. We come from different backgrounds, so we bring those sensibilities.‚Äù  Critical Reception  Marketed as ‚Äúthe biggest dance competition in the world,‚Äù the show garnered national attention, particularly for its wide style of performances and popular performers. Les Twins (Beyonc√©'s former backup dancers) made headlines in USA Today, which wrote, \\"Although the audience was cheering along to Les Twins‚Äô fierce moves the entire performance, their routine's intense ending made judge Jennifer Lopez jump out of her seat in shock.\\"[20] Similarly, young contemporary dancer Diana Pombo‚Äôs first performance made Lopez tear up, while others like Luka & Jenalyn, Fik-Shun, and Nick Daniels also wowed the crowd. As USA Today wrote, ‚ÄúWhat the show also has going for it is the sense of inclusion that you don‚Äôt always find on reality TV. The show celebrates the people and cultures represented on its stage, from an Asian-American dance team that takes its inspiration from martial arts to a young Colombian-American girl from Miami who pauses to tell ‚ÄúMiss JLo‚Äù that she's her idol. She cried, Lopez cried, and you'll probably cry, too.‚Äù == Events == *August 16, 2015, World of Dance Finals, Los Angeles Convention Center *August 15, 2015, World of Dance Los Angeles, Los Angeles Convention Center *July 13, 2015, World of Dance Vancouver, Croatian Cultural Centre *May 30, 2015, World of Dance Orlando, Osceola Performing Arts Center and Expo *May 23, 2015, World of Dance New Jersey, iPLAY AMERICA *May 18, 2015, World of Dance Philippine Qualifier, UP Theater *April 12, 2015, World of Dance Belgium Qualifier, Venue to be determined *April 11, 2015, World of Dance Dallas, South Side Ballroom *April 5, 2015 World of Dance France Qualifier, La Salle Du Summum de Grenoble *March 21, 2015, World of Dance Anaheim, The Grove *February 10, 2015, World of Dance Industry Awards, Avalon Hollywood *January 25, 2015, World of Dance Montreal, Rialto Theatre Montreal *December 20, 2014, World of Dance Las Vegas, Cashman Center *December 14, 2014, World of Dance Hawaii, Blaisdell Concert Hall *November 22, 2014, World of Dance Chicago, Copernicus Theater *November 22, 2014: World of Dance Germany, Huxleys Neue Welt *November 15, 2014: World of Dance Seattle, Highline Performing Arts Center *November 2, 2014: World of Dance Boston, Back Bay Event Center *October 19, 2014: World of Dance Netherlands, Dommelstraat 2 *October 18, 2014: World of Dance San Diego, California Center for the Arts *October 4, 2014: World of Dance Toronto, Queen Elizabeth Theatre *September 28, 2014: World of Dance London, Coronet London *August 30, 2014: World of Dance Live, Universal Citywalk *August 23, 2014: World of Dance Houston, Warehouse Live *August 16, 2014: World of Dance Bay Area, Solano Fairgrounds *April 26, 2014: World of Dance Dallas, South Side Ballroom *April 19, 2014: World of Dance Orlando, Osceola Performing Arts Center and Expo *April 12, 2014: World of Dance Los Angeles, Los Angeles Convention Center *March 23, 2014: World of Dance Belgium, TRIX *December 8, 2013: World of Dance Hawaii, Blaisdell Arena *November 16, 2013: World of Dance San Diego, San Diego Concourse *November 15, 2013: World of Dance Chicago, Copernicus Theater *November 9, 2013: World of Dance New Jersey, Encore Event Center *November 2, 2013: World of Dance Boston, Chevalier Theater *October 12, 2013: World of Dance Toronto, Queen Elizabeth Theatre *September 29, 2013: World of Dance Netherlands, DommelStraat 2 *September 7, 2013 World of Dance Seattle, Auburn Performing Arts *August 31, 2013: World of Dance Live, Universal Studios Citywalk *August 24, 2013: World of Dance Houston, Warehouse Live *August 17, 2013: World of Dance Bay Area, Solano County Fairgrounds *July 27, 2013: World of Dance Orlando, Osceola Performing Arts Center and Expo *June 22, 2013: World of Dance Vancouver, Croatian Cultural Centre *May 25, 2013: World of Dance New York, Terminal 5 *April 20, 2013: World of Dance Dallas, Palladium Ballroom *April 6, 2013: World of Dance Los Angeles, Los Angeles Convention Center *December 8, 2012: World of Dance Hawaii, Blaisdell Arena Honolulu, Hawaii *November 17, 2012: World of Dance Chicago, Copernicus Theater *November 10, 2012: World of Dance Boston, Chevalier Theater *October 6, 2012: World of Dance San Diego, San Diego Concourse *September 29, 2012: World of Dance Vancouver, Douglas College *September 8, 2012: World of Dance Seattle, Auburn Performing Arts Center *August 18, 2012: World of Dance San Francisco, Solano County Fairgrounds *May 26, 2012: World of Dance New York, Harlem Armory *May 20, 2012: World of Dance Toronto, Sound Academy *April 21, 2012: World of Dance Dallas, Palladium Nightclub *April 7, 2012: World of Dance Los Angeles, Los Angeles Convention Center *january 28,2018:national championship\\"manish pandey and kulakarni vashista\\" -

Her body has never been found. ==Background to disappearance== Balmain was planning on visiting Japan for her fourth cabaret tour. She had been working as an escort to establish herself, and she was planning on finishing escort work so that she could fully concentrate on her showbusiness career.John Pinkney, Great Australian Mysteries, Five Mile Press, Rowville, Victoria, 2004 . At 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 5 November, Balmain, who worked as an escort under the name of \\"Mischa\\", visited a client in the south-eastern Sydney suburb of Kingsford. After the two-hour appointment was over, she had planned to meet friend Kate Brentnell for a drink. At 7:15 pm, Revelle rang Kate Brentnell to say that she was about to leave her client and suggested that they meet at the Royal Hotel, Paddington. She did not keep that appointment. ==Disappearance== On the following day, 5 November, Balmain's bag, make-up, diary, credit cards and keys to her Bellevue Hill flat were found scattered around several Kingsford streets. One of her shell-studded platform shoes was retrieved from one street; the other shoe was found in another street. Police interviewed Balmain's client, who said that he had driven her to the nearby Red Tomato Inn at about 7.00 pm on the evening of 5 November. Police officers also questioned the escort agency's owners, but the enquiries resulted in no charges being laid. ==Search and reward== After a couple of fruitless weeks of searching, the New South Wales government offered a reward of $100,000 for anyone who could provide information that would lead to the arrest of Balmain's killer. The reward for information is now up to $250,000. In May 1999, the Deputy State Coroner, John Abernethy, handed down an open finding into Balmain's presumed death. He said he \\"could not ascertain\\" how she died, as her body had never been found. ==New leads== In 2008, forensic evidence suggested that Balmain was murdered in the house of the client who she had visited, which belonged to Gavin Owen Samer. The 1999 coronial inquiry suggested Samer as a suspect, but fell short of recommending charges. Members of Balmain's family also believe that there were major flaws in the police investigation of the disappearance. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared *List of unsolved deaths ==References *Australian Missing Persons Register profile Category:1990s in Sydney Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1990s murders in Australia Category:1994 crimes in Australia Category:1994 in Australia Category:1994 murders in Oceania Category:Crimes against sex workers Category:Female murder victims Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Missing person cases in Australia Category:Murdered models Category:Murder in Sydney Category:People murdered in New South Wales Category:Unsolved murders in Australia ","title":"Murder of Revelle Balmain"},{"id":"35259458","text":"Xotox is a solo musical project started by Andreas Davids in 1998. ==History== Xotox - Amphi festival 2016 Xotox released several self-published albums from 1998 to 2002, gaining some attention in Germany.

The novel tells the tale of Reuben Golding, a well to do journalist at the fictional San Francisco Observer who is attacked by and turned into a werewolf. He spends the duration of the story fleeing the authorities, the media, and DNA analysts. On April 5, 2012, Rice promoted the novel on The Colbert Report. The book debuted at number 6 on The New York Times Best Seller list for print and E-book fiction. and number 3 on the Hardcover Fiction list.Hardcover Fiction ==Background== The novel is set in Northern California, an area where Rice lived a large portion of her life. Several scenes of the novel take place in the Redwood Forest. Rice explained that The Wolf Gift was not her return to supernatural fiction, stating that the religiously themed novels, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana revolved around mystical events as well. At the San- Diego Comic-Con, Rice spoke with MTV about The Wolf Gift: \\"It's about a young man who becomes a werewolf. It's my take on what that experience is like for that young man, to experience that transformation and how it works in his life and how he copes with it.\\" ==Reception== Entertainment Weekly gave the book a letter grade of B minus, marking the most memorable scenes as those where the protagonist practiced and discovered his werewolf powers. This exploration was compared to that of Spider-Man. Gregory Cowles, writing for The New York Times said, \\"[Anne Rice] once again mixes vaguely philosophical inquiries about good and evil with standard horror trappings. He furthered his review with an excerpt: \\"His fingers, or were they claws, touched his teeth and they were fangs! He could feel them descending, feel his mouth lengthening!...His voice was guttural, roughened....His hands were thickly covered with hair!\\" Cowles then compared the lycanthropic transformation to puberty. Cowles supported his comparison with a quote from Rice's Amazon.com review of the film The Company of Wolves: > \\"...a 1984 movie by Neil Jordan (who also directed the big-screen version of > \\"Interview\\"). Werewolf films have for decades dealt with the emerging > sexuality of adolescents. But this film outdoes them all...It‚Äôs in a class > with films like Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.

Guests rode on tire-shaped bumper car vehicles that floated on a cushion of air, similar to an air hockey game. The ride's concept was based on Disneyland's Flying Saucers attraction from the 1960s. The attraction closed on February 17, 2015. It was replaced by Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters. ==History== The attraction, originally titled \\"Luigi's Roamin' Tires\\", was announced in late 2007 along with the rest of the Cars Land multi-year expansion plans for Disney California Adventure. The ride was based on the Flying Saucers attraction that was located in Disneyland's Tomorrowland from 1961 to 1966. Instead of floating bumper cars in the shapes of flying saucers, the Luigi attraction featured bumper cars whose riders steer big levitating truck tires. Executive Vice President of Walt Disney Imagineering Kathy Mangum said in 2011 that designing the ride, now named Luigi's Flying Tires, was not easy even with advanced technology. \\"I think our ride engineers, when we went to them and said, 'Hey we want people to fly,' they would tell you that designing a way for aerodynamics to make that happen was actually pretty difficult,\\" she said. Mary Niven, vice president of Disney California Adventure Park, likened the ride to an air hockey table. \\"It's like sitting on the table and you're the hockey puck,\\" she said. When the attraction initially opened on June 15, 2012, it also featured giant beach balls in an effort to give the ride a more colorful look (the attraction was originally intended to open without beach balls.) After two months, however, they were removed due to increased wait times and some \\"minor incidents\\" that occurred when visitors were hit by the beach balls, according to Niven. On February 17, 2015, the attraction closed. It was replaced by Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters, which opened on March 7, 2016. ==Ride== The queue took visitors through Luigi's Casa Della Tires shop and out back through an Italian garden to Luigi's tire yard where the ride took place. Once seated in their tire, Luigi gave a countdown and then a compressor pumped air up through the floor's 6,714 air vents. The tires lifted about two inches off the floor, at which point riders could make their tire move by leaning in the direction that they wanted to go. The ride lasted for approximately two minutes. ==See also== *2012 in amusement parks ==References== Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2012 Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2015 Category:Cars Land Category:Pixar in amusement parks Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions Category:2012 establishments in California Category:2015 disestablishments in California ","title":"Luigi's Flying Tires"},{"id":"35259615","text":"Jirel is a Southern Tibetic language of Nepal.

Kravac (born June 17, 1964), is a Canadian-born RIAA gold-accredited record producer, recording engineer, musician and composer. He is the owner of the music label Porterhouse Records and its sub-labels Porterhouse Prime Vinyl and Porterhouse 101. He has produced albums for MXPX as well as Pepper, Less Than Jake, Tsunami Bomb, and Home Grown among others. Known for achieving a polished radio friendly sound, many of the acts he has worked with have enjoyed a moderate amount of commercial success. ==Life and career== Steve Kravac was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, a suburb of the City of Vancouver. He attended Burnaby North Secondary School and while in high school began playing drums and founded his first band, Social Outcasts who played locally in support of punk acts DOA and the Angelic Upstarts. He graduated in 1982, and shortly thereafter moved across Canada to the city Montreal where he resided for twelve years. While in Montreal he attended Concordia University for two years studying photography and film before leaving the school to pursue music as a full-time career. At this time he began working on his first commercial productions including records from Canadian bands Doughboys, Asexuals and Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra. He also joined the punk band My Dog Popper, and played drums on two records as well as performing live with the group and in their side project Johnny Neon Beef. Later he would join forces with noted Canadian songwriter Alex Soria of the band The Nils. to form Los Patos, a pop rock music vehicle for Soria's songs. The line up consisted of Soria on guitar and vocals, Stephan (Hams) Hamel on bass and Kravac on drums and background vocals. The project was short lived, but one commercial track was released, a cover of Donovan's \\"Changes\\" which was on Island of Circles, a tribute album to Donovan released on the Vancouver, B.C.-based Nettwerk Records. In 1994 shortly after the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, a recording engineer position became available at Westbeach Recorders. Well known in the punk rock community, Westbeach was located in Hollywood and co-owned by Brett Gurewitz of Epitaph Records and his business partner, noted recording engineer Donnell Cameron. With a little prompting from Youth Brigade drummer Mark Stern, Donnell asked Kravac to forward him a demo reel of his work. Cameron was impressed enough with the contents of the demo to offer Kravac a position at Westbeach and three months later in March 1994 Kravac moved to Los Angeles to take the job. Kravac would remain at Westbeach for the next five years and during that time began recording some of the acts that he would eventually be best known for working with. One of the first sessions he engineered upon arrival in L.A. was the album \\"Cheshire Cat\\" by Blink-182. The record released on Cargo Records went on to be a successful release for the band and provided a springboard to other production and engineering opportunities. One of those opportunities was with the record label Tooth and Nail, a Christian music label based in Seattle Washington. Kravac produced a number of bands for the label including The O.C. Supertones album \\"Supertones Strike Back\\" which was nominated for a Dove award for Modern Rock/Alternative record of the year, in 1998 by the Gospel Music Association. It was through Tooth and Nail that Kravac also began working with the Bremerton-based band MxPx for whom he produced three full-length albums including the RIAA gold accredited album \\"Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo\\" released on A&M; Records and Life in General which featured \\"Chick Magnet\\", arguably the band's most popular single and a popular record amongst their fans. Also in 1998, Steve produced, engineered, and mixed the Christian pop- punk band Slick Shoes second full-length album \\"Burn Out\\" at Westbeach Recorders for their then label Tooth & Nail. Burn Out is still one of Slick Shoes fan favorite albums, taking a more west coast hardcore approach in their guitar riffs and melodic content. Around the spring of 1999 Kravac left Westbeach Recorders to begin working as an independent record producer. Among the acts he has worked with are 7 Seconds, Guttermouth, Less Than Jake and Buck O Nine. In 1999, Steve produced, engineered, and mixed California based punk band 7 Seconds' album \\"Good To Go\\" for punk label SideOneDummy \\"Good To Go\\" was a return to 7 Seconds original 80's hardcore sound that their fans had grown accustomed to. In 2019 he released his first solo LP under the moniker Steven Bradley. The album was released to critical acclaim on September 27th, 2019 and was quickly added to many Indie and College radio playlists. Described by critics as\\"simply note perfect, bouncy, joyous power pop\\".Bringing comparisons to Bob Mould, Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe . Summer Bliss and Autumn Tears was written, produced and recorded at his own Hell's Half Acre Studio in California. While Bradley played almost all the instruments on the LP he recruiting some additional talent to round out the sound, including Wayne Kramer (MC5) , Kevin Kane (Grapes of Wrath ,Northern Pikes), Steve McDonald (Red Kross), Mike Herra (MXPX), Danny McGough (Social Distortion, Continental Drifters) and pedal steel virtuoso Greg Leisz. The single \\"Capitol Hill\\" and its accompanying video hit a nostalgic note with other past and present residents of the Vancouver neighborhood it was named for. \\"The song's video features a blend of archival photos and more recent footage of Bradley's old stomping grounds, which will probably get any other ex-Burnaby residents feeling all misty-eyed as well.\\" Bradley celebrated the release of the album by playing live shows in LA and San Diego with his band featuring Richard Lloyd of the seminal post punk band Television. Porterhouse records Steve Kravac in the studio, 2018 In 1997 Kravac created a small indie record label named Porterhouse Records (after the character Smoke Porterhouse in the film Caddyshack). The first signings were local acts with small followings: Speedbuggy and Rosemary‚Äôs Billygoat. While neither act brought the label any real commercial success the label was able to create distribution channels worldwide with these first products. Other acts signed to the label include Outlie a side project from Luke Pabich of the band Good Riddance and Lightweight Holiday a critically acclaimed indie-rock band from Cincinnati. Neither of these records met with any commercial success, and both of these bands are inactive at this time. In 2009 Porterhouse launched a sub label called Prime Vinyl to re-issue notable punk and indie releases on vinyl. The Los Angeles band X were one of the first bands to be selected for the new imprint and to date Prime Vinyl has re- released their albums Wild Gift, Under the Big Black Sun and More Fun in the New World. In addition to Prime Vinyl Porterhouse has started a digital only label called Porterhouse 101 to launch developing artists and to re-issue catalog digitally. Signings to the label include Kidneys featuring Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion. Hell's Half Acre In early 2013 Steve opened the doors to his new recording studio Hell's Half Acre. Located roughly an hour north of Los Angeles in the southern California countryside his new facility is a combination of analog and digital recording equipment. Steve uses the studio to track, and mix artists he works with. Early clients at the studio have been the Calgary-based folk-punk band Jenny, and 7 Seconds. ==External links== * Porterhouse Records * ==References== Category:Canadian rock musicians Category:1964 births Category:Canadian record producers Category:Living people ","title":"Steve Kravac"},{"id":"35259695","text":"Ben-Zion Leitner ( 1927 ‚Äì March 25, 2012) was an Israeli soldier, who received the nation's highest military decoration, the Hero of Israel citation (now the Medal of Valor), for heroism during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.

(), was a speech by Roh Tae-woo, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Justice Party of South Korea, on 29 June 1987. In the declaration, Roh promised significant concessions to opponents of the incumbent authoritarian regime of Chun Doo- hwan who had been pressing for democracy. Roh went on to win the open presidential elections that were held that year, the first for at least the fifteen years since the October Yushin of 1972. The question of the role of the June 29 Declaration is important in the historiography of South Korean democratization. According to proponents of the view that this was a \\"pacted\\" transition, achieved by calculated compromise by the ruling elite, the June 29 Declaration was the crucial turning point in the development of these calculations.Kim, S., \\"Civil Society and Democratization in South Korea\\", in Armstrong, C. K. (2007), Korean Society: Civil Society, Democracy and the State. Taylor & Francis, p. 53. \\"Pacted\\" transition theorists point to the authoritarian methods of Roh's subsequent regime, which continued the political manipulation and trasformismo of the Chun government, as evidence for the thesis that the June 29 Declaration was simply a tactic that enabled the perpetuation of authoritarian rule.Kim, p. 59. \\"Mass\\" transition theorists, by contrast, believe that the Declaration was merely a response to the June Democracy Movement, and the democratization process was driven by the force of popular demand rather than elite bargaining. The Declaration comprised eight points, in which Roh promised to: * amend the constitution to provide for the direct election of the president; * revise the presidential election law to ensure free candidature and genuinely competitive elections; * grant amnesty to political prisoners, including Kim Dae-jung; * protect human dignity and extend the right of habeas corpus; * abolish the Basic Press Law and restore the freedom of the press; * strengthen local and educational autonomy; * move the political climate towards dialogue and compromise; and * achieve substantial social reform.Sin, D.

Jahan Kosha Cannon (also known as the Great Gun) literally means the Destroyer of the World. It is placed in the Topekhana a quarter of mile to the south east of the Katra Mosque, in the town of Murshidabad, West Bengal, India. Topekhana was the Nawab's Artillery Park and the entrance gate of the old capital of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, the city of Jahangir Nagar. It is protected on the east by the Gobra Nala, locally known as the Katra Jheel. Here, the Jahan Kosha Cannon is laid to rest. Before being placed at its current location, it rested on a carriage with wheels and was surrounded by the roots of a Peepal tree. The growth of the tree roots gradually lifted the gun four feet above the ground. The wheels of the gun carriage have disappeared, but the iron-work of the carriage and the trunions are still visible. The cannon is made of ashtadhatu or 8 metals, namely silver, gold, lead, copper, zinc, tin, iron and mercury. An old photo of the cannon, when it was lifted 4 feet high by the roots of a Peepal tree. The cannon is more than 7 tons in weight. It is 17 feet and 6 inches in length and 3 feet in width. It has a girth of 5 feet at the touch hole end. The circumference of its mouth is more than one foot. The radius of the touch hole is one and a half inches. In order to fire this cannon once, 17 kilograms of gunpowder was needed. The bore is approximately 6 inches. The other side of the cannon.

It was published in Britain by Gollancz in September 2012, and by Tor in the same year in the US. The novel is the second in the trilogy, following The Quantum Thief (2010) and preceding The Causal Angel (2014). ==Plot summary== After the events of The Quantum Thief, Jean le Flambeur and Mieli are on their way to Earth. Jean is trying to open the Schr√∂dinger's Box he retrieved from the memory palace on the Oubliette. After making little progress, he is prodded by the ship Perhonen to talk to Mieli, who turns out to be possessed by the pellegrini again. This time, Jean identifies Mieli's employer as a Sobornost Founder, Jos√©phine Pellegrini, and gets her to reveal how he got captured, thereby picking up the clues to make plans for his next heist. No sooner is that done than an attack comes from the Hunter. The ship and crew barely survived that, and Jean realizes that he has to find a better way to open the Box - fast. Mieli has been very quiet after they left Mars. She has given up almost everything to the pellegrini, even her identity, as she has promised to let the pellegrini make gogols of her in exchange for rescuing the thief. Yet, having to work with the thief is testing her, especially when the thief eventually does something even more unforgivable than stealing Syd√§n's jewel from her. In the city of Sirr, on an Earth ravaged by wildcode, Tawaddud and Dunyazad are sisters and members of the powerful Gomelez family. Tawaddud is the black sheep of the family, having run away from her husband and consorted with a notorious jinn, a disembodied intelligence from the wildcode desert. Now Cassar Gomelez, her father, hopes to get her to curry favor with a gogol merchant, Abu Nuwas, so that he has enough votes in the Council for the upcoming decision to renegotiate the Cry of Wrath Accords with the Sobornost. Soon, Tawaddud is embroiled in an investigation with a Sobornost envoy into the murder that triggered the need for her father to forge a new alliance in the first place, and forced to confront old secrets that will change Sirr forever. Somewhere else, in a bookshop and on a beach, a young boy is at play. His mother has told him not to talk to strangers, but there has never been anyone here before. Until now. Should he talk to them? ==Influences== In the acknowledgments, Rajaniemi cites the influence of \\"Andy Clark, Douglas Hofstadter, Maurice Leblanc, Jan Potocki and [...] The Arabian Nights.\\" Self-loops In the novel, the idea that the mind is a self-loop may have been influenced by the theories of the Professor of Philosophy, Andy Clark, and the book I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. Frame stories The novel uses frame stories rather extensively, a feature also of The Arabian Nights and Jan Potocki's The Manuscript Found in Saragossa. Several characters in Sirr are the namesakes of characters in these two earlier works as well. The events in The Quantum Thief are also retold at least once by Jean le Flambeur in the course of the events in this novel. ==Reception== The novel has received generally positive reviews. However, criticisms of the novel still revolve around Rajaniemi's uncompromising \\"show, don't tell\\" style. For example, Amy Goldschlager, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, suggested that \\"[a] bit more explication of the physics involved (‚Äúsurfing the deficit angle‚Äù?) would really be helpful, more helpful than the description of the Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat problem given earlier in the book\\". ==Bibliography== * The Fractal Prince, Hannu Rajaniemi: Gollancz, 2012, (paperback ) ==See also== * List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series ==References * *Glossary for The Quantum Thief / The Fractal Prince / Jean le Flambeur, replacing the deleted Wikipedia glossary Category:2012 novels Category:Novels by Hannu Rajaniemi Category:2012 science fiction novels Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books Category:Quantum fiction novels Category:Memory in fiction Category:Finnish science fiction novels Category:21st-century Finnish novels ","title":"The Fractal Prince"},{"id":"35259887","text":"Getit is a defunct directional media company in India.

HTTP Speed+Mobility was similar to HTTP, with particular goals to reduce web page load latency and improve web security. As a revision of Google's SPDY protocol, Microsoft's HTTP Speed+Mobility protocol achieved reduced latency through SPDY's use of compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. ==Relation to HTTP== HTTP Speed+Mobility, does not replace HTTP. Rather, it modifies the way HTTP requests and responses are sent over the wire; this means that all the existing server-side applications can be used without modification if a SPDY-compatible translation layer is put in place. When sent over SPDY, the HTTP requests are processed, tokenized, simplified and compressed. For example, each SPDY end-point keeps track of which headers have been sent in the past requests and can avoid resending the headers that have not changed; those that must be sent are sent compressed. In developing HTTP Speed+Mobility, Microsoft built upon both Google's proven SPDY protocol and on WebSocket, which is a web technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection. Besides support of the framing of WebSockets, changes from SPDY include the following: taking mobile phones and other low-power devices into account and the removal of SPDY‚Äôs obligatory use of CPU-intensive features encryption, compression, and server- side push.MSDN blog: Speed and Mobility: An Approach for HTTP 2.0 to Make Mobile Apps and the Web FasterExtremeTech: S&M; vs. SPDY: Microsoft and Google battle over the future of HTTP 2.0CNET: Microsoft: Google's SPDY is nice for a faster Web, but...

He finished his secondary education in 1922, served in the King's Guard before studying electrical engineering at his father's alma mater, the Dresden University of Technology. The studies in Dresden were interrupted and he instead graduated in engineering from Edinburgh in 1928. He worked in Siemens in Norway until 1942, then in S√∏nnico from the early 1950s to his death. He was married to actress Wenche Foss from 1939. Before the marriage was dissolved, the couple were active socialites in Norway's capital.

Radiohead first performed it in 1995, and singer Thom Yorke performed it solo on acoustic guitar or Rhodes piano in the following years. The band and producer Nigel Godrich attempted to record the song for the albums OK Computer (1997), Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), but could not settle on an arrangement, and it became one of their best-known unreleased songs. Versions recorded during the OK Computer period were leaked on the 2019 compilation MiniDiscs [Hacked]. A performance of \\"True Love Waits\\" from the Amnesiac tour was released on I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings (2001). In 2016, Radiohead finally released a studio version as the closing track on their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad. Both versions received positive reviews; several critics felt the long wait made the studio version more powerful. Though it was not released as a single, \\"True Love Waits\\" entered the French SNEP and US Billboard Hot Rock Songs singles charts. ==History== Yorke at the 2009 Latitude Festival, where he performed \\"True Love Waits\\" solo on acoustic guitar Radiohead first performed \\"True Love Waits\\" in December 1995 in Brussels while touring for their second album, The Bends. Singer Thom Yorke performed it on acoustic guitar accompanied by an \\"airy\\" keyboard melody. He performed the song unaccompanied several times in the following years; it became a fan favourite and one of Radiohead's best-known unreleased songs.Letts, p.174. Radiohead worked on \\"True Love Waits\\" for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but discarded the work. Versions recorded in this period were leaked in the 2019 compilation MiniDiscs [Hacked], including a version featuring \\"spacey\\" synthesisers and a wah-wah effect. Pitchfork wrote that these versions \\"[don't] really work ... It offers insight into why [the song] was notoriously difficult to pin down.\\" Radiohead worked on \\"True Love Waits\\" again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), hoping to find an arrangement beyond \\"just acoustic guitar\\". Guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: One month later, he wrote: The song remained unreleased. However, Radiohead's efforts led to new material, such as the electronic track \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" on Amnesiac, which uses elements of a version of \\"True Love Waits\\" recorded in the OK Computer sessions. During Radiohead's 2001 Amnesiac tour, Yorke performed \\"True Love Waits\\" solo several times on acoustic guitar; one performance was released on I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings (2001). He performed it again on several occasions, including his solo performances at the 2009 Latitude Festival and the Cambridge Corn Exchange in 2010. From 2006, Radiohead began performing a slower version on Rhodes piano as an introduction to \\"Everything in its Right Place\\". According to the Phoenix New Times, \\"This is a looser, lighter take ... without the clear chord changes and forceful desperation of the acoustic version, one that somehow emphasises the romantic quality of the lyrics rather than the loneliness.\\" In 2016, more than 20 years after it was written, Radiohead released \\"True Love Waits\\" Radiohead as the last track on their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, in a minimal piano arrangement. Radiohead performed this arrangement on the Moon Shaped Pool tour, until their 2018 tour of South America, when Yorke performed \\"True Love Waits\\" on acoustic guitar again. == Composition and lyrics == A clip of a work-in-progress version from the 1990s, released on MiniDiscs [Hacked] (2019) A clip of the version released on I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings (2001), performed on acoustic guitar The live version of \\"True Love Waits\\" released on I Might Be Wrong has Yorke performing the song alone on acoustic guitar. According to Pitchfork, it features unexpected chord changes and \\"vehement\\" guitar strumming. The Phoenix New Times likened the \\"earnest\\" and \\"simple\\" arrangement to Radiohead songs from the same era, such as \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\". A clip of the studio version, released on A Moon Shaped Pool (2016), performed on piano The studio version, released as the final track on A Moon Shaped Pool, features no guitar; instead, it uses a minimal, four-note piano figure, over which pianos are gradually overdubbed, creating polyrhythmic loops and textures. Bass enters in the second verse. Chart Attack described it as \\"slow and melancholy\\" and in the tradition of Radiohead album closers such as \\"Videotape\\" from In Rainbows (2007). According to Yorke, the first verse ‚Äî \\"I'll drown my beliefs / To have your babies / I'll dress like your niece / And wash your swollen feet\\" ‚Äî addresses the \\"difference between young and old\\", when people grow out of childish behaviour; the narrator is offering not to grow up to keep someone they love. The lines \\"And true love lives / On lollipops and crisps\\" were inspired by a story Yorke read about a child who was left alone by his parents for days and survived by eating junk food. The song has a \\"pleading\\" refrain: \\"Don't leave, don't leave.\\" ==Reception== Reviewing I Might Be Wrong in 2001, Matt LeMay of Pitchfork wrote that \\"True Love Waits\\" is \\"absolutely gorgeous ... it can hold its own against any song on OK Computer\\". He felt that the song, along with the performance of \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", \\"justified the existence\\" of the EP. Ted Kessler of the NME praised Yorke's vocals as \\"clear and true\\". Nicholas Taylor of PopMatters described the song as \\"a bittersweet victory of love\\" that \\"shows that behind all of Radiohead's modernist nightmares is a fragile, desperate desire to connect, fully and meaningfully, with just one person\\". Rolling Stone and Arizona Republic named the studio version of \\"True Love Waits\\" the best song of May 2016; Arizona Republic critic Ed Masley wrote that the new arrangement \\"heightens the sense of desperate yearning in Yorke's vocal as he begs his lover not to leave\\". Pitchfork named it the week's best new track and, at the end of the year, the ninth best song of 2016; critic Nathan Reese wrote: \\"'True Love Waits' is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead's most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic. The wait was worth it.\\" In 2017, Consequence of Sound named it the 12th greatest Radiohead song, writing that it \\"shimmers with rainfall piano instead of mopey guitar\\". In 2019, Vulture named it the greatest Radiohead track, and Pitchfork named it the 93rd greatest song of the decade. Though Quietus critic Mike Diver was critical of A Moon Shaped Pool, he praised \\"True Love Waits\\" as Radiohead's most affecting song since their 2008 single \\"Nude\\". Steve Jozef of the Phoenix New Times felt the new arrangement captured the best elements of Yorke's guitar and Rhodes piano performances, saving it from sentimentality, and was \\"the most straightforward, unpretentious, and emotionally raw composition on the album\\". GQ critic Jake Woolf, however, felt that the studio version was \\"a disappointment\\", with \\"mushy piano that weighs the song down emotionally ... the guitar version had a brightness that the studio version lacks\\". Several critics felt that having waited years for a studio version of the song made it more powerful. Vulture journalist Marc Hogan wrote that \\"the difference between the studio cut and its various predecessors floats over the proceedings like a ghost in the machine\\". Pitchfork critic Jillian Mapes wrote of the \\"sense that an older, wiser man\\" was singing, and that the lyrics were more heartfelt \\"now that he seems resigned to haunting the afterlife\\". Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound felt that the long wait \\"allowed Radiohead to peel its words when riper than ever\\". Phoenix New Times writer Jozef speculated that the studio version was influenced by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen; whereas the early arrangement, likely written shortly after Yorke met Owen, has a \\"hopeful, proud character\\", the Moon Shaped Pool version sounds \\"resigned, isolated, lost\\". Rolling Stone critic Andy Beta wrote that \\"the effect is like stumbling upon an old love letter years after a relationship has grown cold\\", and that whereas the \\"Don't leave\\" refrain once suggested redemption, it now sounded like a goodbye. == Charts == - !Chart (2002) !Peak position - - - } == Personnel == * Colin Greenwood * Jonny Greenwood * Ed O'Brien * Philip Selway * Thom Yorke * Nigel Godrich ‚Äì production, engineering, mixing * Sam Petts-Davies ‚Äì engineering * Maxime LeGuil ‚Äì assistant engineering * Bob Ludwig ‚Äì mastering ==References== Sources *Letts, Marianne Tatom.

Best Kept Village competition This was organised in Wales by the Branches of CPRW from 1954Brace, 2004, 15 onwards and led to the enhancement of many Welsh villagesBrace, 2004, 19 The competition was discontinued in the early 1990s.Brace, 2004, 36 Some villages such as Berriew in Montgomeryshire was awarded a Best Kept Village Award on a number of occasions from 1970 onwards. CPRE still continues with its Best Kept Village Competitions. In October 2015 the Best Kept village competition was relaunched in Montgomeryshire for the Montgomeryshire Branch by Jules Hudson.CPRW Montgomeryshire (Facebook Account) The revived competition is being sponsored by Morris, Marshall and Poole during 2016. In the past the focus has been very much on the aesthetic look of a village, but now the emphasis will be on villages with a vibrant community spirit that creates satisfaction and well-being among inhabitants as well as providing local services and facilities. It will not be about finding the most beautiful village, nor the most ancient or picturesque, but one that is cared for. If the competition is successful, it will be extended to other branches of the CPRW. ==Campaigns== The North Wales Power (and Traction) Company and the British Electricity Authority Nant Gwynant hydro-electric power station which still operates One of the most celebrated campaigns conducted by the CPRW was against the North Wales Power Company and the British Electricity Authority. This was to be satirised by Amabel and Clough Williams-Ellis‚Äô novel Headlong Down the Years: A tale of To-day, which parodies the style of the Regency novelist Thomas Love Peacock.Peacock had lived in Caernarfonshire‚Äîthe proceeds of the novel, published in 1951 went to CPRW. The North Wales Power and Traction Company was formed in 1903. It was financed by a group of Lancashire Industrialists and initially built the small hydro-electric plant at Nant Gwynant in Snowdonia. It had authority to build and operate hydro- electric generating stations and transmission lines covering over an area of 2,100 square miles of North Wales, consisting of the whole of Carnarvonshire, Merionethshire and Anglesey and a good deal of Denbighshire. It also took over the narrow railways of the area, including the Welsh Highland Railway.http://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/North_Wales_Power_and_Traction_Co._Ltd In 1947 the company was Nationalised and became part of the British Electricity Authority and massive expansion plans with the construction of eight large power stations, massive reservoirs and dams, and a network of pylons to carry the electricity were promoted. The Rheidol Plant would divert water from the headwaters of the rivers Wye and Severn and plants at Maentwrog, Ffestiniog, Dolgarrog and other plants in the Conway Valley would have drained the rivers of Snowdonia dry at a time that the Snowdonia National Park was about to come into being.R. Hughes in Epilogue pp.113-8 in Amabel and Clough Williams-Ellis, 1951. However, rising costs and the opposition led by the CPRW led to the schemes being deferred in November 1952,Brace, 2004, 13 though modified schemes went ahead at Rheidol, opened in 1964, at Ffestiniog, a pumped scheme opened in 1963 and elsewhere. The Conwy Bridge and Crossing Conway Castle with the 1958 bridge in front of the other two bridges. Proposals for the development of the road system along the North Wales Coast in the late 1930s, which would have impacted on the Town walls at Conwy resulted in an inquiry in which the CPRW and the Society of Antiquaries were represented by J. D. K. Lloyd and Alwyn Lloyd. As a result of their representations the Inspector in 1940 recommended that the route would skirt the walls, and a new bridge would be built after the War, parallel to Thomas Telford‚Äôs road bridge and Robert Stephenson‚Äôs rail bridge.Brace, 2004, 11 The new road bridge was built in 1958.Haslam R. et al. Buildings of Wales: Gwynnedd, Yale UP, 2009, 318 Then in 1966 the Welsh Office proposed a new high level bridge for the North Wales Expressway across the river Conwy from Deganwy. This would have had a major impact on views of Conway Castle and surrounding landscape. Following a lengthy inquiry, in which the Caernarfon Branch was represented, the suggestion made by the President Lady Eirenne White that the road should go under the Conway in a tunnel, was accepted by the Inspector, and has proved a much better solution.Brace, 2004, 25. This quasi-motorway of 1986‚Äì93, passes under the estuary and has most successfully removed the heavy traffic from the town.\\"Haslam R. et al\\". 2009, 318 Pembroke Power Station and orimulsion The replacement Pembroke Power Station under construction in 2011 The Pembroke Power Station was completed in 1968 for CEGB and together with Marchwood, near Southampton, was the largest oil fired power station to be built. Its maximum output was 2,000 MW and it was joined to Burry Port in Carmarthenship by two 400KVA power lines on 170 foot high pylons. It could emit 600 tons of sulphur dioxide and 3 tons of nitrogen oxides from a 500-foot chimney.Brace 2004, 37 The Power Station never managed to reach this maximum output. Initially it was using crude oil from the adjacent refineries but in 1992 National Power proposed changing this to orimulsion, a mixture of water and bitumen, which came from Venezuela. This would have quadrupled the potential output of sulphur dioxide as well as the possible risk of an orimulsion spill in Milford Haven. There was a local outcry when it was realised that the power station may already be causing a higher level of asthma and that there were other health risks from orimulsion. The Pembrokeshire Branch of CPRW joined with other local groups in opposing the scheme and eventually National Power suggested an additional desulphurisation plant. However, the Secretary of State decided to hold an inquiry, but a few weeks before it started National Power withdrew the proposals. The Power Station was mothballed in 1996 and demolished between 2000 and 2003. It was replaced by the Pembroke B Power Station on the same site which opened in 2012, which has turbines which run on natural gas and has a heat recovery steam generator Wind farms and pylons in Mid Wales Carno Wind Farm at Twr Gwyn The CPRW has been an active member of the Mid Wales Alliance, a group of 21 organisations opposing the plans by six energy developers for major wind farm and associated infrastructure development in the Montgomeryshire uplands.BBC Wales News The proposed wind-farms are at Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llaithddu, Llanbrynmair, Carnedd Wen, and to re-power the Llandinam wind farm. If built, these schemes in conjunction with other consented (Tir Gwynt and Garreg Lywd), built and proposed wind farms would mean in excess of 600 wind turbines in Mid Wales and the necessity for major Grid infrastructure over large areas of the Montgomeryshire and North Shropshire countryside, as there is no further capacity to transfer energy production from the area.Existing Scottish Power capacity in Montgomeryshire‚Äîthe lack of capacity was the reason why the National Grid became involved. The wind farms are above the 50 megawatt jurisdiction of the Welsh Assembly, and as a result plans have been dealt with by the UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change. At Scottish Power Energy Network's (SPEN) request, National Grid started consulting on the route for 400 kV power lines and a 20-acre transformer station in 2012. There has been opposition to proposals for more wind farms and infrastructure from the majority of the local population on the grounds of its effects on the landscape, environment and tourism industry. The proposals to route pylons down either the Severn or Meifod valleys prompted the formation of MAP (Montgomeryshire Against Pylons),Montgomeryshire against pylons (MAP) who joined with Conservation of Upland Powys (CUP)Conservation of Upland Powys who had been opposing large scale proposals for over 20 years. Other local and well established groups, such as the Women's Institute and CPRW, joined forces and the Alliance was established. Local MP Glyn Davies, a past president of CPRW, had been warning for many years of the threat posed to Montgomeryshire by what he claimed was the unbalanced, poorly evidenced approach of the Welsh Government to wind farm development. Both he and Welsh AM Russell George spoke forcefully at the Public Inquiry into the five wind farms.Desecration fears over wind farm bid. Mid Wales enquiry 4 April 2014 The CPRW launched an appeal to fund a landscape consultancy to produce the necessary evidence to help the Alliance fight these proposals. By the end of 2013 nearly ¬£15,000 had been raised by CPRW, which, with additional support from MAP, enabled CPRW to commission Blandford's Landscape consultancy to produce evidence for the Inquiry.http://www.montgomeryshireagainstpylons.org Peter Ogden, Director of CPRW, spoke at the Inquiry and supported the Alliance at a number of sessions.CPRW From February 2013, CPRW worked with CUP and others in the Alliance and researched, produced and presented detailed evidence. The Inquiry ended in May 2014 with the Inspector noting the undoubted strength of local opposition. He submitted his report to DECC at the end of December 2014. The Secretary of State, Amber Rudd, announced her final decision on September 7, 2015.Decision letters and full reports can be accessed at [www.itportal.decc.gov.uk/EIP/pages/projects/MidWalesPI.htm.] She concluded that three of the Inspector's decisions gave insufficient weight to the landscape, residential amenity, heritage impacts he identified and concurred with the other three. This means that only Llandinam Re-powering has received consent, although it still does not have a consented route to export power.Llandinam re-powering. New Grid Connection requirement. Para 4.16 DECC Letter 7Sept 2015 ==Regional branches== The CPRW is split into 14 Regional Branches. These branches organise events, lectures and comment on local matters concerning planning and the landscape.http://www.cprw.org.uk/location.html There are also two co- ordinating working groups, one for the six branches in northern Wales and another for the branches in S.

R.T. Ramage, Helen M. (1951). A History of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and of the Gwyneddigion and Cymreigyddion Societies (1751‚Äì1951). Y Cymmrodor 50. London: Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion In January 1928 a provisional committee of the CPRW was set by the Cymmrodorion at a meeting held at Shrewsbury. The stimulus to form the CPRW came from the establishment of Council for the Preservation of Rural England in 1926, and the Shrewsbury meeting was followed by a meeting in May in London at the Royal Society of Arts. This meeting was addressed by Lord Crawford and Balcarres, the first President of the CPRE.Brace M., 2004, 1 The founding figures at the Shrewsbury Meeting included Miss Gwendoline Davies of Gregynog Hall, Sir E. Vincent Evans and Dr. Thomas Jones, of the Cymmrodorion, Dr Willoughby Gardner of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, Sir Patrick Abercrombie, a founding figure of CPRE, Cyril Fox, the recently appointed Director of the National Museum of Wales,Charles Scott-Fox Cyril Fox, Archaeologist Extraordinary, Oxbow Books, Oxford, 2002, 105, where it mentions that in May 1930 he and two others in this group gave early radio broadcasts about the CPRW T. Alwyn Lloyd, the noted Welsh architect and planner; and Clough Williams-Ellis.Brace , 2004, 2‚Äì3 1930's Aberaeron- an example of colour-washed houses Meetings of the council and later the Executive Committee took place in London and office space for the CPRW was provided by the Cymmrodorion. District Committees started to be established in the Welsh counties from 1928. Matters which occupied CPRW were subjects such as Ribbon development, the design of rural buildings, indiscriminate felling of trees and unregulated advertising. Most of these matters were to come under the powers granted to County Councils when the first Town and Country Planning Act was passed in 1947.

Their objections to the bombing range at Porth Neigl on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula led to modifications, but in the case of the acquisition of the Stackpole Estate and the development of the Castle Martin firing range, the CPRW was forced to acquiesce in the national interest.

The Karnataka Wakf Board is a Muslim charitable trust that manages and oversees property that have been donated for use by the poor. The report commissioned by Manippady alleges that the Karnataka Wakf Board had allowed almost 50% of its land to be misappropriated by politicians and board members, in collusion with the real estate mafia for a fraction of its market value. Manippady has recommended that the government establish a committee to investigate corrupt activities on the Wakf Board and appoint a task force to recover properties that have been illegally sold by the Wakf Board.

In 1849, he was deported to Irkutsk, where he worked until his death as a parish priest of the largest parish in the world (which occupied all of Siberia from the Arctic Ocean to China). In 1888 he was dubbed \\"Apostle of Siberia\\" by Pope Leo XIII. ==Life== Christopher Szwernicki was born on September 8, 1814, in the village of Warnupiany near Mariampole to Adam and Katarzyna n√©e Woclawska. His birth name was Joseph. At age 7, he went to school at Mariampole, first to grammar school for three years, and then to the middle school run by the Marian Fathers in their monastery. When the November Uprising began, Szwernicki enlisted in uhlan's regiment, commandeered by J√≥zef Dwernicki. He was twice wounded, in the Battle of Stoczek and the Battle of Nowa Wie≈õ. After the uprising collapsed he went back to the monastery; there, in 1832, he finished middle school. At this time he entered the Order and changed his name to Krzysztof (Christopher). On December 24, 1837, he was ordained to the priesthood in Sejny by Bishop Pawel Straszynski. He worked with the deaf in Warsaw, where he helped to start the Institute for the Deaf and learned methods of teaching them. He organized and ran a similar school in Mariampole. In 1846, he was arrested for his patriotic activity and put into Warsaw Citadel, where he spent five years under strict investigation. He was sentenced to be exiled to the Province of Irkutsk, and was transported in 1852. When he came to Irkutsk, he obtained permission to fulfill his priestly duties at the local church. He initially helped old Fr. Hacicki (like a vicar), and after the latter's death in 1856 he became parish priest of Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church in Irkutsk. He renewed the church and installed a harmonium, made in the Debain's factory in Paris. In 1855, Szwernicki, like most Polish political exiles, was pardoned by the Tsar, but he elected to stay in Irkutsk. In 1859, under orders from Governor-General Muravyov, he journeyed through Siberia to provide spiritual care for Catholic soldiers. In his pastoral care he met (a future saint and a Carmelite friar) Raphael Kalinowski, who was exiled to Siberia after the January Uprising. In 1881‚Äì1885, Swernicki built a new church in Irkutsk. The previous one, which had been built of wood, was burned in the large conflagration of the town in 1879. He also built and then ran an orphanage. In January 1894, Szwernicki was brutally attacked and beaten. He never recovered from his injuries and died on November 26, 1894. He was buried in the Irkutsk church. Six years after his death, Benedykt Dybowski said of him, \\"By 40 years, when he was a parish priest in the one of the largest parish, Siberia, he saw little happiness among people, but much more times he witnessed to continuous heavy and extreme poverty, many bitter tears and often to pessimism. Although he was continuously contacted with disaster, he had never been neutral its audience. On the contrary, while he was experiencing deep torment of exile's life, he, with all his forces and possibility, tried to help suffering, everywhere, he was. by giving them alongside material support, spiritual comfort together with this quiet exposed hope, which only one can prevent people from pessimism and despair.\\" ==Awards== Szwernicki was awarded: *1857 - by the Consistory of Mohylew, a cross and an order for his participation in the Crimean War *1870 ‚àí the third class Order of St. Stanislaus *1879 ‚àí a third class Order of St. Anne *1888 ‚àí Pope Leo XIII titled him the \\"Apostle of Siberia\\" ==See alsoReferences== Category:Lithuanian Roman Catholic priests Category:Polish Roman Catholic priests Category:Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception Category:Imperial Russian people of Polish descent Category:People from Marijampolƒó County Category:1814 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Christopher Szwernicki"},{"id":"35260494","text":"Mitchell Brett Achurch (born 14 July 1988) is an Australian rugby league footballer who most recently played for the Leeds Rhinos (Heritage No.) in the Super League, and Featherstone Rovers (Heritage No. 1034) (loan) in the Championship.

It was opened to the public on April, 2010. It provides shopping, dining, entertainment and leisure activities. == Controversies == City Centre Mall  Building violations and other irregularities  There were a number of controversies surrounding the mall's construction. According to a news report published in August 2009, the unscientific excavation done for the building posed a threat to Bavutagudda (Light House Hill), a place of historic prominence in Mangalore. The excavation would have been dangerous to the residents of Bavutagudda. Consequently, the then Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Mangalore had ordered the builders to build a retention wall. On 20 April 2009, there was an order issued by the Mangalore City Corporation (MCC) commissioner to demolish certain parts of the building including the seventh and eighth floor. As per the order, the building was not being constructed as per the approved blueprint. The builders brought a stay on the order. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had served a notice to the builders for causing environmental pollution. Three chimneys were installed without taking required permission from KSPCB. The smoke from the chimney was causing inconvenience to the nearby residents and they had lodged a complaint with KSPCB. Prior to its inauguration on 25 April 2010, the Town Planning Officer of MCC made a statement saying it was illegal to go ahead with the opening of the mall without clearances. Four days prior to the inauguration, the MCC had served notice to the owners of the mall to vacate the building since the Fire and Emergency Services Department had not given a no-objection certificate. In August 2012, social activists had accused the then DC of Mangalore of showing unnecessary interest in regularizing the building. The DC himself had refused to give permission to a multiplex in the building as the building had not been given clearances from various departments. However, just before he was transferred to Bengaluru in December 2012, he had issued license to the multiplex.  Assault on employees  On 31 July 2010, four salesmen of the Mochi Shoe Shop at the mall were reportedly attacked. As per reports, one of the salesmen had washed his lunch box in a basin inside the bathroom. This did not go well with Mr. Dharmaraj, an architect at Mohtisham Complexes, also in- charge of the mall and he objected. Later, it is believed that, on orders from Mr. Dharmaraj, a group of 12 people barged to the shoe shop and attacked the four salesmen. By 5 August 2010, four people were arrested in connection with the attack, but Mr. Dharmaraj along with another accused had applied for anticipatory bail and had gone into hiding. == Fire break out == On 21st February, 2019 a fire broke out in the mall.

VIA Motors purchases basic vehicles from GM and replaces the conventional gas powertrain with an extended-range electric- drive powertrain. VIA then sells directly to fleets under the VTRUX‚Ñ¢ brand name. VIA is beta testing its vehicles with fleet customers and is taking orders from the public for trucks to be delivered in 2014. VIA Motors received the NTEA Work Truck Show 2012 Green Award for the VIA VTRUX truck. ==History== VIA Motors was spun off in November 2010 from Raser Technologies, the engineering company that, in 2009, showed a Hummer H3 said to be capable of returning 100 miles per gallon when fitted with Raser‚Äôs range-extender plug-in powertrain.

Executives and engineers from General Motors and Raser Technologies join VIA Motors. 2011 ‚Äì VIA raises $5.3 million from private investors including Carl Berg. Alpha and beta vehicles are delivered to PG&E.; Bob Lutz joins VIA Motors as chairman. 2012 ‚Äì VIA unveils a lineup of EREV versions of trucks, vans and SUVs at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. VIA signs key suppliers, including Remy Motors and A123 Batteries. Fleet customers including Rocky Mountain Power and Verizon Wireless join vehicle testing program. ==Products== NAIAS 2013 VIA offers versions of vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs as Extended Range Electric Vehicles (E-REV), otherwise known as ‚Äúhybrids‚Äù. The VIA VTRUX truck has a 40-mile battery-only range, and a 35-mile range for the van and SUV. After batteries are depleted, a gas-powered generator creates electricity for continued driving, similar to the architecture of the Chevy Volt. Vehicle Specifications * Batteries. VIA's vehicles uses 22 kWh liquid-cooled nanophosphate lithium-ion batteries from A123 Systems. The battery chemistry is based on research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The nanoscale structure of the Nanophosphate chemistry enables battery systems with higher power, increased abuse tolerance, longer life and the greater ability to maintain consistent power over a wide range of state of charge (SOC) as compared with competing lithium ion and other chemistries. * Gas Engine. Gas Engine A 4.3L V6 combustion engine is paired with VIA‚Äôs electric generator to form a gas/electric generator set. The gas engine runs only when generating electricity to recharge the batteries. * Electric Generator. The 150 kW (201 hp) generator is connected directly to the engine and only runs to charge the batteries. The motor and generator are supplied by Remy International. * Electric Motor. The electric motor provides propulsion at all times. The 150 kW 402 Nm motor weighs 108 lbs and measures 11‚Äùx 11‚Äù. * Inverter. VIA claims the truck can be used to power a home in an emergency. PG&E; intends to use the truck to provide emergency street power during outages. The power export capacity is offered in 10 kW or 50 kW options. The inverters used for the traction motor and generator are supplied by TM4 Electrodynamic Systems. * Charging. Vehicles can be charged with 120, 240 or 480 volts (Level 3 charging station). Charging times vary based on input voltage, and can range from 8 hours with a household outlet to 3 hours with a charging station. ==References External links == * Category:Electric vehicle manufacturers of the United States Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 2010 Category:Companies based in Orem, Utah Category:Manufacturing companies based in Utah ","title":"VIA Motors"},{"id":"35260622","text":"Saint-Jean-Baptiste was a former municipality in La Mitis Regional County Municipality in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of Quebec.

Its first event was held in March and featured a bout between the two MMA veterans Bob Sapp and James Thompson. The league has scheduled several events to occur throughout India in 2012. On August 5, the Super Fight League will air their reality show SFL Challengers. Similar to the Ultimate Fighter, the show will take young up-and-coming Indian mixed martial artists, place them in the same house as each other. On October 12, the Super Fight League changed their organisational structure from one event a month in arenas to one event every Friday in a specially designed mini-arena in Mumbai in front of an exclusive invitation only audience. Programming will last for three hours each week with weigh-ins, live fights, and interviews from Bollywood cage side guests. There will be 7 fights in total each event, with 1 of them being a female bout. It will air live on Neo Prime in India and on their YouTube page for the rest of the world. ==List of events== Super Fight League has scheduled several fights cards throughout 2012: {  - !width=\\"55pt\\" Event !width=\\"120pt\\" Date !Venue !City - Super Fight League 1  Andheri Sports Complex Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 2  T-Box Mobile Arena Chandigarh, India - Super Fight League 3  Indra Gandhi Indoor Complex New Delhi, India - Super Fight League 4  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 5  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 6  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 7  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 8  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 9  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 10  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 11  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 12  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India - Super Fight League 13  Super Fight League Arena Mumbai, India } ==Event summaries== Super Fight League 1 Super Fight League 1 was held on March 11, 2012 at the Andheri Sports Complex in Mumbai, India and was the first ever event promoted by Super Fight League. Prior to the event, Bollywood stars, including Bipasha Basu, provided 45 minutes of live entertainment. Jennifer Lopez and electropop group LMFAO were invited to perform at the event as well. The event was streamed live on YouTube. The main event featured a heavyweight fight between Bob Sapp and James Thompson. Both fighters are veterans of Pride Fighting Championships but had never faced each other before. Sapp went into the fight on a five-fight losing streak while Thompson had mixed results in his recent outings. As soon as the fight was started, Thompson headed straight for Sapp and took him down within the first thirty seconds of the bout. After some ground and pound and grappling which had both fights on top of the other at some point, Thompson was able to twist Sapp's leg. Sapp tapped out at 1:52 of the first round due to the resulting leg injury. Results Super Fight League 2 Super Fight League 2 took place on April 7, 2012 at the T-Box Mobile Arena in Chandigarh, India. As with Super Fight League 1 it was streamed live on YouTube. A lightweight bout between Paul Kelly and Gabe Ruediger was initially scheduled. It would have fulfilled a pairing that had been planned for UFC 123. At the time, Ruediger was injured and was replaced by TJ O'Brien. Kelly defeated O'Brien but was released from the UFC after a subsequent loss to Donald Cerrone. Following a knockout loss to Scott Catlin on March 16, 2012, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) medically suspended Ruediger. Although Super Fight League wasn't required to follow the CSAC's suspensions, they still decided to remove Ruediger from the fight card. He has since been replaced with Ryan Healy. The main event saw Todd Duffee facing Neil Grove. Duffee's last fight was almost a year and a half prior when he lost a match to Alistair Overeem for the vacant Dream Heavyweight Championship. Grove's most recent bouts were with Bellator Fighting Championships where he won three fights and lost three fights. This was the first time the two fighters faced each other. The fight ended 34 seconds into the first round when Duffee earned a technical knockout victory over Neil Grove. Results Super Fight League 3 Super Fight League 3 took place on May 6, 2012 at the IGI Stadium in New Delhi, India. As with the previous events, it was streamed live on YouTube. The main event was a heavyweight bout between Bobby Lashley and James Thompson. Lashley was coming into his Super Fight League debut on a two-fight winning streak, which included recently winning the Shark Fights Heavyweight title, whilst Thompson has gone 3-0(1) in his last 4 fights, which included his submission victory against Bob Sapp at Super Fight League 1. The first round started off with Lashley using his wrestling skills to pressure Thompson. After a couple of knees in the clinch, Thompson accidentally caught Lashley in the groin, in which Lashley took a few minutes to recover from. The round ended with Lashley landing a barrage of punches to Thompson by the side of the cage. The second had both men landing some big punches next to the cage. Bobby shook his opponent a few times with clean strikes, but it was Thompson who won the round by clinching Lashley onto the cage and doing some dirty boxing. Lashley took another accidental low blow in the third, this time, Thompson was given a warning. Once recovered, Lashley came forward and both men continued to strike again. Thompson again kept the fight on the side of the cage with him landing punches from the clinch which arguably gave him the decision victory.

It was created by Nawazish Muhammad Khan, the son-in-law of Nawab Alivardi Khan. He also constructed a precious palatial palace beside this lake which is called the Sang-i- dalan (literal translation:stone palace) which is also known as the Motijhil Palace. It is located at the bend of this lake. It was used as the residence of Nawazish and Ghaseti Begum, Nawazish's beloved wife. It is said that after Nawazish died, Ghaseti Begum lived here until Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah took over the palace and seized the residents' in 1756 AD. With this money he built a similar lake with a beautiful palace, Hirajheel, on the opposite side of the Bhagirathi River. The palace has a lofty gateway, a mosque known as the \\"Shahamat Jang\\" and the Kala Masjid and some other buildings which were all built by Nawazish. This palace was built in 1740. As far as etymology is concerned, the palace has been named so as it was built using black basalt pillars which were brought from the ruins of Gaur. Thus, it was given the name of Sang-i-Dalan or the Stone Palace. This palace was then decorated with different varieties of flower plants and precious marbles. The entrance to the lake According to James Rennell Motijhil is a horse shoe shaped lake. Motijhil is situated about one and a half kilometers away from Murshidabad in the south and about three kilometres away from the Hazarduari Palace in the south east. It has been excavated on the former beds of the Bhagirathi River that once flowed near this lake. The river was much nearer in 1766 that now. At south there is a tank known as the Shanti Pukur. The offices were built on its banks. Motijhil was also the residence of Warren Hastings from 1771 to 1773, when he became the political President at the court of the Nawab. It had also paid host to Robert Clive and John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth. ==Kala Masjid== The mosque at Motijhil, 1801 (picture taken by C.B. Asher) Kala Masjid, is situated in the vicinity of the lake and was constructed in 1749‚Äì50 AD. The construction date is also mentioned in a Persian inscription which is embedded in the wall of the mosque. The mosque is rectangular in plan and has is three domed. The mosque rests on several octagonal drums which are plain and are devoid of any decoration and the domes are crowned by lotus and kalasha (pot) finials. It also has four octagonal minarets at the four corners which taper upwards and are topped by bulbous kiosks which are supported on slender pillars. The minaret shafts are decorated. The facade is also ornamented. Three arched doorways on the east open to a prayer hall. A copy of the Quran, calligraphed by Nawazish Muhammad Khan himself is also kept preserved inside the mosque. The plinth area of the mosque is 5986 square feet. Motijhel Lake view Opposite to this masjid on the east banks of the lake used to be an ornamented mosque known as the Raesh Bagh. Motijheel lake and the structures in its vicinity are protected monuments and are looked after by the Archaeological Survey of India. ==Tombs== Motijheel MosqueEast of the Kala Masjid are several enclosures which host the tombs of Nawazish Muhammad Khan, his adopted son Ekram-ud-Daula, Ekram's tutor, Ekram's nurse and Nawazish Khan's General, Shumsheree Ali Khan. The tombs of Ekram and Nawazish are made of marble and that of Shumsheree is made of sandstone. The grave of Ekram's tutor is made of black stone. Ekram was the younger brother of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah. To the west of the mosque and beyond the compound wall of the Motijhil Lake, stands a ruined royal gateway, also built by Nawazish Muhammad Khan. Motijhil also hosts the grave of the son of Mr. Keating, Edward Keating. In 1774, Mr. Keating was the Superintendent of the Murshidabad Mint and later became the judge of the court of appeal. The slab embedded on the grave says that his son was born on 20 December 1779 and died on 3 March 1785 (aged 5 years, 2 months and 11 days). ==New constructions== In 1758, after Siraj ud-Daulah's defeat in at the Battle of Plassey, Mir Jafar, who succeeded Siraj as the Nawab of Bengal, constructed a palace with 12 doors here and named it Bara Duari (the palace with twelve doors). Robert Clive is said to have lived here. He also stayed here to negotiate with the Nawabs for the transfer of the Diwani to the East India Company. On 29 April 1766 he held the first ceremony of beginning the revenue collections here with Clive as the Dewan, when Nazam-ud-Daulah was the Nawab. ==ReferencesCategory:Mosques in West Bengal Category:Tourist attractions in Murshidabad Category:Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent Category:Lakes of West Bengal ","title":"Motijhil"},{"id":"35260696","text":"A peptide microarray (also commonly known as peptide chip or peptide epitope microarray) is a collection of peptides displayed on a solid surface, usually a glass or plastic chip. Peptide chips are used by scientists in biology, medicine and pharmacology to study binding properties and functionality and kinetics of protein-protein interactions in general. In basic research, peptide microarrays are often used to profile an enzyme (like kinase, phosphatase, protease, acetyltransferase, histone deacetylase etc.), to map an antibody epitope or to find key residues for protein binding. Practical applications are seromarker discovery, profiling of changing humoral immune responses of individual patients during disease progression, monitoring of therapeutic interventions, patient stratification and development of diagnostic tools and vaccines. An example of a peptide array used for epitope identification and specificity mapping. ==Principle== The assay principle of peptide microarrays is similar to an ELISA protocol. The peptides (up to tens of thousands in several copies) are linked to the surface of a glass chip typically the size and shape of a microscope slide. This peptide chip can directly be incubated with a variety of different biological samples like purified enzymes or antibodies, patient or animal sera, cell lysates and then be detected through a label-dependent fashion, for example, by a primary antibody that targets the bound protein or modified substrates. After several washing steps a secondary antibody with the needed specificity (e.g. anti IgG human/mouse or anti phosphotyrosine or anti myc) is applied. Usually, the secondary antibody is tagged by a fluorescence label that can be detected by a fluorescence scanner. Other label-dependent detection methods includes chemiluminescence, colorimetric or autoradiography. Label-dependent assays are rapid and convenient to perform, but risk giving rise to false positive and negative results. More recently, label-free detection including surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS) and many other optical biosensors have been employed to measuring a broad range of enzyme activities. Peptide microarrays show several advantages over protein microarrays: *Ease and cost of synthesis *Extended shelf stability *Detection of binding events on epitope level, enabling study of i.e. epitope spreading *Flexible design for peptide sequence (i.e. posttranslational modifications, sequence diversity, non-natural amino acids ...) and immobilization chemistries *Higher batch-to-batch reproducibility ==Production of a peptide microarray== A peptide microarray is a planar slide with peptides spotted onto it or assembled directly on the surface by in-situ synthesis. Whereas peptides spotted can undergo quality controls that include mass spectrometer analysis and concentration normalization before spotting and result from a single synthetic batch, peptides synthesized directly on the surface may suffer from batch-to-batch variation and limited quality control options. However, peptide synthesis on chip allows the parallel synthesis of tens of thousands of peptides providing larger peptide libraries paired with lower synthesis costs. Peptides are ideally covalently linked through a chemoselective bond leading to peptides with the same orientation for interaction profiling. Some alternative procedures describe unspecific covalent binding and adhesive immobilization. However, lithographic methods can be used to overcome the problem of excessive number of coupling cycles. Combinatorial synthesis of peptide arrays onto a microchip by laser printing has been described, where a modified colour laser printer is used in combination with conventional solid- phase peptide synthesis chemistry. Amino acids are immobilized within toner particles, and the peptides are printed onto the chip surface in consecutive, combinatorial layers. Melting of the toner upon the start of the coupling reaction ensures that delivery of the amino acids and the coupling reaction can be performed independently. Another advantage of this method is that each amino acid can be produced and purified separately, followed by embedding it into the toner particles, which allows long-term storage. ==Applications of peptide microarrays== Peptide microarrays can be used to study different kinds of protein-protein interactions, specially those involving modular protein substructures called peptide recognition modules or, most commonly, protein interaction domains. The reason for this is that such protein substructures recognize short linear motifs often exposed in natively unstructured regions of the binding partner, such that the interaction can be modelled in vitro by peptides as probes and the peptide recognition module as analyte. Most publications can be found in the context of immune monitoring and enzyme profiling.

After scanning the microarray slides, the scanner records a 20-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit numeric image in tagged image file format (*.tif). The .tif-image enables interpretation and quantification of each fluorescent spot on the scanned microarray slide. This quantitative data is the basis for performing statistical analysis on measured binding events or peptide modifications on the microarray slide. For evaluation and interpretation of detected signals an allocation of the peptide spot (visible in the image) and the corresponding peptide sequence has to be performed. The data for allocation is usually saved in the GenePix Array List (.gal) file and supplied together with the peptide microarray. The .gal-file (a tab-separated text file) can be opened using microarray quantification software-modules or processed with a text editor (e.g. notepad) or Microsoft Excel. This \\"gal\\" file is most often provided by the microarray manufacturer and is generated by input txt files and tracking software built into the robots that do the microarray manufacturing. ==References== Category:Biological techniques and tools Category:Immunology Category:Microarrays Category:Protein methods ","title":"Peptide microarray"},{"id":"35260698","text":"ELSO may refer to: * European Life Scientist Organization * A tradename for S-Amlodipine * Extracorporeal Life Support Organization ","title":"ELSO"},{"id":"35260706","text":"Warszawa Miƒôdzylesie railway station is a railway station in the Wawer district of Warsaw, Poland.

It is native to eastern North America, where it is distributed throughout eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Though it has a wide distribution, it is very localized, and populations have declined almost everywhere.Plantago cordata. The Nature Conservancy. == Background == This type of perennial plant grows up to half a meter tall. The fleshy leaf blades are oval to heart-shaped and borne on long petioles. The plant produces smaller leaves during the winter, and larger ones during the summer. The inflorescence arises on a hollow stem and contains many flowers. Each flower has four petals and four sepals. The flowering stalks can grow up to 30 centimeters in one week. The fruit is a capsule about half a centimeter long. The capsule usually contains two seeds. The seeds are adapted for water dispersal, with buoyant fleshy parts and a sticky substance that causes them to adhere to objects. This semi-aquatic plant can be found growing in and around running water bodies such as streams and creeks. It is most often found on dolomite.Plantago cordata. Center for Plant Conservation. It can be found on the banks of the Hudson River in New York. It belongs to a number of plant communities and grows in several habitat types.

It contains a single species, Cutleria wilmarthi. ==Discovery== Cutleria is known only from the holotype specimen USNM 22099, a fractured but three-dimensionally preserved, a nearly complete skull and articulated partial postcranial skeleton (including vertebral column, ribs and several girdle and limb elements). It was collected at locality 3, near Placerville of San Miguel County, Colorado, from the Cutler Formation, dating to the Sakmarian stage of the Cisuralian series. MCZ 2987, a tip of the rostrum and some teeth collected 2.5 km from the type locality (from localities 11-13), was originally referred to C. wilmarthi by Lewis and Vaughn (1965). A redescription of sphenacodonts by Michel Laurin (1993 and 1994), revealed that it can't be assigned to any named sphenacodont genus. Although its teeth also bear cutting edges without serrations, they are more bulbous, not as strongly compressed laterally and not curved distally. A new genus wasn't erected for MCZ 2987, as it is very fragmentary and lacks sufficient diagnostic features. ==Description== Cutleria was assigned to the Haptodontinae by Lewis and Vaughn (1965) on the basis of similarities to Haptodus baylei and H. longicaudata (now Palaeohatteria). Currie (1977) described the second haptodontine from North America, Haptodus garnettensis. In 1979, he synonymized all European haptodontines, as well as C. wilmarthi, with H. baylei. Later, Laurin (1993 and 1994) considered Haptodontinae to represent a polyphyletic grade of basal sphenacodonts, and revalidated Cutleria among other genera and species. His revision has been accepted since. Only three phylogenetic analyses included Cutleria. Laurin (1994) and Fr√∂bisch et al. (2011) recovered Cutleria as the sister taxon of Sphenacodontoidea, while the significantly larger analysis of Benson (in press) recovered it as the basalmost sphenacodontid. Benson (in press) listed three synapomorphies between Cutleria and more derived sphenacodontids: their frontal is more than 2.5 times the length of the parietal (as it was noted by Laurin in 1994), a strongly posteroventrally inclined temporal roof (absent in Secodontosaurus), and a lateral centrale that covers the proximal ends of the first-third distal carpals. However, only one additional step was required to place Cutleria outside Sphenacodontidae, as the sister taxon of Sphenacodontoidea (which is the node \\"Therapsida + Sphenacodontidae\\"). The cladogram below shows Cutleria phylogenetic position among other synapsids following Benson (2012). ==Etymology== Cutleria was first described and named by George Edward Lewis and Peter Paul Vaughn in 1965 and the type species is Cutleria wilmarthi. The generic name is derived from the name of the Cutler Formation in which the holotype was found. The specific name honors Wilmarth for finding the holotype. ==References== Category:Fossil taxa described in 1965 Category:Cisuralian synapsids Category:Cisuralian synapsids of North America Category:Sphenacodont genera Category:Cisuralian genus first appearances ","title":"Cutleria (animal)"},{"id":"35261018","text":"Alucita sakhalinica is a moth of the family Alucitidae.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The hilltop site for the church was recommended by William Wordsworth who, when describing it in a letter in 1836, said \\"there is no situation out of the Alps, nor among them, more beautiful than that where this building is placed\\".William Wordsworth in (the letter was addressed to John Kenyon) ==History== Holy Trinity was built in 1836 with funds from Giles Redmayne, the owner of nearby Brathay Hall. Redmayne, who had bought the Brathay estate a few years previously, was a successful draper, who had a shop on London's fashionable Bond Street.'Who is it That Does Dictate the Fashions?' Or: Some Notes on Ladies Shops The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described the design chosen by Redmayne as \\"joyless\\": the architect is thought to have been John Latham, together with Redmayne himself. (Pevsner's description of the church as joyless was published in his North Lancashire volume of 1969. The revised edition describes the church as drab.) The church was consecrated in October 1836 by the bishop of Chester, whose diocese at that time extended as far north as the Lake District. Additions were made to the church in 1905 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. ==Architecture== Exterior The church has a stuccoed exterior with stone dressing and a slate roof. Its architectural style is Romanesque. It is orientated north-south (in the following description the liturgical directions are given). The plan consists of a six-bay nave, a short chancel with a north vestry, and a tower at the southwest corner. Around the church are pilaster buttresses, and a corbelled frieze. The tower is in three stages. In the bottom stage is a west round-headed window and a north doorway. The middle stage contains two slots on each side, and the top stage two-light round- headed louvred bell openings. Along the sides of the nave are more round- headed windows. At the west end are three round-headed windows, the central being taller with two lights, and the flanking windows with a single light. At the northwest corner is a square pinnacle. The east window has three lights. Interior Inside the church is an inscribed octagonal font carried on a squat round shaft. The chancel contains panelling, and there is a reredos behind the altar. The stained glass in the east window dates from 1916, and is by Powells. On the south wall are three windows dating from about 1910, designed by Revd E. Geldart and made by Taylor and Clifton. There is a ring of six bells, cast in 1836 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The organ is by Wordsworth, a firm from Leeds. ==Present day== The benefice is united with those of St Mary, Ambleside, and Holy Trinity, Langdale. Together with the Mission Chapel, Little Langdale, and the Ambleside Baptist Church, the churches form the Loughrigg Team Ministry. In 2011 there was a major restoration of the building and its facilities. The church has become a venue for musical events, in addition to holding services each Sunday. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Skelwith *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Cumbria Category:Diocese of Carlisle Category:Grade II listed churches in Cumbria Category:Romanesque Revival church buildings in England Category:19th- century Church of England church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1836 Category:Austin and Paley buildings ","title":"Holy Trinity Church, Brathay"},{"id":"35261273","text":"Alucita tridentata is a moth of the family Alucitidae.

He wrote several books in Potawatomi and founded St. Ignatius Mission among the Kalispel. Hoecken died of malaria sailing up the Missouri River. ==Biography== Christiaan J. A. Hoeken (1808-1851) Dutch period Christian Hoecken (born Christiaan Hoeken) was the oldest son of Jacobus Hoeken and Johanna Vermeer. He was born in Tilburg (The Netherlands) and baptized the same day, February 28, 1808.https://www.openarch.nl/rat:2cd709de-3863-11e0-bcd1-8edf61960649, The Hoecken's were very religious; Jacobus was chairman of the parochial choir and all six children would leave the house joining a religious order.Cees Weijters, study of: C.Hoecken, A.Hoecken, C.Smarius, Regionaal Archief Tilburg, collection Weijters nr 422, inventory nr 8. Christian attended two Dutch catholic seminaries in his region (the nowadays southern province Noord- Brabant) namely Beekvliet (1821) and Herlaar (1829). Hoecken was ordained a priest March 20, 1832. He was then sent to the United States 'to work among the Indians' and 'strengthen the young catholic church oversea'. In September that year his ship set sail to Maryland,Prayer card, printed by A van der Voort & Sons, Tilburg, The Netherlands, 1851 (see photo gallery) arriving there August 7. He would never see his parents again. Hoecken was a pioneer in the sense that many fathers and sisters from his home region followed him to the US, among which his younger brother Adrian. Novitiate Hoecken settled at the Jesuit St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant, Missouri, for his novitiate. In 1833 the mission among the Indians was entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1836 Hoecken was ready to go out and work as a missionary. He would work 15 years among the first nations and was one of the first companions of father De Smet. Kickapoo mission In 1836 Hoecken started helping the Flamish (Belgian) missionary Van Quickenborne and three of his assistant fathers (Andrew Mazella, Edmund Barry and George Miles) in founding a mission among the Kickapoos in nowadays Kansas. The mission post was installed at Salt Creek close to the Missouri river, between two Indian settlements and 5 miles from the army post Fort Leavenworth (nowadays Kansas City). Hoeckens' group had a budget of 1.000 dollars of their superiors (the Jesuit order) and 500 dollars promised by the government (the Indian Commission) if and when a school would start. A school and a two-storey building were constructed indeed, but the mission failed. Few Kickapoo attended mass and only 14 children were baptized, that is in a camp just outside the fort in 1837. After the death of Van Quickenborne in August that year Hoecken remained a few months at the post, that was to be abandoned.\\"The History of St. Mary's Academy & College\\" Potawatomi missions Hoecken succeeded Van Quickenborne at the Saint- Stanislaus mission among the Potawatomi on Osage River, Kansas. He gave his flock lessons in agriculture. In 1838 Hoecken visited a group of 150 Potawatomi that were displaced from Wabash River, Indiana, to southeastern Kansas. It took an eight days walk to reach the tribe and he visited them three times that year. In januari he stayed for two and a half weeks for the marriage of chief Nesswawke's two daughters. He then returned in May and in October 1838. When he returned in May, the Jesuit fathers De Smet and Pierre Verhaegen were just establishing 'St. Joseph's Mission' at Council Bluffs, Iowa.\\"History of the Kickapoo mission and parish, the first Catholic church in Kansas\\", par Wm. W. Graves, Gilbert J. Garraghan et George Towle, page 48 But there was little success in persuading the tribal members -sometimes called Bluff Indians- to convert to Christianity. In November 1838 Hoecken took over the charge of father Petit who had joined another group of Potawatomi in a forced 660 miles march to new reservation lands. St Mary's Mission at Sugar Creek, which he founded in 1839 by building a church and a school, was the true ending point of the Potawatomi Trail of Death.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" pp. 27 and 39. Two years later mother Duchesne joined this mission station in the eastern Kansas reservation. Father Felix Verreydt succeeded Hoecken at Sugar Creek, enabling him to visit other tribes in Kansas and the upper-Missouri region. In a letter to his parents (dec 22, 1839) Hoecken refers to his first missionary activities speaking of the 'Kieke-Paux' and the 'Estawabiniers' on the river banks of the 'Osagis'. Many of the Indians were ill and Hoecken cared for them the best he could, baptizing some of them. Then, 'in another place', father Petit came to him with 750 'savages', including 350 catholic. Armed with a large axe father Hoecken took the lead and in three days a church was ready. But \\"it was not more than a stable of Betlehem\\", he writes. In March 1839 the Indians moved again to a place 14 miles away and by Lent, they were moving on again, with father Hoecken amidst them. He writes: \\"At holy mass, the savages sang spiritual songs in their own language. I learned their language in a short time. After 2 or 3 months it was my duty to hear confession in their language. In the beginning it seems very difficult, but indeed it is not.\\" St.Ignatius and other missions Hoecken next visited the Ottawas, strategically converted their chief, and tried to banish alcohol intoxication from among the tribe. After that he preached among the Sioux, Gros Ventres, Ricaree, Mandans, and Assiniboins, of whom he reported to have baptized about 400 persons. In 1843 Hoecken founded the mission of St. Ignatius among the Kalispiels. He built a church thirty miles above the mouth of Clark's River, and converted most of the tribe, at the same time teaching them to build log houses and sow grain. From this station he visited the Zingomenes and four other tribes, and completed the conversion of the Shuyelpi Indians that had been begun by father De Smet. He then went to St. Louis.  Early death  Hoecken died of malaria at the age of 43 while sailing up the Missouri River back to his post in St. Louis, June 19, 1851. He was aboard the Saint-Ange, a steamboat piloted by Joseph LaBarge with destination Fort Union. Hoecken was in company of De Smet and a group of about 24 fur traders from Canada, Amerika, France, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Italy when 'different diseases' deployed, causing the death of nine passengers. The day before, Hoecken had taken confession of De Smet, who was seriously ill as well; but De Smet recovered.https://g-geschiedenis.eu/2015/09/21/zwartrok-bij-de-roodhuiden/ article 21-09-2015 From St. Louis University the latter wrote a detailed report of father Hoecken's death to Lyon and Paris, the Jezuit centres in France.

Since his father was working in different cities of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the family had to move permanently. The war found them in Makeyevka. In October 1941, Pavlo with his mother were evacuated to Kizel, Perm Krai, Russia. In Kizel Pavlo worked as a turner at the munitions factory, that was evacuated from Kiev. In January 1943 he was called up to the Soviet Army and sent for training to the military infantry school. After six months of training Pavlo was referred to the Guards 349 at 105th Guards Vienna Airborne Division, that was fighting in Hungary and Austria within 3rd Ukrainian Front. He was wounded in one of the battles for Vienna and discharged after treatment. Vigderhaus dreamt of becoming an architect from the time that he was a schoolboy; shortly upon demobilization, he was walking through Stalino destroyed during the war, and saw an officer, who was drawing sketches of ruins. Pavlo came closer and learned that this man was an architect and was taking building measurements for its reconstruction. Pavlo shared his dream with this man and he invited Pavlo to work to Oblast planning department (Oblproekt) as an assistant architect. In 1947 thanks to work in Oblproekt he met already known Donetsk architects A. Strashnov and A. Kuznetsov. They advised him to go to Kharkov and enter the institute. Pavlo followed their advice and together with his friend entered the Kharkov Institute of Civil Engineering and graduated from it in 1953. In 1957 Vigderhaus became a member of the USSR Union of Architects. During almost 60 years dedicated to architecture, Vigderhaus has created most part of the buildings in contemporary Donetsk, including monument \\"To Miner's Glory\\" (1967), which is considered the unofficial symbol of Donetsk In 1978 Vigderhaus was awarded the State Prize of USSR for landscape architecture in design - that was 8 years later after UNESCO has recognized Donetsk as the greenest industrial city in the world Vigderhaus had one son and three grandchildren. == Selected works == * stadium \\"Shakhtar\\" (Gorlovka) * administrative and laboratory buildings of \\"Ukrniisol\\" institute (Artemovsk) * residential area \\"Semenovka\\" (Donetsk) * experimental school for 2032 students in Donetsk (together with architects I.

The style was especially important and effective in silversmithing, but was also used in minor architectural ornamentation such as door and window reveals, picture frames, and a wide variety of the decorative arts.Schroder, \\"[the style] in its fully developed form is found only in metalwork.\\" It uses softly flowing abstract shapes in relief, sometimes asymmetrical, whose resemblance to the side view of the human ear gives it its name, or at least its \\"undulating, slithery and boneless forms occasionally carry a suggestion of the inside of an ear or a conch shell\\".Osborne, 61 It is often associated with stylized marine animal forms, or ambiguous masks and shapes that might be such, which seem to emerge from the rippling, fluid background, as if the silver remained in its molten state. In some other European languages, the style is covered by the local equivalent of the term cartilage baroque because the forms may resemble cartilage (e.g. Knorpelbarock in German, bruskbarokk in Norwegian, bruskbarok in Danish). However, those these terms may be rather widely and vaguely applied to a bewildering range of styles of Northern Mannerist and Baroque ornament. In Dutch, a \\"dolphin and mollusk\\" style is mentioned.Frederiks, J.W., Wrought Plate of North and South- Holland from the Renaissance Until the End of the Eighteenth Century, p. xiv, 2014, Springer, , 9789401036979, google books ==Metalwork== Although precedents have been traced in the graphic designs of Italian Mannerist artists such as Giulio Romano and Enea Vico,Schroder, \\"... its origins seem to lie in the graphic designs of such 16th-century Italian Mannerist artists as Giulio Romano (e.g. drawing for a fish-shaped ewer; Oxford, Christ Church) and Enea Vico. The latter‚Äôs designs for plate were published in the mid-16th century and may have been known in Utrecht.\\" the auricular style can first be found in 1598 in the important ornament book of Northern Mannerism, Architectura: Von Au√ütheilung, Symmetria und Proportion der F√ºnff Seulen ..., by Wendel Dietterlin of Stuttgart, in the second edition of 1598. It can be found in the designs of Hans Vredeman de Vries in the Netherlands, and was used most effectively in the hands of the Utrecht silversmiths Paul and Adam van Vianen, and Paul's pupil Johannes Lutma, who settled in Amsterdam. Another Dutch silversmith who worked in the auricular style was Thomas Bogaert. At mid-century, designs for plate by M. Mosyn were published in Amsterdam.A ewer is illustrated in John Fleming and Hugh Honour, Dictionary of the Decorative Arts, s.v. \\"Auricular style\\". Christian van Vianen, a son of Adam, worked in England at the courts of Charles I and Charles II, and took the style there.Osborne, 61 A bratina or Russian toasting-cup in the Walters Art Museum was made in Russia in 1650‚Äì70 in an auricular style that was presumably copied from pieces brought in by Dutch traders, perhaps as gifts to ease trade deals.Walters page on the object In metalwork, the style was in harmony with the malleable nature of the material, often giving the impression that the object is beginning to melt. It contrasted strongly with the preceding Mannerist style of crowded figurative scenes, as for example in the Lomellini Ewer and Basin of 1620-21, although some works managed to combine the two styles, as in a silver-gilt ewer and basin of 1630, made in Delft and now in Utrecht,Liedtke (2001), no. 146 (1630); Schroder with auricular elements replacing strapwork. Most of the key works are in the Netherlands, especially the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, whose collection includes ewer and basin sets by Paul van Vianen (1613, with Diana and Callisto) and Johannes Lutma (1647). Especially important is a gilded ewer by Adam van Vianen (1614).Schroder lists a number; Rijksmuseum pages: Adam van Vianen 1614, Paulus van Vianen 1613, Lutma 1647 The Adam van Vianen ewer is \\"a strikingly original work that is largely abstract and completely sculptural in its conception\\", and was commissioned by the Amsterdam goldsmiths' guild to commemorate the death of Paul, despite neither brother living in Amsterdam or being a member of the guild.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" The piece became famous and appears in several Dutch Golden Age paintings, both still lifes and history paintings, \\"no doubt in part because its bizarre form allowed it to pass as an object from an ancient and foreign land\\", and so useful for Old Testament scenes and the like.Liedtke (2007), 186-188, giving examples including Joseph and his brothers (this is the Warsaw version) by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. According to James Trilling, it \\"is one of the very few ornamental works that deserve recognition as art-historical turning points. Van Vianen's breakthrough was the introduction of inchoate or indeterminate form, which paved the way for both Rococo and modernist ornament.\\"Trilling, James, The Language of Ornament, p. 66, 2001, Thames and Hudson, It was raised by a lengthy process of chasing from a single sheet of silver, and chasing was the main technique used in auricular silver.Schroder in Oxford Art Online, \\"Adam van Vianen\\" Diana and Actaeon basin, Paul van Vianen, 1613 The Diana and Actaeon bowl of 1613 by Paul van Vianen (Rijksmuseum), shows scenes from the myth of Diana and Actaeon, with a border in the Auricular style.Rijsmuseum The \\"Dolphin Basin\\", which presumably once had a matching ewer, is an asymmetric form with watery motifs by Christian van Vianen (1635), now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.The Dolphin Basin by Christian van Vianen, Victoria and Albert Museum Engraved portrait by Jacob Lutma after Johannes Lutma the Elder, of Hans von Aachen with Adriaen de Vries and Paul van Vianen. The frame shows the auricular style's affinities with Mannerist strapwork Detail of a Lutma dish ==In other media== The style was also effective in carved wood, and used for furnitureDesigns for chairs in auricular style were published by the furniture-maker Friedrich Untensch, Frankfort-am-Main, ca 1650 (noted in Fleming and Honour 1977). and especially picture frames.Mosco; An example is noted in Harold Osborne, ed.

These Medici frames were more three-dimensional than the other frame styles, with more areas both raised or entirely cut through.Kerraker, Gene D., Looking at European Frames: A Guide to Terms, Styles, and Techniques, 18-21, 2009, Getty Publications, , 9780892369812, google books The framing styles were long- lasting, surviving in use long enough to be reinvigorated by the Rococo. The style was effective for cartouches, whether in three-dimensional uses or for bookplates and the like. It later influenced Rococo and then Art Nouveau ornament.Osborne, 61 ==NotesReferences== *Liedtke (2001): Liedtke, Walter A.

It belongs to the advanced harpaline assemblage, and if these are circumscribed sensu lato as a single subfamily, Pterostichinae are downranked to a tribe Pterostichini. However, as the former Pterostichitae supertribe of the Harpalinae as loosely circumscribed does seem to constitute a lineage rather distinct from Harpalus, its core group is here considered to be the present subfamily and the Harpalinae are defined more narrowly. They are usually mid- sized and rather stout ground beetles. Coloration is typically dark and without conspicuous patterns, but often with a strong sheen like polished metal. They are widely distributed and inhabit a wide range of terrestrial habitats. Unlike the more basal ground beetles which only eat small animals, the Pterostichinae include a large proportion of omnivorous or even herbivorous taxa. ==Systematics== This group includes the following tribes and genera: Tribe Abacetini Chaudoir, 1872 * Abacetus Dejean, 1828 * Abacidus LeConte, 1873 * Aristopus Laferte-Senectere, 1853 * Celioinkosa Straneo, 1951 * Chlaeminus Motschulsky, 1865 * Colpodichius Straneo, 1952 * Cosmodiscus Sloane, 1907 * Cyrtomoscelis Chaudoir, 1874 * Distrigidius Jeannel, 1948 * Ecnomolaus Bates, 1892 * Haptoderidius Straneo, 1975 * Haptoderodes Straneo, 1986 * Holconotus Schmidt-Goebel, 1846 * Inkosa Peringuey, 1926 * Mateuellus Deuve, 1990 * Metabacetus Bates, 1892 * Metaxellus Straneo, 1960 * Metaxys Chaudoir, 1857 * Novillidius Straneo, 1941 * Oodinkosa Straneo, 1939 * Ophonichius Straneo, 1942 * Pediomorphus Chaudoir, 1878 * Pioprosopus Tschitscherine, 1899 * Pollicobius Vinson, 1939 * Prostalomus Basilewsky, 1950 * Pseudabacetus Burgeon, 1935 * Pterostillichus Straneo, 1949 * Rhagadillius Straneo, 1951 * Tiferonia Darlington, 1962 * Trachelocyphoides Alluaud, 1934 * Trachelocyphus Tschitscherine, 1900 Tribe Catapieseini Bates, 1882 * Catapiesis Solier, 1835 * Homalomorpha Brulle, 1835 Tribe Chaetodactylini Tschitscherine, 1903 * Chaetodactyla Tschitscherine, 1897 Tribe Cnemalobini Germain, 1911 * Cnemalobus Guerin-Meneville, 1838 Tribe Cratocerini Lacordaire, 1854 * Brachidius Chaudoir, 1852 * Cratocerus Dejean, 1829 * Oxyglychus Straneo, 1938 Tribe Drimostomatini Chaudoir, 1872 * Abacaelostus Straneo, 1952 * Andrewesinulus Straneo, 1938 * Apsidocnemus Alluaud, 1936 * Barylaus Liebherr, 1985 * Caecocaelus Straneo, 1949 * Caelostomus W.S.

During his long career, he took part in combat in Sumatra and in the American Civil War. Hoff was born in Pennsylvania. He was appointed a midshipman from South Carolina on 28 October 1823. He was assigned that month to the schooner in the West Indies Squadron. In 1825 he was reassigned to the frigate and was aboard her when she transported the Marquis de Lafayette to France. In 1826 he transferred to the frigate in the Mediterranean Squadron. He passed the midshipman examination in 1828.Hamersly, p. 29. Hoff was acting sailing master at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, from 1828 to 1831 and was promoted to passed midshipman on 23 March 1829 and to lieutenant on 3 March 1831. In June 1831 he reported aboard the frigate and took part in the First Sumatran Expedition of 6‚Äì9 February 1832, a punitive expedition against the Chiefdom of Quallah Battoo (Kuala Batee, Aceh Barat Daya, Districts of Aceh, Aceh Sultanate) mounted as a reprisal for the massacre there a year earlier of the crew of the merchant ship Friendship. Potomac bombarded the settlement. Hoff, as part of a division of bluejackets and marines put ashore under the command of her executive officer, Lieutenant Irvine Shubrick. In the Battle of Quallah Battoo, the landing force captured two forts and killed the chiefdom's leader, Raja Po Muhammad, and eleven other Sumatrans in exchange for six Americans badly wounded. The expedition made Sumatran waters safe for American shipping for the following six years.Hamersly, p. 29.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900. Hoff was ordered to the frigate in 1837, then to the new frigate in the Pacific Squadron in 1843 to serve as her executive officer. Later in 1843, promoted to lieutenant commander, he transferred to the supply ship at Callao, Peru. He reported aboard the new frigate , operating the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, in 1848.Hamersly, p. 29. Promoted to commander on 6 February 1854, Hoff returned to USS Independence as her commanding officer in 1856. After Independence was laid up at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, Hoff became senior officer of the Pacific Squadron, embarked on the frigate in 1857. He returned to the United States in 1858 by sailing around Cape Horn, and in 1859 was ordered to the steam corvette at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Hamersly, p. 29.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900. Shortly after the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, Hoff was promoted to captain on 30 June 1861. He commanded the steam sloop-of-war in the Pacific Squadron from 1861 to 1862. Promoted to commodore on 16 July 1862, Hoff returned to the United States in 1862 and was on special duty in 1863, and after that performed ordnance duty in Philadelphia through the end of the war in April 1865 and thereafter until 1867.Hamersly, p. 29.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900. Hoff was promoted to rear admiral on 13 April 1867, and commanded the North Atlantic Squadron from October 1867 to October 1869. During his tour in command of the squadron, he dealt with many sensitive issues, including troubles in Cuba, at the time a colony of Spain, where the Ten Years' War broke out in October 1868. He promptly and energetically intervened in the conflict to protect resident American citizens from the actions of Spanish officials.Hamersly, pp. 29-30.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900. Hoff was placed on the retired list on 19 September 1868, but continued to serve the Navy after that. Returning to the United States in August 1869, he became a member of the Naval Retiring Board in October 1869, and, while serving in the capacity, was also President of the Board of Visitors at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, handling examinations for the Class of 1870.Hamersly, p. 30.Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900.

Its borders include Solano Avenue to the North, Eunice and Hopkins Streets to the South, Spruce Street to the East, and the Albany city limits to the West. It has a shopping and business district, as well as hilly terrain made up of volcanic rock, rhyolite, and 136 stairways carved into the landscape. ==History== After a 1906 earthquake along the western coast, about 15,000 residents from San Francisco decided to move East. Commuter rail had made it possible to now inhabit the countryside and Duncan McDuffie and Joseph Mason took full advantage of this. Under Mason- McDuffie Co., they purchased 700 acres for a subdivision that would eventually be known as Berkeley. Garden suburbs and the Beaux Arts style were prominent influences for this new area. At one point, the local Chamber of Commerce even proposed that Berkeley be named the state capital. This idea influenced lots of the design, bringing lots of stone and classical elements to the town. Mason-McDuffie Co. included racial covenants in the deeds of sale of homes in the Northbrae area that forbid their sale \\"to Asiatics or Negroes.\\". ==Natural and physical features== The Northbrae neighborhood is known for its hilly terrain. The built environment follows along the natural topography which includes trees and existing outcropping of volcanic rock. The volcanic rock in the area, rhyolite, is primarily composed of quartz and is a significant feature of the area. The streets are arranged predominantly N-S in order to emphasize the views of the San Francisco bay and the hills. Most of the homes are bungalows and are tucked into the hills, connected by stairways that have been carved into the landscape. ==Notable places and public amenities== Northbrae is home to many great places in Berkeley. The North Branch Berkeley Library,North Branch Berkeley Library the Martin Luther King Middle School, and Solano Avenue shopping district are all integral parts of Berkeley. Northbrae is also home to a northern business district and many great parks. The MLK Middle School runs a program called the Edible Schoolyard that attracts many people every year.Edible Schoolyard Northbrae also houses a public center called the Fountain Circle. There are also many paths in the neighborhood for walking.paths ==Transportation== The neighborhood was originally designed with the intention of each single family home having direct access to the train under the 1916 zoning law. Today, however, the North Berkeley BART station is just 0.5 mile away and is accessible by 2 local bus routes. There are 2 bicycle boulevards that promote alternative transportation. ==Active associations== *Berkeley Path Wanderers Association *Friends of The Fountain and The Walk *Solano Avenue Association *Friends of King Park ==Works Cited== https://web.archive.org/web/20140310231804/https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/neighborhoods/2011/ Category:Neighborhoods in Berkeley, California ","title":"Northbrae, Berkeley, California"},{"id":"35261693","text":"Nicholas Felton may refer to: * Nicholas Felton (bishop) (1556‚Äì1626), English academic and bishop * Nicholas Felton (graphic designer), infographic designer ","title":"Nicholas Felton"},{"id":"35261699","text":"Jim McKeown may refer to: * James McKeown (missionary), Scottish missionary who founded the Church of Pentecost * James McKeown, Irish football goalkeeper who plays for Grimsby Town * Jim McKeown (soccer) (born 1956), retired American soccer defender * Jim McKeown (racing driver), Australian racing driver ==See also== *James McKeown (born 1989), English-born Irish professional footballer ","title":"Jim McKeown"},{"id":"35261707","text":"Alberto Gonz√°lez Dom√≠nguez (11 April 1904 in Buenos Aires ‚Äì 14 September 1982 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine mathematician working on analysis, probability theory and quantum field theory.

He is the author of Personal Annual Reports that weave measurements into a tapestry of graphs, maps and statistics to reflect the year's activities. He is the co-founder of Daytum.com, and was a member of the product design team at Facebook. His work has been profiled in publications including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Wired and Good Magazine and has been recognized as one of the 50 most influential designers in America by Fast Company. He is credited for influencing the design of Facebook's timeline. == Work == His work focuses on \\"translating quotidian data into meaningful objects and experiences\\". His most famous art project is the Feltron Project (personal annual reports starting in 2005 until 2014), where he registers the minutiae of his life, including data regarding the places he visited, the music he listened to, and his everyday activities in general (gathered from his own memory, calendar, photos, and Last.fm data) and transforms it into a series of artistic charts. His purpose is not only analytical but also aesthetic, playing between the realms of self-quantification, design and art. In the same vein he created in 2009 Daytum together with Ryan Case, an app destined to track personalized every-day data, which could be shared between friends. Even though it was very popular, it had some issues regarding design, so its reception was not completely positive. They are also responsible for the creation of Facebook's timeline, which was a challenge due to the impossibility to predict the user's content. That is why their design focused on being flexible enough to allow for a wide variety of content. Felton's most recent work is the app Reporter, which via short surveys gathers data about the user and tries to \\"illuminate aspects of your life that might be otherwise unmeasurable\\". Even though it might seem that Felton's main concern is self- quantification, he no longer quantifies his own life. After the 2014 edition, he paused his Annual Reports, stating that: \\"The world of personal data has changed considerably since the project began in 2005 and this edition [2014 edition] attempts to capture its current state\\". Regarding this last edition, he commented that: \\"While previous editions have relied on custom solutions to gather ethereal personal data, this edition is based entirely on commercially available applications and devices\\". As a consequence, he no longer gathered data manually, which generated a problem of context: devices cannot connect raw data in order to tell a story. Nonetheless Felton is confident that data extracted from these devices, if put into relation, can lead us to modify our habits to live a happier and healthier life. He is now focused on exploring new ways to present the data rather than in the gathering itself, especially through the use of photography, as we can see in his book Photoviz: Visualizing Information through Photography. According to Felton, data is one of the main sources of information for contemporary designers: \\"It's one of the greatest opportunities designers have ever had to tell stories visually. It's the most exciting time to be a designer or visual artist, and it's data- driven.\\" == References == Category:American graphic designers Category:Facebook employees Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Nicholas Felton (graphic designer)"},{"id":"35261722","text":"The battle of Yanbu was an Ottoman attempt to recapture the city of Yanbu. == Battle of Yanbu == The Battle on Yanbu began on December 1, 1916, when Fakhri Pasha, when two brigades invaded the outskirts of the city. The Ottomans initially had repelled the Arabs from strategic points in the city. Within a couple of days Pasha controlled all routes in and out of the city. The Arab soldiers in the city began constructing a makeshift airstrip for use by British aircraft. More Arab and British reinforcements arrived and strengthened defenses in the city. Five British Navy ships also arrived to help in the defense of the city, including Dufferin, HMS M31 and HMS Suva. T.E. Lawrence stated, \\"Afterwards, old Dakhil Allah told me he had guided the Turks down to rush Yenbo in the dark that they might stamp out Faisal's army once for all; but their hearts had failed them at the silence and the blaze of lighted ships from end to end of the harbour, with the eerie beams of the searchlights revealing the bleakness of the glacis they would have to cross. So they turned back: and that night, I believe, the Turks lost their war.\\" By December 9, Arab counter-attacks opened up the routes to the city, and flights from severely attacked the Ottoman columns. Because of the Navy's presence in the ocean off of Yanbu, Pasha called off all advances on the night of December 11/12. Due to logistical errors, and counterattacks from the Arabs, the Ottomans started the retreat to Medina on January 18, 1917, thus ending the recapture of Yanbu. ==References== * Yanbu Category:Battles of World War I involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:December 1916 events Category:January 1917 events ","title":"Capture of Yanbu"},{"id":"35261723","text":"Heliozela hammoniella is a moth of the Heliozelidae family.

The firm has headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, with a Middle East headquarters at Jumeirah Lakes Towers in Dubai, as well as locations in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States.https://www.synergiaone.com/mouawad.html Founded in 1891 in Beirut, Lebanon by David Mouawad, the firm is now led by 4th generation co- guardians Fred Mouawad, Alain Mouawad and Pascal Mouawad. ==History== First generation The Mouawad Company and brand began with David Mouawad (1865‚Äì1951) who spent more than two decades in New York City and Mexico learning the craft of watchmaker, goldsmith, and jeweler before returning to Beirut in 1891. He opened a small shop in Beirut in 1908 where he combined the trade of watch and jewelry repairs, with his passion for creating intricate clocks and fashioning one-of-a-kind pieces commissioned by wealthy clients. Second generation His son Fayez Mouawad (1917‚Äì1990) expanded the business in the 1950s when he moved to Saudi Arabia. He was able to capitalize on the Middle East's increased oil wealth by making personalized jewelry for people in the area. Third generation The firm moved into the European and worldwide market under Fayez's son Robert Mouawad. He had initially studied in Europe to become a doctor but returned after being convinced by his father to join the family business. He started as a salesman with Mouawad in order to learn the business from the ground up, later entering into an agreement with his father to take over the business as the sole president. In the early 1970s, Robert moved the headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland. He took many risks with the firm by purchasing some of the world's largest diamonds. He expanded the brand into Europe, Asia, and North America and began producing watches in the early 1990s. He's also contributed to the jewelry education and research through support of the Gemological Institute of America whose campus in Carlsbad, California is named in his honor. Robert Mouawad acquired a historical residence in Beirut, Lebanon to host his collections of fine arts and antique pieces, and in 2006 established the Robert Mouawad Private Museum for his collections of books, ceramics, architectural elements, pottery, ancient weapons, carpets, jewelry, objets d'art and rare precious stones. Fourth generation In 2010, Robert Mouawad left the firm to focus on his real estate group, the Robert Mouawad Foundation, and his museum. He officially retired on January 1, 2010, and the company was then led by his sons Fred Mouawad and Pascal Mouawad. Alain Mouawad joined to head up the watch division in January 2013. Diamond collection The Ahmedabad diamond Indore Pears diamonds The Mouawad Liliac diamond Diamonds owned by the Mouawad family include the Ahmedabad which is a pear shaped diamond that weighs 78.86 carats with a D-VS1 Grade. Mouawad is the owner of the Indore Pears which are linked to the Malabar Hill Murder. In January 1925, armed men attacked a car in Bombay which was being driven by an official of the Bombay Corporation. The passenger in the vehicle was a young Muslim woman who was the subject of the attack. The official was killed and four British officers came to the aid of the woman. Robbery was not the motive for this crime as the young woman was believed to be a dancer at the Court of Tukoji Rao III. The woman escaped from being a concubine and the murder was believed to be retaliation. The diamonds were purchased several times throughout the years until they were purchased by Robert Mouawad in 1987. The Queen of Holland diamond (:it:Regina d'Olanda) is another in the Mouawad collection. Its origin is unknown; however, it was believed to have been brought from South Africa to the Netherlands. It was first cut in 1904 by F. Freidman & Co. who made it a cushion-cut and named it after Queen Wihelmina of the Netherlands, which is incorrectly referred to as Holland. The diamond was re-cut sometime after the 1960s into its current weight of 135.92 carats. It is judged to be internally flawless and 'D' color by the Gemological Institute of America. This diamond was also formerly owned by William Goldberg. Mouawad is the owner of the Jubilee Diamond. The Jubilee Diamond was known as the Reitz Diamond and is a colourless, cushion-shaped diamond weighing 245.35 carats (49.07 grams). It is the sixth largest diamond in the world and originally named after Francis William Reitz who was the president of the Orange Free State at the time the diamond was discovered in the area. The Jubilee is the largest diamond in the Mouawad collection. The Mouawad Lilac is estimated to be worth $20M (USD) and weighs 24.44 carat. It is an emerald cut pink diamond that is so saturated with color that it gives off a purplish, almost maroon, hue. ==Guinness World Records== The Mouawad Splendor diamond Mouawad has five Guinness World Records: The most valuable jewellery coffer in the world ‚Äî the Flower of Eternity Jewellery Coffer ($3.5M), the most valuable necklace in the world ($55M) ‚Äî the Mouawad L‚ÄôIncomparable Diamond Necklace featuring the world's largest internally flawless diamond, the Incomparable diamond (407.48 carats).

The lakes include North Manistique Lake, Big Manistique Lake, and South Manistique Lake. The towns surrounding the lakes are Curtis Township, Germfask, and Helmer. The lakes are known for vacationing and fishing. They are also in close proximity to other natural sights such as the Great Lakes, rivers, and smaller lakes as well as tourist attractions including the Canada‚ÄìUS border, the Soo Locks, Mackinac Island, parks, and museums. ==North Manistique Lake== North Manistique Lake is located in Luce County, Michigan. The lake has about 1700 acres of surface area. Springs on the northern and eastern shores and an inlet on the western shore flow into the lake. Helmer Creek provides the only outlet moving south into Big Manistique Lake. Both private and commercial residences populate most of the shoreline with some public land in the form of county parks and boat launches. The bottom of the lake is bowl shaped. It contains some shallow flat areas and a deep area in the middle. Nearly half of the lake is less than fifteen feet deep while the maximum depth is approximately fifty feet. In the deep sections of the lake, the substrate found at the bottom is peat, and in the shallow sections of the lake, the substrates found at the bottom are sand and marl. On the western shore, there is a shallow rock reef. While aquatic vegetation is rarely found, some plants are able to grow in North Manistique including rushes, Chara, and Potamogeton. Fish community North Manistique Lake shares many of the same species of fish as inland lakes of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Walleyes, northern pike, perch, trout, splake, and smallmouth bass are some of the popular fish found in the lake. Walleyes and yellow perch started being stocked in the mid-1930s and continued until the early 1940s. Rainbow trout were stocked from 1947 to 1961 and again in 1982. Northern pike was stocked from 1962 to 1977 and in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1998, and 2000. Brown trout was stocked from 1980-1984 since the program was discontinued after 1984. Walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked since the late 1970s and have continued to be stocked until 2012. Adult lake trout have been stocked from 1982 through 1999. Rock bass and smallmouth bass in North Manistique have won eleven State of Michigan Master Angler awards from 1994 to 2000. ==Big Manistique Lake== Big Manistique Lake, also known as Manistique Lake, is located in Luce County and Mackinac County in Michigan. The lake is the largest of the three Manistique Lakes with around 10,000 acres of surface area. Helmer Creek flows into the lake on the north side, and Portage Creek flows into the lake on the south side from South Manistique Lake. Portage Creek contains the Portage Creek Dam which adjusts the water level in South Manistique Lake for summer recreation. The dam also lets fish travel both upstream and downstream. Helmer Creek is a trout stream and flows from North Manistique into Big Manistique. Helmer Creek also has a dam called the Tressler Dam which allows fish to easily flow downstream. Manistique River is an outlet on the west side of Big Manistique and drains into Lake Michigan. The Manistique Lake Dam is downstream of the lake and the connection between the Manistique River and the Fox River. The dam keeps fish from moving from the Manistique River to Big Manistique Lake. Big Manistique Lake The shore of Big Manistique is populated by both private and commercial residences. There is also some public land containing four boat access sites. The lake has a uniform bathymetry with maximum depth of about twenty feet. The majority of the lake has a depth of less than fifteen feet. In the shallow areas of the lake, the substrate at the bottom of the lake consists of sand, gravel, and rock, while in deeper areas, the substrate at the bottom of the lake consists of sand and organic matter. Aquatic vegetation is rare and can be found in the lake's shallow sections and in submerged beds. Fish community Fish families that can be found in Big Manistique Lake are Cyprinidae, Catostomidae, Centrarchidae, Esocidae, Ictaluridae, Percidae, and Slamonida. Minnows, white suckers, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, panfish such as yellow perch and rock bass, and lake herring make up the prey fish population in the lake. Walleye and bluegill fish are also common in Big Manistique. Walleye fry were stocked beginning and ending in 1935. Then, they were stocked from 1970 up until 1980 and again in 2005. Lake sturgeon were stocked in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1990, and smallmouth bass were stocked in 1998. Northern pike, rock bass, and smallmouth bass from Big Manistique Lake from 1994 to 2005 have won three State of Michigan Master Angler awards. ==South Manistique Lake== South Manistique Lake is also known as Whitefish Lake. It has a surface area of approximately 4000 acres. The lake is situated in the northwestern part of Mackinac County in the towns of Portage, Michigan and Newton Township, Michigan. Curtis, Michigan is in between South Manistique and Big Manistique lakes, on the northern shore of South Manistique. The land surrounding the lake is described as wetlands of woods and flowers with sandy soil. There are four streams that flow into the lake: Norton Creek, Taylor Creek, Strom Creek, and Shoepac River. The only outlet of the lake is Portage Creek in Curtis, and it drains into Big Manistique. The deepest part of the lake is twenty-nine feet. The shore consists of sand, muck, and fibrous peat. Aquatic vegetation is more prominent in South Manistique compared to the other two lakes. Some of the vegetation includes Chara, Potomegaton, bladderwort, flatstem pondweed, northern milfoil, lily pads, cattails, bulrushes, and common naiad. There are four boat launches available for public access, one owned by the town of Curtis and three owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The lake is popular for recreation activities in the summer and ice fishing in the winter. Fish community Walleye fish are a prominent species found in South Manistique Lake. The lake was stocked in the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. After the mid-1990s, the lake began supporting natural reproduction of the walleyes. Bluegill was reported as having poor fishery due to high angler harvest as well as predators such as walleyes and other large fish. Several other fish species found in South Manistique include yellow perch, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, and splake. Muskellunge fish were stocked in 1972 and after 1980 every two to four years. Stocking of muskellunge decreased in the 1990s but still continues. Most populations are maintained by natural reproduction in South Manistique. ==Aquatic plants== Aquatic plants in lakes provide a source of food for bacteria, fish, waterfowl, insects, and mammals because they convert sunlight and nutrients into living plant tissue than can be used by these organisms. Roots from the vegetation also make a diverse environment for the fish which is essential for their reproduction. ==Tourism and recreational activities== Tourists visit the Manistique Lakes year-round as both warm and cold recreation are offered. Cabins are available for visitors to rent throughout the year by local rental companies in surrounding towns. Warm weather Warmer temperatures start in late April. The warm weather opens activities including fishing, swimming, snorkeling, and water skiing. Boats, motors, and jet skis can be rented from local dealers. There are many public access sights on the lakes for both recreational boating and personal watercraft in the town of Curtis, Michigan. Cold weather Ice begins to form in early December. Winter sports and ice fishing events are available from late December to mid-April.

An early proponent of the progressive education movement of John Dewey, Alexander was the driving force behind the creation of the New College, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City.George W. Lucero, (2009) \\"New College, A Demonstration Experimental Teachers College\\" doctoral dissertation (Normal, IL:Illinois State University), http://search.proquest.com/docview/749399096 He was its chairman from 1932-1938. Alexander was described by his contemporaries as a hard-working, pragmatic man and a common sense academic with a genius for organization and a love of education.Goodwin Watson, \\"Utopia and Rebellion: The New College Experiment\\" In M. Miles (ed.) Innovation in Education. (New York, NY: Teachers College, Columbia University, 1964) ==Early life (1887-1913)== Richard Alexander was born on July 3, 1887, in Smicksburg, Pennsylvania, to Mary Elizabeth Wilhelm Alexander and William John Alexander, one of four children. He had two older brothers, John Wilhelm Alexander and Wallace P. Alexander, and a younger sister, Ethel M. Alexander. A move to Kirksville, Missouri was precipitated by a tenuous family situation that led to the separation of young Thomas's parents when he was very young. William John Alexander, who was at one time President of Beaver College (now Arcadia University) in Beaver, Pennsylvania, ended up in San Francisco, California, where he died in 1926. The relationship Richard Alexander had with his father is not known, as there was little contact between them. By the age of 14, he was enrolled in the Kirksville Public School system graduating from Kirksville Public High School at the age of 16 in 1903. He attended the First District Normal School (later, Truman State University) in Kirksville, graduating with a Bachelor of Pedagogy (Pd.B.) in 1905 and later receiving a Master of Pedagogy (M.Pd) in 1907. While working on his master's degree, he taught in Kirksville, rising to the role of principal by 1906.Thomas Alexander is listed in the 1906 Kirksville City Directory as the principal of Willard Public School. Alexander applied to the University of Missouri only to find disappointment when he was told he would not be given credit for the work he had done at the normal school. Alexander started Columbia University studying German on September 25, 1907 on a trial basis. Coming from a rural setting, Alexander did not let himself be bored in the big city. He obtained employment during the week downtown as an usher in the theater district, including the Metropolitan Opera House. It was very good pay, however most of the performances were at night which ordinarily might interfere with studies. Alexander sensibly saw an advantage to the situation. Reminiscing years later to his son, Alexander said there wasn't much work to do as an usher.George W. Lucero (2012). The Cultured and Competent Teacher, the Story of New College, manuscript/dissertation, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, http://search.proquest.com/docview/749399096 He went down to the theater every night at a certain time, showed people to their seats, and after the first act started, he was basically finished. After seeing the show a few times he then took a book to study and read. Later in his life he would tell students that if you must get a job, try to get one where you would have the opportunity to learn something. Alexander knew that every experience could be a learning moment. In finding employment, even part-time, one should seek a position where the brain is challenged rather than numbed in robotic drudgery. Alexander always advocated pedagogy of ‚Äúlifelong learning‚Äù and lived it as an example of a positive life choice. After receiving the undergraduate credit he sought, Alexander applied and received a year's leave of absence to spend the 1908-1909 school year teaching overseas and studying German at the University of Jena with Professor Wilhelm Rein. He had obtained employment teaching science at Robert College, a boys' school in Constantinople, Turkey, until the Adana MassacreAmerican victims of Turkish riots. (1909, April 17). New York Times, p. 5. prompted him to Germany. Returning to New York, Alexander completed all the academic requirements to graduate in 1909, but had to wait until, 1910, to receive his A.B. diploma because of a certain physical education requirement. Alexander needed to demonstrate his ability to swim the length of a pool and receive a certificate of completion. It was not that he did not know how to swim; he just thought the requirement was silly and so he put it off until it was too late to register for the 1909 commencement. This event caused Alexander to think that there was something seriously wrong with an education curriculum that was so structured. The philosopher Dr. Mortimer J. Adler suffered a similar fate as he failed to pass the required swimming test for a bachelor's degree at Columbia College. Like Alexander, he considered it a nuisance. Adler never received his A.B. degree, but so impressed the faculty he was allowed into graduate school to complete his doctorate in psychiatry. Dr. Adler later received his A. B. degree in 1983.For 7,300 at Columbia, a day full of Balloons and Diplomas,‚Äù New York Times (1983, May 18) p. B1 Alexander accepted a position teaching science at Heathcote School(also known as Heathcote Hall) in Harrison, Westchester County, New York, about twenty-five miles north from Manhattan. This was a private boarding school for young boys. During the summer break Alexander returned to Europe to continue his graduate studies. At Columbia University he skipped the desire to complete a master's program and registered as a doctoral student with Dr. Paul Monroe during which time he was also a graduate assistant to Dr. Edward L. Thorndike. ==Nashville and Peabody(1914-1924)== 1n 1914, Alexander received an appointment to the George Peabody College for Teachers, in Nashville, TN. It let him solidify some of his thoughts about teacher education, the concept of community, and curriculum theory. It would show him that the logistics of starting a school within a school is very feasible. It would also introduce him to a couple of people who would forever change his life, Grace Elizabeth Andrews, his future wife, and William Fletcher Russell, son of Teachers College Dean James Earl Russell. The next year, 1915, was significant for Alexander in that he would receive academic acclaim as the founder of the Peabody Demonstration School and a contributor to the establishment of the Knapp Farm. The school lasted as a part of the Peabody College campus until 1974, when the college decided to close it. Afterwards, a sympathetic group of parents, alumni, students and teachers re-formed the demonstration school as the University School of Nashville, a non-profit, independent institution.Taken from the University School of Nashville history website, next to a picture of a very young Dr. Alexander. (http://www.usn.org/podium/default.aspx?t=113323) Alexander completed his dissertation and received his doctorate in 1916, submitting his dissertation entitled The Prussian Elementary Schools.Alexander, R. T. (1919). The Prussian Elementary Schools. New York, NY: Macmillan. The work, a detailed description of Prussian educational practices before the war, was published in book form in 1919. This is significant because, Alexander's next major work, (co-written with Beryl Parker) entitled The New Education in the German Republic, offered a detailed description of German education after the war, in contrast to his first book. Alexander and Russell spent three years in Nashville together at one time briefly sharing an apartment until Russell left in 1917 to become Dean of the College of Education at the State University of Iowa. In 1923 Russell became a professor of education and associate director of the International Institute at Teachers College until he succeeded his father as Dean of Teachers College in 1927. It was Russell that brought Alexander to the faculty at Columbia as part of the International Institute and later, it was Russell who approved the creation of New College. ==International Institute of Teachers College (1924-1930)== In 1923, Russell left Iowa to accept the position of Associate Director of the International Institute of Teachers College, with Paul Monroe as Director. In 1924, Dr. Thomas Alexander was asked to become part of the staff joining Isaac Leon Kandel, Lester L. Wilson, Stephen P. Duggan, Milton C. Del Manzo, George Counts, and Ruth McMurry. Alexander was the German expert at the institute and as such he returned to Europe many times and cultivated friendships with Dr. Fritz Karsen,Radde, G. & Karsen, S. (1999). Fritz Karsen: Ein Berliner Schulreformer Der Weimarer Zeit [Fritz Karsen: a Berlin school reformer of the Weimar period]. Berlin, Germany: Peter Lang Publishing. Dr. Franz Hilker, Dr. Peter Petersen, Paul Geheeb, and Adolphe Ferri√®re. ==New College (1930-1939)== All of Alexander's experiences thus far convinced him that a new type of teachers college was necessary to address the social issues of the day. Originally, New College's progressive foundations, its philosophical origins, and its influences were the Concept of Community, Critical Pedagogy, and German Progressive Education.Lamberti, M. (2000). Radical schoolteachers and the origins of the progressive education movement in Germany, 1900-1914. History of Education Quarterly, (40)1, 22-48. After the planning for the new college began, the United States suffered the economic upheaval that was the Great Depression. Resulting influences then included Social ReconstructionRugg, H. O. (1932). Social reconstruction through education. Progressive Education, 9, 11-18. and Student Activism. There was a planned departure from traditional teacher- training institutions by placing special emphasis on child nature and development through experiences designed to give the student an insight into the problems of contemporary social life. Alexander sought to develop a critical consciousness in his students for intellectually based social leadership and provide guidance in effectually meeting the universally persistent problems of living, that is, the essential problems of living that students and in reality, all humans, would face in all stages of their development as individuals, as members of social groups, and as teachers of children and adults. Using innovative ideas such as extended foreign study, community-based active research, and authentic assessment, a portfolio-based undergraduate learning curriculum was developed which rejected traditional summative grades or the accumulation of credits as the basis of degree completion. The logistics and managerial challenges of starting an institution of higher learning from the ground up must have been daunting. It was here that Alexander proved himself to be an organizational genius. His handprint was on everything, from finding classrooms and dormitories to the formation of the curriculum and the selection of the initial faculty and first students. The worsening socio-economic atmosphere fueled the rise of communism and socialism in America's cities. In the world, New College students saw the rise of Hitler in Germany, Japanese aggression in Manchuria, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War. As a result, many New College students became politically active, encouraged by the philosophy of community-based active research. Some students, avowed communists and socialists, were given ‚Äúcredit‚Äù and in one case, a scholarship,Two win political awards. (1938, February 5). New York Times, p. 17. for organizing and participating in demonstrations, protests and pickets.Cohen, R. (1998). Student movements, 1930s. In M. J. Buhle, P. Buhle, & D. Georgakas (Eds.) Encyclopedia of the American Left. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. By 1938, Dean William F. Russell had to decide that the experimental institution was a financial failure.Cremin, L., Shannon, D. A., & Townsend, M. E. (1954). A history of Teachers College, Columbia University. New York, NY: Columbia University Press. Indeed, the figures in the budget were very clear. New College was in a continual state of deficit spending, but then again, so was every other college or university in the United States, Teachers College included. A college or university that ran in the black during the Depression was a rarity. Although notoriously apolitical, Alexander found himself governing the college through a highly politicized decade steeped in extreme idealism calling for social action. Alexander didn't consider himself a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù or an iconic figure of reform like Kilpatrick or Counts, but rather he was an educator who knew that the teacher, a competent and cultured one, makes the difference in any community or society. Because he never liked to play the political game the extreme left would accuse him of anti-Semitism and being a secret Nazi sympathizer, while the extreme right would hold up his college, the reflection of his educational philosophy, as an example of communist infiltration in higher education. New College closed in 1939. ==World War II (1939-1946)== The closing of New College hit Alexander hard. Although, still technically a member of the Teachers College faculty, he spent the war years teaching sporadically and helping other New College faculty in their endeavors to keep the college's unique philosophy alive. Had New College not existed, Alexander may very well have been regarded as an early pioneer of comparative education, along with Kandel,Null, J. W. (2007b). Peerless educator, the life and work of Isaac Leon Kandel. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. especially through his close friendship with Drs. Franz Hilker and Friedrich Schneider, who both were highly regarded in the burgeoning field of comparative education. The innovation of foreign study as a requirement lived on in Dr. Agnes Snyder, who soon left after the closing of New College, eventually becoming the chairman of the Department of Education at Adelphi College.Cattell, J., & Ross, E. E. (1948) Leaders in Education, third edition. Lancaster, PA: Science Press. In this position she called on Alexander to renew his vision of New College through Adelphi's New Teachers Education Program (ANTEP), which required foreign study as part of the program. Later, in a letter to alumni of New College, Thomas Alexander wrote that in 1945 \\"at a dinner in my home one night, William Russell said, 'Tom, the biggest mistake in my life was to close New College'. Dr. Alexander answered, 'It's a hell of a time to find that out'.‚ÄùTC Today. (2001). New College: Addressing the Persistent Problems of Living. Retrieved from: http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news/article.htm?id=2911. Richard Thomas Alexander purchased the land where the New College Community was near Canton, North Carolina, where he lived until his death on October 16, 1971. == Postwar Germany == When one of his New College students and protege, John W. Taylor,Taylor later became the President of the University of Louisville and Deputy Director General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)Jacques Cattell, & E. E. Ross, Leaders in Education, 3rd Edition. (Lancaster, PA: Science Press, 1948). was appointed to lead the E &RA; (Education & Religious Affairs) branch of OMGUS, the Office of Military Government, United States in the American Zone of post-war Germany, Alexander was in 1946 recruited to advise on rebuilding the German education system, drawing up recommendations which made Dewey's educational ideals central to the project.James F. Tent, \\"American Influences on the German Educational System\\", in The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945‚Äì1968, edited by Detlef Junker, vol. 1 (Cambridge: Publications of the German Historical Institute, 2004), pp. 394-400. Alexander and Taylor worked for the relatively minuscule E&RA; branch whose first mandate was simply to get the children off the streets. The attempts were not successful partly due to Alexander's non-political nature. Echoing his intransigence to non-educational aims, Alexander and Taylor did not try to reach out to political allies who might help them but rather chose their counterparts in Germany, secondary education scholars. The unwillingness of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church and other Christian entities to accept a one- track school system because of concerns about lowered standards soon discredited the American attempt to reform German education, which was effectively abandoned in 1948. For his efforts, nonetheless, Alexander was awarded a medal by the German Government. == Publications == *Alexander, R. T. (1919) The Prussian Elementary Schools.

It aided U.S. servicemen held as prisoners of war and those evading capture in enemy territory. The section, which was modeled after the British MI9, was disbanded at the war's end.

Secret equipment such as small compasses, maps, and radios were smuggled into German prisoner of war camps; to avoid compromising legitimate aid organizations like the Red Cross, MIS-X invented its own aid organizations and created aid packages from these, in which secret items were hidden. A radio code was devised to send messages via BBC broadcasts; this was based on Morse code: a one-syllable word was a dot, a two syllable word a dash. Such messages were preceded by a bell tone. A method of hiding a message in innocuous- looking outgoing letters to the United States was devised: all incoming letters were screened for such messages before delivery. These were signaled by having the date in numbers rather than letters. American officers who were privy to the secret and codes debriefed incoming prisoners and sent any useful information back to the United States. == See also == *MI9, the British equivalent of MIS-X == References == * Shoemaker, Lloyd R.

Summary: Fort Hunt is a World War Two prisoner of war camp in Alexandria, Virginia. It housed more than 3,000 Axis prisoners and several war related programs, MIRS, MIS-Y and MIS-X. The World War Two POW experience is a missing part of the story, and Fort Hunt can help illuminate an important part of the United States' war effort and responsibility. Fort Hunt was a secret location, and its activities included gathering and deciphering German written materials, interrogating Axis, mainly German, prisoners of war, as well as creating and distributing Escape and Evasion packages to air and ground forces in Europe. Today, Fort Hunt is a recreational park owned by the National Park service and the George Washington Memorial parkway. This camp remained secret until recently, when George Washington Memorial parkway employees began investigating its history. Since then, there has been an effort to preserve and present its most recent history to the public. This project began at the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, combing through the documents of Fort Hunt's past during World War Two, gathering information on its establishment and programs in hopes to bring attention to this important site. This project includes recommendations on how to present Fort Hunt's World War Two story to its visitors, with photographs of what the park looks like today. I would like to thank my thesis director, Dr. Michael Galgano, and both of my readers and committee members, Dr. Gabrielle Lanier and Dr. Steven Guerrier, for their assistance in this project.

He worked as an expert for the European Union to create a design centre in Gaziantep (Turkey) in 2003. In 2005, he worked as an expert for the CREPUQ (Conference of Rectors and Principals of Quebec Universities) to set up a master's programme in design for Laval University (Montreal, Canada). He was also a member of the jury for the Design Eleven contest, which was launched in 2010 by the (EESC) to prepare the \\"European Year of Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity.\\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=CES/11/93&type;=HTML He was President of Cumulus, the International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media from 2007 to 2013. This global association gathers 189 members from 46 countries. Created 20 years ago, Cumulus is now the largest international network dedicated solely to issues of design education, with students and nearly teachers. The objective of this association is to exchange best practices concerning design education, creation and innovation. Under the presidency of Guellerin, Cumulus has known significant growth, going from 80 to 178 members, particularly in countries outside Europe. During his mandate, Guellerin signed in 2008 in Japan the \\"Kyoto Design Declaration\\" which reflects the new responsibilities of designers towards the challenges of sustainable development. He was re-elected in 2010 for a second term, which ended in 2013, he is now Honorary President. Since July 2018, Guellerin is the Honorary President of the Chinese French designer's association. Since 1997, Guellerin has been the Executive Director of L'√âcole de design Nantes Atlantique, a private institution for higher education in design which was founded in 1988. Supported by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Nantes St-Nazaire, the school has campuses in Nantes (France), Shanghai (China) and Bangalore New Delhi (2014-2018). In 2018, the settlement of the students of L'√âcole de design in Pune (India) is linked to the partnership with the M.I.T. University. Since 2018, S√£o Paulo (Brazil) and Montreal (Quebec). The institution has developed significantly under his leadership, striving towards the professionalization of design studies and establishing relationships with businesses. A few of the most significant steps in this development of L'√âcole de design are: the opening of a Hypermedia section dedicated to digital products and services, in 2000, the granting of an official accreditation from the French Ministry of Higher Education in 2002 for its master's degree in Design, the opening of a spatial design section in 2005, the creation of an Apprentice Training Centre (CFA) specialized in ‚ÄúIndustrial Creation and Innovation‚Äù in 2006, the setting up of the school's China campus in 2008 initially in Qingdao (China), and now in Shanghai (China), the launching of a graphic design option and the reorganization of the master's programs into social and economical themes in 2009. An exchange program was created in Bangalore (India), in 2010, and the opening in 2011 of an experimental laboratory named READi Design Lab dedicated to interaction design. In 2019, the opening of the \\"Human Machine Design Lab\\", will accompany the technological progress since the first ‚Äúhypermedia‚Äù: technologies for speech recognition (and synthesis), images, Big Data mining and exploitation, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Realities. Guellerin has written numerous articles about design and education.http://blogs.lecolededesign.com/christianguellerin/ Guellerin is also the Honorary Consul of Estonia in France.Who‚Äôs Who France 2009 and 2010 In November 2016, Guellerin was appointed Knight of the National Order of Merit. ==Publications and lectures== International lectures and research * For a more sustainable world: How design will replace Marketing to move from consumption to responsible contribution.

The Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle operating the flight had taken off from Valencia Airport in Valencia, Spain, destined for Ibiza Airport on the Balearic island of Ibiza, also in Spain. All 98 passengers and 6 crew died in the crash. ==The crash== Flight 602 was a domestic service flight that took off from Valencia Airport bound for Ibiza. The aircraft was a Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle, under the command of a 37-year-old captain with 7,000 flying hours' experience. On board were 6 crew and 98 passengers, most of whom were Valencia natives returning to Ibiza for work after the holidays. At approximately 12:15 p.m., the aircraft's captain radioed Ibiza Airport, requesting permission to descend to 5,500 feet (1,676 meters). Ibiza Airport sources reported that he also said, \\"Get me a beer ready, we are here.\\" The aircraft was approaching Runway 07 when it descended below 2,000 feet (610 meters). Reportedly, neither the captain nor the co-pilot noticed the dangerous descent, as they were discussing a football match with the airport tower controller. Flight 602 struck Mount Atalayasa approximately 90 feet (30 meters) below its 1,515-foot (462-meter) summit. The aircraft exploded on impact. All 98 passengers and 6 crew on board were killed. At the time of the crash, visibility was approximately 5‚Äì10 miles and the weather was described as high overcast with broken clouds. ==Cause== It was ruled that the pilot had failed to maintain the minimum flight altitude for a visual approach to Runway 07. ==References *Iberia Airlines Flight 602 at AirDisaster.com Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Spain Category:Transport in Ibiza Category:1972 in Spain Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1972 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Sud Aviation Caravelle Category:Iberia (airline) accidents and incidents Category:January 1972 events in Europe ","title":"Iberia Airlines Flight 602"},{"id":"35261957","text":"G√©za Gr√ºnwald (October 18, 1910, Budapest ‚Äì September 7, 1943) was a Jewish- Hungarian mathematician who worked on analysis.

Besides the high functionality Elektra's machines distinguish themselves from the market through their design. Coffee grinders and accessories are also produced alongside to the core products lever and automatic machines. Unlike other manufacturers of espresso machines Elektra is still not producing super-automatic machines, but only machines with manual portafilter. Elektra machines are mainly used in the professional and less in private sector. == History and technology == sand-casted and chromed eagle on top of an Elektra-machine The company was founded in 1947 by Umberto Fregnan and is still owned by the Fregnan-family. The focus of the machinery of Elektra was from the beginning, the idea of easy operation and maintenance. Elektra was clear from the start a very innovative company, which issued to the large number of patents. Already in 1950 the first machine was presented with an automatic hydraulic unit. In addition to the water level control with float, which was developed by the company as a seal-less system, the automatic dispensing with electrically controlled valve (1968) and the electronic delivery of five doses (1978) was developed. The machines are craft built to this day with a great focus on usability and longevity. Thus only copper is used for the boiler and 80 percent of parts are produced by Elektra itself. All machines are tested before delivery for 48 hours. == Models == decorative plate on the back of a ‚ÄûMini Verticale‚Äú Elektra ‚ÄûBelle Epoque‚Äú espresso machines Elektra now produces two types of machines that are either aimed at professional users (Divisione Bar) or private customers (Divisione Casa). In the Divisione Bar, there are seven different series which are made of semi- automatic equipment. For the Divisione Casa series, the Nivola and Family Retro units can be ordered with semi-automatic equipment. There is also a model with a single-lever machine. The entire product range contains over 40 models. For each of the respective areas, mills and accessories are available. Characteristic of the Elektra models is a partially lavish outfit: the eagle, the symbol of the company, is present at the top of the cover of some models. These are made by sand casting and are mounted on a chrome plate. Studs made from Murano glass are also available as a completion. Finally, some models have eye-catching decorative panels with a coat of arms or with the company logo attached. == Perception in the media == The design and functionality, and also the high price, of Elektra machines has caused them to feature in some luxury goods and lifestyle publications. This is particularly true for the retro style machines built to the ‚ÄòBelle Epoque‚Äô and ‚ÄòFamily Retr√≤‚Äô series. Elektra machines have been used for decades in world famous cafes and bars. Espresso coffee, for example, in the famous Caff√® Florian in Venice and in the Harrods department store in London is prepared with machines from Elektra. On 14 September 2010 the bursting of a boiler of an Elektra machine injured six people in a British Sainsbury's in supermarket in Farnborough (Hampshire). After the accident all the machines at Sainsbury's - using Elektra exclusively - were shut down. According to a study of the supermarket chain the damage was caused by a change by the manufacturer in the safety valve in 2009, so Sainbury's reactivated their old Elektra machines. On 24 February 2012 in an official press release of Elektra they stated that the accident was caused by a faulty electrical connection of the supermarket and not by a fault of the machine. This was confirmed by an independent testing laboratory. == Service == Elektra provides no direct support to customers who purchase their machines in the United States. The only way to obtain support is by going through one of their distributors. Since there are only a handful of distributors, this has made it difficult for purchasers in the United States to obtain adequate servicing of their machines. This has lead to the machine not being as popular as it could be in the United States. == References See also == * Bialetti * Cimbali * De'Longhi * Faema * FrancisFrancis * Gaggia * La Marzocco * Rancilio * Saeco * List of Italian companies == External links == * Elektra website Category:Privately held companies of Italy Category:Home appliance manufacturers of Italy Category:Companies based in Veneto Category:Coffee appliance vendors Category:Espresso machines Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1947 Category:Italian brands Category:Italian companies established in 1947 Category:Coffee in Italy ","title":"Elektra (espresso machines)"},{"id":"35262008","text":"West Ham Corporation Tramways operated a tramway service in the County Borough of West Ham between 1901 and 1933. ==History== Situated in Greengate Street, West Ham, this tram depot opened in October 1906, then housed trolleybuses from June 1937 until April 1960.

Men and women have been observed having different criteria as what makes a good or ideal mate (gender differences). A potential mate's socioeconomic status has also been seen as having a noticeable effect, especially in developing areas where social status is more emphasized.Stone, Shackelford, & Buss (2008) Socioeconomic Development and Shifts in Mate Preferences. Evolutionary Psychology Vol. 6 ==Female mate preferences== In humans, when choosing a mate of the opposite sex, females place high preference for a mate that is physically attractive.Buss, D. M., & Barnes, M. (1986). Preferences in human mate selection.Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(3), 559. This ties in with the idea that women discriminate between men on hypothesized fitness cues. The more physically attractive a man is, the higher his fitness, and the better his genes will be. Women are attracted to more masculine traits (e.g. strong jawline, a more muscular body, a taller height). Indeed, men who are more masculine tend to have a higher number of sexual partners.Frederick, D. A., & Haselton, M. G. (2007). Why is muscularity sexy? Tests of the fitness indicator hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.  Male physical attractiveness   The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis  This hypothesis suggests that secondary sexual characteristics such as a low waist-to-chest ratio or masculine facial features (e.g. strong jawline, larger brow ridge, more muscular) are reliable indicators of mate quality as the hormones that cause their development (i.e. testosterone) suppress the immune system of an individual.Rantala, M. J., Vainikka, A., & Kortet, R. (2003). The role of juvenile hormone in immune function and pheromone production trade-offs: A test of the immunocompetence handicap principle. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 270, 2257-2261. With immunosuppression a male would be more susceptible to diseases or pathogens. However if a male is in good enough condition to weather these negative effects, it would be indicative to women, who selected these men as mates, that they have good genes.  Waist-to- chest ratio  Like men, who have a preference for a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a measure linked to female bodily attractiveness,Singh, D.( 1993). Adaptive significance of female physical attractiveness: role of waist- to-hip ratio. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 59, 1191‚Äì1201. women tend to be more attracted to men who have broader shoulders and relatively narrow waists (the waist-to-chest ratio; WCR).Horvath, T. (1981). Physical attractiveness: The influence of selected torso parameters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 10(1), 21-24. The ratio, changed by the distribution of android fat in the torso, makes the characteristic V-shape and is related to levels of testosterone in males,Braun, M. F., & Bryan, A. (2006). Female waist-to-hip and male waist-to-shoulder ratios as determinants of romantic partner desirability. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 23(5), 805-819. also correlated with higher perceived dominance of males.Dijkstra, P., & Buunk, B. P. (2001). Sex differences in the jealousy-evoking nature of a rival‚Äôs body build. Evolution and Human Behavior, 22(5), 335‚Äì341. Cross- culturally however the waist-to-chest ratio significance differs. A cross- cultural study across urban and rural settings in Britain and Malaysia found that BMI and waist-to-hip ratio also play roles in rating male physical attractiveness. In urban settings, participants would place a larger importance on WCR, minor importance on BMI and no significant importance on WHR. In rural settings BMI was however found to be the most important factor in deciding physical attractiveness.Swami, V., & Tov√©e, M. J. (2005). Male physical attractiveness in Britain and Malaysia: A cross-cultural study. Body Image, 2(4), 383-393. Fluctuating Asymmetry Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA) is the deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry in an organism. The more symmetrical an organism is, the better they are at handling developmental stress arising from environmental stress, genetic problems and developmental instability.Valen, Leigh Van (June 1962). \\"A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry\\". Evolution 16 (2): 125‚Äì142 Along with developmental stability, FA indicates the genetic fitness of an individual and will therefore affect sexual selection. Men with high facial symmetry are rated as more attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy than their counterparts.Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology, 108(3), 233. Low FA males report more sexual partners across a lifetime, an earlier age of first sexual intercourse, and have more offspring than high FA men.Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S. W. (1994). Human fluctuating asymmetry and sexual behavior. Psychological Science, 5(5), 297-302. Additionally, low FA men's partners report more orgasms than those whose partners have high FA.Thornhill, R., Gangestad, S. W., & Comer, R. (1995). Human female orgasm and mate fluctuating asymmetry. Animal Behaviour, 50(6), 1601-1615 With other results showing that women find low FA men's voice Hughes, Susan M.; Harrison, Marissa A.; Gallup, Gordon G. Jr. (May 2002). \\"The sound of symmetry: Voice as a marker of developmental instability\\" Evolution and Human Behavior 23: 173‚Äì180 and scent more attractive,Thornhill, Randy; Gangestad, Steven, W. (May 1999). \\"The scent of symmetry: A human sex pheromone that signals fitness?\\". Evolution and Human Behavior 20 (3): 175‚Äì201 it is clear that mating preference is affected by FA.  Resources  Males with the ability and willingness to provide resources are highly desirable to females. In our evolutionary past, this would have been demonstrated through the ability to provide food, shelter, and protection. In modern day humans, cues to high resource acquisition are presented in different ways. Cross-culturally, females show an increased preference for economic resources than do males, and those males who marry at a certain age tend to earn significantly more than males of the same age who do not marry.Buss, D. M. (1999). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.Trivers, R. (1985). Social evolution. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings. As females often choose mates young, the amount of resources that they actually possess may be small. Therefore, females seek traits indicative of potential resource acquisition ability such as a good education, ambition, and career potential. If a male becomes unemployed or lazy, the female is far more likely to discontinue the relationship with them.Betzig, L. (1989). Causes of conjugal dissolution: A cross-cultural study. Current Anthropology, 30, 654- 76. In fact, even clothing can act as a cue for sexual selection, with females being more willing to engage in relationships with men wearing high status clothing.Townsend, J. M., & Levy, G. D. (1990). Effects of potential partners' costume and physical attractiveness on sexuality and partner selection. The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 124, 371-389.  Age  Age is another trait which is sexually selected by females. Studies have consistently found that females tend to select mates that are roughly 4 years older than themselves, and this even applies cross-culturally.Buss, D. M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12, 1-49.Kenrick, D. T., & Keefe, R. C. (1992). Age preferences in mates reflect sex differences in human reproductive strategies. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 15, 75-91. Older men are much more likely to be financially secure and further along in their career, thus able to provide greater economic resources to the female and any future offspring. == Male mate preferences == It is a well-known fact that men assign as far greater salience to the attractiveness of a potential mate when considering their mating preference than women do.  Body shape and size  The first factor that has been shown to impact mating preference in males is that of Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), that is the relationship between waist circumference and hip circumference, as it has been suggested as a marker of age, reproductive status and health.Singh, D. (1993). Body shape and women's attractiveness: The critical role of waist-to-hip ratio. Human Nature, 4(3), 297-321. It was also found that women with a WHR of 0.7 were rated the most attractive, youthful, fertile and healthy, when compared to other WHR's. Furthermore, the current research also found that those women with a WHR of 0.7 and of normal weight were rated the most attractive, and whereas those with a WHR of 0.7 but whom were underweight were rated as more youthful but not as attractive. An extension of WHR research Singh, D., & Young, R. K. (1995). Body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, breasts, and hips: Role in judgments of female attractiveness and desirability for relationships. Ethology and Sociobiology, 16(6), 483-507. showed that there is an impact of breast and hip size upon attractiveness; Women with large breasts, and small hips were rated more attractive than women with small breasts and small hips, as well as finding that women with large hips were rated less attractive irrespective of breast size.  Skin condition  Skin conditionLucky, A. W. (1995). Hormonal correlates of acne and hirsutism. The American journal of medicine, 98(1), S89-S94. has been found to be an honest indicator of sex hormones which may indicate levels of fertility. The study directly examines the relationship between an individual having acne and the levels of hormones that could potentially indicate low fertility, therefore guiding attractiveness for mate preference. This skin condition, attractiveness link has been corroborated by research that Etcoff, N. (1999). Survival of the prettiest. The Science of Beauty. London: Little, Brown And Company. found that skin colour, skin homogeneity and facial adiposity (how fat is deposited around the face) all predict female attractiveness and therefore, mate preference. Skin tone has also been found to be an honest indicator of youthfulness and fertility;Fink, B., Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (2001). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness in relation to skin texture and color. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 115(1), 92. as well as research showing the first links between estradiol and female facial redness, in which as a woman reaches the peak of her ovulatory cycle her facial redness increases. This research would suggest that male mate preference would be guided by the individuals skin tone, looking for women with redder facial skin tones they indicate peak fertility and optimal opportunity for reproductive success.  Neoteny  Males show a preference for neotenous or youthful looking features in women, such as; big eyes,Jones, D., & Hill, K. (1993). Criteria of facial attractiveness in five populations. Human Nature, 4(3), 271-296. a small nose, and full lips.Jones, D., Brace, C. L., Jankowiak, W., Laland, K. N., Musselman, L. E., Langlois, J. H., ... & Symons, D. (1995). Sexual selection, physical attractiveness, and facial neoteny: cross-cultural evidence and implications [and comments and reply]. Current anthropology, 36(5), 723-748. These features act as a signal of fertility as they are caused by high estrogen and low testosterone. As a result of evolution these features are deemed as highly attractive as they would indicate a higher chance of successful reproduction. This male mate preference for neoteny has been shown in research Johnston, V.S., & Franklin, M. (1993). Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Ethology and Sociobiology 14: 183‚Äì199. in which men were asked to morph images of female faces until an ideal face was achieved.  Chastity  Chastity is deemed highly desirable across cultures however the extent of its importance shows some variation.Buss, D. M., & Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological review, 100(2), 204. The importance of chastity to males, in an evolutionary sense has been linked to paternal certainty; as before contraception, the only way to ensure a woman had not been inseminated by another man was if she were chaste.Buss, D. M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12 == Parental investment == The idea of parental investment is common both in humans and in the animal kingdom and derives from the fact that across most species there is an imbalance in the amount of time each parent invests in their offspring. Parental investment acts as a determinant of offspring survival, and accessing this investment is important for the sex that doesn‚Äôt provide as much PI. This theory states that the sex that invests the most time in raising its offspring is the limiting sex: it is more selective when choosing a mate. The other sex thus invests most of their time in competing for and courting mates.Trivers, R.L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971 (pp. 136‚Äì179). Chicago, IL: Aldine Sexual selection by the limiting sex is stronger the larger the disparity between PI between the sexes. Whilst parental investment is relatively equal in humans, females are the selective sex because males are able to impregnate a number of females, whilst one male may only impregnate a female and they must invest a lot of time initially into the pregnancy. However, the investment by males does mean that males are also selective, and thus females ornaments have evolved to address this. According to evolutionary psychology, PI explains why females tend to focus on traits indicating a superior resource acquisition ability, whilst males tend to focus on signals of fertility: females are selective of their mate; males are selective over when they invest. ==Gender differences== Mating preferences are not only confined to long-term relationships. Men and women have developed separate sexual strategies that are used for both short-term and long-term mate gain. Psychological adaptations such as mate guarding and sexual jealousy, and biological adaptations such as men‚Äôs testes size indicate that polygamy was present in evolutionary history,Kirkpatrick, L. A. (1999). Individual differences in attachment and reproductive strategies: Commentary on Buss and Greiling. Journal of Personality, 67, 243-256.Buss, D. M., & Shackelford, T. K. (1997). From vigilance to violence: Mate retention tactics in married couples. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 346-361. and is preferred in certain situations. Short term mating forms a larger part of the male sexual strategy, largely due to PI, with men more willing to engage in intercourse sooner and preferring a larger number of partners than women.Buss, D. M., & Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological Review, 100, 204-232. However, feminist anthropological research has shown that the higher parental investment by females cannot consistently explain a unidirectional gender difference of males being more willing to pursue sexual intercourse with multiple mates; the research of Sarah Hrdy has shown that female apes seek out sexual relations with many mates to accumulate more resources from those male mates who will invest resources given that the female ape's offspring may be any one of the male ape's offspring Hrdy, S. B. (1981) The woman that never evolved. Harvard University Press Thus, if there are opposing trends in gender differences of mating strategies across various species despite similar gender differences in parental investment across species, gender differences in mating preferences in humans (such as the tendency for male humans to be more willing to engage in intercourse sooner and with more partners) cannot be attributed solely to universal, inherent, dispositional differences between males and females on the basis of the evolutionary perspective; social factors, such as social structures effecting differential power and status between men and women, must also be taken into account. Eagly, A. H., & Wood, W. (1999). The origins of sex differences in human behavior: Evolved dispositions versus social roles. American psychologist, 54(6), 408. For instance, in more egalitarian cultures there is less of an age difference between men and women in relationships, indicating the role of social power and status differences in influencing gender differences in age preference (men preferring younger mates, and women preferring older mates).Eagly, A. H., & Wood, W. (1999). The origins of sex differences in human behavior: Evolved dispositions versus social roles. American psychologist, 54(6), 408. Mate preference changes depending on the strategy being used: when searching for a long-term mate, women often tend to emphasise resources, but in the short term, a potential mate's physical attractiveness is weighed more heavily because it is a good indicator of desirable genes.Li, Valentine, & Patel (2010) Mate preferences in the US and Singapore: A cross-cultural test of the mate preference priority model. Personality and Individual Differences.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 64 ==Predictors for long-term relationship success== In a study conducted by Shackleford, Schmitt, & Buss (2005),Shackelford, Schmitt, & Buss (2005) Universal dimensions of human mate preferences; Personality and Individual Differences 39 four dimensions were found that seem to predict how compatible two people are in what they're looking for in a long-term relationship. The survey was given to over 9,800 people from 37 different cultures across 6 continents and 5 islands. The four dimensions are: *Love vs. Status/Resources‚Äîtrade-off between a loving relationship and a partner with adequate resources and status *Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health‚Äîtrade- off between choosing an emotionally stable partner and one that is physically attractive *Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children‚Äîtrade-off between educational factors and a range of family matters like wanting of kids and chastityLong term relationship success has been found to have four important factors *Sociability vs. Similar Religion‚Äîtradeoff between a partner who is sociable and a partner that is religiously similar or compatible. The four dimensions found imply individuals considering a relationship weigh the importance of the two sides of each dimension for a long term relationship. For example, the higher a person scores on the Love vs. Status/Resources scale, the more that person is extroverted and the more emphasis they place on Love. A person scoring lower would be an introvert and place more emphasis on Status/Resources. Analogous reasoning applies to the other three dimensions, too, the first named concept being the higher valued end of the continuum and the second-named being the lower end. Negative scores indicate direction but not value of the concept. There were several gender differences observed in the study. For instance, men seemed to rate Love vs Status/Resources higher in importance in relation to women, meaning men place more of an emphasis on mutual love while women place more of an emphasis on Status/Resources. Women rated the other three dimensions higher in importance. A majority of cases saw women rate Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health higher, implying a stable personality is more desirable to women than a physically attractive mate. Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children was also rated higher, showing that similar educational background and political views are more important than home life, and a small number of cases had women rank Sociability vs. Similar Religion higher (a pleasing disposition is more important than sharing religious beliefs). In sum, men appear to value physical attractiveness, health, and a want for home life and children in their long-term mates, whereas women appear to value maturity, dependability, education, social status, and financial stability. ==Mate preference priorities== Research has attempted to assess which mate preferences men and women prioritize when selecting mates. Such studies typically involve an element of forced choice, such as asking participants to \\"design\\" their ideal partner using a fixed budget. When budgets are small, participants tend to prioritise those characteristics historically necessary for successful reproduction and relationship functioning - including physical attractiveness, social status, and kindness.Li, N. P., Bailey, J. M., Kenrick, D. T., & Linsenmeier, J. A. W. (2002). The necessities and luxuries of mate preferences: Testing the tradeoffs. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, 947-955. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.947. One cross-cultural study found similar prioritisation patterns in both Eastern (e.g., Malaysia, Singapore) and Western (e.g., the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway) cultures. ==References== Category:Interpersonal relationships ","title":"Mating preferences"},{"id":"35262029","text":"Oslo [OSL] was the first international airport to offer SAF as part of the fuel mix since 2016, followed by Los Angeles [LAX] and Stockholm [ARN]. European project ITAKA - led by the Spanish public body SENASA - Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the name given to advanced aviation biofuel types used in jet aircraft and certified as being sustainable by a reputable independent third-party, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). This certification is in addition to the safety and performance certification, issued by global standards body ASTM International, that all jet fuel is required to meet in order to be approved for use in regular passenger flights. ==Certification== In 2019, United Airlines renewed its contract with Boston- based World Energy, agreeing to purchase up to 10 million gallons of SAF on a commercial scale and at a competitive cost over the next two years. A SAF sustainability certification verifies that the fuel product, mainly focussing on the biomass feedstock, has met criteria focussed around long-term global environmental, social and economic \\"triple-bottom-line\\" sustainability considerations. Under many carbon emission regulation schemes, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, a certified SAF product may be granted an exemption from an associated carbon compliance liability cost. This marginally improves the economic competitiveness of environmentally favourable SAF over traditional fossil-based jet fuel. However, in the near term there are several commercialisation and regulatory hurdles that are yet to be overcome through the collaboration of a variety of stakeholders for SAF products to meet price parity with traditional jet fuel and to enable widespread uptake. The first reputable body to launch a sustainable biofuel certification system applicable to SAF was the academic European-based Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) NGO. This multi-stakeholder organization set a global benchmark standard on which the sustainability integrity of advanced aviation biofuel types seeking to use the claim of being a Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be judged. Leading airlines in the aviation industry and other signatories to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG) pledge support the RSB as the preferred provider of SAF certification. These airlines believe it important for any proposed aviation biofuels have independently certified sustainable biofuel long term environmental benefits compared to the status quo in order to ensure their successful uptake and marketability {  !Scheme !Sustainability Criteria - EU RED II Recast (2018)  GHG reduction - Greenhouse gas emissions from aviation sustainable fuels must be lower than those from the fossil fuels they replace: at least 50% for production facilities prior to 5 October 2015, a mandatory reduction of 60% for production facilities after that date and 65% for sustainable fuels (SAF) produced in facilities starting operations after 2021. Land use change - Carbon stocks and biodiversity: raw materials for sustainable fuel production cannot be sourced from land with high biodiversity or high carbon stocks (i.e. primary and protected forests, biodiversity-rich grasslands, wetlands and peatlands). Other sustainability issues are set out in the Governance Regulation and may be covered by certification schemes on a voluntary basis. - ICAO ‚ÄòCORSIA‚Äô  GHG Reduction - Criterion 1: Sustainable alternative fuel for reactors will generate net GHG reductions of at least 10% compared to fossil fuel for reactors, based on the life cycle. Carbon Stock - Criterion 1: Sustainable alternative Fuel will not be produced from biomass obtained from land whose uses changed after 1st January 2008 and which has been from primeval forests, wetlands or peatlands, as all these lands have high carbon stocks. Criterion 2: In the case of a change in land use after 1st January 2008, as defined on the basis of the IPCC land categories, emissions from direct land use change (DLUC) shall be calculated. If the greenhouse gas emissions from a DLUC exceed the default value of the land use change induced (ILUC), the value of the DLUC will replace the default value of the ILUC. } ==Global impact== As emissions trading schemes and other carbon compliance regimes are emerging globally, certain biofuels are likely to be exempted (\\"zero rated\\") by governments from having an associated carbon compliance liability due to their closed-emissions-loop renewable nature, if they can also prove their wider sustainability credentials. For example, in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme it has been proposed by SAFUG that only aviation biofuels that have been certified as sustainable by the RSB or similar bodies would be zero rated. This proposal has been accepted. SAFUG was formed by a group of interested airlines in 2008 under the auspices of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and in cooperation with support from NGOs such as Natural Resources Defense Council. Member airlines represent more than 15% of the industry, and all member CEOs have signed a pledge to work on the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. In addition to SAF certification, the integrity of aviation biofuel producers and their product can be assessed by further means, such as by using Richard Branson's Carbon War Room , or the Renewable Jet Fuels initiative. The latter currently cooperates with companies such as LanzaTech, SG Biofuels, AltAir, Solazyme, and Sapphire.

In relation to increased fuel efficiency, they committed to an operational and efficiency improvement of 2 per cent per annum; and to maintaining the industry's net carbon emissions from 2020 onwards - carbon neutral air traffic growth - and to a reduction in the carbon footprint of the industry by 2 per cent per annum. In order to achieve the global objectives of international aviation, a basket of measures has been planned in which actions have been identified for implementation, namely the development of innovative technologies by aeronautical manufacturers to reduce aircraft consumption, invest in the development of alternative sustainable fuels, improve air traffic management and the use of economic measures, with the creation of a global emissions market, called CORSIA. All these measures, in addition to contributing to carbon-neutral growth, promote social and economic development associated with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). ==See also== *Aviation biofuel *Aviation taxation and subsidies *Biofuel *Electric aircraft *Environmental impact of aviation *Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact *Sustainability *Climate change ==References *Producer of SAF *SAF Whitepaper *Roundtable on sustainable biofuels *Principles & Criteria, Roundtable on sustainable biofuels *Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Qantas Airways Limited *Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group - Pledge and Signatories *Sustainable Sky Institute *International Journal of Sustainable Aviation Regional SAF Roadmap initiatives: :Australasia :Europe :Northwest Americas Category:Alternative fuels Category:Aviation and the environment Category:Renewable fuels ","title":"Sustainable aviation fuel"},{"id":"35262040","text":"The Sadhujana Paripalana Sangham (Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham) (SJPS) was established in 1907 by social reformer Ayyankali to campaign for education for Dalits in Kerala with the support of government of Travancore, British India.,Ayyankali, Chapter 3:Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham first starting Sadananda villasam Venganoor, next SJPS ==References== Category:Dalit history Category:Kingdom of Travancore Category:Organisations based in Kerala Category:1907 establishments in India Category:Educational institutions established in 1907 ","title":"Sadhujana Paripalana Sangham"},{"id":"35262047","text":"Portrait of Paul van Vianen (portrayed as being painted by Hans von Aachen), engraving after an original painting by Hans von Aachen and adorned with an ornamental frame in auricular style Paul van Vianen or Paulus Willemsz van Vianen (1570-1614) was a silversmith, medallist and sculptor of the Northern Netherlands, trained in Northern Mannerism but then important in developing the Baroque auricular style with his brother Adam van Vianen. ==Biography== Portrait of Paulus van Vianen holding one of his creations, by Cornelis Ketel Vianen was born in Utrecht.

His language in pingshu performances was relatively plain, and he specialized in presenting the images, colors and emotions with sound impressions. Since the mid-1990s, his storytelling video shows have been broadcast on TV stations like CCTV. == Pingshu career==  Early years In the 1950s, Shan's father was wrongly put into prison, thus his mother divorced his father. In 1953, he was accepted into Northeast Institute of Technology. Subsequently however due to his physical condition and family problems, he gave up his studies and turned to perform pingshu, as an apprentice of Li Qinghai (Chinese ÊùéÂ∫ÜÊµ∑).

This is due to her body possessing an extraordinary amount of Fortune energy, which draws from its surroundings, causing the world to fall out of balance. To rectify this, a God of Misfortune named Momiji is sent to the human world to target Ichiko and steal her Fortune energy in order to rebalance the world. == Characters == Main characters ; : : A 16-year-old high school girl who has a high amount of Fortune energy that gives her extreme beauty, high intelligence, wealth and health. Her Fortune levels are so high that she unconsciously absorbs luck from others, causing them to be less fortunate. She is adored by the boys in high school whilst being loathed by the girls, and her sweet looks hide a fierce personality. Due to a past trauma, she has a fear of getting close to others as she doesn't want to be betrayed, often leaving her lonely. Using a magical item given to her by Bobby known as the Somin Sh≈çrai, Ichiko can manifest her Fortune energy into stuffed animal-like versions of the Chinese zodiac. When extracted from her body, Ichiko's Fortune energy can be given to others who are in danger in order to help them. ; : : A God of Misfortune who is a woman clad in plaid undershirt, red overalls and a missing right shoe. She is sent from another world to restore the energy balance on Earth by stealing the Fortune energy from Ichiko, although her Misfortune energy often loses out to Ichiko's Fortune energy. Her right arm is so concentrated with misfortune that she wraps it up in a cast, using it as a support for various gadgets such as syringes. She is also capable of transforming into a spirit form in order to pass through barriers. She is constantly clashing with Ichiko as she tries to steal her Fortune energy, becoming particularly irritated when her flat chest is made fun of. Nonetheless, she often finds herself taking pity on Ichiko, often encouraging her to try to use her Fortune energy to help others. Whenever she takes a bath in the human world, she loses her Misfortune energy and changes to a brighter personality, but will return to normal if made dirty again. She has a habit of nose-picking, which is a tribute to the anime series FLCL, whose eccentric character, Haruko Haruhara, she in some ways resembles.

He works many part-time jobs in order to provide for his four siblings, which is also the cause of him sleeping through class; he serves as his siblings' guardian in the absence of his parents. Generally seen as the most serious of the cast, he will however take a keen interest in opportunities to make some money to provide for his family. It is later revealed that he actually was extremely popular with girls but due to the feelings and possessiveness Nadeshiko had toward him, Keita has never heard anything from other girls, as she uses various ways to prevent other girls from approaching Keita. After spending time with his family while she was in the form of a child, Ichiko gradually gains a romantic interest in him throughout the series. He similarly develops feelings for her after they become friends. By the end of the manga Ichiko and Keita are dating. ; : : A masculine girl who transfers into Ichiko's class, usually dressing like a male delinquent, having been raised like a boy by her father in order to succeed his karate dojo. Despite being tough on the outside, she often yearns to be in more in touch with her girlish side and has a crush on Keita. After Ichiko saves her life with happiness energy, Ranmaru becomes her first true friend, and the second person she has truly cared for since Suwano. She seemingly develops feelings for Momo'o Inugami, but after his departure at the end of the series, she agrees to date any boy who can defeat her in a fight. ; : : Introduced late in the manga series, Nadeshiko is a short child-like ninja who prides herself as a girl of superior upbringing. She is skilled in her ninjitsu art form in that she was able to lay traps and hiding places around Ichiko's house much to her and Momiji's chagrin. She is in love with Keita, having been saved by him once when they were kids and has been stalking him since, which is why she self-taught herself ninja skills and she is also the reason why other girls cannot get close to Keita. In the anime, she shows up at the end of each episode to point out her cameo appearances. ; :Nadeshiko's perverted butler, or specifically, perverted lolicon. He will never allow his master's breasts to grow more than the way they are. ; : :Ichiko's former butler who had served as her guardian for a long time and was the first person she truly cared about. After he nearly dies as a result of all the fortune she had unconsciously taken from him over the years by Ichiko, Ichiko fires him from his position so he can live out his life in safety.

Throughout the story, Suwano continues to keeps in contact with Ichiko through a series of letters, which she treasures and keeps in a box. ; : :One of Ichiko's classmates. She loathes Ichiko just like the other girls (except Ranmaru). She is always seen with her two friends. It is hinted that she cares about her appearance. She has long dark brown hair with her bangs styled into one side with two small hairpins. She develops a crush on Ranmaru Rindou, although any attempts to get closer to her result in comedic misinterpretations. ; :One of Ichiko's classmates. She also loathes Ichiko. She is easily recognized because of her big and fat appearance, making her the only one of the few students who is unattractive. She has dark skin with yellow hair tied into two pigtails with pink flower bands on each pigtail. She also wears make-up which only consists of lipstick and blush-on. She is always seen carrying or eating food (most notably onigiri). Gods ; :Momiji's loyal sidekick who is a demonic stuffed bear. As he cannot talk, he often communicates by writing messages in a book. His body holds many of Momiji's Misfortune items, which she just casually rips out of him. His human form gives him the appearance of a man with a goatee and long black hair tied back into a ponytail. While he gains the ability to talk in this state, Kumagai retains the trademark line of stitches running down the right side of his face that were present in his teddy bear form. ; : : Momiji's boss in the Misfortune God Realm, can be seen from her giant size. Implied to be a secret fan of glam rock. Her sidekick is Saffron, a panda-like stuff. Like Yamabuki, its size is bigger than Teddy. ; : : A masochistic dog god that is usually summoned by Momiji. He is capable of transforming into a chihuahua with a keen sense of smell, though he will be forced back into human form if he experiences too much pleasure, masochistic or otherwise. He later trains alongside Ranmaru in order to become stronger, causing the two to develop strong bond of friendship based on their shared desire to protect Ichiko and Momiji from harm. ; : :A small kitten who Momiji arranges to have taken in by Ichiko to teach her what it is like to lose someone important to her. When Tama is put in danger due to Momiji's plan going too far, Ibuki injects Tama with some fortune energy but ends up using too much and transforming her into a Maneki-neko God. ; : : Also a God of Misfortune and a colleague of Momiji, the two grew up together and were once childhood friends. She came to the Human World to do Momiji's duty so that she can have Yamabuki's affection. Despite her desire to take the credit for the mission, Kuroyuri is a loyal friend at heart. Her sidekick is Gouda, a frog similar in form and purpose to Kumagai. ; : :A toilet god whose head is shaped like a large poop. He gave Ichiko a necklace that prevents her from absorbing the fortune of other people. == Media == Manga The original manga by Yoshiaki Sukeno began serialization in Shueisha's Jump Square magazine from the July 2008 issue on June 4, 2008, and ended with the August 2013 issue on July 4, 2013.

Brazil Child Health. It recognizes that illnesses are not simply matters of biology but are rooted in socioeconomic factors that aggravate and perpetuate the disease. To go beyond medical treatment and to secure patient health for the long term, Associa√ß√£o Sa√∫de Crian√ßa espouses a biopsychosocial model of healthcare that provides comprehensive post-hospitalization care and aims to bring the family out of poverty. It has an office based in New York City under the name Brazil Child Health that is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and coordinates international fundraising for the organization.Brazil Child Health ==History== Associa√ß√£o Sa√∫de Crian√ßa was founded in 1991 by Vera Cordeiro. Sa√∫de Crian√ßa E-book While a physician in the pediatric department at Hospital da Lagoa in Rio de Janeiro, she saw many of her patients fall into a cycle of hospitalization, treatment, discharge, reinfection, and rehospitalization. She realized that treatments given at the hospital were ineffective if her patients simply returned to the environments that made them sick in the first place.Bornstein, David. How To Change The World: Social Entrepreneurs and The Power of New Ideas. Oxford University Press, NY: 2004, In response, she began Associa√ß√£o Sa√∫de Crian√ßa out of her own home with a handful of volunteers in order to provide for families the items required to keep them healthy outside of the hospital, such as food, clothing, and financial support. Sa√∫de Crian√ßa has since expanded, with a wide network that ranges across six states in Brazil. Its efforts have been celebrated both in Brazil and by the international community. ==Family backgrounds== Sa√∫de Crian√ßa works with families from some of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro and all over Brazil. The typical family assisted by the program comes from a favela and lives in poverty with little access to government resources. In this context, acute and chronic medical conditions have severe and long- lasting consequences on not only the family's health but its overall welfare as well. Frequently, the decision to purchase medicine or continue treatment for a sick child means being unable to buy food for the rest of the family. Even if the expensive treatments are purchased, they are rendered ineffective when the child returns to the dirty alleyways and cramped housing characteristic of most houses in a favela. Thus, families become poorer, both financially and in spirit, while their health conditions stagnate or even worsen. ==Methodology== Sa√∫de Crian√ßa's methodology revolves around the Family Action Plan, a 2-year blueprint that outlines all of the major goals a family should aim to achieve in the realms of housing, income generation, education, citizenship, and health. It is created shortly after the family has been identified by and referred to Sa√∫de Crian√ßa from a partnering hospital. Sa√∫de Crian√ßa volunteers interview the family to gain a better sense of its background and together they establish the objectives of the plan. Though each plan is tailored to the individual needs of the families, Sa√∫de Crian√ßa maintains a minimum set of standards that any family must achieve in order to be considered healthy and to graduate from the program. The goals and strategies differ according to the area of health they address. * Health: Sa√∫de Crian√ßa works with the family and provides specialized food, medicine, and technical support to ensure that the child's chronic or acute illness is well-managed. The main goal is that every child in the family is at least in satisfactory condition, as defined by the hospital. * Housing: Houses that are in poor condition and not located in hazardous areas undergo repairs using materials and labor provided by Sa√∫de Crian√ßa. The goal is to ensure that the homes have basic amenities, such as access to water, sewage, painted walls, and a roof without leakages, in order to provide an environment conducive to the child's health. * Income Generation: Family members (particularly mothers) are enrolled in professional training courses, according to their personal abilities and interests. The main purpose is to teach marketable skills to families in order to ensure stable and higher incomes upon graduation. Sa√∫de Crian√ßa offers workshops internally for professional qualification as well as access to courses provided by external organizations. Moreover, Sa√∫de Crian√ßa donates tools and other resources to support enterprise development. * Citizenship: Sa√∫de Crian√ßa facilitates families in obtaining official registration documentation so that they may access government social service programs. Families also receive legal advice in matters such as land tenure, divorces, and different types of legal disputes. * Education: Parents attend educational and preventive lectures on issues such as nutrition, hygiene, violence and domestic accidents, infant development, adolescence, family planning, sexually transmitted disease, AIDS, and basic care. In addition, all children in the family between the ages of 5 and 17 must be enrolled in school. ==Impact== An Evaluation of Long Term Impact, conducted by Georgetown University in 2013, analyzed the assisted families three to five years after the Family Action Plan conclusion date. The study revealed a 92% increase in family income and over 90% increase in home ownership. There were an increase in the percentage of families identifying their wellbeing as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúvery good,‚Äù from 9.6% before ASC to 51.2% after graduating ASC. At the same time, there was a 73% decrease in the percentage of families identifying their wellbeing as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúvery bad,‚Äù from 56.0% before ASC to 15.2% after graduating ASC. The study also found an 86% decrease in the average number of days children spent in the hospital, with a significant drop in costs for the public health system. ==Expansion== The successful experience of the Family Action Plan with families referred from Hospital da Lagoa, Maternity Hospital Maria Am√©lia Buarque de Holanda and the National Institute of Cardiology - partner institutions of the Sa√∫de Crian√ßa - has attracted interest from other organizations and institutions in Brazil and abroad. To disseminate 26 years of experience with the Family Action Plan, Sa√∫de Crian√ßa carries out permanent evaluations, records information and data, and maintains a strict control of the process and development of each family served. The methodology has already been reproduced in 24 organizations that work with hospitals and other public units in several Brazilian states, and adapted to a human development program by the city of Belo Horizonte. The methodology can also be adapted to other institutional and cultural contexts where poverty is the challenge. It offers training, internships and exchanges for people interested in implementing the Family Action Plan, and for students and professionals from universities in Brazil and abroad. ASC invests in research and development of better ways of applying the methodology, offers consulting services, holds meetings and seminars with social entrepreneurs, companies, foundations and governments. In this way, it seeks to broaden and exchange ideas and proposals for innovation in health and social transformation. Currently, work is under way to transfer the program to organizations in the United States and Portugal. In addition, The Plan has served as an inspiration for the implementation of programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. Social franchise Sa√∫de Crian√ßa has inspired the formation of 23 other organizations that have adopted its methodology, such as Refazer, Repartir, and Reacender. To consolidate its brand, in 2010, it transformed itself into a social franchise and now counts 11 branches in six states in Brazil. Public policy The municipality of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais has officially incorporated Sa√∫de Crian√ßa's methodology into its public health program, \\"Fam√≠lia Cidad√£: Cidade Solidaria.\\" Sa√∫de Crian√ßa is currently working with the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro, R.J. and Florianopolis, S.C., on similar pilot programs. ==References External links == * Sa√∫de Crian√ßa * Brazil Child Health Category:Medical and health organisations based in Brazil Category:Children's charities based in Brazil Category:Social work organisations in Brazil ","title":"Brazil Child Health"},{"id":"35262218","text":"Jessica Adams, M.D., is a fictional character on the Fox medical drama House and is portrayed by Odette Annable.New York Post The character worked at the prison where House was incarcerated after he crashed his car into Cuddy's living room. She met House in the eighth season premiere episode \\"Twenty Vicodin\\" and joined his diagnostic team in the third episode. ==Character background== In \\"Twenty Vicodin\\", it is revealed that Adams is from \\"old money\\" (a wealthy family) and did her residency at Johns Hopkins Medical School. It is clear by \\"Charity Case\\" that she has no money concerns whatsoever as she buys expensive shoes and gives gifts even when she's out of work. In \\"Perils of Paranoia\\", Chase suspects that Adams enjoys shooting firearms; this is confirmed in \\"Runaways\\", when she wins a bet with House by shooting a clay pigeon with a single shotgun shell. As a junior in high school, she ran away from home because she was the only person she knew whose parents weren't divorced or having an affair and she figured that the lives of dysfunctional families were somehow \\"deeper\\". She lived with an older man in Manhattan for two months before returning home. Adams married very young and has recently divorced her husband after finding him cheating on her with a girl he met on the way back from their honeymoon, as she later admits to a patient Henry in \\"We Need the Eggs\\". In \\"Risky Business\\" she took out her rage with a baseball bat on a plastic skeleton, as well as other equipment, while House watched, assuring her that \\"it's been paid for.\\" House had on several occasions shared with his team the logical (according to him) idea of Chase hitting on Adams.

It is found in Central Africa and from India through Southeast Asia to New Guinea,Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families with the great majority or species found in Asia.Duistermaat, H. (2012). A taxonomic revision of Amischotolype (Commelinaceae) in Asia. Gardens' Bulletin Singapore 64: 51-131. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words Œ±ŒºŒπœÉœáŒøœÇ, meaning 'unstalked', and œÑŒøŒªœÖœÄŒ∑, meaning 'tangle'. The genus is characterised by its rather compact inflorescences which are composed on two or more cincinni that pierce through the base of the leaf sheath, and also by its seeds that are embedded in red arils. Flowers are actinomorphic, and anthers release their pollen either through a pore at the tip or slits down the sides. They are typically encountered in forest understories. The closely related genus Porandra, which consists of three Asian species, is considered by Robert Faden, a leading authority on the family, to be \\"doubtfully distinct\\" from Amischotolype. Analysis of DNA sequences has shown that Amischotolype is most closely related to the genus Coleotrype, while these two are in turn most closely related to the genus Cyanotis plus its very close relative Belosynapsis. These four genera form a clade that is found only in the Old World, while all of its immediate ancestors are present only in the New World. ; Species * Amischotolype barbarossa Duist. \\\\- Myanmar, Thailand, Sumatra * Amischotolype divaricata Duist. \\\\- Indochina, Sumatra * Amischotolype dolichandra Duist. - Assam * Amischotolype glabrata Hassk. \\\\- Himalayas, southern China, Tibet, Indochina, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, western Indonesia * Amischotolype gracilis (Ridl.)

As a player, Gerards played for Limburgian clubs SV Limburgia and Fortuna '54. As a manager, he spent the majority of his career in Greece, where he acquired citizenship and was a successful head coach for Cretan club OFI Crete for 15 years. ==Playing career== G√®ne Gerards began his career at Limburgia as a defender-turned-striker in 1957. In 1963 he moved to Fortuna '54, before returning to Limburgia in 1967. He followed the club to amateur competitions in 1971 and retired in 1974. Gerards was a member of the Dutch national military team, as well as the Netherlands national under-21 football team. Despite being called-up for the Netherlands national football team by coach Denis Neville in 1964, Gerards made no senior national club appearances. ==Manager career== Roda JC Still in his playing years, Gerards attended the German Sport University Cologne, earning various German managerial certificates.Eleftherotypia newspaper, In 1974, he received his \\"Fu√üballehrer\\", highest professional football manager certificate in Germany, while working as municipality ambassador for Brunssum. Immediately after retirement as a player in May 1974, Gerards signed a contract as assistant manager for Dutch football club Roda JC, where he was also appointed head coach of the club's youth team. He held his position for the Kerkrade-based club for 12 years, serving under head coaches Bert Jacobs (1974‚Äì1980), Piet de Visser (1980‚Äì1983), Hans Eijkenbroek (1983‚Äì1984) and Frans K√∂rver (1984‚Äì1986). During the last managerial change, Gerards replaced Eikenbroek as interim coach for a single game in December 1984, before returning to his post under arriving manager Frans K√∂rver for the remainder of the 1984‚àí85 season. OFI Crete At the start of the 1985‚àí86 season, Gerards assumed his first job as head coach for an ambitious Greek Alpha Ethniki side OFI Crete, based in Heraklion, Crete. The club had recently been acquired by the rich and prestigious Vardinogiannis family, who also were the major shareholders of Athens-based regular Greek champions Panathinaikos. At OFI Crete, Gerards set an outstanding record for both the club as well as Greek football in general, as he remained the team's head coach for 15 consecutive years, which to this day remains the longest managerial tenure in Greek football history. This feat was also paired with a string of successful domestic and European campaigns for the Cretan club, which constitute OFI Crete's \\"golden years\\". In 1986, OFI Crete finished in 2nd place in the Alpha Ethniki, trailing five points behind Panathinaikos, which still marks the best finish the club has ever made in the competition. In his first season with the club, Gerards had turned OFI Crete into a serious competitor for traditional Greek football \\"giants\\" Panathinaikos, AEK, Olympiacos and PAOK. In 1987, Gerards led the club to its first, and to this day only major honour, winning the Greek Football Cup in a penalty shoot-out vs. Iraklis Thessaloniki during the competition Final. He came close to repeat this feat in 1990, but OFI Crete were defeated in the Final by eventual Cup winners Olympiacos. During his 15 years with the club, Gerards qualified OFI six times for European competitions, winning one Balkans Cup in 1989, and advancing OFI through to the UEFA Cup Round of 16 during the 1993‚àí94 edition of the competition, most notably eliminating Spanish club Atl√©tico Madrid in the process. During Gerards' tenure as head coach at OFI, several of the club's players were transferred out to prestigious European clubs. Among others, Gerards nurtured the talents of Nikos Machlas, Kostas Konstantinidis, Alexis Alexoudis, DƒÉnu»õ Lupu, Yannis Anastasiou, Mahamadou Diarra, Kostas Kiassos and Ioannis Samaras. The 1999‚àí2000 season was his last as head coach at OFI. He was honored by the club for his longtime services, and was subsequently offered the position of chief scout and football advisor. However, in November 2000 he was surprisingly fired from his position, as the club's board of directors decided his presence was causing trouble for the club's new coach. Later career In January 2001, Gerards accepted the position of technical director at AEK Athens until the end of the season. He then revived his coaching career at Cypriot First Division side APOEL Nicosia, winning the Cypriot Championship in his first season with the club. He stayed at APOEL until 2002, and moved back to Greece as the new appointed manager of Alpha Ethniki side Iraklis Thessaloniki. After two seasons, Gerards decided in 2004 to retire as football manager and re-assumed his role as technical director and scout at AEK Athens, a position he held until 2009. He regularly organized football camps in Greece to discover new talents and has been linked to several key players to have emerged during his tenure as scout. On 23 February 2010, Gerards revived his managerial career once more, taking over Panachaiki in the Gamma Ethniki, but left the club shortly after two months. ==Personal life== Eug√®ne was the son of Johanna Gerards-Dedroeg and Joep Gerards (1906‚Äì1986), a former Dutch footballer who played for various top- level Limburgian clubs during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as the president of SV Limburgia during 1946‚Äì1973. His brother Jo Gerards (1936‚Äì2014) was an amateur football manager, scout for Limburgia and sports journalist for the local newspaper. He has a younger sister Antoinette, who is a real football fan. Alongside his managerial certificates, Gerards had a certificate for retail, as well as a pilot's certificate. Gerards has a daughter from his first marriage and a son from his second marriage in the Netherlands. He married his third wife Katerina in 2004, and became a permanent resident of Crete. Characteristic of his love for Crete, he acquired Greek citizenship, and began his own winery \\"Geraldakis\\", a name he himself created and often used in public appearances by appending the common Cretan patronymic suffix -akis to his own Dutch surname. Recognition Gerards is recognized by many as one of the greatest managers in Greek football. He has been honored by the club where he made his name as a manager, OFI Crete on several occasions. A friendly game was held in his honor in 2000 at the club's home ground Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium, in which he later was offered a permanent, leather seat with his name engraved on it. In 2017 the club's board of directors decided to name the stadium's Gate 9 after him. On 20 November 2017, a special international friendly game was held to celebrate his service to the club in which Gerards' \\"children\\" (former Greek and foreign OFI Crete players during the years 1985‚Äì2000) played against some of the most recognized players in recent Greek football history (Gerards' \\"friends\\"). Health issues and death Gerards first cited being plagued by health issues as the foremost reason for him retiring as manager in 2000 after 15 years of service at OFI Crete. In 2005, he was diagnosed with Progressive supranuclear palsy. His health had since deteriorated over the years, and by his mid-70s he was confined in a wheelchair. He died on 2 January 2018 aged 77. He is survived by his daughter Nathalie (1968) from his first marriage and son from his second marriage Frank (1981), his third wife Katerina and her two sons Manolis and Minas. ==Managerial statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Team !rowspan=\\"2\\" From !rowspan=\\"2\\" To !colspan=\\"5\\" Record - ! ! ! ! ! -  Roda JC  26 November 1984  2 December 1984 -  OFI F.C.  1 July 1985  30 June 2000 -  APOEL  1 July 2002  7 November 2002 -  Iraklis  28 December 2002  9 November 2003 - !colspan=3Total } ==Honours== Managerial OFI Crete * Greek Football Cup (1): 1986‚Äì87 APOEL * Cypriot First Division (1): 2001‚Äì02 Records * OFI Crete all-time longest serving manager: 1985‚Äì2000. * Hellenic Football Federation all-time longest serving manager in a single club: 1985‚Äì2000 (OFI Crete). ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2018 deaths Category:APOEL FC managers Category:Dutch football managers Category:Dutch footballers Category:Fortuna Sittard players Category:Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. managers Category:OFI Crete F.C. managers Category:People from Brunssum Category:Roda JC Kerkrade managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Cyprus Category:Expatriate football managers in Greece Category:Super League Greece managers Category:Greek people of Dutch descent Category:Dutch expatriate football managers Category:Association football forwards Category:SV Limburgia players ","title":"Eug√®ne Gerards"},{"id":"35262402","text":"Walthamstow Urban District Council Light Railways operated a tramway service in Walthamstow between 1905 and 1933.The Golden Age of Tramways.

Planet of the Damned is a 1962 science fiction novel by American writer Harry Harrison. It was serialised in 1961 under the title Sense of Obligation and published under that name in 1967. It was nominated for the Hugo Award. ==Plot== Planet of the Damned follows Brion Brandd, a character who lives on the planet Anvhar, which, due to an elliptical orbit, experiences a year with a long cold winter and a short hot summer, to which the population have become adapted. To avoid social problems during the winter period, Anvhar has initiated a planet-wide series of mental and physical games called the Twenties. The novel starts with Brandd winning the Twenties. As he recovers from the games, Brandd meets Ihjel, a previous winner of the Twenties, who asks him to join a mission on the desert planet of Dis. The ruling class of Dis, the magter, have threatened to transport cobalt bombs onto a neighbouring planet if they refuse to surrender. As a result, the planet is being blockaded and under threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike. In the novel, Brandd travels to Dis with Ihjel and a scientist from Earth called Lea, but on arrival the trio are attacked and Ihjel is killed. After encounters with the local population and other humans, Brandd starts to put together the reason for the magter's seemingly suicidal aggression. Brandd learns that most life on Dis survives the extremes of the planet by using symbiosis. The magter, though, have been infected by a parasite that destroys the higher functions of their brains. Eventually Brandd locates the cobalt bombs and disables the transmission mechanism, allowing him to return home. ==External links== * Harry Harrison official homepage - information about Planet of the Damned * Category:1962 American novels Category:1962 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by Harry Harrison Category:Novels first published in serial form ","title":"Planet of the Damned"},{"id":"35262419","text":"Oman national under-23 football team (also known as Oman Olympic, Oman U-23) represents Oman in international football competitions in the Olympic Games.

A political worker with liberal views, she became one of the founding members of the Woman's National Democratic Club. In her position overseeing the club's finances, she helped the organization purchase of its Washington, D.C. headquarters, which is still in use. Cunningham was descended from wealthy plantation slaveholders who had moved to Texas from Alabama. By the time she was born in 1882, the family fortunes had been dissipated by the Civil War and Reconstruction, forcing her mother to sell vegetables to make ends meet. She holds the distinction of being the first female student of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston to earn a Graduate of Pharmacy degree. As a member of the National American Women's Suffrage Association, Cunningham helped persuade Senator Andrieus Aristieus Jones of New Mexico, chair of the Senate Woman Suffrage Committee, to introduce the amendment for a vote. Cunningham was part of a team who met with President Woodrow Wilson in the Oval Office, successfully coaxing the President into releasing a statement expressing a leaning towards suffrage. When Texas Governor James E. Ferguson actively opposed the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, Cunningham formed a coalition that helped impeach the governor. She was active for decades in both national and Texas state politics. In 1928, Cunningham became the first woman from Texas to run for the United States Senate. She supported the New Deal policies and programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and sought to uplift the status of the disenfranchised in the country. Cunningham saw the connection between poverty and nutrition, and worked for government legislation to require nutrient enrichment of flour and bread. Cunningham's 1944 Texas gubernatorial candidacy against incumbent Coke Stevenson garnered her second place in a field of nine candidates. To meet the expenses of running a county campaign office for John F. Kennedy's presidential race, she sold used clothing. ==Early life and background== Minnie Fisher was born the seventh of eight children to Horatio White Fisher and his wife Sallie Comer Abercrombie Fisher on March 19, 1882, in New Waverly, Texas, on land that would become known as Fisher Farms. Sallie Comer Abercrombie was the only child of John Comer Abercrombie and Jane Minerva Sims Abercrombie, who had moved to Texas in the 1850s from Macon County, Alabama to become one of the largest land holders in Walker County. Minnie's paternal grandfather William Phillips Fisher had moved to Walker County from Lowndes County, Alabama and was the owner of 92 slaves. Minnie's father Horatio had been the owner of 72 slaves and was elected to Texas State Legislature in 1857. When Civil War broke out, Horatio raised a cavalry company for the Confederate States Army. On furlough during the war, Horatio married Sallie. Of their eight children, seven survived to adulthood.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.8,9 Waverly had been settled in Walker County in 1835 by an Alabama plantation owner named James W. Winters. When San Jacinto County was formed in 1870, Waverly became a part of the new county. The Houston and Great Northern Railroad was denied right-of-way through Waverly, and instead laid tracks ten miles to the west in Walker County where it placed Waverly Station. Many from the original Waverly were attracted to the locale, and it became New Waverly. The Waverly in San Jacinto became known as Old Waverly. The war and reconstruction stripped Horatio and Sallie of their wealth, and they were forced to move in with Sallie's parents. It was at the Abercrombie plantation where Minnie and her siblings grew up. By that point in time, slave labor had been replaced by sharecroppers. The children were home schooled by Sallie until 1894. The family business became selling produce to railroad workers, eventually expanding to marketing the produce in Houston. Sallie used the proceeds of the produce business to finance formal schooling for her children.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.10,11,12 Minnie received her spiritual grounding from the Methodists and was instrumental in helping found a Methodist church in New Waverly. After the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Minnie and her mother Sallie held a fund raising effort in New Waverly. Her political interests stemmed from her father. Although she passed the state teacher certification examination, Minnie chose medicine as her field of study. She enrolled at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston School of Pharmacy. In 1901, Minnie became her alma mater's sole female to earn a Graduate of Pharmacy Degree. She found employment in Huntsville, but earned less than half the wages of her less-educated male co-workers. Minnie would later cite this experience as her motivation in elevating the status of women.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.14,20,21,22 ==First involvement with suffrage issues== After her 1902 marriage to B. J. Cunningham, she became involved in volunteer organizations. One of these in 1912 was the Wednesday Club, which in part focused on women's suffrage and children's rights. She further became interested in women's issues as a member of the Women's Health Protective Association (WHPA) and the Galveston Equal Suffrage Association (GESA).McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.27,28,29 It was in these organizations where Cunningham developed her skill for public oratory, accepting speaking engagements at public events and before groups of legislators McArthur, Smith (2005) p.31 Cunningham became involved with the Texas Woman Suffrage Association (TWSA). In 1913, the organization became affiliated with the National American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In 1914, Cunningham was elected president of GESA. She began networking with other prominent suffrage persons such as TWSA president Mary Eleanor Brackenridge of San Antonio, British politician Ethel Snowden and TWSA co-leader Annette Finnigan of Houston,Texas Through Women's Eyes (2010) p.27 who became Cunningham's mentor.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.32 Under Cunningham's guidance, GESA held a public department store event on May 2, 1914, that included speeches by Chicago attorney and lobbyist Annette Funk.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.33 Cunningham organized GESA events during the Galveston Cotton Carnival, featuring speaker Perle Penfield, a Galveston university medical student hired by Finnigan as a summer intern. 1916 Petition from Minnie Fisher Cunningham to New York Congressman Harry H. Dale Cunningham broadened her network base by reaching out to labor union organizers such as Eva Goldsmith, president of Texas District Council of United Garment Workers Union. In 1915, Cunningham contributed five women's suffrage articles to the Texas State Federation of Labor (TSFL) publication Labor Dispatch. She devoted considerable time and effort to promote the TWSA petition to the Texas State Legislature for an amendment to the state constitution to enable women to vote.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.38 Towards the amendment push, Californian Helen ToddTexas Through Women's Eyes (2010) p.52 was brought in to speak at events, as was Harriot Stanton Blatch, daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Although the amendment was defeated, Cunningham continued to work tirelessly on suffrage, hosting physician, minister and suffrage supporter Anna Howard Shaw. In 1915, TWSA elected Cunningham as its president.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.43 Over the long haul, Cunningham would serve as president until 1919. In 1916, TWSA changed its name to Texas Equal Suffrage Association (TESA).McArthur, Smith (2005) p.44 Finances of TESA and how to make the organization self-sustaining were at the forefront of Cunningham's agenda. She often borrowed money to fund TESA.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.45 She ran TESA from her own home, using it as the organization's headquarters.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.46 International Woman Suffrage Alliance president Carrie Chapman Catt sent freelance organizer Elizabeth Freeman and NAWSA freelance organizer Lavinia Engle from Maryland to rally support.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.47 ==James E. Ferguson== Texas Governor James E. Ferguson and former United States Senator from Texas Joseph Weldon Bailey stood in staunch opposition to a Constitutional amendment for women's suffrage in 1916, lumping it together with prohibition as a states' rights issue. They spoke against it at the state Democratic convention in San Antonio, and as part of the minority report presented at the Democratic National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri. As part of the NAWSA contingent at the convention, Cunningham led a protest against Ferguson. When Cunningham returned to Texas, she and Lavinia Engle toured south Texas urging people to vote against Ferguson in the primary.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.50,51 Cunningham moved the TESA headquarters to Austin in 1917 when the Texas State Legislature began considering a primary suffrage bill that ultimately failed to pass. At the same time, there was a growing possibility of impeachment of Governor Ferguson over numerous practices that included appropriations and appointments at the University of Texas. Cunningham made an alliance with university professor Mary Gearing and Austin suffrage people to form the Women's Campaign for Good Government (WCGG). The organization was joined by the Ex-Students Association and William Clifford Hogg, son of former Governor Jim Hogg. The coalition deluged legislators with letters and telegrams. The legislature called a special investigative session, and the WCGG took to the streets and handed out a flyer listing what it believed were impeachable acts of Ferguson.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.52‚Äì55 Ferguson was impeached on ten counts, and forbidden to hold office in Texas. He resigned from office on August 25, 1917. After the American entry into World War I, Cunningham involved TESA in patriotic work, such as the campaign for Liberty bonds. The organization became involved in an anti-vice campaign focused on military bases. The Woman's Anti-Vice Committee was aimed at providing wholesome alternatives to bars and a deterrent to prostitution, as was the Texas Social Hygiene Association. In 1918, Cunningham received an appointment to the Texas Military Welfare Commission.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.56,57,58 In spite of the terms of his impeachment banning him from elected office, Ferguson announced his candidacy for governor in 1918. Acting governor William P. Hobby was likely to be voted out of office in the wake of Ferguson's illegitimate candidacy. Cunningham worked behind the scenes with state representative Charles Metcalfe to cut a deal for primary suffrage, which would allow women in Texas to vote in the primary elections but not in the general elections. If he would get a primary suffrage bill passed, and signed by Governor Hobby, she would deliver him the women's votes. Metcalfe got the bill passed and Hobby signed the bill on May 26.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.61,62 The women conducted a grass roots campaign named Women's Hobby Clubs to deliver promised votes.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.64 The group persuaded university professor Annie Webb Blanton to run for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The women's vote helped propel Blanton to a primary victory. Blanton went on to win in the November general election and became the first woman in Texas elected to statewide office. ==Passage of the 19th amendment== Cunningham made arrangements with United States Senator from Texas Morris Sheppard in 1917 for a conference in his Washington, D.C. office for women to state their perspectives on the proposed suffrage amendment to the Constitution of the United States.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.69 She and NAWSA lobbyist Maud Wood Park, who would become the first president of the League of Women Voters,Sicherman, Green (1986) pp.519,520 initiated a campaign for constituents to flood the offices of their representatives with telegrams in favor of passage.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.70 The United States House of Representatives passed the first version of the Nineteenth Amendment on January 10, 1918, but it failed in the United States Senate. Alexander Caswell Ellis, a professor at the University of Texas who had been fired by Governor Ferguson, and reinstated after Ferguson's resignation of office, teamed up with Cunningham to pressure Texas newspapers to run editorials in favor of the amendment. Senator Charles Allen Culberson, who had also been the 21st Governor of Texas, was anti-suffrage. Caswell and Cunningham clipped pro- suffrage editorials from Texas newspapers and forwarded the clippings to Culberson's office daily. NAWSA pressed Cunningham into service as a lobbyist, to persuade Senator Andrieus Aristieus Jones of New Mexico, chair of the Senate Woman Suffrage Committee, to introduce the amendment for a vote. Jones complied. They also recruited Cunningham as part of a team to meet with President Woodrow Wilson in the Oval Office, successfully coaxing the President into releasing a statement expressing a leaning towards suffrage.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.71,72 In January 1919, the Texas state legislature passed a state amendment authorizing full suffrage for women. It was subject to referendum by state voters, and subsequently failed the referendum.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.75McArthur, Smith (2005) p.82 A joint resolution on the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed by the United States House of Representatives on May 21, 1919, passing in the United States Senate on June 4, 1919. Cunningham proceeded immediately to campaign for ratification by the Texas legislature.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.84 Texas became the first southern state to ratify the amendment on June 28, 1919. Cunningham teamed with Jessie Jack Hooper, first vice president of Wisconsin Women's Suffrage Association, on a national tour for ratification.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.84,85,86 The thirty-six states out of the then existing forty-eight needed for the three-fourths ratification was reached on August 26, 1920. ==League of Women Voters== With the amendment now a reality, NAWSA became the League of Women Voters (LWV). Cunningham was chosen as a delegate at large to the 1920 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.86,87 TESA became Texas League of Women Voters (TLWV) in 1919.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.91 R. Ewing Thomason was a member of the Texas House of Representatives and had been on the committee that investigated Governor Ferguson. In 1920, Thomason ran for governor against Joseph Weldon Bailey and lost. Cunningham had organized the Woman's Committee for Thomason and considered it a victory that Thomason had forced Bailey into a run-off against the eventual winner Pat Neff.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.92,93,94 Maud Wood Park was elected in 1920 as president of the Women's Joint Congressional Committee (WJCC) lobby organization. Park brought Cunningham back into service to work with Iowa Congressman Horace Mann Towner and Texas Senator Morris Sheppard to pass the 1921 Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act. The act was designed to lower infant mortality rate, and Cunningham, as executive secretary of the LWV, campaigned to get the individual states to accept the Act.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.96,97,98 Cunningham became Park's right hand and pinch hitter.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.99 The duo worked together with Ohio Congressman John L. Cable for passage of the 1922 Married Women's Independent Citizenship Act, and for its 1930 and 1931 amending. Prior to this Act, women's citizenship, or lack thereof, was totally dependent upon their husband's status. The bill was designed for a woman's citizenship to be based solely on her own status.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.100,101 Cunningham and Lavinia Engle worked together to combine the LWV's 1922 Baltimore convention with the Pan-American Conference of Women. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover helped insure the Pan American women delegates were women of achievement, not trophy wives of diplomats. The conference concluded by forming the Pan-American Association for the Advancement of Women, with Carrie Chapman Catt as president.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.101,102 Cunningham was appointed chair of the Negro Problems Committee.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.106,107,108 ==Politics== Cunningham directed the LWV's 1924 Get Out The Vote Campaign, for which she toured several states. The campaign was her final act as an officer of LWV.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.111,116 Cunningham accepted Eleanor Roosevelt's invitation to join Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair Emily Newell Blair's Democratic Women's Advisory Committee (DWAC). It was authorized by DNC chair Cordell Hull and met in 1924 in New York City. Eleanor Roosevelt was the committee chair.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.113 The DNC platform committee refused to meet with the DWAC, but Cunningham was able to meet with the platform committee as part of the LWV. Watching the platform committee undermine her presentations became a learning curve for Cunningham, who was beginning to believe women needed more involvement in partisan politics.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.114 Former Texas Governor James E. Ferguson, who was forbidden by the articles of impeachment from holding office, put his homemaker wife Miriam A. Ferguson up as the Democratic candidate in the 1924 gubernatorial election. That turn of events prompted Cunningham to support Republican candidate George C. Butte.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.118,119 Cunningham served as chair of the Texas League of Women Voters (TLWV) Committee on Prison Reform. She was also a member of the Texas Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor (CPPL), hoping to reform the Texas practice of incarcerating prisoners as cotton plantation labor. In 1925, CPPL's Elizabeth Speer named Cunningham to chair a committee to present the findings of a National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor to the state legislature. Governor Miriam Ferguson vetoed the CPPL's recommendation of taking the prisoners off the plantations and housing them in a new facility to be built in Austin.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.120,121 Woman's National Democratic Club She was a founding member of the Woman's National Democratic Club.McArthur, Judith. Minnie Fisher Cunningham : A Suffragist's Life in Politics New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, page 124. Emily Newell Blair was the club's principal founder, and also served it as secretary (1922‚Äì1926) and then later as president (1928‚Äì1929).McArthur, Judith. Minnie Fisher Cunningham : A Suffragist's Life in Politics New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pages 118, 119, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128. Edith Bolling Galt Wilson headed the club's board of governors when it opened formally in 1924. ==Running for U.S. Senate== Cunningham's campaign for U. S. Senate Cunningham ran in the 1928 election to represent the state of Texas in the United States Senate, the first woman in Texas to do so. Her opponent was the incumbent Earle B. Mayfield.Texas Through Women's Eyes (2010) p.66 Her goal in choosing to run was to elevate the status of women in the electorate.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.131,133 She ran on issues, forsaking the combative style of politics that historically dominated elections. In doing so, she disregarded advice from many, including her long-time ally Alexander Caswell Ellis.McArthur, Smith (2005) p6.135-1371 Cunningham lost in the state's primary.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.146 ==New Deal== Cunningham was appointed associate editor at the Texas Extension Service in 1930. In 1934, she became acting editor.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.151 She was a guest speaker at the 1937 Texas Agricultural Association (TAA) meeting and was a 1938 advisor to the association.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.152 She became interested in the link between poverty and poor nutrition, and in 1939 began working for the Agriculture Adjustment Administration (AAA). Cunningham worked in tandem with the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs (TFWC) to advocate bakers enrich flour with basic vitamin and mineral content. She was appointed Senior Specialist of the AAA's Information Division in 1939.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.154‚Äì155,157 She formed the Women's Committee for Economic Policy (WCEP) in 1938. And in 1941 when Lyndon Johnson ran as a candidate for the United States Senate, the WCEP had an agreement with him that in exchange for his making freight-rate reform a top priority, they would get out the vote for him. The WCEP also advocated a fully funded teacher retirement system and pensions for needy elderly persons who did not qualify for Social Security.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.156- In 1940, Cunningham became chief of the National Defense Advisory Commission Consumer Division's Civic Contracts Unit.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.159 Cunningham became frustrated with anti-New Deal elements within the Department of Agriculture and its subsequent gag order on the AAA. She resigned in 1943 and went home to Texas. ==1944 Campaign for governor and Texas liberals== After returning home to Texas, Cunningham ran for governor in 1944, to oppose what she believed were Governor Coke Stevenson's behind-the-scenes manipulations to undermine Franklin D. Roosevelt's price controls. She was particularly incensed with his cutting pensions for the elderly to balance his state budget. The anti- Roosevelt Democrats in the South conspired to throw the next Presidential election into the House of Representatives. The Texas Regulars, as the group was called in the state, operated at the behest of the oil and gas lobby, as did Stevenson.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.168 Cunningham, Bob Eckhardt, John Henry Faulk and other Texas liberals of the time had tried in vain to convince J. Frank Dobie to run against Stevenson. That same group of liberals later formed the 1946 People's Legislative Committee (PLC), to give a voice to the disenfranchised.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.186‚Äì189 With little or no funding, Cunningham sold lumber from trees on Fisher Farms to raise money for her filing fee. Liz Carpenter served as Cunningham's press secretary. Stevenson was forced to stay in Texas campaigning for re-election, rather than attend the national convention in Chicago. The 1944 campaign served to meld liberals into a cohesive unit in Texas.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.172,173,174 Although she lost in the primary, Cunningham did come in second in the nine-candidate race.Sicherman, Green (1986) pp.176,177McArthur, Smith (2005) p.169 At Cunningham's urging, Sarah T. Hughes ran for Congress against Joseph Franklin Wilson, losing in a post-primary runoff. Governor W. Lee O'Daniel stacked the University of Texas Board of Regents with Texas Regulars, a practice continued with Stevenson. University president Homer Rainey was fired in 1944 for his continued conflicts with the regents over their firing of professors. Cunningham formed the Women's Committee for Educational Freedom (WCEF) in 1945 as a call to arms over practices of the university regents.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.176,177 Rainey ran for governor in 1946, but lost to Beauford H. Jester. ==Shivercrats and final years== A farm labor organization named the Texas Social and Legislative Conference (TSLC) was primarily the concept of Cunningham and Alexander Caswell Ellis. They worked to create a coalition of parties with a vested interest in New Deal policies. As a result of their efforts, James Carey of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Frank Overturf of the Texas Farmer's Union and James Patton of the National Farmers Union formed the TSLC in February 1944.McArthur, Smith (2005) pp.166,167 Cunningham continued to be involved with the Democratic Party, supporting Harry Truman in 1948.McArthur, Smith (2005) p.191 When Texas Governor Beauford H. Jester unexpectedly died in office July 11, 1949, then Lieutenant Governor Allan Shivers ascended to the governor's mansion. Shivers controlled the wing of the Texas Democratic Party that were Dixiecrats, or States' Rights, holdovers. An internal contest for the party played out, with Shivers intent on delivering the state of Texas to Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Those who aligned themselves with Shivers were called Shivercrats. At the state convention, the Shivercrats controlled the party and influenced the Democrats to vote Republican for Eisenhower, rather than the Democratic party standard bearer Adlai Stevenson. Cunningham and Lillian Collier ran the Texas Women for Stevenson organization out of Austin. In 1953, Cunningham instituted the Texas Democratic Women's State Committee (TDSW), with a constitution that required individual member support for the federal level of the Democratic party. The organization drew the disenfranchised of the state Democrats, the minorities and liberals who were otherwise shut out by the Shivercrats.

When the procession was passing a mosque, Muslims in the mosque forbade them to drums. At one stage, someone hurled a brick bat on the procession. An altercation took place at once which turned into chase and counter-chase when someone from the procession responded by throwing a brick bat. Police organised a meeting between the two parties which was allegedly delayed with ill-intention. A group of Muslims said that the meeting will be held in the mosque and the Hindus agreed. The meeting started in the evening. Requesting anonymity, several of those who attended the meeting told that a handful of miscreants vandalised a temple on the Loknath Sebasram premises when the meeting was underway. They also vandalised seven to eight cars of the temple's visitors. Muslims first vandalised a temple on the Loknath Sebasram premises when the meeting was underway. The idols and the temple premises were vandalised. At that night local Islamists named Emdad Ullah and Lokhman hired a construction worker named Mohammad Jasim to break down the wall of the local Mosque to divert away vandalisation of Lokhnath Temple. Next day they spread the rumour that Hindus have destroyed the mosque. Thousands of students of Darul Ulum Muinul Islam madrassah attacked the Raksha Kali Mandir at Hathazari and torching the temple after the madrassah students had said their juma prayers on the road.

Section 144 was clamped on Hathazari on Friday, 10 February 2012. == Aftermath == The violence against Hindu community was condemned by a great number of people. Initially Bangladeshi mainstream media kept a media blackout on this topic. But due to Facebook and Blog the news was spread across the world. A great number of Muslims also protested against this crime. Advocate Rana Dasgupta, the general secretary of the central committee of Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad visited the affected areas of Hathazari. On 19 February, the BHBCOP, held a press conference at the Chittagong Press Club and demanded immediate arrest and punishment of the guilty.

He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks. At Cicero ‚Äì North Syracuse High School, Corbin did not pitch for his high school's baseball team until his junior season. He played college baseball at Mohawk Valley Community College and Chipola College. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted Corbin in the second round of the 2009 MLB draft. The Angels traded Corbin to the Diamondbacks in 2010 as part of a package for Dan Haren. Corbin made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks in 2012, and was named an All-Star in 2013. Corbin missed the 2014 season due to an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. He returned to the Diamondbacks in 2015, but struggled, and was removed from the starting rotation in 2016. After returning to the rotation in 2017, Corbin started for the Diamondbacks on Opening Day in 2018.

Its properties are still debated and it may be a massive highly luminous star or a very young less luminous Herbig Ae/Be star. MWC 349 is also a variable star with the designation V1478 Cygni. ==MWC 349A and B and a third star== MWC 349 is a resolved double star, with its components separated by 2.4 arc seconds. The primary, MWC 349A, is a B[e] star, where the B is the spectral type and the [e] denotes forbidden emission lines. Its spectrum lacks absorption features and is variable but has been classified as B0-1.5 with a supergiant luminosity class. The secondary, MWC 349B, is a giant star with a spectral type of B0III. It has been proposed that there is a third star, of lower mass and closely orbiting MWC 349A, possibly at a distance of 12‚Äì13 AU from the primary with a period of 9 years. Such a star has not been observed but would help to explain some unusual properties of the system. ==Features== MWC 349B appears to be a relatively conventional hot giant star, but MWC 349A is a very unusual object. It is a supergiant B[e] star, indicating that it is a luminous star with high mass loss and a disc of surrounding material. These features are shared by pre-main-sequence stars and evolved very massive stars, and it is unclear which category MWC 349A falls into. MWC 349 is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky and 2 cm observations show a prominent hourglass nebula. It also has a very faint infrared nebula with the same orientation and geometry, but 400 times larger (5 parsecs across). It is extremely unusual in showing hydrogen recombination masers and lasers, interpreted as originating in the disc. One theory is that MWC 349A is a highly luminous evolved star similar to a luminous blue variable (LBV), with an absolute magnitude somewhere between ‚àí6.7 and ‚àí7.3, and a bolometric luminosity several hundred thousand times that of the sun. It is a variable star and the General Catalogue of Variable Stars lists it as an S Doradus variable due to its erratic brightness and spectral changes. The distant association with MWC 349B and its remoteness from the dense star-forming regions that would normally host such luminous stars is unusual. One possibility is that the whole system was ejected from Cygnus OB2 and the two components have since become unbound due to mass loss from MWC 349A. The alternative theory is that MWC 349A is still condensing onto the main sequence. It is still a massive star surrounded by a disc of material but that material was not ejected from the star, and the luminosity is lower than would be the case for a more massive evolved star. The compact nature of the material absorbing and re-radiating much of the stars output suggests that it is unlikely to be extremely luminous. ==Origin== MWC 349 may be a runaway star ejected from the nearby, massive Cygnus OB2 association. The mass of the main component of the system, MWC 349A, is assumed to have been when the star was born 40 times the mass of the Sun, but stellar evolution left it with just 20-25 solar masses, destabilizing the system and causing MWC 349B to no longer be gravitationally bound. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * MWC 349A: A hot edge-on disk * SCIENTISTS DISCOVER FIRST NATURAL LASER IN SPACE Category:B-type giants Category:B(e) stars Category:Runaway stars Category:Radio stars (astronomy) Category:Cygnus (constellation) Category:IRAS catalogue objects Cygni, V1478 J20324553+4039366 ","title":"MWC 349"},{"id":"35262685","text":"Zoigl beers Zoigl is a type of beer brewed in the Oberpfalz in north-eastern Bavaria, Germany, between Franconia and the Czech Republic. The name is believed to be derived from a Windischeschenbacher dialect pronunciation of the German word zeigen or Zeichen meaning \\"sign\\", the symbol used to advertise that the beer is available at an establishment. Its two component triangles represent the joining of six beer ingredients: the first triangle denoting water, fire and air; the second and inverted triangle denoting malted barley, hops, water. ==History== Zoigl house in Tirschenreuth, northeast of Bavaria The first documented example of the word \\"zeigl\\" occurs in a 1508 document at Neustadt an der Waldnaab, having derived from the German \\"Zeichen\\" meaning sign, or \\"zeigen\\" meaning show. It was pronounced \\"zeigel\\" in the Oberpfalz region. Today the word \\"Zoigl\\" is still in use and has given its name to this style of beer production. Zoigl has been brewed for centuries in communal breweries, owned either by the town or by an association of homebrewers. Zoigl was only found in Windischeschenbach and Neuhaus until about 2000. The name and mark have been pilfered because they were not copyright protected. Hence, the over-advertising of Zoigl beer across Germany. The original comes from Windischeschenbach and Neuhaus, and people have their favorites, because each brewer has his/her own recipes. ==Process== First wood is chopped, the fire started to cook the water and barley to temp, it is cooled over copper, then the wort is distributed to the brewers' private cellars, where the fermentation takes place. The method used is bottom fermenting yeast and lagering. About two weeks later the beer is brought to these home pubs where it is tapped directly from the lagering tank. It is then sold in the brewer's house, which effectively becomes a pub until all the beer has been drunk. The pub that has Zoigl from that Friday through Monday then attaches the Zoigl- Star to the corner of his house to show he has beer available. Only about 9 or 10 people have ‚Äúdas Braurecht\\" in Windischeschenbach at one time. ==NotesReferences== * The Beer Thrillers - An Educational Beer Blog ==External links== Category:Beer and breweries in Bavaria Category:German beer styles Category:Upper Palatinate Category:Types of drinking establishment ","title":"Zoigl"},{"id":"35262689","text":"Thomas Jeyaraj Fernando, aka Jeyaraj, Jayaraj, or simply, J., is an illustrator for Tamil periodicals and magazines. He is especially known for his depictions of attractive, young (and frequently buxom) women, which have earned him a fan following among readers of Tamil magazines as well as criticism. Jeyaraj, who is from Tuticorin, has no formal training in art, but nevertheless won prizes in school and college for his sketches. He studied for a bachelor's degree in economics, but when he could not find any employment in his chosen field, he decided to try his luck with illustration. This was in Chennai in the late 1950s. His first assignment in 1958 was for a short story by Ra. Ki. Rangarajan in Kumudam magazine, fetched him Rs. 10. Since then, Jeyaraj has illustrated hundreds of Tamil short stories, jokes and serials, and is known for his versatility, handling everything from line-drawing, wash drawing, colour drawing, perspective drawing to cartoons. He is also very quick and prolific as an illustrator: according to Jeyaraj, in the 1970s, he used to make 40 illustrations a day. A biographical note in The Blaft Anthology of Tamil Pulp Fiction, Vol. II claims that by 1980, Jeyaraj had done over 2,00,000 illustrations.

The Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Eaton in the 19th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2012 with the Diamondbacks, and played with them through the 2013 season. He played for the Chicago White Sox from 2014 to 2016. Prior to playing professionally, he played college baseball for Miami University. ==Career== Amateur career Eaton graduated from Kenton Ridge High School in Springfield, Ohio. He is the fourth player to reach the major leagues from Kenton Ridge, preceded by Dave Burba, Rick White and Dustin Hermanson. A pitcher and outfielder in high school, Eaton's fastball could reach as high as 92 mph, while he batted .482 in his junior season in 2006. He helped lead his team to the regional finals in 2004 and 2005. Eaton earned All-Ohio honorable mention honors that year, as well as being named to the All-Miami Valley first team and the Springfield News-Suns All-Area first team as a sophomore and junior. However, a bulging disc suffered while playing basketball limited Eaton in his senior season in 2007. Eaton committed to attend Miami University on a baseball scholarship. Miami recruited Eaton as a two-way player. He played for the Miami RedHawks baseball team in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in NCAA Division I. In 2009, he was named a MAC All-Star outfielder. Arizona Diamondbacks Arizona Diamondbacks in 2013 The Diamondbacks drafted Eaton in the 19th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, with the 571st overall selection. In 2010 and 2011, Eaton had a .340 batting average with the Diamondbacks' minor league affiliates. Eaton was named a Pioneer League All-Star outfielder in 2010, and a California League All-Star in 2011. In 2011, he batted .318 with 145 hits and 72 walks, good for a .434 on-base percentage (OBP), which was the fourth best OBP in minor league baseball. Eaton also stole 34 bases. He was invited to spring training in 2012, where he impressed Diamondbacks' manager Kirk Gibson, and received as many at bats as Diamondbacks regulars. Eaton played for the Reno Aces of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 2012. He was named the PCL Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player. The Diamondbacks called Eaton up to the major leagues on September 4. Eaton was expected to play for the Diamondbacks for the 2013 season, but suffered an injury to his right elbow during spring training. He returned to the Diamondbacks in July, and played in 66 games. Chicago White Sox Chicago White Sox in 2016 On December 10, 2013, the Diamondbacks traded Eaton to the Chicago White Sox in a three-team deal, involving the Diamondbacks, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and the White Sox. The Diamondbacks received Mark Trumbo from the Angels and two players to be named later (Brandon Jacobs and A. J. Schugel) and the Angels received Tyler Skaggs from the Diamondbacks and Hector Santiago from the White Sox. Eaton batted .300 with 15 stolen bases during the 2014 season. During spring training in 2015, Eaton and the White Sox agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $23.5 million, with options for two additional years. During a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 22, 2015, Eaton grounded out to Yordano Ventura, who shouted profanity at Eaton, which ignited a bench-clearing brawl. Eaton was unaffected while five players, including Ventura were ejected. Washington Nationals Eaton with the Nationals' 2019 World Series trophy On December 7, 2016, the White Sox traded Eaton to the Washington Nationals for Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo L√≥pez, and Dane Dunning. 2017 On Opening Day, Eaton went 1-for-2, was walked twice, stole a base, scored a run, and hit a double against the Miami Marlins. On April 28, 2017, Eaton stumbled when reaching first base and left the game. The next day, on April 29, Eaton was diagnosed with a left knee strain, placing him on the 10-day disabled list. The same night, further tests from MRIs revealed that Eaton had a torn ACL, as well as a torn meniscus and a sprained ankle. He would miss the rest of the 2017 season. 2018 Eaton got a late start on spring training in 2018, with the Nationals wanting to handle him with care. He got off to a hot start at the plate to begin the season, winning the first National League Player of the Week award of the year (and in his career) after going 8-for-13 with two home runs against the Cincinnati Reds in a three-game series. However, Eaton continued to move awkwardly on his surgically repaired left leg, and after exiting a game against the New York Mets early on April 5 following an aggressive sliding play at the plate to score a run, he was ultimately placed on the disabled list with what was described as a bone bruise in his left ankle on April 11. On May 10, Eaton underwent arthroscopic surgery on his injured ankle in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with Dr. Robert Anderson discovering and removing a small tear in the cartilage of the ankle that was causing discomfort. Following the chondral flap operation and a brief rehab assignment with the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators and High-A Potomac Nationals, Eaton was activated from the disabled list for a start in right field against the San Francisco Giants at Nationals Park on June 9. Eaton compiled a .301 average and .805 OPS over 319 plate appearances on the season. 2019 In 2019 he batted .279/.365/.428 with 15 home runs and 49 RBIs. The Nationals finished the year 93-69, clinching a wild card spot and winning the World Series over the Astros. ==Personal life== Eaton has been confused with former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Adam Eaton. In one instance, he received six licensing checks from MLB worth $20,000 each, and has received fan mail meant for the other MLB veteran. Eaton is married to former Miami RedHawks softball player Katie Osburn Eaton. They have two sons, and reside in Brighton, Michigan during the offseason. Adam's brother, Zack Eaton, is an acquisitions officer in the United States Air Force. ==References * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Miami RedHawks baseball players Category:Missoula Osprey players Category:Visalia Rawhide players Category:Salt River Rafters players Category:Mobile BayBears players Category:Reno Aces players Category:Arizona League Diamondbacks players Category:Charlotte Knights players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Pacific Coast League MVP award winners ","title":"Adam Eaton (outfielder)"},{"id":"35262723","text":"The Salvation Army in Canada (nicknamed \\"Sally Ann\\") is the Canadian territory of a Christian church that is known for its charity work, with a motto of Giving Hope Today. The Salvation Army was formed in 1865 in London, England, and it began working in Canada in 1882. Today, it operates in 400 communities across Canada and in Bermuda.Our Organization, The Salvation Army. The Salvation Army Archives are in Toronto, and the Salvation Army's Training College (formerly in Toronto) is in Winnipeg. ==Governance== The Salvation Army in Canada is an administrative unit of The Salvation Army that serves Canada and Bermuda. The territory is divided geographically into divisions ‚Äì Alberta, Bermuda, British Columbia, Maritime, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario Central East, Ontario Great Lakes, Prairie, and Quebec. Each division is headed by a divisional commander, who is responsible to the National Commander. In turn, the National Commander is responsible to International Headquarters (IHQ) in London, England. The Territorial Commander (TC) and Chief Secretary are appointed by the General. Their role is to oversee and administer the work of The Salvation Army within their territory. They are assisted by various other Secretaries (departmental heads) who are, in turn, responsible for overseeing their various branches of Army activity. The Territorial Commander is responsible for the territory's overall operation and mission, and the Chief Secretary is responsible for the territory's administration and daily operations. Senior executive officers are, on the recommendation of the Territorial Commander, also appointed by the General. All other officer appointments within a territory are the responsibility of the Territorial Commander and the Cabinet. The Salvation Army in Canada is a non-governmental direct provider of social services in the areas of homelessness, poverty and addiction, and a continuing support for programs in developing countries. In addition to mobile programs such as disaster relief, and homeless soup lines, the Salvation Army in Canada currently operates permanent facilities including corps community centers (churches), Social Services Centers, summer camps, Adult Rehabilitation Centers, and thrift stores. ==History== 1st Salvation Army meeting in Canada Plaque, Stayner's Wharf, Halifax, Nova Scotia En route to England, George Scott Railton stopped at the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and held the first Salvation Army meeting in Canada on March 24, 1881. He was so engaged in his sermon that he missed his boat to England. He preached in Halifax for the following week at various Halifax churches, and a year later, the Salvation Army was officially established in Canada. The Salvation Army began operating in Canada in 1882. Brigadier Gideon Miller (1866-1949), Staff Architect for the Salvation Army in Canada from April 1906 until 1931, designed meeting halls (often called 'citadels'), hospitals and hostels in cities and towns across Canada.Brigadier Gideon Miller In 1886, only four years after it had come to Canada from England, the Salvation Army built its Territorial Headquarters for Canada and Bermuda. It also housed the Toronto Temple, built in 1886 and demolished in 1954. Arnold Brown (December 13, 1913 - June 26, 2002), the 11th General of The Salvation Army (1977‚Äì1981), served as Territorial Commander in 1974.

After finishing folk high school in 1896 and agricultural school in 1897, he was a farmer at M√∏rfj√¶r in Stokken from 1900 to 1923 and the family farm Fl√∏istad in √òstre Moland from 1923. He was also a bailiff in Stokken from 1902, and from 1921 he doubled as bailiff of Austre Moland too. He held the bailiff position until 1948, except for the years 1943‚Äì1945 during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. He was a member of √òstre Moland or Stokken municipal council from 1904 to 1923 and 1934 to 1940, serving as mayor of Stokken from 1919 to 1921. Stokken had been separated from √òstre Moland as an independent municipality in 1919. He was married to Gustava, born 1880. Through his oldest son Ivar,1910 census he was a grandfather of philosopher Guttorm Fl√∏istad. ==National politics== He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in the 1912 election from the constituency Nedenes, and served a three-year term. In 1915 Fl√∏istad won the first round of voting, with a tally of 1,747 against 1,267 votes for Liberal Aslak Kateraas (with a Gunnar Fl√∏istad as running mate) and 1,196 for Conservative Lars Olsen Skjulestad. There was therefore a second round, and the bourgeois parties backed Kateraas to avoid re-election of Fl√∏istad. Kateraas (now with Skjulestad as running mate) won with 2,887 votes against Fl√∏istad's 2,181. Kateraas was a former mayor of Aamli, but Fl√∏istad carried that district as well as Lille Topdal and Froland‚Äîon the other hand, Kateraas carried Fl√∏istad's home district √òstre Moland as well as Gj√∏vdal, Trom√∏, His√∏ and √òiestad. The same thing happened in 1918. Fl√∏istad won the second round with 1,843 votes against 1,444 for Skjulestad and 1,370 for Kateraas. Fl√∏istad now faced Skjulestad in the run-off, and lost with 1,688 against 2,340. It was not enough for Fl√∏istad to carry Aamli as well as √òstre Moland. In 1919 Fl√∏istad signed a communique that preceded the founding of a splinter party from Labour, the Social Democratic Labour Party. In the 1921 election, plural- member constituencies had been introduced and Fl√∏istad headed the Social Democratic ballot for Aust-Agder. Gunnar Fl√∏istad was now an Agrarian. Neither were elected. Many years later he served as a deputy representative during the term 1945‚Äì1949, but this time for the Conservative Party. In the 1949 election he was promoted to head the Conservative Party ballot for Aust-Agder, but Labour swept three of four seats with the last going to the Liberals. The Conservatives were outrun by the Agrarian Party too. Fl√∏istad died in July 1953, some months before the next parliamentary election. Fl√∏istad was a board member of the trade union Norges lensmannslag, and chaired it locally in Aust- Agder from 1924 to 1939 and 1946 to 1948. Upon retiring here he became an honorary member. He also chaired Arendals Meieri (1930‚Äì1947, board member since 1907), Aust-Agder Melkecentral (1931‚Äì1948) and Aust-Agder Kraftverk (1942‚Äì1952, board member since 1934) and was a board member of Nedenes Sparebank (1927‚Äì1953), Arendal Museum (1933‚Äì1952) and Vestlandske Tidende. In 1947 he was decorated with the King's Medal of Merit in gold. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Arendal Category:Norwegian farmers Category:Norwegian police chiefs Category:Mayors of places in Aust-Agder Category:Members of the Storting Category:Labour Party (Norway) politicians Category:Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway politicians Category:Conservative Party (Norway) politicians Category:Recipients of the King's Medal of Merit in gold ","title":"Guttorm Fl√∏istad (politician)"},{"id":"35262772","text":"The Lisbon massacre (alternatively known as the Lisbon pogrom or the 1506 Easter Slaughter) was an incident in April, 1506, in Lisbon in the Kingdom of Portugal in which a crowd of Catholics, as well as foreign sailors who were anchored in the Tagus, persecuted, tortured, killed, and burnt at the stake hundreds of people who were accused of being Jews and, thus, guilty of deicide and heresy. This incident took place thirty years before the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition and nine years after the Jews were forced to convert to the Catholic Church in 1497 during the reign of King Manuel I. ==Background== In the years that followed the banishment of the Jews from Castile and Aragon in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, thousands of Jews took refuge in neighbouring Kingdom of Portugal. King Manuel I was by far more tolerant toward the Jewish community but, under pressure from Spain, made their conversion to Catholicism compulsory in 1497. ==The massacre== Epistola de victoria contra infideles habita, 1507 The massacre began, as it is reported, in the S√£o Domingos de Lisboa Convent on Sunday, 19 April 1506. The faithful were praying for the end of the drought and plague that swept the country when someone swore they had seen the illuminated face of Jesus on the altar ‚Äî a phenomenon that could only be explained by the Catholics present as a message from the Messiah, a miracle. A New Christian, one of the converted Jews, thought otherwise, and voiced his opinion that it had been only the reflection of a candle on the crucifix. The men gathered for Mass, hearing this, grabbed the man by his hair and brought him outside the church where he was beaten to death by the crowd and his body was burnt in the Rossio, one of the main squares of central Lisbon. From that point the New Christians, who were already not trusted by the population, became the scapegoats for the drought, famine and plague. Dominican friars promised absolution for sins committed over the previous 100 days to those who killed the \\"heretics\\", and a crowd of more than 500 people (many of them sailors from the Holland, Zeeland and the Kingdom of Germany) gathered and killed all the New Christians they could find on the streets, burning their bodies by the Tagus or in the Rossio. That Sunday, more than 500 people were violently sent to their deaths. The Court and the King had earlier left Lisbon for Abrantes in order to escape the plague, and were absent when the massacre began. King Manuel I was in Avis when he was informed of the event in Lisbon, and dispatched magistrates to try to put an end to the bloodbath. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, the small group of authorities present were unable to intervene, as the crowd grew and the violence spread. By Monday, 20 April, more locals had joined the crowd, which carried on the massacre with even more violence. The New Christians, no longer found on the streets, were dragged from their houses and from churches and, along with their wives, sons and daughters, were burnt in the public squares alive or dead. Not even infants were spared, as the crowd ripped them to pieces or threw them against the walls. The crowd proceeded to loot the houses, stealing all the gold, silver and linens they could find. More than 1000 people were killed on the second day. There is also record that more than New Christians of Jewish ancestry were killed that day. Some accused their neighbours of heresy, and these unfortunates met the same fate as the New Christians. On Tuesday, members of the court arrived at the city and rescued some of the New Christians. Jo√£o Rodrigues Mascarenhas, the King's Squire, was killed by mistake in the massacre, and this triggered the arrival of the royal guard. The death count had, however, already reached more than 1900. Aires da Silva and D. √Ålvaro de Castro, head of the Lisbon Freguesia and Governor, respectively, were among those who tried to stop the crowd, and they were backed by the Prior of Crato and D. Diogo Lopo, Baron of Alvito, who had special powers from the King to execute members of the crowd. ==Aftermath== Monument in Lisbon in memory of those lost. It reads: \\"In memory of the thousands of Jews who were victimed by intolerance and religious fanaticism, killed on the massacre that started on 19 April 1506, on this square\\". The base has a verse from the Book of Job etched onto it: \\"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.\\" Some Portuguese were arrested and hanged, while others had all their possessions confiscated by the Crown. The foreigners returned to their carracks with their plunder and sailed away. The two seditionist Dominican friars who had incited the massacre were stripped of their religious orders and were burnt at the stake. There are reports that the S√£o Domingos Convent was closed down during the eight years that followed, and all the representatives of the city of Lisbon were expelled from the Council of the Crown‚ÄîLisbon had had a seat in the Council since 1385, when King John I gave the city that privilege. Following the massacre, a climate of suspicion against New Christians pervaded the Kingdom of Portugal. The Portuguese Inquisition was established thirty years afterward; many families of Jewish ancestry either escaped or were banished from the country. Even banished, they still had to pay for their emigration; they had to leave or sell their properties to the Crown, traveling only with the luggage they could carry. After the massacre, New Christians of Jewish ancestry still felt deep allegiance to the Portuguese monarch.Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Elisheva Carlebach: Jewish History and Jewish Memory: Essays in Honor of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, 1998, UPNE, , p. 6‚Äì7 ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Richard Zimler The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon (1998) Category:Antisemitism in Portugal Category:Conflicts in 1506 Category:1506 in Portugal Category:History of Lisbon ","title":"Lisbon massacre"},{"id":"35262774","text":"Wendell Helms Fleming (born March 7, 1928) is an American mathematician, specializing in geometrical analysis and stochastic differential equations.

In addition to her diplomatic mission, her crew also conducted numerous geographical and natural studies in the Far East. She was scuttled by her own crew in the Crimean War due to the poor condition of her hull in 1855. ==Construction== Pallada was built at the Admiralty Shipyardin St Petersburg, with her hull design based on the British frigate , which in turn was based after an American frigate, which had been captured as a prize of war by the Royal Navy during the War of 1812. The ship was intended from the start for use by members of the Russian imperial family on diplomatic missions, and Tsar Nicholas I issued an imperial rescript commanding that the vessel incorporate all of the latest innovations. After launching, she was based at Kronstadt with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the command of Captain Pavel Nakhimov, one of the ablest commanders in the Russian Navy. She entered active service in early August 1833. ==Description== \\"Pallada\\" was a three-masted frigate of wooden construction, with a transverse steel reinforcement skeleton in her hull. The length of the hull, at the height of the main deck battery, was (without bowsprit), the maximum interior width was . Her hull was sheathed in copper sheets, to prevent destruction of the wood by marine organisms. A novelty on the Russian ships at the time was the use of portholes for lighting crew spaces on the lower deck. Nominally, \\"Pallada\\" was classified as 44-gun frigate (Fifth-rate); however, her actual weaponry in service consisted of 30 x 24-pounder guns on her upper deck and 22 x 24-pounder carronades on her quarterdeck and forecastle. Her crew numbered 426 men. ==Service record== In 1834, \\"Pallada\\" transported the future Frederick William IV of Prussia on a state visit to Russia. From 1835-1836 she served in various ports in the Baltic and in 1837 was tasked with carrying gold bullion to London on a special mission for the Russian embassy. She served until 1846 as a training ship for cadets. She underwent a complete overhaul from 1846‚Äì48, and afterwards was assigned to the Mediterranean, calling on Madeira and Lisbon in 1849 and was frequently the flagship for Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia. In 1852, Pallada was assigned to a special expedition to the Far East under the command of Admiral Ivan Unkovsky as the flagship of Vice Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin. On his expedition, Putyatin was accompanied by Alexander Mozhaysky and a secretary, the writer Ivan Goncharov, who wrote a travelogue, Fregat Pallada (The Frigate Pallas), published in 1858 (\\"Pallada\\" is the Russian spelling of \\"Pallas\\").A Library of the World's Best Literature - Ancient and Modern - Vol. XVI by Charles Dudley Warner p. 6534. She departed Kronstadt on October 19, 1852, but was forced to dock at Portsmouth in England for repairs lasting a month. In January 1853, Admiral Unkovsky decided not to risk Cape Horn, but to follow the route to Asia around the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean. She spent over a month in South Africa for repairs and for collecting specimens of local flora and fauna, and crossed to the Sunda Strait in mid-May, where Putyatin sent a cable to St Petersburg requesting the dispatch of the newly built Diana due to repeated problems with Pallada. After calling on Singapore and Java, followed by Hong Kong, she reached the Bonin Islands by July 9 but was there demasted by a typhoon. While under repairs, her crew took the opportunity to explore the archipelago. Pallada finally arrived in Nagasaki on August 12, 1853, just one month after the first visit of Commodore Perry to Uraga outside of Edo Bay. Treaty negotiations with the Japanese were difficult and protracted, and Putyatin sent the ship on a number of survey missions around the Japanese coast. After the arrival of Diana, the diplomatic crew transferred to the newer vessel while Pallada was sent to survey the coasts of Korea and the Russian Maritime Province. While at Imperatorskaya Gavan on 22 May her crew learned of the outbreak of the Crimean War with Britain and France. Unable to enter the Amur River because of her draft, she overwintered at Imperatorskaya Gavan. In the spring of 1855, Admiral Vasily Zavoyko, who was also military governor of Petropavlovsk, surveyed Pallada and declared her unfit for active service. She was left under a skeleton crew until January 1856, until orders were received to scrap her in January 1856. As the ship was only at a depth of 20 meters, it was common for Russian, and later Japanese, divers to retrieve small items from the sunken vessel as souvenirs. ==Notes *Frigate Pallada in Japan and the Friendship Treaty between Japan and Russia Category:1832 ships Category:Ships built in the Russian Empire Category:Three-masted ships Category:Full-rigged ships Category:Frigates of the Imperial Russian Navy ","title":"Russian frigate Pallada"},{"id":"35263302","text":"Pallada on a port visit to Seattle in August, 2011.

It stands at the foot of the Touch Hills, on the south side of the River Forth. The house incorporates a 16th-century tower house, but its present form dates to the middle of the 18th century when the south facade was added, described by Historic Environment Scotland as \\"Probably the finest Georgian elevation in the County of Stirling.\\" The house is a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. ==History== The name derives from the Gaelic tulach, meaning hillock, and is first recorded in 1329 in the form Tulch. The Touch estate was the property of the Frasers; a tower house may have existed from the 14th century. Touch was acquired by Alexander Seton, kinsman of the powerful Seton family, in the middle of the 15th century, and in 1480 his son Alexander is recorded as 1st laird of Touch. Elizabeth Seton inherited Touch in 1742, and in 1745 she hosted Bonnie Prince Charlie at the house, a few days prior to the battle of Prestonpans (21 September). Elizabeth married Hugh Smith, who took the name Seton, and the couple set about extending their property. The architect may have been John Steinson, a figure who is otherwise unknown. The names of William Adam (1689‚Äì1748) and his son John Adam (1721‚Äì1792) have been linked to the design. Debts were incurred during the building of the house, and Hugh Seton continued to borrow money to fund agricultural improvements, including drainage works on the carse (floodplain) of the Forth. Hugh was eventually imprisoned as a debtor in Dover Castle, leaving the country on his release. His son Archibald Seton (1758‚Äì1818) joined the East India Company in 1779, and subsequently became a member of the Supreme Council at Fort William, Calcutta, and Lieutenant-Governor of Prince of Wales Island (Penang). Touch was managed in his absence by his brother-in-law, Sir Henry Seton-Steuart of Allanton. Sir Henry is responsible for the present layout of the parkland around the house, having commissioned Thomas White to prepare designs. A million trees are said to have been planted on the estate. Touch was inherited by the Seton-Steuart branch of the family in 1866, and was subsequently let, the owners living at Allanton. In 1928 the estate was sold by Sir Douglas Seton-Steuart, 5th Baronet, to Mr C. A. Buchanan. Sir Robert Lorimer was commissioned to restore the interiors. Touch became a convalescent home during the Second World War, but was subsequently reoccupied by the Buchanans. The south facade is topped by a pediment, carved with the arms of the Setons of Touch. The rear parts of the building date to the 16th and 17th centuries, including the tower house which stands on the eastern side. The 18th-century stable block has since been converted and leased as offices. ==References== * ==External links== *Touch House and Business Centre website *Touch House, Historic Houses Association Category:Category A listed buildings in Stirling (council area) Category:Listed houses in Scotland Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes ","title":"Touch House"},{"id":"35263369","text":"Jindu () is a town of the People's Republic of China situated in Zhaoqing, Guangdong, China. ==See also== *List of township-level divisions of Guangdong ==References== Category:Gaoyao Category:Township-level divisions of Guangdong ","title":"Jindu"},{"id":"35263450","text":"The Justices of the Peace Act 1547 (1 Edw 6 c 7) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

For this exhibition, Norris performed her 2012 work Untitled (2012). In this work, Norris paints a wall using her body as both the paint and the paintbrush. Norris runs a knife through a lemon, then cuts her tongue and while pressing her body against the wall uses the trail of blood and saliva to create a minimalist landscape on the gallery walls.

His father was physician William Mervyn Crofton, who conducted medical research at the Royal University in Dublin, wrote books on endocrinology and virology, and had flourishing private medical practices both in Dublin and London. His mother was Mary Josephine Abbott, known as Molly. Crofton was sent to prep school at Baymount, in the suburbs of Dublin away from \\"The Troubles\\", and then in 1925 to Tonbridge School in Kent. ==Education== In 1930 Crofton matriculated at Sidney Sussex College in the University of Cambridge, eventually earning an MB in 1937 and MD in 1947. During his studies he was a keen rock-climber, making frequent expeditions to the Scottish Highlands, and pioneering a number of climbs, one of which (the Cumming-Crofton route on Mitre Ridge in the Cairngorms) still bears his name. Like most Cambridge medical students, his clinical practice was in London, in his case at St Thomas's Hospital. During this time his family moved from Dublin to London and he lived with his parents for the first time since the age of nine. == Career== Crofton's first medical posts, in 1937, were casual posts at military hospitals: the Royal Herbert Hospital in Woolwich, and the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital. In August 1939, while temporarily unemployed, he arranged a climbing trip in the French Alps with friends; they were in Italy when they discovered that war was about to break out, and managed to get back into France the day before the border closed, and from there on crowded trains back to England. He then signed up with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in France, in Egypt with periods in Greece and Eritrea, and from 1942 to 1944 in Malta. He was then granted home leave and took up a posting in Northern Ireland, where he met his future wife, Eileen, also a qualified doctor. They married in December 1945, just three weeks after he suffered a broken nose in a car crash in Luneburg. Demobilised, he started work at the Brompton Hospital, organising a controlled trial of the use of streptomycin in the treatment of tuberculosis, coordinated by the Medical Research Council: an appointment arranged by Guy Scadding, under whom Crofton had worked in wartime. After a while he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Brompton.  University of Edinburgh At the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, Crofton was appointed chair of the Respiratory Diseases and Tuberculosis in 1952. In Scotland, he developed what came to be known as the \\"Edinburgh Method\\" for tuberculosis treatment. The essence of the method was the use of multiple drugs taken simultaneously to reduce the chance for drug-resistant strains of the tubercle bacilli to develop, this combined with careful monitoring of patients to ensure that they adhered to the prescribed medication regime. His team were able to demonstrate that mortality, and the spread of the disease in the community, could be reduced almost to zero if medication was properly prescribed and properly taken. The incidence of tuberculosis in Edinburgh declined rapidly, and Crofton spent much of the rest of his career travelling around the UK and the wider world attempting to get this message across. Alongside tuberculosis, Crofton's other main work was in preventing tobacco- related medical problems. In this he worked closely with his wife Eileen, who from 1972 headed the Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) organisation in Scotland. From 1963 to 1966 Crofton was dean of medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. From 1966 to 1969 he worked with Andrew Douglas on their postgraduate textbook, Respiratory Diseases. From 1969 to 1971, the period of student unrest all around the world, he was vice-principal of the university: during this time Gordon Brown (future prime minister) was elected by the students as rector. This had traditionally been a ceremonial post, but Brown decided to exercise his right as rector to chair the University Court. According to Crofton, Brown did the job very efficiently. From 1973 to 1976 Crofton was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.  International organizations  Crofton was chair of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) from 1984 to 1988. He helped write the World Health Organization's guidelines for the treatment of tuberculosis before his death. In 1998, Crofton was a founding member of a new UK and international tuberculosis charity, TB Alert. He served as TB Alert's honorary president from 1999 until his death in 2009. His support for the charity continues through The Sir John Crofton Fund to Fight TB and the Sir John Crofton Prize for TB Nursing. == Recognition == After his 1977 retirement from Edinburgh, Crofton was knighted. Crofton was the 2005 recipient of The Union Medal from the IUATLD. The Crofton Award, named in honour of the physician and his wife, physician Eileen Crofton, is given by the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland (REHIS) and ASH Scotland, recognising the \\"contributions young people in Scotland make towards reducing the harm caused by tobacco\\". Saving Lives and Preventing Misery: The memoirs of Sir John Wenman Crofton, was published in 2013 by Crofton's daughter and son-in-law. == References  External links == * Category:1912 births Category:2009 deaths Category:20th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:Irish military doctors Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Presidents of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh Category:Irish pulmonologists Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh John ","title":"John Crofton"},{"id":"35263651","text":"Kingsey may refer to these places: * Kingsey, a village in England * Saint- F√©lix-de-Kingsey, Quebec, earlier known simply as \\"Kingsey\\" * Kingsey Falls, Quebec ","title":"Kingsey (disambiguation)"},{"id":"35263660","text":"ƒåaslav is a Slavic given name, which has several spelling variants: ƒåaslav (Cyrillic: –ß–∞—Å–ª–∞–≤) in Serbian, ƒå√°slav or ƒå√©slav in Czech, and Czas≈Çaw or Czes≈Çaw in Polish.

The 11¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are appressed at the summit, which is slightly excurved. They are marked by rather poorly developed, almost vertical, axial ribs, which become obsolete on the later whorls. Of these ribs, 18 occur upon the second and third, 20 upon the fourth, 22 upon the fifth, 24 upon the sixth, 26 upon the seventh, 28 upon the eighth, 30 upon the ninth, and 32 upon the tenth, while upon the penultimate they are too irregular to be counted. The intercostal spaces are very feebly impressed, about as wide as the ribs. The spiral sculpture consists of strong and weak incised lines, the strong lines pass strongly upon the sides of the ribs and even cross the summit. The first of these strong lines is about one- fifth of the distance between the summit and the suture anterior to the summit, while the spaces between the first and second, the third and fourth, the fourth and fifth, and the fifth and sixth are almost equal and about two- thirds as wide as that between the second and third. Of the finely incised spiral lines eight occur between the summit and the first strong line and three between the first and second, the anterior member of these three being much stronger than the other two. There are also three between the second and third, the last two of these being closer spaced than the first two. No fine lines are apparent between the other strong lines. The suture is slightly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is strongly inflated. The base of the shell is short, and well rounded. It is marked by the feeble continuations of the axial ribs and 22 wavy incised lines, which are of varying width and spacing. The subquadrate aperture is moderately large. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is oblique, straight, and slightly revolute.

Within medical anthropology, Leslie focused most of his time and resources on studying the concept of medical pluralism, and Asian medical systems. Because of Leslie‚Äôs deep interest in Asian medical systems, it allowed for him to travel to many Oceanic and Asian countries, which is where most of his research on medical pluralism takes place. ::::‚ÄúThe structural reasons that medical pluralism is a prominent feature of medical care throughout the world are that biomedicine, like Ayurveda and every other therapeutics, fails to help many patients.

In Asian Medical Systems, Leslie draws attention to modernizing movements and their effects on lost medical traditions. In the introduction of Asian Medical Systems, Leslie describes Asian medical systems as ‚Äúformulated from generic physiological and cosmological concepts‚Äù, and ‚Äú...great medical traditions were relatively independent, they evolved in similar ways. They all became professional branches of scientific learning in the millennium between the fifth century B.C. and the fifth century A.D.‚Äù.Madan, p.4 Arguably, what can be considered Leslie's greatest accomplishment as an anthropologist, is his work. Which has been credited as the inspiration for work done by other anthropologists in the field, this can be seen no clearer than in the 2002 festschrift, New Horizons in Medical Anthropology: Essays in Honour of Charles Leslie, written in his honour by peers and former students who have been influenced by his work. This ripple- effect that his work has started can be best seen when comparing current work traditional and alternative medical systems and Leslie‚Äôs. ==Career in academia== Leslie has worked as a professor for many international post- secondary institutions throughout his career.

His research focuses on building scalable decision making systems from large sources of data using techniques and principles from the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. ==Early life and education== He is a graduate of the The Lawrence School, Sanawar, which he considers one of the best presents his parents gave him without realizing it. Dhar graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 1978 with a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering. He subsequently attended the University of Pittsburgh where he received an M. Phil and a Ph.D. in 1984. After he earned his doctorate, he joined the faculty at New York University. He worked at Morgan Stanley between 1994 and 1997 where he created the Data Mining Group that focused on predicting financial markets and customer behavior. ==Career highlights== Dhar is an Artificial Intelligence researcher and data scientist whose research addresses the following question: when do we trust AI systems with decision making? The question is particularly relevant to current-day autonomous machine-learning- based systems that learn and adapt with ongoing data. Dhar's research has been motivated by a building predictive models in a number of domains, most notably finance, as well as areas including healthcare, sports, education, and business. Why are we willing to trust machines in some areas and not others? Dhar's view is that there is a discontinuity when we give complete decision- making control to a machine that learns from ongoing data. This discontinuity introduces some risks, specifically those around the errors made by such systems, which directly impact our degree of trust in them. Dhar's research breaks down trust along 2 risk-based dimensions: predictability, or how frequently a system makes mistakes (X-axis) and the associated costs of error (Y-axis) of such mistakes. The research demonstrates the existence of an ‚Äúautomation frontier‚Äù that expresses a tradeoff between how often a system will be wrong and the consequences of such mistakes. Trust, and hence our willingness to cede control of decision making to the machine, increases with increasing predictability and lower error costs. In other words, we are willing to trust machines if they don't make too many mistakes and their costs are tolerable. As mistakes increase, we require that their consequences be less costly. The automation frontier provides a natural way to think about the future of work. With more and better data and algorithms, parts of existing processes become automated due to increased predictability, and cross the automation frontier into the ‚Äútrust the machine‚Äù zone, whereas the parts with high error costs remain under human control. The model provides a way to think about the changing responsibilities of humans and machines as more data and better algorithms become better than humans with decisions. Dhar also uses the framework to frame policy issues around the risks of AI-based social media platforms and issues of privacy and ethical uses and governance of data. He writes regularly in the media on Artificial Intelligence, societal risks of AI platforms, data governance, privacy, ethics, and trust. He is a frequent speaker in academic as well as industrial forums. Professor Dhar teaches courses on Systematic Investing, Prediction, Data Science, and Foundations of FinTech. He has written over 100 research articles, funded by grants from industry and government agencies such as the National Science Foundation. == See also == * Data Science * Predictive Analytics ==References * NYU Stern Faculty Page Category:New York University Stern School of Business faculty Category:Living people Category:Indian Institute of Technology Delhi alumni Category:University of Pittsburgh alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Vasant Dhar"},{"id":"35263740","text":"Scott White is an American television director and producer.

The series aired in Japan between July 1 and September 23, 2012 on TV Kanagawa, and was also simulcast by Crunchyroll. The series is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks. A manga adaptation illustrated by Tomiyaki Kagisora was serialized in Square Enix's Gangan Joker in 2012. ==Plot== The story centers around five Japanese high school students who are too young to be called adults, but who no longer think of themselves as children. Wakana Sakai once took music lessons, but she withdrew from music after losing her mother. Konatsu Miyamoto is a positive- thinking girl who loves singing and spends time after school at the vocal music club. Sawa Okita is a spirited archery club member who dreams of becoming a horse rider. Taichi Tanaka is a chronically late badminton team member who lives with his college student sister. \\"Wien\\" just transferred into Wakana's class after 12 years abroad in Austria. Music brings Wakana, Konatsu, Sawa and the others together into an ensemble during their last summer in high school. The story is set in Fujisawa and Kamakura, Kanagawa. ==Characters== Main characters ; : (Japanese) :Wakana lives with her father and her pet cat, Dora. Despite the fact that she is apparently very good at singing, she refuses to do so to the point of turning down Konatsu's attempt to recruit her into her new choir club. Her mother died when she was in her last year of middle school and hid her sickness from her to allow Wakana to focus on her entrance exams and not worry about her, but then she started living in regret for not being able to properly bid farewell to her daughter. When her father shows Wakana her mother' notes regarding a song she was composing to her, she finally manages to move forward and join the club as a regular member while dedicating herself to finish her mother's song. She is in the same after- school class as Wien. She aims to attend music school after graduation and follow in her mother's footsteps. ; : (Japanese) :A short, earnest girl who loves to sing and dance. She was previously affiliated with the choir club until she had a falling out with their supervisor, who did not allow her to sing after she had experienced a bout of stage fright the previous year's recital. After that incident, Konatsu began training herself by performing in the public park. She decides to create her own club so she can keep singing, but when it falls too short on members, she combines it with Taichi's badminton club to form the \\"Choir and sometimes Badminton Club\\". After graduation, she goes to college and joins a club there. ; : (Japanese) :Sawa is Konatsu's best friend. Apart from being an equestrian with her horse, Sabure, Sawa is also a member of the archery club, and is the first member invited by Konatsu to join the latter's new music club. She wishes to become a professional jockey in the future, which often leads to disagreements with her father, who believes her to be simply playing around. To complicate matters, Sawa learns that there is an upper weight limit for students who wish to join the equestrian school and is therefore unable to move on with her dream, even after her father agrees to support her. She drops out of school before graduation in order to attend an equestrian school abroad. Nonetheless, despite leaving Japan and studying abroad prior to the official graduation ceremony, Sawa is still allowed to graduate from Shirahamazaka High School. She is often seen wearing pink and gray headphones. ; : (Japanese) :The sole member of the badminton club, Taichi is a very serious yet insensitive person in matters regarding girls. He hopes to become a pro badminton player someday. Taichi is also good at singing. He is terrible at drawing, having once been encouraged by Konatsu to draw again before she saw Taichi's drawing ability and then told him to never draw again. He develops a crush on Sawa. ; : (Japanese) :Wien (German for \\"Vienna\\") is a returnee who transfers into Shirahamazaka High School after spending twelve years in Austria. Due to his time away, he is very unfamiliar with Japanese customs, and is seen always consulting books about it, with often humorous results. He is in the same after-school class as Wakana and is obsessed with a super sentai show called \\"Nettou Hero Ganbaraigers\\". He often writes letters to a young and sickly Austrian boy named Jan, who he left his Red Ganbaraiger toy with. However, in the anime, the letters show the name \\"Yang\\" instead of \\"Jan\\". After graduation, he returns to Austria. Others ; : (Japanese) :Wakana's father. ; : :Wakana's late mother, who died just before Wakana entered high school. She was part of the original choir club alongside Naoko and Shiho. She wrote the Condor Queen's best hit, \\"Amigo! Amigo!\\", which is also Konatsu's favorite song. ; : :Responsible for Shirahamazaka High's vocal club, who is put in charge of Konatsu's choir club after its adviser, the principal, is hospitalized following a bicycle accident. She is often harsh towards Konatsu, seeing music as something that should not be treated like a game. She was Mahiru's friend in high school and has not been able to get over her death. ; : :The homeroom teacher of Wakana and the other's class, who is currently on maternity leave after giving birth to a baby girl. ; : :Konatsu's younger brother who is often blackmailed by Konatsu into helping out with her club. He is a member of the student council. ; : :Sawa's mother, who enjoys surfing. Like Sawa, she has a bad habit of patting girls on the butt for encouragement. She was Mahiru and Naoko's underclassman in high school. ; : :Sawa's father, who owns the temple near the school where he lives with his family. ; : :Shirahamazaka High's principal and the adviser of Konatsu's club. ; : :Taichi's older sister who takes care of him. She is a college student. ==Media== Manga A manga adaptation illustrated by Tomiyaki Kagisora was serialized in Square Enix's Gangan Joker magazine between the June 2012 and November 2012 issues.

The title means \\"The Tale of Sulanjana\\", derived from the name of the hero Sulanjana as the protector of rice plant against the attack of Sapi Gumarang cow, Kalabuat and Budug Basu boars symbolizing rice pestilence. The Wawacan Sulanjana contains Sundanese local wisdom through reverence of rice cultivation in its tradition. The mythology in Wawacan Sulanjana tell the myth of the Sundanese gods, most especially telling the story of rice goddess Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri. It also describe the wealth of ancient kingdom of Pajajaran or Sunda Kingdom with its legendary king Siliwangi. It also to describe the agriculture nature of Sundanese people. The origin of Wawacan Sulanjana was probably oral tradition of Pantun Sunda transmitted orally by village's story teller across generations. The present copy of Wawacan Sulanjana was estimated to be compiled and composed in later period, around 17th to 19th century after adoption of Islam into Sundanese culture. It contains several traces of Islamic mythology such as the Sundanese gods are connected to biblical figure of Adam, also the demon Idajil connected to the Devil (Satan) in Biblical tradition. The present myth contain influences of Hindu and Islamic mythology. However, most of the mythology actually derived from far older pre-Hindu and pre-Islamic aspect of ancient Sundanese culture. Some trace of Javanese culture also present, such as the reference to the deity Batara Ismaya disguised as the old servant Ki Semar, and the mentioning of Nawang Wulan apsara that magically cooks rice. In 1907 Plyte translated and compiled the \\"Wawacan Sulanjana\\". ==Summary== The creation of the world The story began with the creation mythology of the universe by a single supreme God, and with peculiar connection to Biblical figure of Adam as the ancestor of Sundanese gods. these sections was probably added later to the original version in order to incorporate Islamic mythology and ideas after Sundanese people influenced by Islam. The highest God of Sunda Wiwitan belief, the Sang Hyang Kersa (\\"The Powerful\\") created the universe and also other gods such as Mother Goddess Batari Sunan Ambu, and Batara Guru (identified as Shiva after adoption of Hinduism). Many other gods were adopted from Hindu gods such as Indra and Vishnu. Batara Guru rules the kahyangan or svargaloka as the king of gods. Sang Hyang Kersa also created seven bataras (lesser demigods) in Sasaka Pusaka Buana (The Sacred Place on Earth), they ruled various locations in Sunda lands. The myth of the rice goddess Once upon a time in svargaloka (heaven), Batara Guru (in ancient Hindu Javanese is associated with Shiva), the highest god commanded all the gods and goddesses to contribute their power in order to build a new palace of Bale Pancawarna. Anybody who disobeyed this commandment are considered lazy and would lose their arms and legs. Upon hearing the Batara Guru's commandment, one of the gods, Anta (Ananta Boga), a NƒÅga god, was very anxious. He didn't have arms or legs and he wasn't sure how he could possibly do the job. Anta was shaped as a serpent and he could not work. He sought advice from Batara Narada, the younger brother of Batara Guru. But unfortunately Narada was also confused by Anta's bad luck. Anta became very upset and cried. As he was crying three teardrops fell on the ground. Miraculously, after touching the ground those teardrops became three beautiful shining eggs that looked like jewels or pearls. Batara Narada advised him to offer those \\"jewels\\" to the Batara Guru hoping that the gift would appease him and he would give a fair judgement for Anta's disability. With the three eggs in his mouth Anta went to the Batara Guru's palace. On the way there he was approached by an eagle (in some traditions, it is described as a crow) who asked him a question. Anta keep silent and could not answer the question because he is holding the eggs is in his mouth. However, the bird thought that Anta was being arrogant and it became furious and began to attack Anta. As the result one egg fell to earth and shattered. Anta quickly tried to hide in the bushes but the bird was waiting for him. The second attack left Anta with only one egg to offer to the Batara Guru. The two broken eggs fell to the earth and became twin boars Kalabuat and Budug Basu. Later Kalabuat and Budug Basu was adopted by Sapi Gumarang cow. Sapi Gumarang was accidentally conceived when a female cow accidentally drink the urine of the devil Idajil. Finally he arrived at the palace and offered his teardrop in the shape of a shiny egg to the Batara Guru. The offer was graciously accepted and the Batara Guru asked him to nest the egg until it hatched. Miraculously the egg hatched into a very beautiful baby girl. He gave the baby girl to the Batara Guru and his wife Batari Umah (Uma). Nyai Pohaci (sometimes spelled \\"Pwah Aci\\") Sanghyang Asri was her name and she grew up into a beautiful princess in the heavenly kingdom. Every god who saw her became attracted to her, even her foster father, Batara Guru started to feel attracted to her. Seeing the Batara Guru's desire toward his foster daughter, all the gods became worried. Because Batari Umah had nurtured and breastfeed Sanghyang Asri, she is considered as her daughter, and this means she is Batara Guru's daughter too. Marying one's daughter is considered as incest and it is taboo. Fearing that this scandal could destroy the harmony in heaven, finally the gods led by Batara Narada conspired to separate Nyi Pohaci and the Batara Guru. To avoid scandal and to keep the peace in the heavenly kingdom, and also to protect Nyi Pohaci's chastity, Batara Narada led the gods to plan for her murder. The gods collected all the most powerful poisons from all around the world and put it in a small container. The poison was later secretly put into Sri's drink. She was poisoned to death and died almost instantly. Her sudden death had caused guilt and fear among gods, since they have committed the sin of killing an innocent girl. This unjust act had incited the wrath of the universe and Sang Hyang Kersa, the supreme god that usually kept silent, punished the gods by sending the storm and peculiar harsh weather upon the heavenly kingdom. In tears of fears the gods took her body away from heaven and buried somewhere on earth in a far and hidden place. However, because of Sri Pohaci's innocence and divinity, her grave showed a miraculous sign; for at the time of her burial, up grew some useful plants that would forever benefit human beings. From her head grew coconut; from her nose, lips, and ears grew various spices and vegetables, from her hair grew grass and various flowering plants, from her breasts grew various fruit plants, from her arms and hands grew teak and various wood trees, from her genitals grew Kawung (Aren or Enau: sugar palm), from her thighs grew various types of bamboo, from her legs grew various tuber plants, and finally from her belly button grew a very useful plant that is called padi (rice). In some version, white rice grew from her right eye, while red rice grew from her left eye. All of the useful plants, essential for human needs and wellbeing, are considered to come from the remnant of Dewi Sri's body. From that time, the people of Java island venerated and revered her as the benevolent \\"Goddess of Rice\\" and fertility. In the ancient Sunda Kingdom, she was considered the highest goddess and the most important deity for agricultural society. The way to cook rice In the heavenly kingdom, Batara Guru ordered Batara Ismaya, that manifested on earth as Semar, to take these useful plants to the kingdom of Pajajaran and give them to humans to eat and use. Batara Guru also sent his daughter the bidadari (apsara) Nawang Wulan to bring cooked rice to men. Nawang Wulan was one of seven bidadari that sometimes descended to earth to bathe in a clear pond. They descend to earth using a magical colorful sash that enabled them to fly and travel between heaven and earth. When these seven apsaras descended to earth, their colorful sash took form as the seven colors of the rainbow. Nawang Wulan also can be found in the Javanese tale of Jaka Tarub. Nawang Wulan descended to earth and married King Siliwangi of Pajajaran Kingdom. Nawang Wulan magically cooked the rice by putting a single ear of rice grain into a bamboo container and magically the entire ear of rice was cooked and ready to eat. She kept this heavenly magical method secret and ordered everybody to stay away from her pendaringan (traditional cupboard in the kitchen contains rice container and cooking utensils). She insisted that nobody should learn the secret way of cooking rice. One day the King felt curious of the method of cooking rice and peeped inside the hole on the kitchen wall and learned the Nawang Wulan's secret magical way of cooking rice. Because the King has broken his vow, the magical way of cooking rice was undone, and Nawang Wulan had to return to svargaloka and leave her husband King Siliwangi. Because of this accident, Semar had to teach people the more difficult and laborious way of planting and properly cooking the rice, the traditional method as we know it today. The battle between Sulanjana and Gumarang Previously the twin boars Kalabuat and Budug Basu were born from the two broken magical eggs of Anta's tear, and fell to earth. They were adopted and taken care of by Gumarang the cow. Gumarang was a demon buffalo conceived through the urine of the demon Idajil, thus naturally, he is inherently evil. After grown up, Kalabuat and Budug Basu tried to find their sister and finally found Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri's grave. They circled the grave seven times and died upon their sister's grave. Meanwhile, Dampo Awang from across the sea came with his ships to the land of Sunda to buy the rice. Because the rice is sacred for the Sundanese people and considered as the gift from the gods that actually belongs to gods, nobody dared to sell it. King Siliwangi refused to sell the abundant rice stock stored in leuit (barns) in his kingdom. Dampo Awang was very furious, and in retaliation, he persuaded Gumarang the cow to destroy the rice in the Sunda Kingdom. The Gumarang buffalo took the body of Kalabuat and Budug Basu from Pohaci's grave and took them to travel, encircling the earth. Miraculously the body of Kalabuat and Budug Basu turned into various animals: pigs, boars, rats, insects, and all kind of animals that are pestilence to rice. The nature of Kalabuat and Budug Basu is to reunite with their sister through eating and destroying rice crop, which is why both are the considered as the manifestations of pests. To protect the rice, Batara Guru ordered his son, Sulanjana that was living and taken care by the earth goddess Pertiwi, to come to Sunda and fight Gumarang and the pests manifestations of Kalabuat and Budug Basu boars. Sulanjana also identified as Sedana was assisted by his twin sisters to fight Gumarang the buffalo. They fought ferociously until finally Sulanjana succeed to defeat Gumarang and the pestilences. Gumarang the buffalo pleaded to Sulanjana to spare his life. In return he agreed to help Sulanjana to take care the rice plants, lf Sulanjana periodically gave him the offering of fern leaves to eat. Sulanjana agreed and made Gumarang to work the rice paddy, and it became the predecessor of water buffalos that today plow the rice paddy to prepare for rice planting. == See also == * Bujangga Manik * Sunda kingdom * West Java == References == Category:Sundanese literature Category:Sundanese mythology Category:Indonesian manuscripts ","title":"Wawacan Sulanjana"},{"id":"35263909","text":"Destiny of Love is the second special album by South Korean pianist Yiruma. ==Track listingReferences== 1\\\\. https://web.archive.org/web/20120612050534/http://www.alexdang.com/2010/08/yiruma- destiny-of-love-2005.html Category:2005 albums Category:Yiruma albums ","title":"Destiny of Love"},{"id":"35263913","text":"Aftab Dar (, also Romanized as ƒÄftƒÅb DƒÅr) is a village in Alamut-e Bala Rural District, Rudbar-e Alamut District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It has been published by Shueisha since May 2008, first under their Super Dash Bunko imprint (which was abolished in 2014) and then under their Dash X Bunko imprint since. The series concluded with the 21st volume on November 22, 2017. It has been adapted into a manga series published in Shueisha's Super Dash & Go!. A 13-episode anime television series, produced by Diomed√©a aired in Japan on AT-X and Tokyo MX beginning in July 2012 and ended in September 2012. Sentai Filmworks released an English dub of the TV series in North America. The novel's story focuses on Godou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who was forced to retire due to injury, as he becomes a Campione after killing the god of war, Verethragna. Hanabee Entertainment later licensed the series on February 23, 2014 alongside From the New World and The Familiar of Zero. ==Plot== Godou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who had to retire due to injury, is asked by his grandfather to return a stone tablet to a friend in Sardinia named Lucrezia Zora. After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, Verethragna. After killing the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Erica, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular. Every time he fights a god, he kisses one of the girls he has brought with him. ==Characters== Main characters ; : :Godou is the main protagonist of the series and is the 7th Campione. He is a retired middle school baseball player (wild pitch injured and weakened right shoulder), after his grandfather asked him to return a stone tablet in Sardinia to Lucrezia Zora. Upon his encounter with Erica Blandelli, he manages to slay the god Verethragna, a Persian god of Victory. After obtaining Verethragna's Golden Sword and becoming a Campione, Godou obtains the abilities of Verethragna's ten incarnations: Gale (wind), Bull (strength), White Stallion (sun), Camel (leg strength), Boar (trample), Youth (divine protection), Raptor (speed), Ram (resurrection), Goat (thunder) and Warrior (Golden Sword). The Golden Sword allows Godou to seal the authority of a god, only if he accomplish the condition of using the power which is to have substantial knowledge about his enemy. He receives the information via kissing one of the female protagonists, which is the only way to infuse the information into a Campione due to their incredible magic resistance. This and ingestion are the only ways someone can have their magic, benign or malign, bypass a majority of the resistance. He is a little afraid of women due to being completely dense to their feelings, numerous interrogations and punishments from his sister, along with Erica's pranks and occasional blackmail. He tends to take what people say at face value, missing their intentions. ; : :Erica is an Italian girl who is member of the , one of the European magic organizations that inherited secret rites from the Knights Templar and is based in Milan, Italy. Their battle tactics and colors (red and black) has likened them to that of red devils. Holding the rank of Great Knight and the title of Diavolo Rosso (Dark Red Devil), she is a magic swordsman that through coincidence meets Godou and assists him while he was in Sardinia, Italy. She ends up falling in love with him. She uses her weapon Cuore di Leone (Heart of Lion), an enchanted sword that she can summon to her hand. She also has the ability to use the sword to summon a large silver lion which can attack in place of Erica in the anime. Her weapon can transform into a spear, lance or sword for offense, or simply a shield for defense. Its true form is that of a long, silvery, broadsword infused with the spell words of David which she must cast, giving it the ability to harm gods. She is able to multiply the Cuore di Leone, even after throwing it, or in its lion form. Whether there is a restriction on how many duplicates she can make, due to ability or power, is unknown but so far has made up to thirteen lions and seven spears. Her lions are infused with intelligence allowing them to act independently just like real lions, but under her control. Although she fares well against Liliana Kranjcar in martial arts as a knight, her magic expertise excels Liliana's and can be even be considered unrivaled in the areas of iron alchemy, fire, creation, transformation, destruction and reinforcement spells. Erica can use leap magic, able to boost jumping while in midair. She is an Italian girl who likes to keep herself in control of her own situation, thus she can be very forceful in her affection and jealousy. However, she knows her own limitations to be able to help and protect Godou, and she is willing to be open-minded enough to allow the other girls to become additional \\"wives\\", although she is to be recognized as his number one wife. ; : :Yuri is a dark- haired Hime-Miko (princess shrine maiden) under Musashino, an organization whose duty is to protect Kanto, handling the greatest tasks and responsibilities. She is subject to the authority of The Committee for the Compilation of True History, a Japanese government based magic organization, who aims to use Godou to protect Japan while minimizing his potential as a threat. She is quite harsh on Godou the majority of the time due to the misunderstanding that Godou is doing something lecherous, but is endured by Godou as he sees the self-sacrifice that lies behind it. Often called a Yamato nadeshiko, Yuri is clairvoyant and uses magic to heal and send knowledge to Godou. In terms of fighting level and physical stamina, she is the weakest, shown when playing sports, but excels at support and is unrivaled at information gathering. She is an excellent cook in both taste and visual appeal, and the head of the Tea Ceremony Club that God≈çu's little sister Shizuka Kusanagi is a member of. Like Erica, she falls in love with Godou when she sees how willing he is to put his all to protect others. Yuri gets upset when she sees Godou with one of the other girls, (which she misinterprets as flirting), or extremely serious she unknowingly smiles while giving off an extremely cold presence like a yaksha. ; : :Liliana is the Croatian childhood friend of Erica and belongs to the organization which is a mage/knight organization similar to, yet occasionally working but usually competing with, the Copper Black Cross. The organization serves the Campione Salvatore Doni, although her grandfather and some other members favor and support the Campione Sasha Dejanstahl Voban by preference. The Bronze Black Cross are referred to as blue berserkers. Liliana has been also been called the Sword Fairy and Blue Witch, although these seem to be more nicknames as she is rarely called either while Erica is called or calls herself Diavolo Rosso often. She possesses the sword Il Maestro, able to fight with great speed, excellent magic, and flying attacks similar to that of a falcon. When released, takes on its true appearance of a naginata, which releases spell melodies when swung that can disrupt the concentration of even the toughest of opponents, although since magic in nature it has limit, if any effect, on Campiones or gods. However, in naginata form the spell words of David are infused into it as well giving it the ability to harm gods. She is often compared to be on equal footing to Erica in both martial skills and combat, as well as known by people to be among the top of the current generation of Great Knights. However, due to her direct and upfront nature, she does not have the political acumen Erica possesses and is more gullible to Erica and Karen's pranks. She is also in love with Godou, but does her best to hide it from others. Usually covering up her desire to be in close proximity or help Godou with claims of merely serving her role as a knight or bodyguard. She is a silver-haired girl with a svelte body. Though she lacks the well-curved, voluptuous figure Erica possesses, her beauty is more along that of an ephemeral, delicate fairy. She is great at housework and cooking, is a descendant of witches, and has the hobby of writing embarrassing romantic novels. Her expertise over Erica is in flight magic, witchcraft, potions, communicating with plants and animals, and spells relating to water, earth, and sky. This allows her to make flying attacks similar to a sparrow, but with the ability to halt in midair, unaffected by gravity, before continuing her attack. This also gives her the ability to swim through water as easily as a fish, harvest herbs, cast hard spells and create difficult potions. She proved invaluable in not only opening a gate to the astral realm to rescue Godou and Erica, but the knowledge to create the potion required to be unaffected by the astral realm's environment. She can also summon and use the Bow of Jonathon, which is powerful enough to harm gods, such as Perseus. Although it appears she shoots four arrows at a time, only one is real, the others are illusions to increase the chances of the real arrow hitting. ; : :Ena is a girl with long, shiny, black hair with red eyes. She is a Hime Miko as well as a Yamato nadeshiko but with a figure similar to Erica's. She is the strongest of all Japan's Hime Miko, being specially trained by Susanoo. She is aggressive, impulsive, and has a tendency to ignore complicated things. Due to the harsh training she endured, Ena lacks a bit of common sense in everyday life, but this has made her an unpredictable fighter as she relies on instinct. She possesses the sword Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi and can draw power from it, becoming possessed in the process. However, she can only do this for short periods before her body starts taking damage. Also, if she takes in too much power, there's a chance of Susanoo's instincts or Ama no Murakumo taking control of her and running amok. When this happens she can fight on par with Campiones and gods alike. Erica considers her a threat to her position with Godou, due to Ena being another harem member with both a strong personality and a voluptuous, curvy figure; Liliana and Yuri are more submissive and easier for Erica to either manipulate or dominate. Erica believes that Ena can get close to Godou as a \\"guy\\" with her forthright nature before showing some feminine charm as a \\"girl\\". Due to isolation from society during her training, Ena is not very experienced with relationships in general. Although her mission was to seduce Godou, she knew that he was her soulmate the instant she saw him and has completely fallen for him to the point that she is willing to be his mistress as long as she can be with him. She misunderstands his wanting to develop their relationship slowly as well as his desire to become a man good enough for her as signs that she is not good enough to be his wife, which frustrates Godou as much as Erica's wild antics do. Campiones Campione, or God Slayers, are humans who have obtain the abilities of the first slain god called Authorities. They have enhanced bodies that can heal from even mortal wounds much faster and magic abilities which exceed that of the most powerful mages. They also have very high magic immunity which protects them from mortal enemy magic, but also prevents them from receiving beneficial magic such as teaching or healing. Thus, a caster has to deliver the spells internally through methods such as kissing or ingestion. The number of the Campiones are in chronological from when they first appeared, not a reference to power level or actual age. ; : :Voban is the 1st Campione and of Hungarian descent. He is a cold man whose only desire is to battle worthy opponents and obtaining abilities. His normal appearance is that of a healthy and athletic old man with gray hair. His true form is the appearance of a huge werewolf. Voban is the oldest of the Campiones, as he has defeated and usurped the authorities of Apollo and Osiris. He has the abilities to create severe storms, summon swarms of dire wolves, swallow sun-based attacks, turning people into salt with his eyes and summon the bodies of those he has killed to serve him. ; :Luo Hao is the 2nd Campione and of Chinese descent. She was a great figure who carried herself with royal splendor. She possess the full set of the five Confucian virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge and integrity. She was seeking a worthy opponent who could defeat her just like Verethragna had before Godou met her. Also, she believes her valor to be the greatest in the world, she places greater value on herself than anyone else on the Earth and is undecided on whether humanity is worth saving or not. Despite all this, Luo Hao is very observant of formality and propriety, as well as the rules of etiquette. She is able to control flowers, albeit harmless, poisonous or dangerous. With over two hundred years experience she has mastered Daoist arts which allows her to use techniques similar to European magic spells. Another ability is changing herself to a small lizard, although whether it is an Authority or a Daoist art is unknown. ; :Aisha is the 3rd Campione and of Alexandrian descent. She has the nicknames the Eternal Beauty, Goddess of Caves or Mysterious Queen of Caves, which refers to her ability to create a hole to another world and has the appearance of a cave. She is a beautiful maiden with black hair and olive skin, having the personality of a wanderer. The Authorities she possess do not have any combat potential, however one of the Authorities she received from Persephone allows her to share the energy of life with living things which heals even severe wounds. Although, if she has a day to prep she can flip the Authority's \\"spring side\\" into the \\"winter side\\", which can remove life, but Godou stopped her from actually using it the time she considered it. Another she usurped from a certain Catholic saint in the Catholic religion causes everyone to like her which helps keep her out of trouble in areas where the locals ostracize or treat strangers with hostility. Although if she does not keep the effect toned down or inspires a group of defenders too often then she could unintentionally create a cult that would lay down their lives for her. This is considered a most troublesome Authority by Saint Raffaello in that most of the holes link to the past. This is a problem in that any changes in the past could affect the future similar to the butterfly effect. The main problem with this Authority is that she has no control over what time period the holes open up to, and the holes appearing and sucking her in whenever she forgets about having the Authority. Also, the connection in time is not stable so someone entering the hole a few minutes earlier or later than another person will still arrive at the same spot, but days or years before or after the other. ; :Annie is the 4th Campion and of American descent. She also goes by the masked identity of John Pluto Smith. A serious minded individual, she only lets her feelings show when she is drunk. When in the armored form of John Pluto Smith, she acts much more relaxed and flamboyant. At some point the Smith persona turned into a semi-split personality, which seems to express all the emotions and stuff Annie has been heavily suppressing. So Annie and Smith are aware and know everything the other personality experiences, but thoughts and actions reflect whichever one is out. She starts to grow feelings toward Godou after fighting alongside him and Luo Hao, although she denies to herself due to the difference between their ages and Godou's reputation of being a playboy. Has usurped the Authorities of Tezcatlipoca, which requires sacrificing sources to temporarily transform into a jaguar, and Artemis, which automatically reloads arrows in a large, six-shooter revolver. Annie wears dark leather suits, rectangular half- glasses, with short fiery red hair. John Pluto Smith wears various cloths that present the proper atmosphere of a hero over armor that makes her look like an insect, primarily the helmet, and hides the fact that Smith is a woman. ; :Alexander is the 5th Campione and of British descent. He is also known as Black Prince Alec, leader of political organization Royal Arsenal that oppose Princess Alice's organization Witengamot. He looks like a young man with black hair. He has an arrogant personality, willing to work with Alice when their goals align on issues. He has the Authority of Fallen Angel Ramiel \\"Black Lightning,\\" an ability that grants him super speed. He can also turn himself into a lightning avatar made of plasma to travel even faster, evade physical injury and use lightning strikes. However, if the lightning avatar is dispelled, he will revert to his normal physical form. He also defeated the Minotaur Granting, which creates an underground labyrinth where he always understands the full layout and where his opponents are located, and the three Judging Furies, which returns all damage done in front of him back to an opponent using any physical or magical form of destructive power. ; : :Salvatore is the 6th Campione and of Italian descent. He has blonde hair and has a scar going around his right shoulder where it meets the arm He has a carefree personality, considered by most to be a complete idiot with no common sense and lacks magical skills. He is on equal levels with Godou Kusanagi as a Campione, as they had a draw on their fight. Salvatore is also notably hated or strongly disliked by the Campione Sasha Dejanstahl Voban, for stealing his prey that he had summoned specifically to relieve boredom. He is feared for all the trouble his antics causes and his utter lack of understanding and caring about serious issues, as he believes his scabbard is the solution to every issue. He does not see Godou as a friend or an ally, but an adversary. He therefore anticipated for a rematch, warning Godou about Voban entering Japan as an excuse for Godou to grow stronger and faster. He is a former Templar candidate, but failed due to abysmally poor magic scores and ability well below that of a young novice who never heard of magic before. He is considered an exceptional prodigy with swords and always carries one around with him wherever he goes just in case he gets into an interesting fight. The Copper Black Cross answers to him since his home base coincides with their headquarters. He has usurped three Authorities from the king of the Tuatha D√© Danann. Nuadha (Ripping Arm of Silver) allows him to turn his arm silver and gaining the ability to cut through anything. Nordic hero Siegfried (Man of Steel) provides a body of steel that cannot be damaged but increases his mass in proportion to how strong the protection is. Vulcan (Return to Medieval Style) reduces the technology level of an area to that of the Middle Ages for about half a day. His fourth Authority he usurped from Dionysus, which causes all magical powers to overload, activate and run out of control. His creed and spell words is that he will not allow anything to exist in the world that he can not cut. ; :Uldin is the 8th Campione and of Hunnic descent. He is a warrior, who is compared to Godou, due to similarities in personalities and fighting temperaments, possibly due to being an unrecorded and distant ancestor. He has a habit of acting on his impulses and therefore has a harem of women spread throughout the world, although he is apparently married to four of them, with Ruska (first wife) and Clotilde (fourth wife) making their appearance along with Uldin. His other two wives are at two other fortresses he controls. As with the time period feels that if he likes a woman it is okay to carry her off as she will eventually fall for him like the others anyway. His primary Authority that is used is Dragon Tamer, which allows him to control the dragons that he keeps in the forest near his castle. He also can turn dragon bones into an army of smaller skeleton dragons similar to the story of sowing teeth of dragons into the ground to raise an army. He is also known as Tyr's Sword due to having Authority of Tyr, which allows him to temporarily resurrect his army of dragons to fight again. Heretic Gods Heretic Gods, or Rogue Gods, are gods that come to exist in real world, rather than staying as myths. A human who weakens and killed a Heretic God single- handedly will gain their abilities and become a Campione, while Campiones can also kill other Heretic Gods single-handedly to gain more abilities. Killing a Heretic God who is already weakened by someone else or cooperating with other people during the fight to kill them will not receive any ability. Note that even if killed, Heretic Gods will resurrect later as long as the myth is still known among humans. ; : :Athena has a cold personality and seems willing to do anything to reclaim her lost powers. Her appearance is that of a young teenager with silver hair and black eyes similar to those of an owl. After using the Gorgoneion to transform herself into true her goddess, she was defeated by Godou Kusanagi and Erica Blandelli, returning to her youth form. She later returns to help Godou by offering information to defeat Perseus. In exchange for her assistance, Godou had to promise her that he would fulfill any one wish. It is stated that she lost her age and rank before becoming a Heretic God, so her young form appears to be a punishment of some kind. While she claims that she does not want anyone else to defeat Godou but her, she does seem to have taken an interest in Godou's growth and development. It is possible that, like Erica and the others, having watched and interacted with him she has started to develop feelings for him that she is not aware of or willing to admit to herself. This is shown when she sought his help after losing her memories. When she talked with Shizuka Kusanagi, it is hinted that her feelings towards Godou might be affectionate. ; : :Verethragna is an ancient Persian warlord who likes to fight and will do anything to challenge a worthy opponent. He has defeated nine other warlords and inherited their abilities. He meets Godou in the form of the Youth, but he does not remember his name or that he is a god. After seeing that Godou possess the grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus, he flees. After recovering his divinity, he forgets that Godou has the grimoire. When Verethragna attacks in Sardinia, Godou uses the grimoire to steal Verethrana's incarnation of the Horse. After being defeated, his powers were usurped by Godou, who thereby became a Campione. Being joyful at finally being defeated, he blesses Godou before passing on, along with a stern command not to fall to anyone else before their rematch. ; : :Perseus masquerades himself as a Greek hero, but he is actually the Persian god Mithra. He is known as the Legendary Dragon Killer, slaying any dragon he encounters but disregarding the consequences that come from killing the dragons. He possesses the Heroic Steel, being known in many myths worn to conquer dragons, which was use in rescuing and marrying any maiden in distress, allowing him to dominate and control any descendant of those goddesses and priestesses, as shown when he enthralled Liliana Kranjcar before Godou managed to break the spell since she loved him. Godou defeated him during the battle in a coliseum in front of an audience. Perseus was consumed by a shadowy figure, later recognized as Metis. ; : : Pandora, known to be the mother of all Campiones, appears twice in Godou's dreams when he is in the border between life and death after the Ram activated. She provides information, criticism, pep talks or even just small talk with any of the Campiones who either have just become a Campione, or died but have not yet revived through their Authorities. However, until the Campione reaches some level in an unknown aspect, most of the talk will be forgotten with only the subconscious remembering anything. Secondary characters ; : :She is a powerful witch whom Godou Kusanagi meets when returning a grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus in place of his grandfather, who had promised his departed wife to never meet with Lucrezia again. She attended college with and befriended Godou's grandfather, but she is able to retain the appearance of a young woman due to her high magic ability and talent. She has long, flaxen hair and voluptuous body and lives on the island of Sardinia. While living away from major cities she makes sure to have modern conveniences such as a refrigerator, air conditioning, and a computer with internet access. Lucretia is very knowledgeable about gods and magic, and also shares the same disposition with Erica Blandelli for always choosing the more interesting course of action and teasing Godou. Deciding it would be more interesting, and keep Erica from blindly charging forth with it, Lucrezia returned the grimoire to Godou to help him deal make an alliance with a Heretic God named Melqart to defeat Verethragna to become a Campione. ; : :Arianna is Erica's personal maid, chosen by her master due to her possessing interesting aspects. She has black hair and black eyes constantly wears a maid outfit, but she wears only a apron when wearing a swimsuit. Although smart, responsible and hardworking, she has a few flaws. She has extremely dangerous driving habits, her cooking is on a level to be found in any fancy restaurant, but any meals she cooks with a pot are considered awful. She has no martial or magic ability at all. While otherwise perfect, she will make a single unintentional major mistake every three days like clockwork. ; : :Karen is Liliana's personal maid from North Macedonia, who notices Liliana's feeling toward Godou and often gives her advice as a push, as well as making fun of her master. She has short green hair and constantly wears a maid outfit unless meeting Erica in secret. She secretly sells copies of Liliana's romance novels. Karen is someone Erica feels is good to have a long term relationship with, as she considers selling privileged information on the Bronze Black Cross as too risky and thus is less likely to get caught from overextending herself. Although she appears to be a teenager, she has already learned and finished equivalency exams equal to that of a college degree. She is apprenticed to and learning how to be a witch from Liliana. She also occasionally takes bribes from Liliana's grandfather to get Liliana to dress and act more sexily and less strictly. ; : :Shizuka is Godou's younger sister, who has short brown hair. She is a strong-willed girl who is suspicious about her brother's actions and fears that he has inherited their grandfather's lady-killer ways. Shizuka is aware of a multitude of girls, especially several of her friends, being fond of him but refuses to enlighten him about it. She worries that one day Godou will not only realize his extreme talent at attracting the love and affection of women, but will come to abuse it. Like Yuri Mariya, Shizuka often criticizes Godou, but it is a front for her concern for her brother. Since Godou's high school and her middle school are part of the same school complex, she is a member of the same tea ceremony club that Yuri belongs to. Shizuka is jealous of all the attention Godou receives from Erica. ; : :Hikari is Yuri's younger sister, who is Hime-Miko at the apprentice level. She, like her sister, is stated to be a descendant of a Divine Ancestor, a former Mother Goddess defeated and cast down from her divinity. She used Yuri's cellphone to call Godou in order to get help from him to put off a young man who was relentlessly trying to recruit her to being the Hime-Miko of the temple under his guardianship. She revealed he was of a high ranking family so she could not simply tell him no, she needed the aide of someone whom even a member of one of the Four Families could not ignore or override. After a bit of talking, they are convinced to take a look and see what Hikari would be getting into, and go to visit the Monkey King that is sealed within the temple. Once there, meeting the Monkey King, they were attacked by the Campione Luo Hao, who wishes to fight and defeat the Monkey King, and forces Hikari to start unsealing the Monkey King using the sword Zanryuuto. After a short battle, Hikari, Yuri, and Godou escape into another part of the Netherworld and eventually return to the surface with the help of Godou's Wind Authority. Hikari has the rare power of Disaster Purification, which allows her to cancel and negate magical effects and powers. This ability will not work to the full extent on the Authorities of Campione or Heretic Gods, though it can diminish their power slightly. She has a huge crush on Godou as she stated that she will follow him like Erica and the others. ==Media== Light novel The first volume of Campione! was published on May 28, 2008.

His father, a Scot, lived for some time at Reedness in Yorkshire, and became rector of Sutton-on-Derwent. Henry Johnston (died 1723) was another son. Jonston proceeded M.D. from King's College, Cambridge, in 1656, having been incorporated at Cambridge M.A. in 1654 with a degree from the University of St Andrews. He was created a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians by the charter of James II, and was admitted on 12 April 1687. He practised at Pontefract, but took up the antiquities and natural history of Yorkshire. Ralph Thoresby first made Johnston's acquaintance at Pontefract on 26 February 1682, and became a great friend and a correspondent. Johnston fell out of medical practice, moved to London in 1686, and became a High Tory pamphleteer. He lived at first at the Iron balcony in Leicester Street, next Leicester Fields. The Glorious Revolution deprived him of prospects. He died in London in 1705. He owned at the time property at and near Pontefract, sold by order of the court of chancery in 1707. ==Works== In 1686 Johnston published The Excellency of Monarchical Government, a folio of 490 pages, beginning with ancient history, and then discussing the royal power in England and its relation to the power of parliament. He largely followed Hobbes, and, besides much classical learning, shows considerable knowledge of English chroniclers and legal authorities. In 1687, in answer to a pamphlet of Sir William Coventry, he issued The Assurance of Abby and other Church Lands in England, the object of which is to demonstrate that even if the religious orders were restored in England, the possessors of the church lands confiscated by Henry VIII could not be disturbed. Johnston was answered by John Willes. To defend James II's treatment of Magdalen College, Oxford, Johnston issued on 23 July 1688 The King's Visitatorial Power asserted, being an impartial Relation of the late Visitation of St. Mary Magdalen College in Oxford. In order to obtain information, he corresponded with Obadiah Walker; visited Oxford with Thomas Fairfax, and talked to Anthony Wood, but his information was mainly from the royal commissioners. In the same year he published a volume of political Enquiries, and subsequently The Dear Bargain ‚Ä¶ the State of the English Nation under the Dutch, anon. ==Legacy== For thirty years Johnston studied the antiquities of Yorkshire, and he left over a hundred volumes of collections, written in a very crabbed hand. Johnston borrowed from the manuscripts of Roger Dodsworth. He intended writing volumes on the model of William Dugdale's Warwickshire and Robert Plot's Natural History of Staffordshire. Proposals for printing his notes were published without result in 1722 by his grandson, the Rev. Henry Johnston, into whose hands the collections passed. Edmund Gibson made use of them in editing William Camden's Britannia. In the Catalogi MSS. Angli√¶ (Oxford, 1697) was an account of 130 volumes. On Henry Johnston's death in 1755, ninety-seven volumes were purchased by Richard Frank of Campsall, Yorkshire, who allowed John Burton, to examine them when preparing his Monasticon Eboracense. These remained in the possession of Frank's descendant, B. F. Frank, and were calendared in the Historical Manuscripts Commission's 6th Report. The surviving volumes of Johnston's writings were sold at Sothebys in 1942 to the Bodleian Library and is stored under the Nathaniel Johnston and Richard Frank collection. ==Family== Johnston married in 1653 Anne, daughter of Richard Cudworth of Eastfield, Yorkshire, and had four sons, and a daughter, Anne. Of the sons, the eldest, Cudworth, was a physician in York, and died before his father in 1692. Cudworth's son, Pelham Johnston, (d. 1765), graduated M.D. at Cambridge in 1728, was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians of London in 1732, practised in London, and died at Westminster 10 August 1765. ==Notes== ;Attribution Category:1627 births Category:1705 deaths Category:17th-century English medical doctors Category:English antiquarians Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:Fellows of King's College, Cambridge ","title":"Nathaniel Johnston"},{"id":"35264379","text":"Jerry Donald Fisher (born March 1, 1942 DeKalb, Texas) is an American R&B; singer - Texas-born and Oklahoma-reared - known internationally for being the lead vocal with Blood, Sweat & Tears from 1971 to 1975, known to Dallas music fans for his R&B; gigs from 1964 to 1972, and known on the coast of Mississippi in Bay Saint Louis as one-half of the husband‚Äìwife proprietorship of \\"Dock of the Bay,\\" a restaurant and nightclub owned and operated by the two from 1976 to the spring of 2005, when they sold it a few months before Hurricane Katrina blew it away. == Pre-BS&T; groups== 1964‚Äì1970: \\"Jerry Fisher and the Night Beats\\" : Beginning around 1964, Jerry Fisher formed \\"Jerry Fisher and the Nightbeats,\\" a R&B; band that performed in popular nightspots around Dallas, such as The Music Box on Cedar Springs, Club Village, Gringos on Oak Lawn,Francis Paul Raffetto (1915‚Äì2002), Nightbeats to Open in the Music Box, The Dallas Morning News, August 18, 1967 and the Loser's Club on Mockingbird. The band also performed nightclub circuits in Las Vegas (Caesars Palace & the Thunderbird), Lake Tahoe (Harveys), and Oklahoma. 1970‚Äì1971: The Jerry Fisher Group, \\"Cherokee\\" : In 1970, Fisher formed a group composed of members of the North Texas Lab Bands. This 10 piece group opened at the Dunes on Ross ave. In Dallas. Fisher had been performing at Sammy Ventura's, \\"Gringo'sSammy David Ventura (1907‚Äì1997) Club Village when a pre-Christmas fire (1970) forced the club to close temporarily close, ending the gig. Fisher, who had been wanting to have his own club, was able to obtained the lease of Nero's Nook located at 3118 Oak Lawn. Fisher restored it, named it \\"Fisher's, and opened it January 8, 1971.\\"Phillip S. Wuntch (born 1945), Dallas After Dark: At Nero's, The Dallas Morning News, January 8, 1971 In the early 1970s, Fisher approached Earl Lon Price (born 1946), a saxophonist studying at North Texas, about being the musical director of a new band he was putting together in Dallas. Price agreed and recruited the players, mostly from North Texas, which included Steve Turr√©, who played not trombone, but bass. The band's instrumentation was: guitar (Kenneth Ray \\"Catfish\\" Renfro; 1948‚Äì1976), keyboards, bass, drums (Wilford Dahrell Norris, born 1946), and four horns (trumpet, two tenor saxes and trombone), and Fisher. Price arranged most of the music and wrote two songs for Fisher. The group worked mostly in the Dallas area with occasional trips to Oklahoma (Fisher's home state), and a month in Lake Tahoe. While we were in Tahoe, Jerry and Price flew to Los Angeles to play their demo for composer and producer Mike Post, whom Fisher had met earlier. After hearing the demo, Post said that the group sounded too much like Blood, Sweat and Tears. Price disagreed, but Post said that audiences wouldn't understand the subtleties that he was talking about. Post said that they'd hear a band with a lot of horns and a white singer who sounded like Ray Charles and they'd think \\"Blood, Sweat and Tears.\\" Price then grew discouraged about the band ever making it big, despite the fact that the band had a permanent gig at Jerry's in Dallas. Price also harbored artistic differences with the drummer, which led to Fisher firing the only two horn players left - Price and Fletch Wiley (trumpet), adding a female vocalist, and keeping the drummer who, one month later, joined Sonny & Cher.Earl Lon Price (born 1946), Memoirs of a Working Musician - Part Two: The Middle Years, ELON Music (2005) 1971‚Äì1972: Recording in New York : When BS&T; decided to replace David Clayton Thomas, Bobby Doyle went to New York and spent a few weeks playing and recording with the band. For one reason or the other, things didn't work out with Bobby, and Fisher was chosen as the new singer. Two of the tracks with Doyle on keyboards were recorded by Fisher at Columbia studios, and are on the New Blood album. Fisher, at the time, had a great blues band and was playing at his place in Oklahoma City. He was also recording singles with New Design, a subsidiary of Columbia Records, BS&T;‚Äôs label.Blood, Sweat and Tears at www.classicbands.com == Transition from solo performer to BS&T; == Fisher had a sizable following and was considered by one Texas music critic as \\"probably the greatest white blues singer in the business.\\" When Fisher joined BS&T;, he didn‚Äôt want to sing all the old material sung by David Clayton-Thomas. He wanted to join the band as a new singer singing new songs. The other members were pleased about that, wanting to move on with new material. But audiences wanted to hear the big hits, so BS&T; picked the most requested ones and performed them in concert along with their current tunes. After Fisher joined BS&T;, he was offered the opportunity to record a solo album for New Design; but he decided instead to focus on the BS&T.; Yet, for him, for everyone, all these changes meant time spent rehearsing and reorganizing instead of recording. In 1971 The band, through Columbia Records, released New Blood, from which two songs climbed to the top 20. == Post BS&T; == After leaving BS&T;, Jerry and his wife, Melva, spent the next couple of years biking and backpacking their way across the country.

The president of the exhibition was the lord mayor of London (then Charles Johnston) and the vice president Admiral Edmund Fremantle. Trafalgar related items included an item labelled as the quilt from Nelson's bed on board ship and a \\"scenic interpretation\\" of the battle and death of Nelson But in addition to Trafalgar commemoration, as the name suggests there were naval, shipping and fishery related exhibits. :Naval related exhibits included Captain Cook's chart rule and his plane table :Fishing displays included the opportunity to observe fishers mending nets and divers in a diving tank. :Shipping related exhibits included an eight foot model of the Empress Queen (which also appeared at the Glasgow and Franco-British fairs) and a village of Amerindians in which war canoes were shown. More actively there was the opportunity to take a submarine trip.

During this time he made his first experiments with 3D scanning as a form of sculptural photography. He undertook postgraduate studies at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago and Trinity College, Dublin, and in 2002 was awarded a P√©pini√®res Residency at Ars Electronica, Linz, where he developed his first works in 3D Real-time computer graphics. In June 2009 he began a six-month guest residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam. During 2012 he was Legacy Fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford, working on Exercise (Djibouti) 2012, a commission for Modern Art Oxford and the London 2012 Festival. ==Works== Gerrard's works concern themselves with the nature of contemporary power in the broadest sense, epitomising the structures of power and the networks of energy that characterized the massive expansion and intensification of human endeavour that took place during the twentieth century. Many works have featured geographically isolated industrial facilities that are a hidden part of the global production network that makes the luxuries of contemporary life possible. As Emily Hall wrote in ArtForum: > [Gerrard's] fine balance of concept, content, and material suggest a theme > and variations on the theme of the virtual. The computer-generated > landscapes bring to mind, of course, virtual worlds, video games, special > effects ‚Äì that is, ways of producing unrealities. Here the format manifests > something quite real, albeit at the periphery of most of our worlds ‚Äì the > discomfort of this admission is part of the work's impact ‚Äì since for many > of us, the arrival of food in our markets and the availability of oil are > things we take on faith, if we think about them at all. Their existence > remains provisional ‚Äì more or less virtual ‚Äì whether in life, on a gallery > wall, or on a computer chip.Hall 2011 Gerrard's works are constructed as simulations or virtual worlds, using 3D Real-time computer graphics ‚Äì a technology originally developed for military use, and now used extensively in the videogame industry (he currently uses Unigine 3D enginehttp://www.johngerrard.net/untitled-near-parndorf- austria-2018.htmlhttps://unigine.com/en/news/2017/artist-john-gerrard- presented-his-new-work-in-london). Although making use of advanced digital technology, Gerrard's work has been noted for its resistance to being categorised as 'new media art'.Gopnik 2009 Gerrard himself regards realtime 3D as 'a post-cinematic medium in which one can manipulate and interact with time in new ways'.Gerrard and Groom 2011 He has also said that the works constitute a continuing reflection upon his own time: 'these melancholic realms are in some way a road movie of the Twentieth Century, a revisiting of the extraordinary comforts and freedoms that I've experienced.' The eerie hyperrealism that characterises the medium, and Gerrard's choice of industrial subjects, has led some to compare his work with Charles Sheeler's 'precisionism'.Mackay 2010Smith 2009Baker 2009 Gerrard's interest in minimalism and postminimalism is evident in the physical presence of his installed objects, which are presented either as large-scale projections that often push the boundaries of existing technology, or as compact 'artboxes', designed in collaboration with Inseq, an industrial design firm in Vienna. Working method The production of Gerrard's works is a highly labor- intensive, collaborative affair, which he has described as 'very similar to making films, in that a group of specialists is assembled under a director to make something ... making these works is beyond the capabilities of any one person.'Wald 2011 Working initially from research documents, texts or striking images in the popular press, Gerrard uses the internet as a research tool, in what he calls 'image wandering'. This subsequently leads to exploratory journeys, during which subjects are often discovered by chance. Once a structure is selected for a 'portrait', the artist takes a comprehensive set of several thousand photographs of surfaces and surroundings. These photographs are used in the studio as textures for a reconstructed, hand-built virtual 3d model of the structure, which in turn is then placed within a 'virtual world' that incorporates the passing of time and other environmental elements. While they use the same software that is employed for intensively interactive gaming environments, the works offer the viewer no freedom of movement, and generally feature a slow camera path that orbits a silent, isolated scene. In relation to this movement, Gerrard says that his understanding of this medium is 'profoundly orbital. The works stage a world, in which certain set of behaviors have been put in motion. One of them is what I call an orbital camera, a camera that moves, at walking pace, around the scene ‚Äì the human presence: being there, the witness. And then of course you have the orbit of the year which is linked to the real and which forbids an easy, instant consumption of the scene, because it takes a full year to unfold in full. But then, crucially, this world, this reality, consists of one moment in time. Not an instantaneous moment, but the time during which I documented the scene' Recent works such as the Exercise series have increasingly featured simulated human figures, produced using Motion Capture, and have experimented with the use of algorithmic components to produce action within the work that is unforeseeable to the artist himself. Farm (Pryor Creek, Oklahoma) 2015 [2015] Farm (Pryor Creek, Oklahoma) 2015, by John Gerrard. Installed at Thomas Dane Gallery, London, 5 February ‚Äì 21 March 2015 In early 2014, following denial of access by Google, Gerrard hired a helicopter and produced a detailed photographic survey of one the key physical sites of the internet‚Äîa Google data farm in Oklahoma.Vice: The Creators Project: An Artist and a Helicopter Capture Google's Off-Limits Data Farm This survey was the starting point of the work Farm (Pryor Creek, Oklahoma) 2015. The work features a simulated \\"twin\\" of the squat building flanked by diesel generators and powerful cooling towers, as seen from a virtual camera orbiting the facility. As suggested by the title, the architecture of the server farm bears marked resemblance to Gerrard's earlier works depicting livestock facilities, Grow Finish Unit and Sow Farm,Thomas Dane Gallery: John Gerrard: Farm Gerrard states that he wants the work to pose the following questions: \\"What does the internet look like? What are the material qualities of the network? How is it powered? Do we consume this facility‚Äîor does it consume us?\\"Gerrard, quoted in Holmes 2015 Critical response included: > We don‚Äôt question where these things come from, they just appear, but > Gerrard wants to confront all of that. He wants to unshroud the mysteries > behind our Facebook feeds and push notifications. : ‚Äî Eddy Frankel, Time Out, 20 February 2015Frankel 2015 > [T]he effect [‚Ä¶] is more painterly than cinematic. It is like a 16th century > Dutch still life moving in very slow motion.

Installed at Lincoln Center, New York. Solar Reserve (Tonopah, Nevada) 2014 features a simulated landscape showing computer-generated images of a solar thermal power plant in Nevada, whose central tower is surrounded by 10,000 mirrors which reflect sunlight onto it to heat salt to high temperatures, forming a thermal battery which is used to generate electricity. Over the course of a 365-day year, the work replicates the movements of the sun, moon, and stars across the sky as they would appear at the Nevada site. The mirrors adjust their positions in real time according to the position of the sun. Over a 24-hour period the virtual camera view of the tower shifts, following the movement of the mirrors, from ground level to an overhead satellite view. \\"Solar Reserve\\" was displayed on an artist-designed frameless LED wall on the Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza in New York in October‚ÄìDecember 2014. Public response was favourable, with many visitors disseminating images of the work via Instagram (public images of \\"Solar Reserve\\" at Lincoln Centre). In June 2015 it was announced that actor Leonardo DiCaprio planned to donate Solar Reserve to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was reported that DiCaprio's donation to LACMA was linked to his advocacy for environmental causes.Burns 2015 Pulp Press (Kistefos) 2013 [2013] Pulp Press (Kistefos) 2013, by John Gerrard. Installed at Kistefos-Museet Sculpture Park, Jevnaker, Norway Pulp Press (Kistefos) 2013 is situated in the grounds of the Kistefos-Museet Sculpture Park, the site of a nineteenth-century paper mill in Jevnaker, an hour north of Oslo, Norway. Within a projected simulation, the original paper press operates continually, generating 'bales' of data using a physical modelling algorithm devised specially for the work. The bales are stored on hard drives each of which, when it reaches full capacity, is lodged inside the pavilion, thus providing a physical indicator of the accretion of virtual data.Kistefos Museet: Pulp Press (Kistefos) 2013 The simulation is housed in a 100m¬≤ poured concrete pavilion designed by the artist in collaboration with Dublin-based architects A2, with technical design and object production handled by Vienna-based Inseq Design.Inseq Design: Pulp Press (Kistefos) 2013 Exercise In a recent series of works under the collective title Exercise Gerrard has addressed what James der Derian has called the \\"military- industrial-media-entertainment network\\"Der Derian 2009 ‚Äì the convergence of media spectacle and military power, both operated through digital simulation technology. The work draws on sources such as the military simulation ARMA and the US army public media site dvidshub.Mackay 2015 Live Fire Exercise [2011] Live Fire Exercise, a collaboration with celebrated choreographer Wayne Mcgregor, uses Gerrard's simulation as a projected backdrop to McGregor's dance piece comprising a simulation of a massive explosion, and its subsequent fallout, in the Djibouti desert, which is used for US military training exercises. Critical response included: > John Gerrard's backdrop ... is both alluring and sinister. [‚Ä¶] Rarely does a > new dancework offer quite so many satisfying interconnections. : ‚Äì Jenny > Gilbert, The IndependentGilbert 2011 > Although [Gerrard's work] is of an African desert, it makes you think of > Afghanistan and Iraq. With the same blank dispassion of a film such as The > Hurt Locker it creates an alien landscape in which McGregor's six dancers, > in Lucy Carter's half-light, grapple with the choreography of conflict. This > sophisticated tapestry of movement is staggeringly beautiful, its pensive, > slightly mournful mood engrossing. It is dance for people who like to think > as well as feel, both abstract and real. : ‚Äì Sarah Crompton, The TelegraphCrompton 2011 > The contrast between Gerrard's film event and Tippett's gentle pastorale is > brutal in its irony, but McGregor's neo-balletic vocabulary, with its > anguished grapplings and cradlings, unites the two. These are the scorched > landscapes on which our privilege is built, these are the people who suffer > so that we may not, this is the human body in hyperstress. : ‚Äì Luke Jennings, The ObserverJennings 2011 Infinite Freedom Exercise (Near Abadan, Iran) 2011 [2011] In this public commission for Manchester International Festival, a virtual soldier in a simulated landscape executes an algorithmic cycle of gestures. Gerrard worked with a member of Wayne McGregor Random Dance, who was motion-captured moving into a number of postures that Gerrard took from photographs of military exercises on dvidshub. In the virtual world, they are triggered by an algorithm according to a set of rules developed in collaboration with McGregor. Exercise (Djibouti) 2012 [2012] Exercise (Djibouti) 2012 is the result of Gerrard's Legacy Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, an alliance between Modern Art Oxford, Oxford University Sport and the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, to mark the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The work draws parallels between the spectacle of troops being exhaustively put through their paces as the representatives of power, and the global, celebratory spectacle of the Olympic Games.Mackay (ed) 2015 On a simulacrum of the barren Djibouti landscape, two teams of computer-generated figures, wearing red and blue, the traditional colours of war gaming, meet daily at dawn to initiate a series of cryptic gestural routines. The figures represent a group of elite athletes who were engaged for the project during their training for the 2012 London Olympics and whose actual movements were subsequently digitised using motion capture technologies. Exercise exists in 'real time' (Djibouti: GMT +3 hours), orbiting over a yearly cycle that also incorporates the movements of sun, moon and stars.Modern Art Oxford, Press Release, May 2012 Exercise (Dunhuang) 2014 [2014] Exercise (Dunhuang) 2014 originated in satellite images that were the object of online discussion and speculation during 2011.Gizmodo: Why is China Building these Gigantic Structures in the Middle of the Desert?, Gizmodo, 13 November 2011 The images show a mysterious structure in the heart of the Chinese desert, a precise system of roadways the size of a small town and apparently designed to be seen from orbit. Gerrard commissioned an American satellite imaging firm to depth-scan these markings, and visited the site to document it photographically, in order to digitally reconstruct the entire structure and its surrounding landscape. Into this simulation, the artist places motion-captured simulacra of thirty-nine workers from a Ghangzhou computer manufacturing plant, clothed in the blue uniforms and elasticated paper bonnets they wear for their work.Gerrard 2015 The workers' paths across the grid are calculated and determined by the A* search algorithm, as used in GPS routefinding systems. The work is exhibited as a three-screen installation showing views of this process from three different virtual cameras: from human head height, from the point of view of a circling low-flying drone, and from a satellite's distant overhead perspective. When two participants meet, the actor closest to their goal continues walking, while the other must sit or lie on the landscape and rest. After a period lasting between 24 and 36 hours, only one remains standing. The process then draws to a close, the actors reassemble at the centre of the scene, the ground-level point of view gravitates around the worker who endured the longest, and the exercise begins anew. Animated Scene This series of works by Gerrard features virtual reconstructions of historical events or existing structures on the contemporary landscape. A dust storm approaches Stratford, Texas, in 1935. In 2006, Gerrard discovered several photographic images, from 1935, of a vast dust storm travelling across Texas, in what were becoming the agri-industrial heartlands of the US. The photograph became the basis for Dust Storm (Dalhart, Texas) 2007, a work that consists of a virtual portrait of the landscape as it stands today, upon which is placed a realtime animated 3D model of the storm, like a slowly unfolding sculpture. This work led Gerrard to investigate further the history of the Dust Bowl as a crucial moment of the modern industrial age.Gerrard and Morris 2012 Dust Storm (Dalhart, Texas) 2007 [2007] / Dust Storm, 2007 [2007] The Dust Storm works are virtual recreations of duststorms from found photographs, placed upon reconstructions of the landscape as it stands today. Upon the Exhibition of the work at Art Chicago in 2008, critic Alan Artner led his review of the Fair with the headline 'A New Medium Emerges', opining that 'Not many times in life can anyone see an artist pioneer a significant new medium. But that is what we see in John Gerrard's Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas)'. Artner continues: > Dust Storm unites a classic image from the Great Depression with a > contemporary industrial landscape, setting them in a cosmological orbit that > is completed over the full spectrum of a year. The exploitation of oil that > goes back to the beginning of the 20th Century is presented as the catalyst > of conditions that led to the ecological disaster of Dust Bowl. But nothing > is didactic. The pity in the subject comes to viewers subliminally through a > visual poem of complexity and power.Artner 2008 Other critical responses included: > In a strange reversal, Dust Storm makes our contemporary thirst for oil, and > an attendant blindness to its effects on the world, animate a historic > catastrophe in the panhandle of George W. Bush‚Äôs home state, a disaster that > was likewise driven by oil, rapaciousness, and willful ignorance of the > consequences. : ‚Äî Joseph Wolin, in Modern PaintersWolin 2007 Grow Finish Unit (near Elkhart, Kansas) 2008 [2008] Grow Finish Unit (near Elkhart, Kansas) 2008 depicts a pork production plant in the US midwest. Gerrard has stated that his visit to the Chinati Foundation at Marfa following the 2007 show Equal, That Is, To the Real Itself, and in particular seeing Donald Judd's 100 Untitled Works in Milled Aluminium, sensitised him to the recurrent forms of the pig production units he saw in the distance from the highway. Working with his partner Cesar Mejias Olmedo, he drove offroad to discover more about the structures, giving rise to Grow Finish Unit. Sow Farm (Near Libbey, Oklahoma) 2009 [2009] Sow Farm is a realtime portrait of a related agri- industrial complex in the midwest. A single transport truck pulls to each building every 156 days and waits for one hour. Behind the sheds lie large effluent lakes. In 2015 Sow Farm was accessioned to the Tate Collection. Lufkin (near Hugo, Colorado) 2009 [2009] Lufkin is a portrait of an oil-pump discovered by Gerrard during his travels. It is significant in the light of the foregoing Animated Scene works that the pigs in Grow Finish Unit and Sow Farm are exclusively raised on corn which is in turn grown using nitrogen derived from oil and gas, thus rendering the occupants of these sheds, in essence, oil-derived animals. In turn, the depleted landscape of the Dust Storm works was the result of the use of mechanised petroleum-powered ploughing and intensive nitrogen-enabled agriculture. Oil Stick Work (Angelo Martinez / Richfield, Kansas) 2008 [2008] Oil Stick Work is the first work in which Gerrard integrated human figures into his portraits of architectural subjects. In Oil Stick Work, the character Angelo Martinez paints one square of his barn in oil stick crayon every day. It takes the whole day, from dawn till dusk, to complete this action. To complete the task will take the entire thirty years of the piece ‚Äì from 2008 to 2038 (towards the end of the artist's own lifespan, as he notes in an interview.) Oil Stick Work was later shown for one full calendar year in Canary Wharf as part of Art on the Underground and has subsequently been exhibited in institutions globally. Cuban School (Community 5 October) 2010 [2010] / Cuban School (Sancti Spiritu) 2011 [2011]  The schools depicted in this work belong to a period in Cuba's history when the optimism of early revolutionary socialist models of housing provision gave way to large-scale mass housing models. Like Oil Stick Work, the Cuban School works include a single human figure, in this case a female caretaker who walks through the building once a day, at dusk, to switch the lights off. Critical response included: > Technology is the vehicle for this work, but it is not only the vehicle. > Through it Gerrard manages to invoke the history of landscape painting, > photography, and Earth art, and situates his work somewhere between > documentary and fiction ‚Äì between images that bring us news of places and > situations that are foreign to us, and the kinds of invention (ideological, > narrative, moral) that we undertake in order to comprehend them. : ‚Äî Emily Hall, ArtForum Early works One Thousand Year Dawn (Marcel) [2005] This realtime 3d work shows a beach scene with man staring out to sea. The rising of the sun within the virtual world is programmed to take place over a period of 1000 years, meaning that no viewer will ever be able to see the work in its entirety.Gerrard 2006 Portrait to Smile Once a Year, (Mary) [2006] As the title suggests, this work consists of a realtime 3d portrait of a woman, Mary, who smiles once a year. Smoke Trees [2006] A series of works featuring realtime 3d models of trees which have smoke in place of foliage. ==Exhibitions== Gerrard has participated in group shows including \\"The Space Where I Am\\", Blain Southern Gallery, London (2014), \\"The Everyday Experience\\", Irish Museum of Modern Art (2013‚Äì14), \\"Constructing the View\\", Irish Museum of Modern Art (2013), \\"The Universal Addressability of Dumb Things\\", Bluecoat, Liverpool, UK (2013), \\"Out of the Ordinary\\", Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington DC (2013‚Äì14), \\"0 to 60: The Experience of Time in Contemporary Art\\", North Carolina Museum of Art (2013), \\"Open File: Long Live the New Flesh\\", ICA, London (2013), \\"Pursuit of Perfection: The Politics of Sport\\", South London Gallery/Southwark Old Town Hall, London (2012), \\"More Real?

Leaves typically start to appear above ground in late autumn and are often beginning to yellow by the time the flowers appear, which in the case of O. scolopax is between March and June in their native habitats. The flower spike is very variable in height, usually tall, but occasionally up to . The number of flowers is equally variable, with as few as two or as many as 15 or even more. Each flower has the standard structure for the genus. There are three outer sepals which may be lighter or darker shades of green or violet, the lightest appearing white. Each is long by wide. The upper (dorsal) sepal varies from flat to boat-shaped and is bent backwards at the base and then curves forwards. Inside the sepals are three petals, two lateral petals and the lip. The lateral petals may be pink to violet in colour, or green, and are around long by wide. The lip (labellum) has a complex three-dimensional shape and is strongly patterned. It is divided at the base into three lobes, each of which is rolled up so that from the front there appear to be three tubes. The relative length of the three lobes varies; the larger central lobe is long and has a more or less upturned appendage. The outer sides of the side lobes are hairy; the margins of the central lobe are velvety. The rest of the surface of the lobes is smooth. The background colour of the lip is some shade of brown. The speculum is H- or X-shaped or even more complicated, usually a dull blue to violet in colour with a pale yellow border.

Demonstration farms are often owned and operated by educational institution or government ministries. It is also common to rent land from a local farmer. The leaser is allowed to perform their demonstrations, while the land owner can be paid for the land usage or may be given the resulting crops. Many demonstration farms not only have crops, but may also have various types of livestock. Various techniques for feeding and bedding are tested on these farms. Demonstration farms run by universities are not only used for research, but are also used for teaching purposes. The Ontario Agricultural College operates a demonstration farm in which students take active participation in their classes. There has also been an expanding number of demonstration farms which are used to test various forms of renewable energy, primarily wind turbines and solar panels. Model farms became popular during the Industrial Age, providing education to urbanized populations and encouraging improved welfare standards for agricultural workers. Farm buildings were designed to be beautiful as well as utilitarian, inspired by the ideals of the enlightenment. == Hofwyl: Early Example of Model Farm == In the nineteenth century, a combined effect of population pressure and the scientific revolution drove Western Europe to consider a fundamental revolution in agricultural training and practice. A number of prominent European agricultural experts, including the agricultural secretary of Scotland and famous agriculturalist Arthur Young, argued for the creation of institutions dedicated to agricultural experimentation. One attempt to introduce scientific approach to agriculture was the formation of ‚Äòmodel farms‚Äô across Europe. These farms served as experimental models, in which to develop and experiment with husbandry practices and technology. One of the most well-reputed and long-lasting model farms was Hofwyl, an estate near the Swiss city of Bern. In 1799, Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg purchased 250 acres of land and over the next forty years, created five establishments on his model farm, which he named Hofwyl. An agriculturist by trade and a moral reformer at heart, he sought to establish agricultural educational institutions dedicated to both scientific approach to agriculture and reconnecting individuals of all social classes to the land. His two most celebrated schools, the Scientific Educational Institution for the Higher Social Classes (1806) and the Poor School (1810) garnered attention and visitors from all over Europe and the United States. Through the establishment of an institution dedicated to the discipline of agricultural experimentation, improvement, and innovation, Fellenberg hoped to elevate his students‚Äô minds and improve society in general. He divided his pupils between two aforementioned institutions: the sons of rich gentlemen and affluent landowners, and those of the poor and vagrants. The Scientific Educational Institution for the Higher Social Classes provided rigorous academic and practical training in scientific disciplines deemed useful in agricultural studies, such as mathematics, chemistry, and natural history, while the Poor school sought to instill its less fortunate students with skills and manual training necessary for agricultural operations. The former group followed a rigorous schedule from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., covering not only the theoretical aspects of studies, but also training in practical gardening and husbandry techniques and immersive work with local peasantry. The elite students were encouraged to undertake self-activities such as student government, and also shouldered the responsibility of experimenting with and maintaining their land plots. ==List of demonstration farms== * Central Experimental Farm, Ontario, Canada * District Livestock Farm (Hosur, India), India * University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm, Illinois, USA *Belle Fourche Experiment Farm, South Dakota, USA ==See also== *J W Poundley and D Walker (Land- surveyors and Architects) *Leighton Hall, Powys *Thomas Coke *Wrexham Road Farm *Sturgeons House ==ReferencesBibliography== *Flagg, Maurice Irwin.

The primary interest of the company was the trade on the Swedish Gold Coast. The establishment of the pseudo Swedish Africa Company caused much astonishment in the Amsterdam city council. ==History== In 1648 De Geer's charter on exporting Swedish copper ended. Along with his son Laurens, and with a royal charter of Christina I of Sweden he founded the Swedish Africa Company, but moved its base from Gothenburg to Stade. The company was founded after Hendrik Carloff, a former high-ranking administrator of the Dutch West India Company, had offered his help, promoting his good relation with a local chief. Caerloff was hired for three years as commander and director at a salary of one hundred guilders and an ounce of gold per month to cover the charges. He was embarking on the Elbe and thence sailed to Africa. He arrived at the Gold Coast on April 22, 1650. Carloff signed a contract for the purchase of land with the chief of Efutu. There was a conflict with the Company of Merchants Trading to Guinea negotiating with Henniqua, a cousin of King of the Fetu about a British trading post. On May 28, 1650 both Sweden and the British signed a treaty with the chief. The English obtained the right to trade for only half a year.R. Porter: The Crispe Family and the African Trade in the seventeenth Century, p. ?. In: Journal of African History. 9, 1, 1968, ISSN 0021-8537 Carloff occupied Butre in 1659, Annemabo in 1651 and Orsou in 1652. On his return in September 1652 Carloff and his ship Christina were seized and taken to Plymouth. His ship was transporting about twenty bags of gold and 6,500 elephant teeth.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=55252&strquery;=Caarloff The gold rings, necklaces and bracelets were taken to the Tower of London. Meanwhile, his men started building Fort Carolusborg and conquered Tacorary in 1653. In Sweden Carloff was promoted to general and knighted on May 3, 1654 under the name Carloffer. It seems he occupied Jumore (Fort Apollonia) and Cabo in 1655. In 1656 Fort Batenstein was recaptured by the Dutch. In 1656 Carloff was accused of private trade. Johann Philipp von Krusenstjerna (1626‚Äì1659) took over the post of governor. Annoyed, Carloff left the colony and deserted to Denmark on March 27, 1657. He then founded the Danish Africa Company and recaptured Carolusburg from the Swedes. Because of the Dano-Swedish War he ordered to sell Carolusborg to the Dutch if the garrison entered into trouble. The establishment of both the Swedish and Danish Africa Company should be seen in the light of the mismanagement of the Dutch West India Company. This company went bankrupt in both 1636 and 1647, and was eventually dissolved in 1674.A more successful second Dutch West India Company was founded in 1675. Both the Swedish and the Danish company were founded by Dutchmen who tried to evade the West India Company's monopoly and used the company's mismanagement to make a private profit. The Swedish Africa Company was formally abolished in 1663, after the West India Company paid compensatory damages to the Swedes. ==References== Category:History of Ghana Category:Chartered companies Category:Defunct companies of Sweden Category:Swedish colonisation in Africa Category:Cape Coast Category:17th century in Ghana Category:1640s in Africa Category:1650s in Africa Category:1660s in Africa Category:1649 establishments in Africa Category:1663 disestablishments in Africa Category:1649 establishments in Sweden Category:1663 disestablishments in Sweden Category:1649 establishments in the Swedish colonial empire Category:1663 disestablishments in the Swedish colonial empire Category:Economic history of Sweden Category:Ghana‚ÄìSweden relations Category:Christina, Queen of Sweden ","title":"Swedish Africa Company"},{"id":"35265213","text":"Nesa (, also Romanized as NesƒÅ‚Äò) is a village in Alamut-e Pain Rural District, Rudbar-e Alamut District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Kinney sent it later to Liguorian, a Catholic magazine, which was the first commercial publication to print it. According to Timothy Kinney, the poet's son ,the poem was originally read at an ecumenical council meeting, after which the ministers, priests and rabbis in attendance requested copies of it.

It is a late 19th- century Land Fort, and one of six constructed around Chatham and Gillingham, Kent to protect HM Dockyard Chatham from attack. Originally proposed in the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom Report, published in 1860, it and the other land defences were omitted as part of general cost cutting with only the coastal defences on the River Medway being retained and completed under the original 1860 proposals. It was not until the mid-1870s that a revised programme was accepted, which included the construction of a convict prison at Borstal, Rochester, to provide low cost labour for the construction of a line of four forts, Fort Borstal, Fort Bridgewood, Fort Horsted and Fort Luton (a further three forts were constructed with the use of convict labour). Its construction started in 1879 and was complete by 1889 after much delay. ==Materials== The fort was constructed almost entirely of concrete, topped with chalk and earth with no visible concrete exposed from the outside, except from the gorge or rear of the fort. The ditch was protected by two single and one double counterscarp galleries. ==Armaments== Although the original plans of the fort proposed fixed armament, by its completion there had been a shift away from fixed armament to moveable guns. The fort would not been armed, unless actual threat materialised and then with moveable field artillery. In the event of actual invasion and an attack on HM Dockyard Chatham, additional field defence would have augmented the forts, with trenches and battery positions. In fact in 1907 during summer manoeuvres such defences were probably constructed. ==World wars== Deemed to have become obsolete by 1910, the fort formed part of Chatham's land defences in both World Wars. In World War I brick emplacements and a pillbox were built on the ramparts, and fixed anti-aircraft guns of an early type were installed (possibly 12pdr coastal defence guns on improvised high angle mountings, not be confused with the later naval version). ==The name== The fort was named after a local hamlet. Horsted is speculated to have been named after the legendary Saxon warrior Horsa, who was killed at nearby Aylesford while fighting the Britons. ==The fort today== The fort survives relatively intact and is currently in use as a business park. While it is in relatively good condition, its commercial use has seen some new construction and modification which has seen the significant loss of the original structure and features. ==References== Category:Forts in Medway ","title":"Fort Horsted"},{"id":"35265228","text":"Pij Bon (, also Romanized as Pƒ´j Bon; also known as Pƒ´ch Bon and Pƒ´chbon) is a village in Alamut-e Pain Rural District, Rudbar-e Alamut District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The film tells the story of Mark Lunsford, and his transformation from an uneducated truck driver to a child activist after the murder of his daughter Jessica by a convicted sex offender. As of June, 2016, the film is currently on Hulu, available to the public. ==Background== Before his daughter's murder, the tattooed, long-haired Harley rider drove a dump truck, lived with his church-going parents and spent most of his free time with his daughter. Jessie, as everyone in the small West Florida town of Homosassa called her, loved going to karaoke nights with her dad and playing outside in their mobile-home neighborhood. On February 24, 2005, John Couey broke into Jessie's bedroom and took her across the street to his trailer. He raped her, buried her alive, smothering her. After his daughter's body was discovered, Lunsford embarked on a journey to pass Jessica's Law around the country. It toughens penalties against sex offenders. So far, Lunsford has convinced 46 states to pass it. ==The film== The hour- long documentary follows Lunsford as he visits Capitol Hill and state capitols to urge lawmakers to increase penalties for persons convicted of offenses against children. The film offers a behind-the-scenes look at a single father haunted by the knowledge that a sex offender held his daughter within earshot for three days. Jessie's Dad was initially funded by a Carole Fielding Production Grant, along with a University of Florida research grant. Mark Lunsford, his parents and several other members of his family attended the 2008 screening of Jessie's Dad at the University of Florida. Lunsford and the film received two standing ovations from a packed theater. Green Apple Entertainment is distributing Jessie's Dad, which is available from iTunes and Amazon, where it has received an average rating of 5 (the highest possible). Lifetime and Investigation Discovery have used a substantial amount of Jessie's Dad footage in their programs. The film has screened in several film festivals, where it has won top prizes, and prestigious venues, including Columbia University's satellite campus in Paris. Dvir reflected on the film years later in an article in the Centre Daily Times: \\"As a documentary filmmaker, I change my mind about societal issues related to my projects much like kids experience growth ‚Äî I only notice it months, sometimes years, later. Directing and producing \\"Jessie's Dad\\" [...] altered my point of view on mandatory sentencing.\\" == Reception == Response to the film has been positive thus far.

It was granted Grade II Listed status in 1987. ==History== The current building was commissioned to replace an earlier town hall in King Street which had been used as a police station until it was acquired by the council in 1875. The new building was designed for Leigh Borough Council by J.C. Prestwich, who had an architectural practice in the town, in the Edwardian Baroque style. Work began in 1904 and, after construction works costing ¬£60,000 had been completed, the building was opened in 1907. Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as \\"An exceptionally good building, expressive yet not showy\\". On 18 May 1938 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the town hall and talked to a local soldier, Private Alfred Wilkinson, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War. The town hall was the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Leigh but it ceased to be the local seat of government when the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan was formed in 1974. After launching an appeal, the council secured a grant of ¬£1.3 million from the National Lottery Heritage Fund so allowing its contractor, Walter Carefoot and Sons, to start work in 2019 refurbishing the town hall and establishing a new home for the borough's archives as well as a new public searchroom on the ground floor. Three empty shops are also being converted to create new archives and museum exhibition space under the title \\"Revealing Wigan Archives\\". ==Architecture== The town hall, designed in the Edwardian Baroque style, has two main facades, its main entrance faces the Civic Square and another lined with nine shops faces Market Street. Roughly U-shaped in plan, the building is three storeys high with basements and an attic. It is built in Darley Dale sandstone ashlar under a steeply pitched Westmorland green slate roof with a belvedere and ornamental cupola. The three-storey main facade has eight bays of which bays two to eight are symmetrical demarcated by flat pilasters extending from ground level to the roof cornice and from first-floor level, blocked columns with Ionic capitals. The ground floor is solid and plain with an elaborate entrance porch which has paired, blocked columns with Ionic capitals supporting a semi- circular pediment bearing the borough's sculptured coat of arms. The first bay has a glazed door with a pediment above and balcony with a stone balustrade to a first-floor committee room. The balcony is supported on scrolled brackets with acanthus leaves and a carved figure. To the left of the first bay is an octagonal corner turret rising from a carved base surmounted by a dome. The Market Street elevation is symmetrical with seven bays of which the end bays have gables and oriel windows at first floor level and a round window on the second floor. There is a smaller bow window in the central bay. Inside is a large entrance hall with scagliola columns and an imperial staircase which accesses the council chamber and mayor's parlour on the first floor. The council chamber has stained glass windows representing some of the town's industries and there are coats of arms on the staircase windows all by H. Gustave Hiller.

Initially a single division, in 1936 a second division was created, initially named the Provincial League, but becoming National League Division Two in 1938. When league racing resumed after World War II, there was initially a single division. Six clubs started a new grass roots Northern League that year, and with more tracks opening up, the National League expanded to three divisions in 1947. For several reasons, including the levels of Entertainment tax and competition for audiences from television, a number of teams ceased to be profitable and the league reverted to two divisions in 1954. Further withdrawals led to a reduction to a single eleven-team division in 1957. Continuing reduction in spectator numbers, and dissatisfaction with the way speedway was structured and managed led several promoters (including Mike Parker, Reg Fearman, and Johnnie Hoskins) to create the breakaway Provincial League in 1960. Working within tighter budgets, they were nevertheless more successful commercially than the National League promotions. After relations between the two leagues broke down in 1963, an RAC commission led to the two leagues merging in 1965 to form the British League. The National League name was revived in 1975 when the British League Division Two was renamed, initially to the New National League. The name was reused again for the third tier of British speedway from 2009. ==Champions== {  style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" ! Season ! Champions !

Born in New York and raised in Portland, Maine, he worked in Boston and Haiti before starting teaching in New Orleans, Louisiana before the end of the American Civil War. Moving to Galveston, Texas in 1866, where he worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, Ruby also organized for the new Republican Party. He served as one of ten African Americans elected to the 1868-69 state constitutional convention,\\"The 1860s: George T. Ruby\\", Forever Freedom exhibit, Texas State Library and Archives, 2017 in the Texas senate, and as a delegate to two Republican Party national conventions. At the first he was the only African American delegate from Texas. He also was active with labor unions, founding and serving as president of the Texas Colored Labor Convention. He earned a reputation as an educator of Louisiana blacks, returning to New Orleans in 1874 after the white Democratic takeover of the Texas government. He worked as a journalist in that city. ==Career== Ruby was born in New York City in 1841. His parents were probably the Rev. Ebenezer Ruby and Jemima Ruby, though their son would claim that his father was an aristocratic white man. He was visibly of mixed race.Carl H. Moneyhon, \\"George T. Ruby and the Politics of Expediency in Texas,\\" in Howard N. Rabinowitz, ed., Southern Black Leaders of the Reconstruction Era (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1982), 363. Ruby grew up as a child with his family just outside Portland, Maine, where he had his schooling. Moving to Boston as a young man in 1860, he was hired as a correspondent on the Pine and Palm, run by James Redpath, and sent as a correspondent to Haiti. Redpath's journal supported a movement encouraging African-American colonization in Haiti (which the government there encouraged.) American migrants suffered from the poor economy and the plan was considered a failure in 1862. Ruby returned that year to the United States. In January 1864, Ruby moved to Louisiana and began teaching school. First he taught in a Baptist church in New Orleans and then, as the Union occupation force expanded its educational efforts into the hinterland, in St. Bernard's Parish. The army dropped its responsibility for schooling at the war's end. The American Missionary Association needed teachers, and Ruby worked for them in New Orleans. When the Freedmen's Bureau schools started up, he was hired to teach there. In 1866, he went to Jacksboro in East Feliciana Parish to open a Bureau school there. A white mob attacked him and tried to drive him out.Moneyhon, \\"George T. Ruby and the Politics of Expediency in Texas,\\" p. 364. ==Texas politics== In September 1866, with Louisiana schools shutting down for lack of funding, Ruby left for Texas. The Freedmen's Bureau agent assigned him as agent and teacher in Galveston. (This was not unusual; many black teachers with experience in Louisiana migrated to Texas, where their past association ensured that they had colleagues in their new surroundings). Working to set up and run schools for blacks, Ruby also helped organize local chapters of the Union League on which mobilization for the newly created Republican party would depend. In 1868, he was elected the League's first state president, a powerful political position. Later that year, he was the first African-American from Texas to attend the Republican National Convention. In time he became editor of the Galveston Standard. Like many Republican papers, it had a brief life. Provisional Governor Elisha M. Pease appointed Ruby as a notary public in Galveston. When elections took place for delegates to a state constitutional convention in 1868, Ruby was chosen for the district comprising Brazoria, Galveston, and Matagorda counties. He was one of ten African Americans elected as delegates. He allied with the more radical end of the party. Deeply disturbed by the conservative compromises that made it into the final document, Ruby worked for some months to have it defeated or rejected by the national government. In the end, he accepted it as the best that could be done, if a Republican government was to survive at all. He believed that equal rights for blacks in Texas depended on a Republican government.Eric Foner, Freedom's Lawmakers: A Directory of Black Officeholders during Reconstruction(Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1996), 187Moneyhon, \\"George T. Ruby and the Politics of Expediency in Texas,\\" pp 370-71. Although discussed as a possible running-mate for Republican gubernatorial nominee Edmund J. Davis, Ruby was far younger at age 28 than would have been the norm. In addition, Republicans were reluctant to nominate a black candidate, because of the risk of driving away white votes. Blacks were a minority statewide. In 1870, he was first elected to the Texas Senate in a very close vote, where he served two terms, in 1870-71 and again in 1873. He pressed hard for bills protecting the freedpeople's civil rights, including a measure opening public conveyances to all, regardless of race‚Äîa bill that white members made sure never came to a vote. At the same time, with an eye to his largely white constituency, Ruby introduced bills supporting construction of railroads radiating from Galveston, including several transcontinental projects such as the Southern Pacific and the International & Great Northern. Railroad aid was not a win-win deal; money or lands appropriated to help out their projects came at the expense of other needs of the state, such as a well-financed public school system.Moneyhon, \\"George T. Ruby and the Politics of Expediency in Texas,\\" pp 380-82. He served as a delegate to two Republican Party national conventions, the first time as the only African American from Texas. He was also appointed as a customs officer in Galveston in 1869. With close connections to labor organizations in Galveston and as president of the Texas Colored Labor Convention in 1869, Ruby had influence far beyond Galveston. He also helped black workers gain jobs at the Galveston docks after 1870. One historian called Ruby, \\"the most important black politician in Texas during Reconstruction in terms of power and ability.\\" He had an ability to mobilize Republican voters along the Gulf Coast and black voters everywhere in Texas.Eric Foner, Freedom's Lawmakers: A Directory of Black Officeholders during Reconstruction(Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1996), 187. \\"In the post-Civil War era no black man in Texas exercised more political power than did George Thompson Ruby,\\" Moneyhon wrote. \\"An astute politician, Ruby built a base of power in the black community of Galveston, then used that support to make himself a major force in the state at large. He was a forceful advocate of civil and political rights for his race, but he knew when to compromise to gain his larger goals, and he moved carefully among hostile white politicians in his efforts to expand opportunities for black people.\\"Moneyhon, \\"George T. Ruby and the Politics of Expediency in Texas,\\" p. 363. ==Return to Louisiana and journalism== With the return of the Democrats to power in 1874, Ruby left Texas and returned to Louisiana. He found work on the New Orleans Louisianian, a black Republican newspaper edited by Louisiana's former lieutenant-governor, Pinckney B. S. Pinchback. He gained a job in the New Orleans custom-house, but Ruby's main occupation was newspaper work. He worked with Pinchback's paper until 1878. That year he became editor of the New Orleans Observer, a paper which he established, operating it through the 1880 election. After its demise, he began another, the New Orleans Republic. In the late 1870s, Ruby became a strong supporter of the Exoduster movement. It supported the voluntary migration of freedmen from the Deep South to Kansas, in order to escape segregation, violence and white supremacy. Still an influential spokesperson for black interests in Louisiana, Ruby died on October 31, 1882 of malaria at his home on Euterpe Street, New Orleans.Moneyhon, \\"George T.

Shildt became the manager of the Johnson City Cardinals, the Cardinals Short Season A affiliate, in 2009, along with his scouting duties. He was promoted as manager of the Cardinals AA affiliate, the Springfield Cardinals, in 2011. He joined the major league coaching staff in 2017 and became manager in 2018 after the dismissal of Mike Matheny. On July 15, 2018, he collected his first managerial win in a 6‚Äì4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. On October 9, 2019, he led his team to a 13-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves to win the NLDS. ==Early career== Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Shildt played high school baseball at Olympic High School and college baseball for University of North Carolina (UNC) Asheville Bulldogs. After his playing career ended as he \\"couldn't hit a curve ball\\", Shildt became a coach at West Charlotte High School where he helped bring the baseball team their 1st winning season in 20 years, After leaving the high school, Shildt was hired by UNC Charlotte to become an assistant coach for the Charlotte 49ers baseball team. He held the position for five years. During the off-season he owned a baseball training facility in North Carolina, becoming a full-time baseball instructor to area youths. ==St. Louis Cardinals system== Shildt started his Major League Baseball career as an associate scout with the league for three seasons. He moved on to the Cardinals organization, working as the area scout for North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. On a recommendation from future Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak, Shildt began his minor league coaching career as a part-time coach. Shildt was sent to the Cardinals' Single-A affiliate in the New York‚ÄìPenn League. He was a part-time coach during 2004 and 2005, while continuing his scouting duties. He was promoted to a full-time coaching position in 2006, and kept coaching with the single A affiliate until the 2007 season. In 2008, Shildt coordinated the Cardinals' minor league spring training workout camp. Afterwards he became the hitting coach for the Johnson City Cardinals for the 2008 season. Shildt was promoted to manage Johnson City in 2009, where he finished with a 37‚Äì30 record. In his second season, Johnson City posted a 42‚Äì24 win-loss record, and after defeating its two playoff opponents, won the Appalachian League championship. For his effort, Shildt was named St. Louis Cardinals Minor League Manager of the Year by Scout.com. He was also named the Appalachian League Manager of the Year. Among the players he helped improve during the season include Appalachian League's Pitcher of the Year Ryan Copeland, and batting average champion Phil Cerreto. After Johnson City's season ended, Shildt was invited to spend some time on the St. Louis Cardinals roster in order to gain experience. After the season, Shildt was awarded the Appalachian League Manager of the Year award, and the George Kissell Award for his \\"excellence in player development\\" by the St. Louis Cardinals organization. Johnson City repeated as league champions in 2011 under Shildt. It was the first time that Johnson City clinched two consecutive league championships since 1975‚Äì1976. Shildt went on to manage the Springfield Cardinals (AA) for three seasons. Shildt guided Springfield to its first Texas League Championship before being recognized as Baseball America's Team of the Year in 2012. Following two seasons as the manager for the Memphis Redbirds (AAA), Shildt was again promoted in 2017, this time to the MLB team, as the quality control coach. After a rough start to the 2017 season, third base coach Chris Maloney was reassigned in the organization, and Shildt became the full-time Cardinals third base coach for the rest of the 2017 season. When Jos√© Oquendo was brought back for the 2018 season to be the St. Louis Cardinals third base coach, Shildt became the team's bench coach for the 2018 season. On July 14, 2018, Shildt was made interim manager of the Cardinals following the firing of Mike Matheny. He became only the eighth man to manage a Major League Baseball team despite not having ever played professional baseball at any level. Bob Nightengale of USA Today tweeted on August 28, 2018 that the team would remove the interim tag from Shildt's title and name him the club's permanent manager, awarding him a 3-year contract. Shildt won his 100th game as Cardinals manager with a 6‚Äì2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 9, 2019, his 51st birthday. Following a 3‚Äì2 win over the Chicago Cubs on September 22, 2019, the Cardinals clinched a playoff berth for the first time in Shildt's career as manager, and the first for the team since 2015. ==Managerial record== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season !! colspan=\\"4\\"Postseason - !Games!!Won!!Lost!!Win %!!Finish!!

It had an estimated seismic moment of 3.8 x 1028 dyn cm‚àí1, equivalent to a magnitude of 8.35 on the moment magnitude scale. This earthquake was followed thirty minutes later by the 1906 Valpara√≠so earthquake in Chile, but the two events are not thought to be linked. Due to the remote location, there are no reports of damage associated with this earthquake. A transpacific tsunami reported from Japan and Hawaii was triggered by the Chilean event, rather than the Aleutian Islands earthquake. ==Tectonic setting== The Aleutian Islands are a volcanic arc lying above the convergent boundary where the Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the North American Plate. Earthquakes in the area are caused by movement along the plate interface (such as the 1965 Rat Islands earthquake), normal faulting within the outer rise and within the subducting slab. The earthquake's epicenter lies close to a major break in the Aleutian chain, between the Andreanof Islands to the east and the Rat Islands to the west, along what is known as the Amchitka channel. In this region there is evidence for a tear in the lithosphere of the descending slab. It is thought that this tear is caused by the unusually sharp curvature of this part of the arc coupled with the interaction of Bowers Ridge in the over-riding plate with the subduction zone. ==Earthquake characteristics== Analysis of this earthquake using modern techniques has been possible due to the large collection of seismograms recording this event published in 1907. They came from 78 stations around the world and included details of the characteristics of the individual seismometers. The focal mechanism of the earthquake has been determined from the seismograms as a normal faulting event within the subducting slab, with a large component of left-lateral strike-slip faulting. A tsunami was recorded in both Japan and Hawaii in the hours following the earthquake. A run-up of reported from Maui was too early to be related to either of the earthquakes. Based on the estimated focal mechanism of the Aleutian Islands event and the timing of the observed run-ups, the tsunami is thought to have resulted from the earthquake in Chile. ==Relationship to the 1906 Valpara√≠so earthquake== The short time interval between these two major earthquake has raised the possibility of the event in Chile being triggered in some way by the earlier earthquake in the Aleutian Islands, particularly as the later event occurred during the passage of the wavefronts of its body waves through the epicentral area. However, this is regarded as most likely coincidental. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in 1906 *List of earthquakes in Alaska *List of earthquakes in the United States ==References * Category:1906 earthquakes Aleutian 1906 Aleutian Islands earthquake Category:1906 tsunamis Category:August 1906 events ","title":"1906 Aleutian Islands earthquake"},{"id":"35266080","text":"\\"Sticky Icky\\" is a song by American rapper Pitbull featuring Jim Jones.

EAC's 40 employed staff and 300 volunteers work with researchers, policymakers, and the community toward sustainability in seven focus areas: Built Environment, Coastal and Water, Wilderness, Food Action, Marine, Transportation, and Energy . The EAC has received numerous commendations for its evidence-based programs and policy work, including winning The Coast's award for Best Activist Organization each year from 2004-2016, being named one of Tides Canada's Top 10 in both 2003 and 2010, winning an Arthur Kroeger Award for Public Affairs in 2009, and being named one of the Globe and Mail's 10 best-run charities in Canada in 2000. EAC's Fern Lane headquarters underwent largely volunteer-implemented renovations from 2015-2016, incorporating salvaged materials and green building technologies to increase energy efficiency . == Mission and vision == EAC describes their vision as \\"a society in Nova Scotia that respects and protects nature and provides environmentally and economically sustainable solutions for its citizens\\". Operating from both ecological and social justice perspectives, the organization advocates for innovative, grassroots approaches to environmental issues. Category:Think tanks based in Canada Category:Environmental organizations based in Canada ==History== Origins The Ecology Action Centre (EAC) was started in 1971 by a small group of Dalhousie students with help of several government grants. Originally it had two main goals: to promote recycling in Halifax, and to be a source of environmental information for the public. The EAC‚Äôs first recycling project began in 1972 with a recycling depot that operated every Saturday from Jan. 1972 to Feb. 1975, recycling approximately one ton of paper each week. Today, Nova Scotia has a waste diversion rate higher than any industrialized nation. Early environmental education programs included lectures, a regular newsletter, a library specializing in energy issues, school curricula development, and a high school text on environmental law. Financial crises  Despite early success, in March 1974 there was an abrupt end to core funding by the government. In order to provide financial stability, the EAC registered as a society and obtained tax status as a charitable organization. In December 1990, the EAC, along with Greenpeace, the Cape Breton Coalition for Environmental Protection, and the Save Boularderie Island Society filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Federal Government of Canada over the proposed Point Aconi Power Plant, which had a significant negative financial impact on the EAC. Thanks to efforts by the fundraising committee, in February 1996 the EAC became officially clear of the debt incurred by the Point Aconi case, but its membership base was lower than at any point in the centre's history. Locations At the time of its inception in May 1971, the EAC was located in a private house on Carleton Street. In November 1971 the EAC moved to the basement of the Forrest Building at Dalhousie University, where it was situated at no cost for 14 years. However, this agreement ended in 1986 and since then the centre has had five homes: the Roy Building on Barrington Street (fall 1986); Veith House in North End Halifax (April 1989); 1553 Granville Street (early 1995); 1568 Argyle Street (June 1996); and 2705 Fern Lane (as of April 2006). Current headquarters The building at 2705 Fern Lane in North End Halifax was purchased by the EAC in July 2005 and renovated by volunteers prior to opening to the public in May 2006. Over the next decade the centre outgrew this space, and further renovations began in May 2015, which were completed in April 2016 after more than 1800 hours of work by volunteers. The current headquarters is largely composed of salvaged materials and features natural plasters on the walls; despite adding nearly 50% more office space, the building's energy efficiency has increased by 22%, setting an impressive precedent for green renovations.. ==References== ","title":"Ecology Action Centre"},{"id":"35266170","text":"Silent Hour/Golden Mile is the debut solo EP by American indie rock musician Daniel Rossen, released on March 20, 2012 on Warp Records.

Particularly, there is a group of problems that have been extensively studied where the input is an array of unsorted numbers and a query consists of computing some function, such as the minimum, on a specific range of the array. ==Definition== A range query q_f(A,i,j) on an array A=[a_1,a_2,..,a_n] of n elements of some set , denoted A[1,n], takes two indices 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq j\\\\leq n, a function defined over arrays of elements of and outputs f(A[i,j])= f(a_i,\\\\ldots,a_j). For example, for f = \\\\sum and A[1,n] an array of numbers, the range query \\\\sum_{i,j} A computes \\\\sum A[i,j] = (a_i+\\\\ldots + a_j), for any 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n. These queries may be answered in constant time and using O(n) extra space by calculating the sums of the first elements of and storing them into an auxiliary array , such that B[i] contains the sum of the first elements of for every 0\\\\leq i\\\\leq n. Therefore, any query might be answered by doing \\\\sum A[i,j] = B[j] - B[i-1]. This strategy may be extended for every group operator where the notion of f^{-1} is well defined and easily computable. Finally, this solution can be extended to two-dimensional arrays with a similar preprocessing. ==Examples== Semigroup operators Range minimum query reduced to the lowest common ancestor problem. When the function of interest in a range query is a semigroup operator, the notion of f^{-1} is not always defined, so the strategy in the previous section does not work. Andrew Yao showed that there exists an efficient solution for range queries that involve semigroup operators. He proved that for any constant , a preprocessing of time and space \\\\theta(c\\\\cdot n) allows to answer range queries on lists where is a semigroup operator in \\\\theta(\\\\alpha_c(n)) time, where \\\\alpha_k is a certain functional inverse of the Ackermann function. There are some semigroup operators that admit slightly better solutions. For instance when f\\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\max,\\\\min\\\\\\\\}. Assume f = \\\\min then \\\\min(A[1..n]) returns the index of the minimum element of A[1..n]. Then \\\\min_{i,j}(A) denotes the corresponding minimum range query. There are several data structures that allow to answer a range minimum query in O(1) time using a preprocessing of time and space O(n). One such solution is based on the equivalence between this problem and the lowest common ancestor problem. The cartesian tree T_A of an array A[1,n] has as root a_i = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\\\\\} and as left and right subtrees the cartesian tree of A[1,i-1] and the cartesian tree of A[i+1,n] respectively. A range minimum query \\\\min_{i,j}(A) is the lowest common ancestor in T_A of a_i and a_j. Because the lowest common ancestor can be solved in constant time using a preprocessing of time and space O(n), range minimum query can as well. The solution when f = \\\\max is analogous. Cartesian trees can be constructed in linear time. Mode The mode of an array A is the element that appears the most in A. For instance the mode of A=[4,5,6,7,4] is . In case of ties any of the most frequent elements might be picked as mode. A range mode query consists in preprocessing A[1,n] such that we can find the mode in any range of A[1,n]. Several data structures have been devised to solve this problem, we summarize some of the results in the following table. {  - + Range Mode Queries - ! Space  Query Time  Restrictions -  O(n^{2-2\\\\epsilon})  O(n^\\\\epsilon \\\\log n)  0\\\\leq \\\\epsilon\\\\leq \\\\frac 1 2 -  O\\\\left(\\\\frac{n^2\\\\log\\\\log n}{\\\\log n}\\\\right)  O(1)  - } Recently J√∏rgensen et al. proved a lower bound on the cell-probe model of \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\log n}{\\\\log (S w/n)}\\\\right) for any data structure that uses cells. Median This particular case is of special interest since finding the median has several applications. On the other hand, the median problem, a special case of the selection problem, is solvable in O(n), using the median of medians algorithm. However its generalization through range median queries is recent. A range median query \\\\operatorname{median}(A,i,j) where A,i and j have the usual meanings returns the median element of A[i,j]. Equivalently, \\\\operatorname{median}(A,i,j) should return the element of A[i,j] of rank \\\\frac{j-i}{2}. Range median queries cannot be solved by following any of the previous methods discussed above including Yao's approach for semigroup operators. There have been studied two variants of this problem, the offline version, where all the k queries of interest are given in a batch, and a version where all the preprocessing is done up front. The offline version can be solved with O(n\\\\log k + k \\\\log n) time and O(n\\\\log k) space. The following pseudo code shows how to find the element of rank in A[i,j] an unsorted array of distinct elements, to find the range medians we set r=\\\\frac{j-i}{2}. rangeMedian(A, i, j, r) { if A.length() == 1 return A[1] if A.low is undefined then m = median(A) A.low = [e in A  e <= m] A.high = [e in A  e > m ] calculate t the number of elements of A[i, j] that belong to A.low if r <= t then return rangeMedian(A.low, i, j, r) else return rangeMedian(A.high, i, j, r-t) } Procedure partitions , using 's median, into two arrays and , where the former contains the elements of that are less than or equal to the median and the latter the rest of the elements of . If we know that the number of elements of A[i,j] that end up in is and this number is bigger than then we should keep looking for the element of rank in ; otherwise we should look for the element of rank (r-t) in . To find , it is enough to find the maximum index m\\\\leq i-1 such that a_m is in and the maximum index l\\\\leq j such that a_l is in . Then t=l-m. The total cost for any query, without considering the partitioning part, is \\\\log n since at most \\\\log n recursion calls are done and only a constant number of operations are performed in each of them (to get the value of fractional cascading should be used). If a linear algorithm to find the medians is used, the total cost of preprocessing for range median queries is n\\\\log k. The algorithm can also be modified to solve the online version of the problem. ==Related problems== All the problems described above have been studied for higher dimensions as well as their dynamic versions. On the other hand, range queries might be extended to other data structures like trees, such as the level ancestor problem. A similar family of problems are orthogonal range queries, also known as counting queries. == See also == * Level ancestor problem * Lowest common ancestor ==References *Open Data Structure - Chapter 13 - Data Structures for Integers *Data Structures for Range Median Queries - Gerth Stolting Brodal and Allan Gronlund Jorgensen Category:Arrays ","title":"Range query (data structures)"},{"id":"35266332","text":"Kirari (Sparkling in English) is Dazzle Vision's fifth overall release, containing 12 songs.

Hanna and Erich Garvenberg can now marry.Hake, pp. 113‚Äì14, spelling the astrologer's name Karl-Otto. ==Partial cast list== * Maria von Tasnady: Hanna M√ºller * Willy Birgel: Erich Garvenberg * Lil Dagover: Charlotte Garvenberg (Pola Negri refused the role, saying she was too busyErica Carter, Dietrich's Ghosts: The Sublime and the Beautiful in Third Reich Film, London: British Film Institute, 2004, , p. 78, note 7.) * Maria Koppenh√∂fer: Frau Freese, the maid * Peter Bosse: Hanna's son Peter * Theodor Loos: Professor Obereit, the paediatrician * Albert Lippert: Gregor Carl-Otto, an astrologer * Kurt Meisel: Baron Salviany, Carl-Otto's friend * Erich Ponto: judge * Hella Graf: Frau Czerwonska * Paul Otto: prosecutor * Alexander Engel: Mr. Smith, landlord * Eva Tinschmann: head nurse * Walter Werner: Dr. Smedley, doctor in New York * Carl Auen: New York criminal investigator * Erich Bartels: court official * Johannes Bergfeld: adoption notary * Ursula Deinert: dancer * Christa Mattner: Peter's foster mother * Erna Berger: soprano soloist * Luise Willer: alto soloist * Rudolf Watzke: bass soloist * Hellmuth Melchert: tenor soloistCast, SCHLU√üAKKORD, British Film Institute, retrieved 31 March 2012. ==Themes and imagery== The film contrasts American with German culture and \\"a decadent past\\" (the Weimar Republic) with a \\"healthy, hopeful present\\" (the Third Reich) that reaffirms the values of the \\"old\\" (pre-Weimar) Germany.Hake, p. 119. The interiors, by Erich Kettelhut, a co-designer on Metropolis, have symbolic force;Hake, p. 54. in particular, Charlotte Garvenberg is surrounded by mirrors, suggesting narcissism, preoccupied with her own happiness at the expense of her husband or other integration into society, so that her fate in the film \\"in a way, rehearses the conditions under which [Weimar] culture came to an end\\", in selfishness, \\"erotic obsessions\\" and \\"empty rituals\\".Hake, p. 120; Carter, p. 214. In contrast Erich Garvenberg and Hanna are both guided by duty, and Garvenberg is a decisive leader and Hanna is able to draw strength from her rootedness in German culture and her healthy maternal feelings. Sierck stated in an interview that he saw melodrama in its original and etymological sense, as \\"music + drama\\".John Halliday, Sirk on Sirk, New York: Viking, 1972, excerpted in Lucy Fischer, ed., Imitation of Life: Douglas Sirk, Director, Rutgers films in print 16, New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University, 1991, pp. 226‚Äì36 p. 227; cited in Hake, p. 113 and Thomas R.

In Schlu√üakkord, Kurt Schr√∂der's score is reminiscent in style of later work by Erich Korngold and incorporates several excerpts of classical music, including radio broadcasts and gramophone records. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was performed for the soundtrack by the orchestra of the Berlin State Opera with well-known soloists including Hellmuth Melchert and Erna Berger. Throughout Schlu√üakkord, music serves both to further the plot and to symbolise values. Jazz and swing are played at the New York New Year's Eve party and a party given by Charlotte; Charlotte is late to a performance by her husband of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, fails to gain entrance and back home exclaims to her maid, \\"[S]ometimes he is so foreign to me. Always with Bach, Beethoven, and whatever their names are\\"; while in an interwoven scene, an ailing Hanna in New York, hearing on the radio the notes of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony which Garvenberg is conducting, whispers \\"Beethoven\\", remembers Germany and decides to return to her homeland, whereupon the scene shifts back to the concert hall, where the performance has reached the \\"Ode to Joy\\". The sequence contrasts Charlotte's estrangement in Berlin with the expatriate Hanna's need to belong (and to be reunited with her child).Hake, p. 117.Eric Rentschler, The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife, Cambridge, Massachusetts / London: Harvard University, 1996, , p. 141. In the scene where they discover they love each other, Hanna tells Garvenberg that the Adagio movement saved her life.Ornella Calvano, \\"Zum Einsatz von Musik, Kl√§ngen, T√∂nen und Ger√§uschen in Die Ehe der Maria Braun von Rainer Werner Fassbinder und Peer Raben\\", Kieler Beitr√§ge zur Filmmusikforschungen 4 (March 2010) pp. 8‚Äì20, p. 11 (pdf) , suggesting that the use of the Ninth Symphony in Schlu√üakkord influenced Rainer Werner Fassbinder to also use it in The Marriage of Maria Braun. Other passages of classical music serve as leitmotifs in the film. A passage from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite is introduced in the opening credits and recurs \\"repeatedly . . . each time announcing an emotional crisis or insight.\\" A theme from \\"Dance of the Toy Flutes\\" first occurs as Hanna mentions her child when the police in New York are questioning her, and the music changes to \\"lyrical and pastoral tones\\" as the viewer sees in turn New York tenements, the lighted skyline of Manhattan, the Atlantic, the historic centre of Berlin, and finally the boy in the orphanage.Hake, pp. 115‚Äì16. The theme recurs when Hanna gives Charlotte her medicine and when she dreams about that last encounter, foreshadowing that she will be reunited with her son.Hake, p. 116. Other Nutcracker passages occur when Hanna is at the theatre with the director of the orphanage and are intercut with scenes of Charlotte and her lover; and after an argument with Charlotte, Hanna goes to an opera in the style of Richard Strauss, where an older woman sings an aria, \\"Drop of Hemlock, Sweet and Deadly,\\" expressing Hanna's fear of elimination, but it is a younger woman who is poisoned on stage. Finally, the closing scene is at a performance of Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus, and the camera moves from the newly united family to the triumphant angels on the ceiling of the concert hall. Sabine Hake points out that in addition to expressing the deepest feelings of the characters, the use of music in the film establishes the \\"social, psychological, and cultural terms\\" in which it defines community, and that the use of classical music quotations as well as the film's visual symbolism presuppose a shared middle-class cultural frame of reference. ==Reception== The film was successful and strengthened Sierck's negotiating position with UFA.Nadar, p. 65: It was \\"extremely popular\\" and he was chosen to make Zu neuen Ufern, Zarah Leander's expensive UFA d√©but, as his next film. The Film- Kurier review praised Sierck for \\"manag[ing] to blend the various emotional and affective elements of the plot into a moving musical unity\\" with \\"appropriate emphases\\" and \\"sustaining dramatic tension from start to finish.\\"July 25, 1936, quoted and paraphrased in Rentschler, p. 131. Schneider in Licht-Bild-B√ºhne called it \\"[t]he most honest, most decent and, in its form, most compelling film of [recent] years.\\"July 25, 1936, quoted in Hake, pp. 112‚Äì13 and with slightly differing translation and specifying \\"the German film industry\\" in Romani, p. 53. Another Berlin critic wrote that \\"Sierck . . . shows with this film that he ranks with the most important contemporary filmmakers\\" and singled out in particular his not favouring some \\"stars\\" over other actors: \\"[A]ll his actors are stars from the moment they appear on the screen.\\"A. Lippert, Das 12 Uhr-Blatte, quoted in Romani, pp. 52‚Äì53. However, most of the reviews focussed on the stars Willy Birgel and Lil Dagover rather than on the direction. In 1969, David Stewart Hull wrote that the film was \\"done with much the same flair which Sierck (Douglas Sirk) was to evidence . . . two decades later in the United States\\" but also that \\"the excellent musical sequences saved the film from banality.\\"David Stewart Hull, Film in the Third Reich: A Study of the German Cinema, 1933‚Äì1945, Berkeley, California: University of California, 1969, , p. 103. ==Awards== * Pr√§dikat (Propaganda Ministry award of distinction): Artistic Value (k√ºnstlerisch Wertvoll)Hake, p. 115.Rentschler, pp. 130‚Äì31. * Best Musical Film, Venice International Film Festival ==Accord final== In 1939, Sierck made Accord final in France for France-Suisse Film; this is the same title as Schlu√üakkord but the plot is different.Nadar, p. 82, note 1.According to Rentschler, p. 288 (who gives the year as 1938), he was artistic director but the film was directed by I.R.

Born in Islington, he was educated at the City of London School and entered business as a refreshment contractor with premises at Upper Street. In 1875, he was elected to Islington Vestry. He subsequently became a member of the Islington Board of Guardians: during his 38 years membership he was chairman for 20 years and vice-chairman for 9. When the first elections to the London County Council were held in January 1889, Elliott was elected as one of two councillors representing Islington South. Originally a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party, he was re-elected in 1892 and 1895. There was some doubt as to his party allegiance by the time of the 1898 election: as a Unionist he was seen as being aligned to the Conservative supported opposition Moderate Party, although he was nominated by the Progressives. He was later described as an \\"Independent Progressive\\", and at the 1901 election was returned unopposed, taking the Moderate whip. He stood at the 1904 council election as an independent, but was defeated. Elliott was elected to the Islington Borough Council as a Conservative, and was thirteen times mayor of Islington: in 1902/03, from 1906‚Äì09, and from 1910‚Äì18. As mayor during the First World War he was largely responsible for raising the 21st (Service) Battalion (Islington), The Middlesex Regiment. He was knighted in 1917. At the 1918 general election he was elected as Coalition Conservative member of parliament for Islington West. He retired from parliament at the next general election in 1922. He married Elizabeth Frances Hellier, Upottery, Devon and the couple had six children. He died suddenly at his home \\"The Chalkpit\\", Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1925.

He was a professor of English at Allahabad University, and an advocate for the Maithili language, where he petitioned the Government of Bihar to make its language instruction available for primary schools in the area., He worked tirelessly for the statehood of Mithila in India carving out from Bihar and Jharkhand from 1994 till his death. ==Early life== Mishra was born on 20 November 1922, in Varanasi.Mishra's birth month as stated as November by daughter Lila, although his friend Dhanakar Thakur has mentioned December. His father, Umesha Mishra, and grandfather, Pandit Jayadev Mishra, were both mahamahopadhyaya titled scholars. Umesha Mishra studied Maithili and Sanskrit. In 1923, the Mishras moved to Allahabad. ==Career== In 1943, Mishra completed his M.A. degree in English Language and Literature at Allahabad University. In 1944, he joined their faculty as a lecturer in the Department of English and Modern European Languages. With Dr. Amarnath Jha as his thesis advisor, Mishra wrote his PhD dissertation on the history of Maithili literature. Mishra continued in the faculty at Allahabad until 1983, when he retired as professor and head of their English department. From 1985 to 1988, he was the Visiting Professor of English at Sagar University. In 1986, he served on The All India Board for Research Awards in Humanities at Mysore. From 1992 to 1994, he served as the Dean of the Faculty of Languages and Social Sciences in Chitrakoot Gramodaya Visvavidyalaya.

In 1973, he published the first part of the glossary, which covered words that began with \\"a\\". The dictionary would later be published in two volumes. The Maithili words were written in Devanagri and Tirhuta scripts, along with equivalent phonetics in English. It is considered an important landmark in Maithil literature. According to article 350A of the Indian constitution, each State should provide facilities where primary education students can receive instruction in their local language. On 3 September 1998, Mishra filed civil writ CWJC-7505/1998 at the Patna High Court, against the Government of Bihar for not providing minimum primary education in Maithili medium to the Maithili-speaking region of Bihar.In the civil appeal, Manish Kumar and Gopal Singh were their advocates for the Bihar Government. Vijayendra Mishra and Anil Kumar Jha were the advocates for Mishra. On 30 September 2010, The Supreme Court (Court No. 9) rejected the appeal.The judgement for Civil Appeal 7266 of 2004 was given by Justices B. Sudarshan Reddy and Surinder Songh Nijjar. The Bihar government withdrew other similar cases (e.g., Civil Appeal No(s). 2203‚Äì2208 of 2001), concerning similar primary education rights. , ==Legacy== In 2009, Gajendra Thakur and the editors of the e-journal Videha ‚Äì First Maithili Fortnightly published a series of English-Maithili dictionaries that were dedicated to Mishra along with other advocates. ==Personal life== In 1939, Mishra married Shreemati Devi, a Maithili poet and writer. ==Works== Some of Mishra's notable publications include: * History of Mithili Literature ‚Äì Mishra's PhD thesis. * Introduction to The Folk Literature of Mithila (1950‚Äì51) * The Critical Edition of Kirtaniya Dramas * Lectures on Thomas Hardy (1955, 1965) * Complex Style in English Poetry (1977) ==Awards== 1967: Samman Patra by Akhil Bhartiya Maithili Sammelan, Bombay. 1989: Gaurinath Memorial Lectures. 1990: Tamra Patra by Chetna Samiti, Patna. 1995: Samman Patra by Mithila Sanskritik Sangam, Prayag. 1999: Samman Patra by Vidyapati Samiti, Dhanbad. 2001: Bhasha Samman by Sahitya Academy for the year 2000 ==Notable positions== 1943‚Äì2008: President, All India Maithili Sahitya Samiti, Allahabad. 1948: Member, Council of All India Oriental Conference. 1963‚Äì82: Member, Advisory Board and General Council of Sahitya Akademi. 1967‚Äì71: Secretary, G.

Oslo, 2006 A group of prominent citizens formed the \\"Prinds Christian Augusts Minde\\" charity in 1809, in honour of the Danish Governor-General of Norway, Christian August. The charity was set up to help the poor and unemployed: The number of poor people had increased dramatically in the city, and the prisons were overcrowded. The charity bought Mangelsg√•rden in 1812. The facility next housed the hospital for the poor (fattigsykehus) and public kitchen (dampkj√∏kken) together with separate living quarters for men and women. The facility also held a police office and jailhouse (dollhus). Most notably the spinning factory of the institution for the care of the poor (Fattigvesenet) was also moved here. The factory soon turned into a workhouse focused on textile production, stone cutting, and woodworking. The complex was expanded several times and in 1833 a factory building drawn by architect Christian H. Grosch was erected.Research project about Prinds Christian Augusts Minde, the Institute of criminology at the University of Oslo Christiania Insane Hospital (Sinnssykeasyler) was moved to Mangelsg√•rden in 1829 and was expanded after the new lunatic asylum laws were passed in 1848.

It was strategically situated west of James Bay about up the east-flowing Albany River at the mouth of the Henley River, downstream of the confluence of the major north-flowing Kenogami River with the Albany. From the head of the Albany at Lake St. Joseph a portage led west to Lac Seul, from which the English River (Ontario) led to the Winnipeg River and westward. The Kenogami led south toward Wawa, Ontario, but this does not seem to have been a practical canoe route all the way to Lake Superior. In 1685, just before the Hudson Bay expedition (1686) the French built Fort des Fran√ßais at the future site of Henley House. In 1743 Joseph Isbister, the head of Fort Albany at the mouth of the Albany decided to reverse long-standing policy and build an inland post upriver. This was an isolated event since the HBC directors did not support inland forts until 1775. It was intended not as a full trading post but as a sort of 'pit stop' to help the Indians continue down the river and to discourage them from trading with the coureurs des bois. The first Henley House was built on the north bank of the Albany opposite the mouth of the Kenogami. It is typical of the HBC at this time that the men had difficulty running the boats upriver since they had no woodland skills. In 1755 a group of Indians attacked and looted the post, killing four men. It seems that some Indian women were being held at the post and that the French may have encouraged the attack. Isbister captured and hung three of the murderers. For this action he was dismissed from the HBC service. The burnt fort was quickly rebuilt on the same site. In 1759, at the height of the Seven Years' War, it was attacked again by a group of Indians and French-Canadians. The waited until most of the men were away at Fort Albany. One man was killed and the three survivors held out in the fort until nightfall when they slipped out, went downriver and met the men returning from Fort Albany and the whole group returned to Fort Albany. In 1768 a second Henley House was built on an island 8 miles downstream from the first. From 1775 the HBC started copying the French policy of trading in the interior. Henley House became a proper trading post and returned 2,000 made beaver in one year, about a tenth of the James Bay production. In 1777 Gloucester House was built further upstream and Henley House was used as a base for westward exploration by Philip Turnor and others. In 1782 the post burned down but was quickly rebuilt. The post continued until around 1850, but by 1880 no vestiges of it remained. Today the two sites are covered with forest. From 1884 to 1941 there was an HBC post called English River Post up the Kenogami at Mammamattawa, Ontario. ==References== * *Arthur S Morton, \\"A History of the Canadian West\\", no date Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts ","title":"Henley House"},{"id":"35266858","text":"The Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway operated a narrow gauge tramway service in Arthog between 1899 and 1903.The Golden Age of Tramways.

His early paintings were in a romantic style, but in his later work he was an exponent of realism and impressionism. He was a major initiator and promoter of Amsterdam Impressionism, the artist's association St. Lucas, and the movement of the Amsterdamse Joffers.From about 1610 the old guilds emerged in the Low Countries and the last was disbanded around 1795. Almost every town had such one and they were founded for economic reasons. They must be seen in connection with the 1. Dutch golden age of painting.It was named after the patron of the painters.The flow of Amsterdamse Joffers is a movement within the Amsterdam Impressionism. Its members, however, have always chosen their own way. Amsterdam Impressionism ‚Äì sometimes referred to by art historians as the School of Alleb√© ‚Äì was the counterflow to the very strong Hague School in the movement of Dutch Impressionism. As a professor at the Royal Academy of Amsterdam (Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten) he fostered a cosmopolitan attitude toward art and the promotion and motivation of his students, and provided a significant stimulus to developments in modern art. ==Biography== Portrait by Alleb√© of Johannes Luden, 1868, collection Teylers Museum He was born in Amsterdam. According to the RKD he followed evening classes at Felix Meritis and studied at the Antwerp Academy, the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.August Alleb√© in the RKD He was a pupil of Petrus Franciscus Greive, Adolphe Mouilleron, Charles Rochussen and Louis Royer. He became a member of Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam from 1863 and a member of Soci√©t√© Royale Belge des Aquarellistes from 1868. In 1870 he became a professor at the Royal Academy of Amsterdam (Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten) and was a director there from 1880. The RKD lists 179 pupils and it is known that he stayed in correspondence with ex-pupils and several artists came back to the academy to be able to follow classes with him. He was a strong influence on the Amsterdamse Joffers, and had close ties with Amsterdam Impressionism. He died in Amsterdam in 1927 and is buried at Zorgvlied cemetery. A square is named after him in the neighborhood of streets named after 19th- and 20th-century Dutch painters in Overtoomse Veld-Noord, Amsterdam. ==Kunstenaarsvereniging Sint Lucas== In 1880, the ', an artist's association in Amsterdam, was founded with his support.The patron saint of painters is the Holy St. Luke. This new artist's association has been named after him. The first arts guilds of St. Lucas was founded in the 16th century in the Low Countries. The starting point was the reform movement of 1579 and the shaking of the Catholic state power of the Habsburg Kingdom of Spain. In 1610/11 they were founded in Haarlem, Gouda, Delft, Rotterdam and The Hague. The last of their kind existed in Antwerp until 1795. They became part of the Amsterdam art scene, and community center of artists and lovers of painting. Here contacts were made, passed on knowledge and thus the antithesis of successful structured Hague School, which was part of the international movement of impressionism. In addition, links to Amsterdam Sozi√´teit Arti et Amicitiae were present, which were essential for both institutions. ==Some of his well-known students== * Lizzy Ansingh (1875‚Äì1959)She belonged to the \\"Amsterdamse Joffers\\", part of the Amsterdamse Impressionism. * Floris Arntzenius (1864‚Äì1925) * Johan Braakensiek (1858‚Äì1940)He had got private lessons. * Nicolaas Bastert (1854‚Äì1939 * Johanna Bauer-Stumpff (1873‚Äì1964) * Tjeerd Bottema (1884‚Äì1978) * Johan Coenraad Braakensiek (1858‚Äì1940) * Cornelius de Bruin (1870‚Äì1940) * Georg Hendrik Breitner (1857‚Äì1923)He spent a short time at the academy and left it for Paris. * Antoon Derkinderen (1859‚Äì1925) * Eduard Frankfort (1864‚Äì1920) * Leo Gestel (1881‚Äì1941) * Arnold Marc Gorter (1866‚Äì1933) * Richard Roland Holst (1884‚Äì1956) * Isaac Isra√´ls (1865‚Äì1934) * Cornelius Jetses (1873‚Äì1955) * Hendrik Maarten Krabb√© (1868‚Äì1931) * Jacobus van Looy (1855‚Äì1930) * Kees Maks (1876‚Äì1967) * Herman Mees (1880‚Äì1964) * Wally Moes (1856‚Äì1918) * Pieter Cornelius Mondriaan (1872‚Äì1944)Art historians believe that Piet Mondriaan was student of Prof. Alleb√©, too. * Martin Monnickendam (1874‚Äì1943) * Gerard Muller (1861‚Äì1929) * Jacoba Johanna Ritsema (1876‚Äì1961) * Suse Robertson(1855‚Äì1922)She had got private lessons. * Jan Slyters (1881‚Äì1957) * Hobbe Smith (1862‚Äì1942) * Dirk Smorenberg (1883‚Äì1960) * Willem Bastiaan Tholen (1860‚Äì1931) * Jan Tiele (1884‚Äì1956) * Johannes Theodorus Toorop (1858‚Äì1928) * Maurits van der Valk (1857‚Äì1935)In 1880 he got the membership of St. Lucas as student. * Jan Pieter Veth (1864‚Äì1925) * Gerhard Westermann (1880‚Äì1971) * Petrus Theodorus van Wijngaerdt (1873‚Äì1964) * Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller (1855‚Äì1925) * Ernst Witkamp (1854‚Äì1897) * Willem Jan Willemsen (1866-1914) * Willem Witsen 1860‚Äì1923) * Jan Zoetelief Tromp (1872‚Äì1947) == Successful students of Alleb√© == * Lizzy Ansingh ‚Äì she won the Barend Polviet and the Willink van Collenprijs in 1906. * Pieter Florentius Nicolaas Jacobus Arntzenius ‚Äì he got a commendation from the Willink van Collenprijs in 1890. * Eduard Frankfort ‚Äì he got the Gold medal from the Soci√´teit Arti et Amicitae. * Hendrik Maarten Krabb√© ‚Äì he got a commendation by the Willink van Collenprijs in 1889. * Wally Moes - she won the 1. place of the Willink van Collenprijs in 1884. * Henri Goovaerts ‚Äì he won the Prix de Rome in 1890. * Gerard Muller - he won the 1. place of the Willink van Collenprijs in 1887. * Hobbe Smith - he won the 2. place of the Willink van Collenprijs in 1888. * Willem Bastiaan Tholen - he won the 2. place of the Willink van Collenprijs in 1883 and in 1903 he got from the Queen K√∂nigin the Gold Medal of honor. * Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller ‚Äì won the 1.

The Huskies competed in the West Division of the Mid-American Conference. They were led by second-year head coach Dave Doeren for the regular season and Rod Carey in the 2013 Orange Bowl. They played their home games at Huskie Stadium. They finished the season 12‚Äì2, 8‚Äì0 in MAC play to win MAC West Division Title. With their win over Kent State in the MAC Championship Game on November 30, NIU moved to 12‚Äì1, the most regular season wins in the program's 113-year history. Since the MAC was a non-automatic qualifying (non-AQ) conference, its conference champion had to finish 16th or higher in the BCS ranking and be ranked ahead of at least one AQ conference champion to qualify for a BCS game. With their MAC Championship, the Huskies moved to No. 15 in the final Bowl Championship Series rankings, while Big East champion Louisville was ranked No. 21. As a result, Northern Illinois received a BCS bid to the Orange Bowl against Florida State. It was the first major-bowl appearance in school history, as well as the first-ever major-bowl appearance for a MAC team. Head coach Doeren did not coach the Huskies in the Orange Bowl after accepting the head coaching job at North Carolina State. Co-offensive coordinator Rod Carey was named his successor, and coached the bowl game. The Huskies lost to Florida State 10‚Äì31. The season marked the Huskies' fifth consecutive trip to a bowl game. ==ScheduleRankingsRosterGame summaries== vs Iowa {  - align=\\"center\\" ! Overall record ! Last meeting !

Her right arm and both of her feet had to be amputated to stop gangrene from spreading. On 29 March 2012, Makar died from her injuries. She was buried on 30 March in Luch. Since she died unmarried, she was buried in a wedding dress, in accordance with local tradition. ==Investigation and trial== Three men ‚Äì Yevgeny Krasnoshchok, 23, Maxim Prisyazhnyuk, 24, and Artem Pogasyan, 22 ‚Äì were arrested on 11 March, but Prisyazhnyuk and Pogasyan were released on police bail. Shortly thereafter it was claimed in the media that the parents of Prisyazhnyuk and Pogasyan were ex-government officials from the Mykolaiv area and were connected to local politicians. It was reported that Prisyazhnyuk is the adopted son of a former head of district council and Pogasyan is the son of the regional prosecutor.https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/high-profile-ukraine-men-accused- of-raping-burning-woman-alive--16169 (In their statement the police have confirmed the claim in respect of Prisyazhnyuk but stated that Pogasyan's mother is a librarian and his father was a manual laborer before his death in January 2012.) After protests on the streets of Mykolaiv and other cities against the police bail of Prisyazhnyuk and Pogasyan, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych intervened and an investigating team from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, then visited Mykolaiv.In Ukraine, scales of justice often imbalanced, Kyiv Post (10 April 2012) The two suspects released on police bail were re- arrested, and at least four local law-enforcement officials were sacked. On 29 March, a Ministry of Internal Affairs spokesman announced that all three men had been charged with Oksana Makar's rape and murder and faced life in jail.

Surovitskaya posted a footage of Makar in hospital after medics had been forced to amputate one of her arms and both her feet on YouTube (these amputations can clearly be seen on the video) two weeks after the attack. Ukrainian billionaire and member of parliament Renat Akhmetov had aided the transfer of Makar to the Donetsk Burn Center and also paid for the Swiss surgeon. The Governor of the Mykolaiv province, Nikolai Kruglov blamed among the others the family of the injured girl: \\"The question of control of the child - it's family issues. This is a minor child, in our 18 years in school learning - I am at this point I say\\". Raisa Bohatyryova (Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently the Minister of Health) held talks with Nikolai Kruglov and asked him to provide all the necessary medical care for Makar. The Ukrainian Presidential adviser, Marina Stavniychuk, voiced her support to the residents of Mykolaiv and opposed the initial release of suspects. She announced that the Presidential Administration was surprised by the behavior of law enforcement officers, who released the suspects of the rape and attempted murder. The presidential adviser further expressed her personal disbelief over the release of the suspects. Member of parliament Serhiy Sobolev said that \\"the spokesman of the Mykolaiv regional police department is frankly lying\\" when she (Lt. Col. Olga Perederenko) stated that \\"the girl was in such condition that it could not provide any evidence\\", Sobolev was shocked that Olga Perederenko still holds her position. During the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) on March 14, Gennady Zadyrko, in reaction to the incident involving Oksana Makar, said that Ukraine should \\"bring back the death penalty\\". The deputy Oleg Lyashko urged his colleagues to donate one day's salary to Makar's medical treatment. He also opined that they should \\"castrate pedophiles\\". Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Andriy Klyuyev expressed confidence that the perpetrators will be punished with the full extent of the law. He noted that \\"the government must adequately respond to any crime - no one has to avoid punishment, regardless of affiliation or social status\\". An Honored Artist of Ukraine Angelica Rudnitskaya has stated she doesn't not believe in the execution of President Viktor Yanukovych order to ensure a full and impartial investigation of rape Oksana Makar. She said: \\"If the law enforcement system is not able to protect its citizens and punish those responsible, the people themselves must all available legal means to force her to do it\\". After Makar had died on 29 March 2012 President Yanukovych and Prime Minister Mykola Azarov were among the first to offer condolences. Azarov wrote on his blog ‚ÄúNo compromises. Only with the knowledge that punishment is inevitable will these monsters fear to encroach on people‚Äôs lives and rights.‚ÄùPunishment vowed as Ukrain rape victim dies, News24 (29 March 2012)  Rallies and funds collection  On the morning of March 13, dozens of Mykolaiv residents went to the first rally next to the Central police station. The rally moved to the Prosecutor's Office of the Mykolaiv province. Another protest was held at Lenin Square. On March 15, another rally was held in the central area of Mykolaiv, near Lenin Square, in support of Oksana Makar with a few thousand participants. Due to the resonance of the Oksana Makar assault, another, similar criminal case was revealed, involving another teenager, Aleksandra Popova, who was hospitalized on the same day and was unconscious for weeks. The rally became supportive of both Oksana Makar and Aleksandra Popova. The demonstrators who gathered in Lenin Square were able to collect 7,511 hryvnia for the treatment of Oksana Makar and 6,652 hryvnia were collected for Alexandra Popova. The general public donated over 1 million hryvnia for the treatment of Makar, according to her mother. –ú–∞–º–∞ –û–∫—Å–∞–Ω–∏ –ú–∞–∫–∞—Ä —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–ª–∞, –∫—É–¥–∏ –≤–∏—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å –∑—ñ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ª—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –º—ñ–ª—å–π–æ–Ω (Mom Oksana Makar told where to spend a million gathered on treatment), Ukrayinska Pravda (16 March 2012)  Blood donation  On March 14‚Äì15, more than 150 Mykolaiv residents donated blood for Oksana Makar.

She led the International Council of Bird Preservation. In 1958, she became the first woman to receive an MBE for work in conservation, and was made CBE for 1970. == Biography == Phyllis, as she was known, was the second of three daughters of Edward Barclay-Smith and his wife Ida Mary. Edward was a professor of anatomy at Cambridge University. She studied at Blackheath high school and King's College, London and joined as an assistant secretary to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in 1924. One of the founders of the RSPB was her aunt Margaretta Louisa Lemon, known as Etta Lemon. At the International Ornithological Congress of 1930 Barclay-Smith spoke on oil pollution and sea birds. Jean Delacour who was vice-president of the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP) was impressed by her organizational efficiency. Barclay-Smith resigned from the RSPB in 1935, partly due to being denied the position of secretary after the retirement of Linda Gardiner, a position for which Robert Preston Donaldson was recruited. Etta Lemon believed that a male secretary was needed for the organization to be viewed more seriously and this enraged the secretaries, Barclay-Smith as well as Beatrice Solly. Barclay-Smith then joined the ICBP and worked almost lifelong at the Council, becoming a secretary in 1946 and secretary-general in 1974.  War years  During the World War II, Barclay-Smith worked as a secretary to the business manager of the Bristol Aeroplane Factory and from 1943 to 45 she worked in the Ministry of Labour. Her strengths were in building organizations, ensuring communication, collaboration and participation within and across an international network of scientists, civil servants and politicians. She helped in bridging aviculturists and ornithologists, serving as editor of the Avicultural Magazine from 1938. She helped establish the International Wildfowl Research Bureau, and helped in raising awareness on insecticide risks. She also helped in rallying support for the establishment of the Cousin Island reserve in the Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean. Phyllis earned the nickname of the dragon, a name she also shared by her aunt Etta Lemon.  Death  Barclay-Smith died five days after going into coma following a severe stroke on Christmas Day, 1979, at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London. She was cremated. == Honors == She was made MBE in 1958 for her services to conservation, CBE for 1970,London Gazette 1 January 1971 and awarded Ridder of the Most Excellent Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. ==Selected works== Among Barclay-Smith's works were translations of books from French and German. *British birds on lake, river and stream, 1939 *British and American game birds, 1939 *Garden birds, 1945 *A book of ducks, 1951 * (tr.)

In visual media such as television and film, sexposition is the technique of providing exposition against a backdrop of sex or nudity. The Financial Times defined sexposition as \\"keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on\\". Its purpose, according to James Poniewozik, is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation. ==Etymology== The term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNuttOriginally in: to describe scenes in the HBO TV series Game of Thrones in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author George R. R. Martin said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the A Song of Ice and Fire books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show. As the show has to convey details of many characters and backstories from the books, sexposition is useful to deliver the information to viewers in condensed form. The term has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows Deadwood and The Sopranos (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip Jane. According to James Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need. ==Criticism== Critics have disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality. Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men. Neil Marshall, director of the second-season episode \\"Blackwater,\\" recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that \\"[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience\\", an experience that Marshall described as \\"pretty surreal\\" to happen on the set of a major network production. Game of Thrones showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does \\"pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes\\", while co-creator D. B. Weiss disagreed, countering that \\"Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it.\\" While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say \\"Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO.\\" Time reported before the seventh season in 2017 that \\"Even if Benioff and Weiss don‚Äôt always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back\\". Huffington Post critic Maureen Ryan contrasted sexposition‚Äîwhich she said was useful if used to convey much information that would otherwise be boring‚Äîwith \\"H.B.\\" (\\"Hey, boobs!\\"), which she described as scenes that only exist to show (usually female) nudity. ==Satire== Fan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 sketch on Saturday Night Live when discussing Marshall's anecdote. Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of HBO First Look featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old \\"creative consultant\\" to Game of Thrones. Played by Andy Samberg, the teenage boy was proud of \\"mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs\\" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin (Bobby Moynihan) called Friedberg \\"a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it.\\" The real Martin is aware of the skit, joking at San Diego Comic-Con that Friedberg could not attend because \\"[t]here was a scene in Belfast with no boobies in it and he needed to go there to put that to rights\\". ==References== Category:Narrative techniques Category:Sexuality in fiction Category:Words coined in the 2010s ","title":"Sexposition"},{"id":"35267254","text":"Vanash-e Bala (, also Romanized as VanƒÅsh-e BƒÅlƒÅ; also known as VanƒÅsh) is a village in Alamut-e Pain Rural District, Rudbar-e Alamut District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Posthumously he has been referred to as \\"William Pelham Dutton\\". ==History== Dutton was born in Sydney, a son of Henry and Margaret Dutton, who had emigrated from England some years previously; in 1813 his family moved to Hobart Town, at that time a major shipping port. He was employed as a sailor by Captain John Griffiths, a whaler and merchant of Griffiths, Connolly and Sinclair. He first landed at Portland Bay near Blacknose Point in December 1828 with Captain McMullen in the schooner Madeira Packet. This is the text of a statutory declaration made by Dutton in 1874. They were hunting seals, but they had become scarce and Portland Bay became better known as a whaling centre. In July 1829 he returned on the schooner Henry under Capt. McLean, to set up a whaling station, and built for himself the first house in Portland, at \\"Single Corner\\" (aka \\"Whaler's Point\\") on the sandspit; in January 1830 he was picked up by the Henry to embark on another sealing expedition. He sailed to Portland with the Hentys' head man Alexander Campbell, and was in charge of construction of huts for the shore party. Dutton and Campbell remained friends, though later competitors in whale hunting. James Moore was a recruit for Dutton's ship. By 1833 he was in charge of the Henry, and established a whaling station at \\"Double Corner\\" in March of that year, and was in charge of a whaling party for the Henty Brothers that same year. The Hentys' whaling station at Portland was established in November 1834. He was at one stage first mate for Captain Hart, who in March 1833 took the first whale oil from Portland to Hobart. Between 1839 and 1841 he commanded the barque (previously part of the First Fleet of South Australia) on several whaling expeditions to the South Seas. He seemed financially secure, and may have owned the Africaine, but was undone by the bankruptcy of Griffiths, Connolly and Co. in 1842. He married Mary Sagers or Saggers (c. 1820 ‚Äì 23 August 1885) of Launceston in 1843; they had a home at Kelso, on the Tamar River. There are records of his having an earlier wife in Tasmania, an Aborigine named Sarah, and of their having a daughter Sophie, baptised in Launceston in December 1836. This article mentions the previous wife, command of the Africaine off Kangaroo Island, and adoption of a niece and nephew, which are not mentioned elsewhere. Dutton commanded the whaler that outside the whaling season sailed as transport between Hobart and Portland for the Hentys from 1844. :Lady Mary Pelham was built in 1816 as a brig, purchased by George Fife Angas (and converted to a barque by adding a third mast) for the South Australian Company as part of the First Fleet of South Australia. She was then fitted out for whaling. In 1847 Dutton gave up the sea and returned to Victoria, and purchased a farm at Narrawong at the mouth of the Surrey River to the east of Portland, though he was involved in the occasional whale hunt, and was responsible for the last whale killed at Portland Bay, in August 1868. Whales had been used by the Gunditjmara people and when they tried to maintain this practice European whalers stopped them culminating in the Convincing Ground massacre where there is unto an estimated 100 Aboriginal deaths, after which Aboriginal people would avoid the region. He had little success as a farmer at either Narrawong or Bolwarra, and died destitute and his widow (who may have since married a Mr. Bell, but who also died) was forced to rely on the kindness of neighbours. She died at her home in Hurd Street, Portland. He and his wife were buried in adjacent plots in the Narrawong Cemetery. They had no children. Claims have been made for Dutton as the first European settler in Victoria, but Edward Henty has the stronger claim, as Dutton's residency though earlier was not continuous. ==Further reading== *Wiltshire, J.

Everyone hates each other and would like to delete it, but just because of the bad example that the two men give power to the people, many Italians are adversely affected because of cheating and rudeness of the fascist manufacturer and the communist magistrate. The director Dino Risi underlines the misdeeds and the weakness of the Italian people to react accordingly, by focusing on the story of these two men who are each other's opposite of the net. == Cast == * Ugo Tognazzi: Judge Mariano Bonifazi * Vittorio Gassman: Lorenzo Santenocito * Yvonne Furneaux: Lavinia Santenocito * Ely Galleani: Silvana Lazzorini * Pietro Tordi: Professor Rivaroli * Simonetta Stefanelli: Giugi Santenocito * Franco Angrisano: Colombo * Renato Baldini: Accountant Cerioni * Checco Durante: Pieronti, the archivist ==References * Category:1971 films Category:Italian films Category:Commedia all'italiana Category:Films directed by Dino Risi Category:Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli Category:1971 comedy-drama films Category:Films with screenplays by Age & Scarpelli Category:1971 comedy films Category:1971 drama films ","title":"In the Name of the Italian People"},{"id":"35267345","text":"Dikin (, also Romanized as Dƒ´kƒ´n and Dekƒ´n) is a village in Moallem Kalayeh Rural District, Rudbar-e Alamut District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

She was the first Norwegian woman to be awarded a doctorate degree. == Biography == Stephansen was born in Bergen, Norway. She was the eldest daughter of Anton Stephan Stephansen (1845‚Äì1929) and Gerche Reimers Jahn (1848‚Äì1935). Her father was a merchant and owner of a textile shop. He later established the textile factory, Espelandfos Spinderi & Tricotagefabrik, in Arna. She was educated at the Bergen Cathedral School graduating in 1891. She was fluent in the German language and traveled to Switzerland to continue her education. She attended Eidgen√∂ssische Polytechnikum in Zurich and graduated in 1896. Her thesis Ueber partielle Differentialgleichungen vierter Ordnung die ein intermedi√§res Integral besitzen was published in 1902. She obtained her doctorate (Dr. Philos.) in absentia from the University of Zurich in the fall of 1902. In 1902‚Äì1903, she traveled to the University of G√∂ttingen under a government grant to attend lectures by noted German mathematicians, Ernst Zermelo, David Hilbert and Felix Klein. She first served as a teacher of mathematics at Bergen Cathedral School and Bergen Technical School. Between 1905‚Äì1906, she completed mathematical research and wrote further papers on difference equations. From 1906 until her retirement in 1937 she worked at the Agricultural College of Norway at √Ös in Akershus. She first taught physics and mathematics. In 1921, she was appointed Docent in mathematics. In retirement, she lived at the family farm at Espeland in Arna (Espeland, gnr. 289, g√•rdsbruk i Arna) which her father had first acquired during 1918. After the liberation of Norway in 1945, she was awarded the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) for the assistance she rendered to Norwegian prisoners held at the Nazi operated Espeland concentration camp (Espeland fangeleir). She died during 1961 at Espeland in the borough of Arna and was buried at Solheim Cemetery in the √Örstad district of Bergen. ==References Other sources == *Kari Hag and Peter Lindqvist (1997) Elizabeth Stephansen: A pioneer Skrifter det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab 2, 1-23. *Catharine M.

It centers around aspiring actress Penny Reilly (Kate Wetherhead) and her friend, casting agency director Tim Trull (Colin Hanlon), and their circle of friends, colleagues, relationships and family. The series was created in August 2010 by Broadway performers Wetherhead and Andrew Keenan-Bolger. Wetherhead is the series' writer, while Keenan-Bolger is the main director and editor. The series has had three seasons. The first season started airing in October 2010 and had six episodes, the second season started airing in September 2011 and had eight episodes, and the third season started airing in March 2014 and had eight episodes. Most episodes run between 15 and 20 minutes long. The first season was produced on a minuscule budget, and was shown on YouTube. The second and third seasons had significantly larger budget, and higher production quality. Episodes from the second and third seasons were originally shown exclusively on the website BroadwayWorld.com, which also partially funded the project, but were both eventually released on YouTube. Most of the funding for the second and third seasons was solicited through the website Kickstarter. Broadway producer Kevin McCollum was a producing partner for the third season. ==Characters== Main * Penny Reilly (Kate Wetherhead) ‚Äì an aspiring Broadway actress who remains optimistic despite a variety of setbacks * Tim Trull (Colin Hanlon) ‚Äì the head of a casting agency, and Penny's best friend * Steven Ferrell (Stephen Bienskie) ‚Äì Penny's agent and Tim's ex-boyfriend * Aaron Miller (Santino Fontana) ‚Äì a talented but blas√© actor, and Penny's occasional love interest * Gail Liner (Lindsay Nicole Chambers) ‚Äì Tim's secretary, who is disdainful of nearly everyone, including Tim * Cameron Dante (Max von Essen) ‚Äì a former actor and Steven's boyfriend (recurring first and second seasons, main third season) * Linda Avery (Anne L.

Saraqib was considered an important strategic point because of its size, being the second largest city of the province, and its geographic position at the junction of two highways going to Aleppo: one going south towards Hama, Homs and Damascus, and one going west towards Latakia. It was also used as a base to launch attacks on military convoys. On 24 March, the Syrian Army shelled the city briefly while leading a ground assault at the same time. A column of tanks entered the city to attack the defenses of the rebels, while infantry backed by snipers led the second wave to pursue the remaining fighters. The Free Syrian Army fighters fought back the first day and damaged a tank. In the fighting 18 of them were killed. After the first day, the rebels were forced to withdraw from the city after the army took full control of it. An opposition group accused the army of burning most of the shops in the town and called for observers to come in the city. After the battle, security forces and Shabiha militia searched for suspected rebels and captured at least 24 and executed them. On 28 March, the army continued their offensive and took control of Khan Sibil, a village near Saraqeb. The Arab news channel Al Jazeera showed video footage of the destruction of the city during the battle which killed dozens of armed men and civilians. ==Aftermath== On 1 November 2012 rebels attacked three, and overran at least one, army checkpoints on the road to Saraqeb, killing 8 soldiers and 7 rebels. The rebels captured and killed 2 government soldiers, beat them up and then executed them with automatic weapons.

After her modification to a barque she became part of the South Australia Company's fleet of 1836. She later served as a whaler and transport between Van Diemen's Land and Portland, Victoria. She was wrecked in 1849. ==The first 20 years== Lady Mary Pelham first appeared in Lloyd's Register with Hay as master and owner, and trade Falmouth packet.Lloyd's Register (1816), Supple. pages \\"L\\", Seq.‚ÑñL66. Her first captain, James Hay, took charge of her on 10 February 1816. Henry Cary, R.N., became master on 5 January 1821. From 1822 under Anselm Hatch, she carried Irish migrants to New York City. Lady Mary Pelham sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 5 December 1832 direct for Britain. She was carrying 800,000 dollars transhipped from . Clio had received the money, which was for merchants' account, from , which had brought it from Peru. Lady Mary Pelham arrived in Britain around 8 February 1833. ==In Australia== Lloyd's Register for 1836 showed Lady Mary Pelham with R. Ross, master, the South Australian Company as owner, and with trade London‚ÄìAustralia. She had undergone a large repair in 1830.Lloyd's Register (1836), Seq.‚ÑñL57. George Fife Angas chartered Lady Mary Pelham. She left Portsmouth for Adelaide 30 March 1836 under Captain Robert Ross, and was the third of the fleet to leave. Her only full fare-paying passengers were Cornelius Birdseye and Mrs Birdseye. There were also five assisted emigrants, several of whom were also working as crew members. Her first mate, James Doine Thompson, died at sea.Leadbeater, Maureen, Adelaide Cooperative History She arrived at Nepean Bay (Kangaroo Island) on 30 July. One source states that she had 29 passengers, all adults.Pioneers Association of South Australia. Lady Mary Pelham sailed from South Australia to Hobart to fit-out for a whaling voyage, arriving there 25 September. She departed Hobart under Captain Ross on 15 October 1836 for the South Sea Fishery. She cruised among the Solomon Islands and was reported at Carteret Harbour, New Ireland, where she spoke the US whaler Mechanic.The Sydney Monitor, 15 February 1837, p.2. In April 1837 she arrived Sourabaya in a leaky state, the crew \\"in a state of almost mutiny owing, it is said, to the conduct of the captain.\\"The South Australian Gazette, 17 March 1838, p.3. Only a small amount of whale oil had been taken and it was decided to convert the cruise to a trading voyage. Accordingly she took aboard 2,000 bags of sugar and departed for Sydney, arriving there 2 May 1838. S.G. Henty & Co. of Portland, Victoria, purchased her and refitted her in Hobart Town as a whaler. As a whaler under the Hentys, her first captain was John Mills,http://home.iprimus.com.au/bobdalrymple/Brabyn/JohnBrabynMills.htm followed in 1841 by John Harper, then in 1844 by William Dutton (1811‚Äì1878), sometimes referred to as \\"William Pelham Dutton\\". Dutton killed 100 whales in his career, the last being in 1866, and is considered one of the founders of Portland. He gave up command of Lady Mary Pelham in 1847 to Rosevear; Henty sold her that same year. She underwent repairs in Launceston and put in the charge of Captain Thomas Wing. ==Loss== Lady Mary Pelham was wrecked on 31 August 1849 at Port Fairy, Victoria, or Belfast as it was then officially named. She was anchored off the port awaiting a favourable wind when a fierce gale broke her chains. Captain Wing deliberately beached her, with the result that no lives were lost and most of her cargo was salvaged. Her back was broken and by mid-October wave action had completely broken her up. ==In art and public monuments== *The National Maritime Museum Cornwall holds a watercolor by Nicolas S. Cammillieri of Lady Mary Pelham, 1818. There is considerable controversy about the identity of this artist. The Maritime Museum, Cornwall attributes the series to a Nicholas Cammillieri (ca.1773‚Äì1880); the Peabody Essex Museum, Massachusetts to the French Nicholas Cammillieri (1768‚Äì1828), whose son Nicholas S. Cammillieri (ca.1798‚Äì1856) was also a painter of maritime subjects. *A group of monuments overlooking Reeve's Point, Kangaroo Island, marks the spot where passengers disembarked from the first four ships (Duke of York, Lady Mary Pelham, Rapid and Cygnet). == Citations References== * ==Further reading== * *Learmonth, Noel F.

Venevisi√≥n has aired the telenovela from February 13, 2012 to November 5, 2012. ==Plot== Patricia Campos (Marlene Favela), her two sisters, Virginia and Mariela, and her brother, David Campos, have grown up under the iron hand of their grandmother, Ursula (Susana Dosamantes), a wealthy landowner with a stern and domineering personality. Despite Ursula's disapproval, the teenage Patricia becomes romantically involved with Marcos (Jos√© Guillermo Cortines), a poor farm hand‚Äîbut the relationship comes to a tragic end when he is mortally wounded. Years later, still marked by the loss of Marcos, Patricia has become a bitter woman whose heart is closed to love, and has drowned her sorrow by devoting all her time to managing the family ranch as strictly as her grandmother. Patricia's, her sister's and David's father is the evil man Bruno Montesinos (Marcelo Buquet). Virginia's father is Alejandro (Fernando Carrera). The arrival of the handsome, charming, and self-assured foreman just hired at the ranch, Armando Marcano (Guy Ecker), drastically changes Patricia's life. Armando has a sister, Rebecca. While at first Patricia fights hard against the feelings he inspires in her, rejecting him, passion ends up taking over both of them and Patricia falls deeply in love. But once again, happiness will not be easy to achieve. Aside from facing her grandmother's opposition to her relationship with someone she considers beneath her, Patricia is up against a formidable rival: her beautiful and wicked cousin Fedora (Jessica Mass), who wants Armando for herself. The situation becomes even more difficult when Marcos suddenly reappears, very much alive and now a rich, ruthless man who'll stop at nothing to get Patricia back. Virginia is in love with professor Ricardo Rey (Luis Jose Santander) but he is married to drunkard Sonia and they have two children. Mariela is in love with Ramiro Melendez (Carlos Augusto Maldonado). Sonia commits suicide. Bruno rapes Virginia. Patricia marries Alejandro but Marcos kills him; she is suspected of the murder. Marcos and Fedora team up against Patricia and Armando. Ursula has a friend whose niece is lawyer Leticia Bracamontes (Marjorie de Sousa). She decides to be Patricia's lawyer. David marries Rebeca and they have a daughter. Ricardo Rey starts dating Graciela (Patty Alvarez), an ex-guardian at a prison from Mexico, doctor Alvaro's ex-fianc√©e. Fedora and Bruno kidnap Rebeca and her small daughter. Armando and David try to save them. Fedora hits Armando in the head; she advises him to go to the swamps area and cross the border. They leave David with his daughter and they take Rebecca and Armando as their hostages. Bruno is attacked. Fedora and Armando manage to escape. Marcos has illusions that he sees Satan and he almost kills his mother. He is committed at a mental hospital. The evil Teresa Rivas Gomez (Gabriela Rivero) ends up paralyzed and Virginia lets her stay in her house. Marcos admits that it was he who killed Alejandro. Leticia reveals Ricardo that, in the past, she wanted to have Graciela sentenced to life imprisonment because while she was guardian at a prison from Mexico she received millions from a very strong person to kill an inmate; Graciela decided to burn down the prison not to leave traces and 300 women died. Graciela has an accident, ends up in hospital and forces Ricardo to marry her. Virginia is imprisoned and she finds out that she is pregnant with Bruno's baby. Fedora cuts Patricia's face with a knife and, as a result, Patricia wants to break off with Armando. Fedora helps Bruno get out of the hospital. Leticia falls in love with Armando. Graciela wants to burn Virginia but both of them are traped in a room by Teresa Rivas Gomez. Ricardo wants to save them but Teresa hits him in the head. Graciela dies impaled. Both Fedora and Bruno are killed by Marcos.

It consists of a flat sheet of material full of pinholes that are arranged in a pattern which is similar to the rings in a Fresnel zone plate, but a sieve brings light to much sharper focus than a zone plate. The sieve concept, first developed in 2001, is versatile because the characteristics of the focusing behaviour can be altered to suit the application by manufacturing a sieve containing holes of several different sizes and different arrangement of the pattern of holes. Photon sieves have applications to photolithography. and are an alternative to lenses or mirrors in telescopes and terahertz lenses and antennas. When the size of sieves is smaller than one wavelength of operating light, the traditional method mentioned above to describe the diffraction patterns is not valid. The vertorial theory must be used to approximate the diffraction of light from nanosieves. In this theory, the combination of coupled-mode theory and multiple expansion method is used to give an analytical model, which can facilitate the demonstration of traditional devices such as lens, holograms, etc. ==References== * Category:Optical devices ","title":"Photon sieve"},{"id":"35268152","text":"Juyank (, also Romanized as J≈´yan·∏µ) is a village in Rudbar-e Mohammad-e Zamani Rural District, Alamut-e Gharbi District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Becoming stuck in the past can eat away at someone, and \\"letting go\\" is often easier said than done. \\"Blind Faith\\" is a political song, and addresses \\"society giving up too much control to the ruling elite\\", and blindly following in the vein of paternalism. The track \\"Lost Within\\" is about being inspired by a person or movement, and then later realizing this idealism is false. In other words, some role models become internalized and selfish, and sell out or develop materialistic motives. \\"Walk the Edge\\" is largely influenced by '80s glam metal, and contains a few riffs originally from the Retribution sessions. The song is about opiate addiction and the thin line between control and overdose. For \\"The Wasteland,\\" Fair was inspired by one of his favorite poems, The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot. He also drew influence from the Book of Revelation to create an apocalyptic theme. ==Track listingPersonnel== ;Shadows Fall *Brian Fair ‚Äì lead vocals *Jon Donais ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals *Matt Bachand ‚Äì rhythm guitar, clean vocals *Paul Romanko ‚Äì bass *Jason Bittner ‚Äì drums ;Production *Produced and engineered by Adam Dutkiewicz *Assistant engineering by Jim Fogarty *Mixed by Brian Virtue at Modernist Movement Studios *Mastered by Paul Logus at Taloowa *Album artwork and design by Aaron Marsh ==References * Official website Category:2012 albums Category:Shadows Fall albums Category:Razor & Tie albums Category:Albums produced by Adam Dutkiewicz ","title":"Fire from the Sky"},{"id":"35268299","text":"Pam is a nearly extinct, unclassified Mbum language of northern Cameroon. ==References== Category:Languages of Cameroon Category:Mbum languages ","title":"Pam language"},{"id":"35268429","text":"Caolan Owen Lavery (born 22 October 1992) is a Canadian-born Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a forward for League Two club Walsall. He has played in the English Football League for Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United, as well as on loan at Southend United, Plymouth Argyle, Chesterfield, Portsmouth, Rotherham and Bury. He has represented both Canada and Northern Ireland at youth international level and is one of only a small number of footballers to have played for both Sheffield clubs. ==Club career== Early career Lavery started his youth career in Canada, playing for the Red Deer Renegades. He then played with Northern Irish youth side Goodyear while having trials at Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic. A successful trial at Ipswich Town saw him spend two years at the club before rejecting the offer of a new deal in late 2011 and leaving the club after his academy scholarship expired. He went on to have trials at Sunderland and Leicester City in November. In December 2011 Lavery was reported to be in talks with League Two club Bradford City. Sheffield Wednesday 2012‚Äì13 season Finally, in the summer of 2012, Lavery signed for Sheffield Wednesday to join their development squad. On 28 August 2012, Lavery was included in Sheffield Wednesday's first-team squad as an unused substitute for the League Cup tie against Premier League Fulham. A 1‚Äì0 win saw Sheffield Wednesday enter the third round of the competition, but Lavery failed to get on the pitch for that game, against Premier League outfit Southampton. After continuing success in Sheffield Wednesday's development squad, Lavery was targeted by clubs for a possible loan deal and, on 25 January 2013, he signed for League Two side Southend United. He made his professional debut a week later on 2 February when Southend hosted Oxford United. 2013‚Äì14 season On 10 August 2013, Lavery was named on the bench for Wednesday for the home Football League Championship game against Burnley. This was the second game of the season and Wednesday's first home game. In the second half, with Wednesday trailing 2‚Äì1, Lavery made his debut for the club but was unable to help his side to salvage a point. In November 2013, he joined League Two club Plymouth Argyle on loan until the start of January 2014. Lavery made his debut against Dagenham & Redbridge the next day, and scored the first senior goal of his career during his first start against Bury on 21 December. Five days later, he opened a 3‚Äì2 win at former club Oxford with a goal in the first minute of the second half. The loan was then extended for a month after he scored his third goal in four starts on New Year's Day against Torquay United, but he was recalled less than a week later. Upon his return to Sheffield Wednesday, Lavery was used as a second-half substitute against Leeds United on 11 January 2014. He scored two goals, his first professional goals for Sheffield Wednesday, in their 6‚Äì0 home victory against their Yorkshire rivals. He scored a further brace for the Owls in a 4‚Äì1 win over Birmingham City on 15 March 2014. 2014‚Äì15 season On 2 February 2015, Lavery was loaned to League One team Chesterfield until 7 March, replacing Cardiff City-bound Eoin Doyle. On 9 March, having scored three goals in seven games including a last-minute winner at Milton Keynes Dons, he extended his loan until the end of the season, but was recalled by Wednesday only six days later, due to an injury to Will Keane. He scored his first Wednesday goal of the season on 21 March, as they came from behind to win 3‚Äì2 at South Yorkshire rivals Rotherham United. On 11 April he added a second, opening a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Charlton with a volley from Lewis Buxton's cross. Sheffield United On 30 August 2016, Lavery joined Sheffield United after turning down a new contract offer from city rivals Wednesday. His first goal for them was in a 4-0 home win against Swindon Town. On 29 January 2018, Lavery moved to South Yorkshire neighbours Rotherham United, on loan until the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season. He was transfer-listed by Sheffield United at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season. Lavery joined Bury on a season-long loan on 31 August 2018. He scored his first goal for Bury in a 2-1 EFL Trophy loss against Rochdale on 4 September 2018. He was released by Sheffield United at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. Walsall On 6 August 2019, Lavery signed an undisclosed-length contract with Walsall. ==International career== Lavery is eligible to play for his country of birth Canada and, as both his parents were born there, either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. Before Lavery's move to England he played for Canada U-17 in warm-up games in preparation to qualifiers for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. However, after playing time in Northern Ireland for Goodyear and then his move to Ipswich Town, he switched to the Northern Ireland national side. He made his debut for Northern Ireland U-21 on 17 November 2010 in a 3‚Äì1 loss against Scotland. He has also made three appearances for the Northern Ireland U-19 team. On 21 May 2015, Lavery was given his first call-up to the senior Northern Ireland team ahead of a friendly with Qatar and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Romania. Manager Michael O'Neill had wanted him to feature the previous Summer in a tour of South America, but Lavery was unavailable as he was the best man in his brother's wedding. ==Career statistics== {   + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Sheffield Wednesday 2012‚Äì13 Championship0000000000 - 2013‚Äì14 Championship214200000234 - 2014‚Äì15 Championship132100000142 - 2015‚Äì16 Championship0000200020 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !34!!6!!3!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!39!!6 - Southend United (loan) 2012‚Äì13 League Two3000001040 - Plymouth Argyle (loan) 2013‚Äì14 League Two8300000083 - Chesterfield (loan) 2014‚Äì15 League One8300000083 - Portsmouth (loan) 2015‚Äì16 League Two134000000134 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Sheffield United 2016‚Äì17 League One274200010304 - 2017‚Äì18 Championship3010210061 - 2018‚Äì19 Championship0000000000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !30!!4!!3!!0!!2!!1!!1!!0!!36!!5 - Rotherham United (loan) 2017‚Äì18 League One142000010152 - Bury (loan) 2018‚Äì19 League Two 235100051296 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Walsall 2019‚Äì20 League Two 2743212323410 - 2020‚Äì21 League Two 6100102091 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !33!!5!!3!!2!!2!!2!!5!!2!!43!!11 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !166!!32!!10!!2!!6!!3!!13!!3!!195!!40 } ==Honours== Club Sheffield United *EFL League One: 2016‚Äì17 Rotherham United *EFL League One play-offs: 2018 Bury *EFL League Two runner-up: 2018‚Äì19 ==References* Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Red Deer, Alberta Category:Soccer people from Alberta Category:Association football forwards Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland youth international footballers Category:Northern Ireland under-21 international footballers Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Canadian expatriate soccer players Category:Canada men's youth international soccer players Category:Canadian people of Northern Ireland descent Category:Expatriate association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:English Football League players Category:Canadian expatriate sportspeople in England ","title":"Caolan Lavery"},{"id":"35268473","text":"Halalabad or Helalabad () may refer to: *Helalabad, Fars *Halalabad, Abyek, Qazvin *Halalabad, Qazvin ","title":"Halalabad"},{"id":"35268474","text":"To is an unclassified Mbum language of northern Cameroon and the Central African Republic.

At the time of his enlistment in 1914, he was a 15-year-old schoolboy living in the parental home at 25 Arthur Street in Gloucester. He falsified his age (and place of birth) to enlist in the local Territorial Force battalion, claiming that he was 19 years of age.Birth certificate and miscellaneous documents, Worsley family papers. In 1916, Digby-Worsley was evacuated from France to the Red Cross Hospital in Gloucester with a severe case of trench foot, after serving in Flanders for only two months. Digby-Worsley's mother then attempted to have him excused from further duty at the front on grounds of age. By this time, however, Digby-Worsley had already been appointed as a drill instructor, and the Middlesex Regiment clearly felt that his services were needed to train recruits at home, which he did until his transfer to the King's Own Scottish Borderers.Miscellaneous records and correspondence, Worsley family papers. After the war, Digby-Worsley lived at Hargate Forest on Broadwater Down in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. He pursued a successful career in theatrical management, becoming manager of the Sadler's Wells Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.GB 1032 S/SWT/2, Sadler's Wells Theatre Archive; \\"D'Oyly Carte Boss A Real Who's Who,\\" Oakland Tribune, 13 August 1955. == Military career == Bristol F.2b. Bruce Digby-Worsley enlisted in the territorials on 21 September 1914 and served with the 2/5th Gloucestershire Regiment (TF) until July 1915. He was then transferred to the Regular Army and served with the 16th and 24th Middlesex Regiment until March 1917, and the 2/5th King's Own Scottish Borderers (TF) until August 1917, receiving a promotion to lance- corporal in June 1917. Digby-Worsley then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as an officer cadet (29 August 1917) and received his commission on 3 January 1918, with the rank of probationary second lieutenant. Digby-Worsley returned to France in April 1918, assigned to No. 88 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. The London Gazette announced that probationary Second Lieutenant Digby- Worsley (late General List, Royal Flying Corps) was confirmed in his rank as second lieutenant (observer officer), as of 24 July 1918. Digby-Worsley is credited with 16 aerial victories, all of them as an observer in a Bristol F.2b, and all within a mere four months of operations. The observer's first four victories were from Bristol F.2b (C787) piloted by Lieutenant Kenneth Conn, a Canadian. On 5 June 1918, he scored a double victory, destroying two Albatros D.V aircraft over Messines, West Flanders, Belgium. The following month, on 1 July 1918, Digby-Worsley racked up another double, taking out two Fokker D.VII planes west of Westrozebeke, West Flanders, destroying one in flames and sending the other out of control. His next seven victories, numbers 5 through 11, were all from Bristol F.2b (C4061), piloted by Lieutenant Charles Findlay, a Scottish flying ace credited with 14 aerial victories. He was credited with his fifth on 30 July 1918 when he sent a Pfalz D.III out of control over Richebourg, France. His sixth kill took place on 6 August 1918, when a Fokker D.VII was destroyed in flames over Ploegsteert, Hainaut, Belgium. This was sweet revenge, for it was at Ploegsteert Wood that his first cousin, Trooper Eardley Gilbert Wallis \\"Bertie\\" Digby-Worsley of the 11th Hussars, had been killed in action on 22 October 1914. Bertie Digby Worsley was the third of 58 hussars of the 11th (\\"Cherry Pickers\\") to be killed in the First World War.Miscellaneous records, Worsley family papers. The next four victories, numbers 7 through 10, all took place on 11 August 1918. In the morning, two Fokker D.VII planes were sent out of control over Clery, France. In the afternoon, two more D.VII planes were taken out over M√©ricourt, Pas-de- Calais, France, one destroyed in flames, and the other sent out of control. His eleventh kill took place the following day, on 12 August 1918. A Fokker D.VII was destroyed east of Biaches, Somme, France. Digby-Worsley's remaining victories, numbers 12 through 16, were all from Bristol F.2b (E2216), piloted by Conn, who was the leading ace of No. 88 Squadron with 20 victories. His twelfth took place on 5 September 1918, when a Fokker D.VII was sent out of control northeast of Armenti√®res, Nord, France. On 16 September 1918, he scored a double victory, destroying two Fokker D.VII aircraft northeast of Harbourdin Airfield, near Lille, Nord, France. Four days later, on 20 September 1918, Digby-Worsley racked up another double, sending one Fokker D.VII out of control over Quesnoy, France and destroying another southeast of Quesnoy. The latter was his sixteenth and final victory. That sixteenth victory for Digby-Worsley was the only one in which the identity of his victim is known. Leutnant Helmut Gantz of Jasta 56 died of his wounds the following day. That last victory was also the only one shared with other crews. It was shared with four other aviators: Captain Edgar Johnston, Lieutenant Walter Grant, Lieutenant George Poole, and Sergeant Charles Hill. Pilot Edgar Johnston was an Australian flying ace who was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and was credited with twenty aerial victories. His observer Walter Grant was also an Australian flying ace, and was credited with seven aerial victories. Pilot George Poole was a British flying ace credited with five aerial victories. His observer Charles Hill was a British flying ace credited with seven victories. The London Gazette reported that Digby-Worsley relinquished his commission due to illness that had been contracted while he had been on active service. Further, it was noted that he was permitted to retain his rank. This was to be effective the following day, on 26 April 1919. == Gallery of downed aircraft == Image:ZK-DVA2 IMG 3492-Edit.jpgAlbatros D.V Victories 1,2 Image:Pfalzdiiia.jpgPfalz D.III Victory 5 Image:Fokker D.

Unable to obtain a visa for herself, she was deported to Auschwitz from Berlin early in 1942. The book describes the fate of the brothers‚Äô family, how the children managed to survive the defeat of the French army by the German invaders, who occupied France, the care they received from Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants and their rescue by members of the American Friend Service Committee, who obtained visas for these Jewish brothers to come to the United States in 1941. The book tells the story of the education these young German refugees received, their marriages, the families they created and the contributions they made to their American communities and society. It is the story of the two young immigrants, who fled for their lives . . . and it is the story of America.\\" (Amazon). ==References== Category:American lawyers Category:2019 deaths Category:Jewish writers Category:1930 births Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Boston Latin School alumni ","title":"C.

A first-round draft pick in the 1999 MLB Draft, his career was slowed by injuries. He pitched in minor league baseball for 14 seasons before his first promotion to Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2013. He made his MLB debut with the New York Mets on April 1, 2013. ==Career== Rice attended Royal High School in Simi Valley, California. He played for the high school baseball team as a pitcher. The Baltimore Orioles drafted Rice in the first round, with the 44th overall selection, of the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in minor league baseball for the Orioles organization through 2005, reaching Class AA, then signed with the Texas Rangers in 2006, reaching Class AAA. He made only eight appearances in 2007 due to injury, and had surgery on his flexor tendon in 2008. Rice returned to baseball pitching in independent leagues, playing for the Long Island Ducks in 2008 and the Newark Bears in 2009. He then pitched in the Colorado Rockies organization in 2010 and for the Chicago Cubs in spring training in 2011, but was released. Rice joined the York Revolution of the Atlantic League in 2011. During the season, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Rice and assigned him to their Class AA minor league team. The Dodgers invited Rice to spring training in 2012, but he did not make the team, and was instead assigned to pitch for the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). New York Mets Invited to spring training by the New York Mets in 2013, Rice made the Mets' Opening Day roster, the first time he was named to an MLB roster after 480 appearances in 14 minor league seasons. He made his MLB debut on April 1, 2013, striking out Nick Hundley and Cameron Maybin and retiring Will Venable on a ground out in one inning of work. Rice made 73 appearances, and recorded a 3.71 earned run average (ERA). After struggling through the start of 2014 season, pitching to a 5.93 ERA and 1.98 walks plus hits per inning pitched in 32 appearances, the Mets demoted Rice to the Las Vegas 51s of the PCL on June 23. He underwent elbow surgery in July to remove a bone spur. The Mets removed Rice from the 40-man roster after the 2014 season, making him a free agent. Rice re-signed with the Mets on a minor league deal with an invite to spring training in December. Arizona Diamondbacks Rice signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks in December 2015. He was released on May 9, 2016. York Revolution Rice resigned with the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. This marks Rice's return to York since 2011. He became a free agent after the 2016 season. ==References * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Aberdeen IronBirds players Category:Albuquerque Isotopes players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Arizona League Rangers players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Bluefield Orioles players Category:Bowie Baysox players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Clinton LumberKings players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Delmarva Shorebirds players Category:Estrellas Orientales players Category:Frederick Keys players Category:Frisco RoughRiders players Category:Gulf Coast Orioles players Category:Las Vegas 51s players Category:Long Island Ducks players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Mets players Category:Newark Bears players Category:Ottawa Lynx players Category:People from Simi Valley, California Category:Phoenix Desert Dogs players Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:Sportspeople from Ventura County, California Category:Tulsa Drillers players Category:York Revolution players ","title":"Scott Rice"},{"id":"35268700","text":"Katekan (, also Romanized as KatekƒÅn and KategƒÅn) is a village in Rudbar-e Mohammad-e Zamani Rural District, Alamut-e Gharbi District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The third-party provider is responsible for providing the hardware for the server, and also for preliminary maintenance. This is in contrast to multitenancy where multiple client organizations share a single server, or an on-premises deployment where the client organization hosts their own software instance. Managed Private Clouds also fall under the larger umbrella of cloud computing. == Adoption == The need for private clouds arose due to enterprises requiring a dedicated service and infrastructure for their cloud computing needs, such as for business critical operations, improved security and better control over their resources. Managed private cloud adoption is a popular choice among organizations, and has on the rise due to enterprises requiring a dedicated cloud environment, and preferring to avoid having to deal with management, maintenance, or future upgradation costs for the associated infrastructure and services. Such operational costs are unavoidable in on-premises private cloud data centers. ==Advantages and Challenges of Managed Private Cloud== A managed private cloud cuts down on upkeep costs by outsourcing infrastructure management and maintenance to the managed cloud provider. It is easier to integrate an organization's existing software, services, and applications into a dedicated cloud hosting infrastructure which can be customized to the client's needs, instead of a public cloud platform, whose hardware or infrastructure/software platform cannot be individualized to each client. Customers who choose a managed private cloud deployment usually choose them because of their desire for an efficient cloud deployment, but also have the need for service customization or integration only available in a single- tenant environment. This chart shows key benefits of the different types of deployments, and shows the overlap between these cloud solutions. {  - ! Feature !! Multi-tenant !! On-Premises !!

While server upkeep and maintenance is handled by the service provider, including network management and security, the client is charged for all such services. It is up to the potential client to determine if a managed private cloud solution aligns with their business objectives and budget. While the service-provider maintains the upkeep of servers, network, and platform infrastructure, sensitive data is typically not stored on managed private clouds as it may leave business- critical information prone to breaches via third-party attacks on the cloud service provider.

The company was named after a horse Garibaldi and Hyde bet on when having a business meeting on the lawn of Arlington National Raceway. Lotuspool's stable of artists includes Zoom, Panel Donor, Bully Pulpit, Suneaters, and The Weightmen. In 2012, the year of Lotuspool's 20th anniversary, Lotuspool moved to change music distribution by offering all Lotuspool albums for free download and streaming. ==History== Early Years On July 7, 1992, Lyons Township High School graduates, Chris Garibaldi and Matt Hyde went to Arlington National Raceway to discuss the prospect of starting a record label to release the music of their high school friend Mark Henning, frontman of the band, Zoom. With their remaining seven dollars, Garibaldi and Hyde placed a bet on the seventh horse in the seventh race. The horse, Lotuspool came in at 21 to 1 odds and the winnings funded an evening of steak, imported beer, and merriment. During the victory dinner, Hyde suggested the label be named after their equine benefactor. Garibaldi seconded the motion. That winter, Garibaldi and Hyde moved to Lawrence, Kansas to start the label and focus on the thriving local Lawrence music scene. Lotuspool then released a Zoom 7‚Äù and Zoom‚Äôs self-titled debut album. They ran Lotuspool headquarters from the farmhouse of a 238-acre farm, which was one of the largest dairy farms in Kansas back in the 1960s. The dairy facility and barn were both out of commission during the Lotuspool days, but the label put both structures for use during some of the recording sessions held on the farm. Sole Proprietorship In 1994, it was apparent to both Garibaldi and Hyde that their respective interests related to Lotuspool were at different levels. The two amicably split leaving Garibaldi as the sole owner of Lotuspool. Hyde and Garibaldi continue to be close friends. Hyde is now the owner of 715, a Lawrence, Kansas restaurant with meat-centric cuisine and an upscale ambiance. Productivity and Success Lotuspool thrived in its early years, releasing a 20 band compilation, ‚ÄúFeast of the Sybarites‚Äù, two Panel Donor records, a Bully Pulpit 7‚Äù, and a Bully Pulpit full-length CD. During this time John Peel became a Lotuspool fan; Zoom and Panel Donor were signed to larger labels; Lotuspool became one of the first 10 labels on the internet as they joined the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA); Lotuspool was pursued for acquisition by three major labels; and the Lotuspool ownership struck up an alliance with James Grauerholz and the author William S. Burroughs. The alliance mostly centered on a mutual love of firearms and the loose shooting restrictions associated with the Lotuspool farm zoning, but in addition, Grauerholz was a generous friend to Lotuspool. He produced the initial Panel Donor record with Matt Nalbach and was very generous when it came to Lotuspool borrowing his recording equipment for Bully Pulpit records. Dark Times In 1997, Garibaldi and a few band members found themselves at odds and unable to continue working harmoniously. The weight of that disappointment caused Garibaldi to turn his focus away from the label. Lotuspool dropped off IUMA, but did put up its own web site at http://www.lotuspool.com/. In addition, Lotuspool released the temporarily shelved Bully Pulpit album, ‚ÄúJockeys‚Äù free and virtually, which served as a precursor to the label‚Äôs future. Still, the label was mostly dormant up until early 2010. Rebirth In 2011, Lotuspool revived itself by releasing all Lotuspool albums for online consumption. In addition, Lotuspool started working to license and release more music. In October, 2011, Lotuspool released Suneaters first album, ‚ÄúSuneaters I‚Äù. Furthermore, Lotuspool made an aggressive move to change the music industry paradigm by posting all of its albums for free download and streaming. Free Music: Listeners First! Bands Next! Labels Last! While SOPA and PIPA had been held at bay, Lotuspool was not going to stand idly by and wait for the next attack on a listener‚Äôs right to download music and share it for free. Lotuspool now has an expansive online presence where Lotuspool music can be purchased or enjoyed free. == Catalog == * Bully Pulpit * Heidi Gluck * Hollow Body * Krafty LoveLordz * Mild 7 * Panel Donor * Poster Children * The Weightmen * Suneaters * Zoom ==References== * Leyser, Yony.

While the spectral lines strongly indicate that the star is of spectral type F2V-IV, previous analyses have stated that the star is a G8III giant star and an F0V main-sequence star. Located in the constellation Cetus, the star has a metallicity only 1% that of the Sun. It is nearing the end of its lifetime on the main sequence, and will soon begin the transition into a red giant. ==Claims of planet detection== In 2012 it was announced that HIP 11952 had two giant planets, this would have made it the oldest and most metal-poor planet host star known. This would have posed a challenge to planetary formation, as the chances of a planet forming so early in the Universe's history, with such a small amount of heavy elements with which to form planets, are believed to be remote. Further measurements of HIP 11952 were made on 35 nights over about 150 days, from August 7, 2012 to January 6, 2013, using the newly installed high resolution spectrograph HARPS-N at the 3.58m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo telescope on La Palma Island (Canary Islands) and HARPS at the European Southern Observatory's 3.6m telescope on La Silla (Chile). Following their analysis, they were able to confidently exclude, through non-detection, the presence of the two giant planets with periods of 6.95 ¬± 0.01 days and 290.0 ¬± 16. 2 days. They also reasoned that the previously mistaken detections were probably due to instrument measurement errors. Re-analysis of the FEROS data revealed a problem with the barycentric correction used to derive the radial velocities, this error had led to the erroneous detection claim. ==See also== * Population II star ==ReferencesNotes== Category:Cetus (constellation) 011952 Category:F-type main-sequence stars 016031 BD-13 0482 ","title":"HIP 11952"},{"id":"35268758","text":"The Sogamoso Dam is a concrete-face rock-fill dam on the Sogamoso River in northern Colombia.

The Supreme Court of Canada held that full board meetings of the Ontario Labour Relations Board to discuss matters of policy in relation to a case did not violate the principles of natural justice. ==Background== This action arose from a labour dispute resulting from the closure of a corrugated container plant in Hamilton operated by Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd. on April 26, 1983. Prior to this closure, the union and the management had been engaged in collective bargaining, which resulted in an agreement dated April 22, 1983. The union was never informed of management's decision to close the plant. The International Woodworkers of America filed an application with the Ontario Labour Relations Board for relief, arguing that the management had not bargained in good faith as they did not disclose information relevant to the negotiations during the process. The Board had previously decided a similar issue in United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America, Local 504 v. Westinghouse Canada Ltd.,[1980] OLRB Rep 577, aff'd (1980), 80 CLLC 14,062. and held that there was a duty to disclose information relating to plans \\"which, if implemented during the term of the collective agreement, would have a significant impact on the economic lives of bargaining unit employees\\". Both the union and the employer argued that the Westinghouse test should be modified. Management argued that speculative information did not need to be disclosed (and on the facts of the case the decision regarding the plant closure could not be definitively established). The union argued that there is a duty disclose if the employer was \\"seriously considering an action which if carried out will have a serious impact on employees.\\" After a three-member panel heard the arguments, they brought up the policy issue regarding the Westinghouse test to a \\"full Board meeting\\" of all members of the Ontario Labour Relations Board. According to the Board, the purpose of the full Board meeting was to discuss issues of policy that affect future cases. It had been the custom of the Board to hold such meetings in order to discuss decisions in order to create certainty and uniformity in their decisions, although the full Board meeting did not have power to bind individual panels in their decisions.[1983] OLRB Rep 1985 at 2001. Following this meeting, the panel returned a ruling in favour of the union, holding that the employers had bargained in bad faith, upholding the Westinghouse test. The employer applied for re-consideration of the decision, arguing that the full Board meeting was illegal because it violated the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice, that decisions could not be made unless the parties were heard. In this case, although the three members who heard the case were part of the full Board meeting, the employers argued that the full Board meeting did not have the opportunity to hear the arguments first hand and were not entitled to make a decision on their case. The Board upheld its decision, and the case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue of whether the rules of natural justice allow a full Board meeting to take place, given the policy considerations relevant to the Board.[1990] 1 SCR 282 at para 69. ==Opinion of the Court== A majority of the Court held that the full Board meetings were justified in order for individual members of the Board to benefit from the collective experience of all its members, and to ensure uniformity of decisions rendered by the Board.Ibid at para 73. The Court considered \\"whether the disadvantages involved in this practice are sufficiently important to warrant a holding that it constitutes a breach of the rules of natural justice, or whether full Board meetings are consistent with these rules, provided that certain safeguards be observed.\\"Ibid at para 74. In weighing these considerations, the Court recognized the inherent problems associated with the full Board meetings, which compromised the independence of panels to decide individual cases: > It is obvious that no outside interference may be used to compel or pressure > a decision maker to participate in discussions on policy issues raised by a > case on which he must render a decision. It also goes without saying that a > formalized consultation process could not be used to force or induce > decision makers to adopt positions with which they do not agree. > Nevertheless, discussions with colleagues do not constitute, in and of > themselves, infringements on the panel members' capacity to decide the > issues at stake independently. A discussion does not prevent a decision > maker from adjudicating in accordance with his own conscience and opinions > nor does it constitute an obstacle to this freedom. Whatever discussion may > take place, the ultimate decision will be that of the decision maker for > which he assumes full responsibility.Ibid at para 80. Nonetheless, the Court found that since the full Board meetings were limited to discussions of policy and not factual findings, they were satisfied that the meetings did not influence or pressure the individual three-member panels deciding each case.Ibid at para 94. Gonthier J. summarized the court's opinion: > The advantages of an institutionalized consultation process are obvious and > I cannot agree with the proposition that this practice necessarily conflicts > with the rules of natural justice. The rules of natural justice must have > the flexibility required to take into account the institutional pressures > faced by modern administrative tribunals as well as the risks inherent in > such a practice. ... > The consultation process adopted by the Board formally recognizes the > disadvantages inherent in full board meetings, namely that the judicial > independence of the panel members may be fettered by such a practice and > that the parties do not have the opportunity to respond to all the arguments > raised at the meeting. The safeguards attached to this consultation process > are, in my opinion, sufficient to allay any fear of violations of the rules > of natural justice provided as well that the parties be advised of any new > evidence or grounds and given an opportunity to respond. The balance so > achieved between the rights of the parties and the institutional pressures > the Board faces are consistent with the nature and purpose of the rules of > natural justice.Ibid at para 96. ==Aftermath== The Supreme Court of Canada re-affirmed its decision in Tremblay v. Quebec (Commission des affaires sociales)[1992] 1 SCR 952 and Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board).[2001] 1 SCR 221 They further clarified that meetings involving members not on the panel hearing the case could constitute inappropriate influence if the applicant could show that there was systemic pressure acting on the panels. ==References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian administrative case law Category:Canadian labour case law Category:1990 in Canadian case law Category:United Steelworkers litigation Category:History of Hamilton, Ontario Category:Papermaking ","title":"International Woodworkers of America, Local 2-69 v Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd"},{"id":"35268873","text":"Ferdinand Schmutzer (21 May 1870 ‚Äì 26 October 1928) was an Austrian photographer and engraver. == References == * == External links == * Category:Austrian photographers Category:Austrian engravers Category:1870 births Category:1928 deaths Category:19th-century engravers Category:20th- century engravers Category:20th-century printmakers ","title":"Ferdinand Schmutzer"},{"id":"35268892","text":"The dimple sign or Fitzpatrick's sign is a dermatological sign in which lateral pressure on the skin produces a depression.

Loss and Reconstruction Sch√ºtz's score for the opera was lost sometime during the Thirty Years' War. However, German musicologist Reinhard Seehafer managed to reconstruct the opera in 2007. ==Synopsis== The opera is divided into a prologue and five acts.  Prologue  Ovid delivers in seven stanzas of six verses the power of love.  Act I  Shepherds are terrorized by a monster in the countryside. Apollo arrives and slays the monster to the rejoice and celebration of the shepherds.  Act II  Cupid and his mother are engaged in bitter dialogue before being interrupted by the entrance of Apollo. Apollo mocks Cupid, and Cupid swears revenge. A choir of shepherds sings the glories of Cupid.  Act III  Cupid avenges himself by making Apollo fall in love with Daphne. Shepherds praise the benefits of hunting.  Act IV  Cupid celebrates his triumph with Venus. The shepherds sing of love.  Act V  Apollo chases Daphne until she calls upon the help of her father Peneus. Peneus turns Daphne into a laurel tree, eternally bestowing her leaves on poets. Shepherds and nymphs dance around the tree. ==Modern scholarly reevaluation== Although long unquestioned as \\"the first German opera\\" the performance started no notable tradition in Germany, and Wolfram Steude (1991) made the controversial proposal that Dafne was in fact a spoken drama with inserted song and ballet numbers. Consequently recent publications such as the latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Opera are more cautious in attribution of the \\"first German opera\\" claim.

A CalArts graduate, following three independent album productions, Holter released Tragedy as her first official studio album in 2011. Ekstasis, followed in 2012. After signing with Domino Records in 2013, she released the albums Loud City Song (2013), Have You in My Wilderness (2015) and the live- in-the-studio album In the Same Room (2017). Most recently, her double album Aviary was released in 2018. Holter has also collaborated with other musicians, including Nite Jewel, Laurel Halo, Ducktails, Linda Perhacs, Michael Pisaro, and Jean-Michel Jarre. ==Biography== Holter was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At age six her family moved to Los Angeles, where she later attended the Alexander Hamilton High School. She studied music at The University of Michigan for four years, graduating with a degree in composition. After seeing Michael Pisaro perform an avant-garde composition in Michigan, she was inspired to study with him at CalArts, where she graduated from another composition program. Holter contributed songs to multiple compilation albums in 2008. In 2010, she began playing with Linda Perhacs' band and released a CD-R titled Celebration and a collection of live recordings. Following three independently produced albums ‚Äì Phaedra Runs to Russia (2007), Cookbook (2008) and Celebration (2010), Holter's official debut album, Tragedy , was released in August 2011 on Leaving Records. Inspired by Euripides' Greek play Hippolytus, the album received generally favorable reviews and was named one of NPR's \\"Best Outer Sound Albums of 2011\\". Holter released her second album, Ekstasis , in March 2012 on the RVNG Intl. label. The album drew comparisons to works by such artists as Laurie Anderson, Julianna Barwick, Kate Bush, Joanna Newsom, Grouper, and Stereolab, and received many positive reviews.Ekstasis reviews: *Pitchfork: *NME: *BBC: *The Quietus: *PopMatters: *Consequence of Sound: *Beats Per Minute: *Drowned in Sound: *musicOMH: *FACT: Holter spent three years making the album, whose title comes from the Greek word meaning \\"outside of oneself.\\" The music video for album track \\"Moni Mon Amie\\", directed by Yelena Zhelezov, was also released in March. In addition to collaborating with other California-based musicians like Nite Jewel (Ramona Gonzalez), Holter released her third album, Loud City Song , in August 2013 on Domino Records. Unlike her preceding albums, which were recorded mostly alone in her bedroom, Holter recorded Loud City Song with an ensemble of musicians. In 2015, Holter released the album Have You in My Wilderness, which became her most successful charting release to date. She also contributed to Ducktails' fifth studio album, St. Catherine, with her bandmates Chris Votek and Andrew Tholl. Holter collaborated with Jean-Michel Jarre on a song for the second part of the Electronica double album, released on July 18, 2016. In November 2016, she curated her own program during the tenth anniversary edition of Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht. This program included performances by Laurel Halo, Josephine Foster, Maya Dunietz, Jessica Moss and other artists. In September 2017, she performed a world premier of her scoring of the 1928 silent French film The Passion of Joan of Arc on September 29 at the FIGat7th in downtown Los Angeles. In September 2018, Holter announced her sixth commercially released album, Aviary, and released the lead single \\"I Shall Love 2\\". She followed it with another single, \\"Words I Heard\\", before the album's release on October 26. ==Personal life== Holter was previously in a relationship with former Real Estate guitarist and Ducktails frontman Matt Mondanile. In 2015, she contributed to his Ducktails album, St. Catherine. In the wake of sexual misconduct allegations made against Mondanile, Holter divulged that Mondanile was \\"emotionally abusive to the point where I had to have a lawyer intervene and was afraid for my life.\\" ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  US Heat ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  BEL (FL) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  BEL (WA) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  NLD ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  NOR ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  SWI ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" Phaedra Runs to Russia  *Released: 2007 *Label: self- released *Format: CD-R  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Eating the Stars  *Released: 2007 *Label: Human Ear Music *Format: CD-R  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Cookbook  *Released: 2008 *Label: Sleepy Mammal Sound *Format: CD-R  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Celebration  *Released: November 12, 2010 *Label: Engraved Glass *Format: CD  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Tragedy  *Released: August 30, 2011 *Label: Leaving *Formats: LP, CD, digital download  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Ekstasis  *Released: March 8, 2012 *Label: RVNG *Formats: LP, CD, digital download  49  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Loud City Song  *Released: August 19, 2013 *Label: Domino *Formats: LP, CD, digital download  19  60  140  91  20  88  103 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Have You in My Wilderness  *Released: September 25, 2015 *Label: Domino *Formats: LP, CD, digital download  3  56  107  36  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  29 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Aviary  *Release date: October 26, 2018 *Label: Domino *Formats: LP, CD, digital download  16  81  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  99  73 } Live albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of live albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  BEL (FL) - ! scope=\\"row\\" Live Recordings  *Released: 2010 *Label: NNA Tapes *Format: MC  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" In the Same Room  *Released: March 31, 2017 *Label: Domino Documents *Format: LP, CD, digital download  126 } ==ReferencesLive from NYC's Le Poisson Rouge on NPR * Julia Holter Julia Holter * Julia Holter by Ben Vida Bomb Category:American electronic musicians Category:American indie pop musicians Category:Avant-garde keyboardists Category:California Institute of the Arts alumni Category:Living people Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:Songwriters from California Category:1984 births Category:American women in electronic music Category:Domino Recording Company artists Category:University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance alumni Category:21st-century American women singers Category:Musicians from Milwaukee Category:21st-century American singers ","title":"Julia Holter"},{"id":"35269060","text":"The Action of 13 November 1943 was a submarine engagement of World War II. It resulted in the sinking of the Japanese Navy's Kaidai Junsen Type B1 submarine I-34 in the Strait of Malacca by the British Royal Navy submarine HMS Taurus. I-34 was on a Yanagi Mission, an underwater convoy secretly shipping goods between Japan and their German allies. ==Background== The Japanese submarine I-34 under commander Irie Tatsushi, departed Kure on the first leg of a \\"Yanagi\\" mission to Nazi-occupied France. At the time she was the third Japanese submarine to undertake such a mission. Code-breakers at Hut 7 in Bletchley Park, however, intercepted and deciphered radio traffic transmitted in diplomatic code concerning I-34's mission between Tokyo and Berlin. The message was then relayed to the submarine operating in the area: HMS Taurus under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mervyn Wingfield operating from a base in Ceylon. On the morning of 11 November I-34 departed Seletar for Penang. Before the submarine would have entered the South Atlantic, the Germans had planned to refuel I-34 in the Indian Ocean from a supply ship. When she departed I-34 was carrying a cargo of tin, tungsten, raw rubber and opium. ==Action== On the morning of 13 November 1943, off Penang the officer of the watch on Taurus sighted the large submarine I-34 running on the surface at fourteen knots despite a rain squall. Wingfield fired a spread of six torpedoes, one of which hit I-34's starboard side just below her conning tower; she sank rapidly, along with 84 of her crew. Only fourteen survivors managed to escape the wreck and were rescued by a Malay junk. The following morning, a Japanese subchaser CH-20 from Penang attacked Taurus. Due to the shallow water in the region, when Wingfield tried to evade the attack by diving, Taurus' bow became stuck in the soft, muddy seabed. Fortunately, the explosions from a pattern of depth charges dropped over Taurus shook her free. Wingfield went to periscope depth, surfaced and engaged CH-20 with his deck gun, severely damaging the subchaser. Thirteen were killed, including the captain, and another seventeen wounded, but before any further action could follow, a Japanese aircraft came into view and forced Wingfield into an emergency dive, which endangered the sub (it had taken on almost a ton of water.) Taurus, however, escaped with only minor damage and managed to make it back to her base at Ceylon. Following the loss of I-34 the Imperial Japanese Navy diverted all Europe-bound submarines away from Penang. I-34 was the first Japanese submarine to be sunk by a Royal Navy submarine. ==Notes== Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:1943 in British Malaya Category:World War II operations and battles of the Southeast Asia Theatre A Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Submarine warfare in World War II Category:Military history of Ceylon in World War II Category:November 1943 events Category:Japan‚ÄìUnited Kingdom military relations ","title":"Action of 13 November 1943"},{"id":"35269078","text":"A falcon modeled on the work of Chokuan Soga (1720) was an ukiyo-e artist and painter who was known for his bird-and-flower paintings.

It can be considered an intermediate problem between regression and classification. Examples of ordinal regression are ordered logit and ordered probit. Ordinal regression turns up often in the social sciences, for example in the modeling of human levels of preference (on a scale from, say, 1‚Äì5 for \\"very poor\\" through \\"excellent\\"), as well as in information retrieval. In machine learning, ordinal regression may also be called ranking learning. ==Linear models for ordinal regression== Ordinal regression can be performed using a generalized linear model (GLM) that fits both a coefficient vector and a set of thresholds to a dataset. Suppose one has a set of observations, represented by length- vectors through , with associated responses through , where each is an ordinal variable on a scale . For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we assume is a non-decreasing vector, that is, . To this data, one fits a length- coefficient vector and a set of thresholds with the property that . This set of thresholds divides the real number line into disjoint segments, corresponding to the response levels. The model can now be formulated as :\\\\Pr(y \\\\le i  \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sigma(\\\\theta_i - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}) or, the cumulative probability of the response being at most is given by a function (the inverse link function) applied to a linear function of . Several choices exist for ; the logistic function :\\\\sigma(\\\\theta_i - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\\\theta_i - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x})}} gives the ordered logit model, while using the probit function gives the ordered probit model. A third option is to use an exponential function :\\\\sigma(\\\\theta_i - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\exp(-\\\\exp(\\\\theta_i - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x})) which gives the proportional hazards model. Latent variable model The probit version of the above model can be justified by assuming the existence of a real-valued latent variable (unobserved quantity) , determined by :y^* = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\varepsilon where is normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance, conditioned on . The response variable results from an \\"incomplete measurement\\" of , where one only determines the interval into which falls: : y = \\\\begin{cases} 1 ~~ \\\\text{if} ~~ y^* \\\\le \\\\theta_1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 ~~ \\\\text{if} ~~ \\\\theta_1 < y^* \\\\le \\\\theta_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 ~~ \\\\text{if} ~~ \\\\theta_2 < y^* \\\\le \\\\theta_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ K ~~ \\\\text{if}~~ \\\\theta_{K-1} < y^*. \\\\end{cases} Defining and , the above can be summarized as if and only if . From these assumptions, one can derive the conditional distribution of as : \\\\begin{align} P(y = k  \\\\mathbf{x}) & = P(\\\\theta_{k-1} < y^* \\\\le \\\\theta_k  \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = P(\\\\theta_{k-1} < \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\varepsilon \\\\le \\\\theta_k) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\Phi(\\\\theta_k - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\Phi(\\\\theta_{k-1} - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\end{align} where is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and takes on the role of the inverse link function . The log-likelihood of the model for a single training example , can now be stated as :\\\\log\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}  \\\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^K [y_i = k] \\\\log [\\\\Phi(\\\\theta_k - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_i) - \\\\Phi(\\\\theta_{k-1} - \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_i) (using the Iverson bracket .) The log-likelihood of the ordered logit model is analogous, using the logistic function instead of . ==Alternative models== In machine learning, alternatives to the latent-variable models of ordinal regression have been proposed. An early result was PRank, a variant of the perceptron algorithm that found multiple parallel hyperplanes separating the various ranks; its output is a weight vector and a sorted vector of thresholds , as in the ordered logit/probit models.

The machine was originally developed by Atron Corporation as the Atron 501, introduced in 1969. It was marketed primarily for remote job entry applications and promoted as The Peripheral Processor. Two related models from Mohawk were the 1200 and the 2300. ==Description== The system had a base memory of 4 KB of core memory with a 2 Œºs cycle time, expandable to 32 KB. It supported one to four input/output channels with up to 16 devices per channel. It offered a choice of line printers between 280 and 1250 lines per minute (lpm), a 400 cards per minute (cpm) card reader, a 160 columns per second card punch, a paper tape reader, a 2.48 MB disk storage unit, and 7 and 9-track half-inch magnetic tape drives. An optional asynchronous terminal could be attached as a console. The system supported synchronous communications at up to 9600 baud, and usually served as a remote job entry system to a larger mainframe computer. The remote job entry software provided full support for the HASP multi-leaving protocol, among others.2780 - ==See also== George Cogar ==References *Mohawk Data Sciences at the Computer Museum History Center *MDS 2400 manuals at Bitsavers.org Category:Remote job entry ","title":"MDS 2400"},{"id":"35269346","text":"In statistics, groups of individual data points may be classified as belonging to any of various statistical data types, e.g. categorical (\\"red\\", \\"blue\\", \\"green\\"), real number (1.68, -5, 1.7e+6), odd number(1,3,5) etc. The data type is a fundamental component of the semantic content of the variable, and controls which sorts of probability distributions can logically be used to describe the variable, the permissible operations on the variable, the type of regression analysis used to predict the variable, etc. The concept of data type is similar to the concept of level of measurement, but more specific: For example, count data require a different distribution (e.g. a Poisson distribution or binomial distribution) than non-negative real-valued data require, but both fall under the same level of measurement (a ratio scale). Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in degree Celsius or degree Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation. Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented. Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)Mosteller, F., & Tukey, J. W. (1977). Data analysis and regression. Boston: Addison-Wesley. distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)Nelder, J. A. (1990).

Leiden: DSWO Press The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. \\"The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer\\" (Hand, 2004, p. 82).Hand, D. J. (2004).

Some examples: *Random vectors. The individual elements may or may not be correlated. Examples of distributions used to describe correlated random vectors are the multivariate normal distribution and multivariate t-distribution. In general, there may be arbitrary correlations between any elements and any others; however, this often becomes unmanageable above a certain size, requiring further restrictions on the correlated elements. *Random matrices. Random matrices can be laid out linearly and treated as random vectors; however, this may not be an efficient way of representing the correlations between different elements. Some probability distributions are specifically designed for random matrices, e.g. the matrix normal distribution and Wishart distribution. *Random sequences. These are sometimes considered to be the same as random vectors, but in other cases the term is applied specifically to cases where each random variable is only correlated with nearby variables (as in a Markov model). This is a particular case of a Bayes network and often used for very long sequences, e.g. gene sequences or lengthy text documents. A number of models are specifically designed for such sequences, e.g. hidden Markov models. *Random processes. These are similar to random sequences, but where the length of the sequence is indefinite or infinite and the elements in the sequence are processed one-by-one. This is often used for data that can be described as a time series, e.g. the price of a stock on successive days. Random processes are also used to model values that vary continuously (e.g. the temperature at successive moments in time), rather than at discrete intervals. *Bayes networks. These correspond to aggregates of random variables described using graphical models, where individual random variables are linked in a graph structure with conditional distributions relating variables to nearby variables. **Multilevel models are subclasses of Bayes networks that can be thought of as having multiple levels of linear regression. **Random trees. These are a subclass of Bayes network, where the variables are linked in a tree structure. An example is the problem of parsing a sentence, when statistical parsing techniques are used, such as probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG's). *Random fields. These represent the extension of random processes to multiple dimensions, and are common in physics, where they are used in statistical mechanics to describe properties such as force or electric field that can vary continuously over three dimensions (or four dimensions, when time is included). These concepts originate in various scientific fields and frequently overlap in usage. As a result, it is very often the case that multiple concepts could potentially be applied to the same problem. ==References== ","title":"Statistical data type"},{"id":"35269409","text":"Edward Schaumberg Quade (28 June 1908 ‚Äì 4 June 1988)California, Death Index, 1940-1997 was an American mathematician at the Rand Corporation who worked on trigonometric series and systems analysis. ==References== Category:American mathematicians Category:1908 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Jacksonville, Florida ","title":"Edward Schaumberg Quade"},{"id":"35269430","text":"Hovhannes \\"Jean\\" Semerdjian (, 9 March 1920 ‚Äì 27 August 2013), also known as Jean Jansem, was a French-Armenian painter.

White in 1996 in order to teach rhythm skills. Takadimi, while utilizing rhythmic symbols borrowed from classical South Indian carnatic music, differentiates itself from this method by focusing the syllables on meter and on western tonal rhythm. Takadimi is based on the use of specific syllables at certain places within a beat. Takadimi is used in classrooms from elementary level up through the collegiate level, and it meets National Content Standard 5 by teaching both reading and notating music. ==Development== Takadimi is similar to the Kod√°ly method, developed in 1935 in Hungary.University of North Texas Digital Library Both systems can be traced back to the 19th century French Time-Names system. Hoffman, Pelto, and White developed the system with certain goals in mind. As stated by the developers themselves: #It should lead to accuracy and musicality in performance, both studies, and sight-read, including the ability to recognize and perform the musical gesture. #It should require and reflect an understanding of rhythmic structure, recognition of metric and rhythmic interaction, and awareness of the precise contextual location of beats and attack points. #It should facilitate aural recognition and identification of rhythmic patterns and metric divisions. #It should provide a precise and consistent language for the discussion of temporal phenomena. There should be no need to create new terms or separate categories for performance, transcription, or analytical work. #It should address rhythmic issues presented by music outside the realm of traditional tonal literature such as asymmetric meters, modulation of meter or tempo, complex syncopations, complex tuplet groupings, and passages that combine these in a novel and challenging ways. #Like pitch solf√®ge, it should be a system that is easily applied and adapts to broad applications, and it should be a tool for lifelong use. Hoffman, Pelto, and White believe that they took the best from many existing systems and tweaked them together to form this system that best meets the goals they set for themselves. Of the systems they used as either inspiration or examples of unwanted attributes, three are mentioned in the journal where they first proposed their system in 1996: The Kod√°ly Method, the McHose/Tibbs system, and Edwin Gordon's system. ==How it works== The Takadimi system teaches students to read rhythm in a way similar to the way a language would be taught, rooted in Pestalozzian theory formalized by Robert M. Gagn√© and applied in Edwin Gordon's skill learning sequences. Students learn first to recognize and repeat rhythms before they learn to associate those rhythms with standard musical notation and begin reading and writing music. The system has a basis of two related sets of syllables, one for simple meter and one for compound meter. In both meters, syllables are assigned to certain positions within the beat as opposed to the syllables being assigned to certain notational values. This allows for rhythms that sound the same to be pronounced the same, even when the notation differs. Such notational differences that commonly result in rhythms that sound the same often occur between 2/4 and 2/2 time signatures. Also, each subdivision has unique syllables, so a note in a certain place within the beat always has the same syllable. Divisions of Takadimi Syllables Simple meter In simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‚Äòta,‚Äô and an attack on the second half of the beat is always called ‚Äòdi.‚Äô When the beat is divided further into fourths, the pronunciation of each fourth would be ‚Äòta ka di mi.‚Äô Compound meter In compound meter, as in simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‚Äòta.‚Äô The first division into thirds is pronounced ‚Äòta ki du.‚Äô The subdivision into sixths is pronounced ‚Äòta va ki di du mu.‚Äô Both meters In both meters, ‚Äòta‚Äô always begins a beat and ‚Äòdi‚Äô always marks the middle of the beat, simplifying switching between the two. Also, in order to allow the system to expand to more unusual time signatures, a syllable ‚Äòti‚Äô may be added to the end of the subdivision. A quintuplet in simple meter, for example, would be pronounced ‚Äòta ka di mi ti,‚Äô and a septuplet in compound meter would be pronounced ‚Äòta va ki di du mu ti.‚Äô ==Comparison to other systems== Kod√°ly Method The Kod√°ly method, a system developed by Hungarian composer Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, differs from Takadimi in that it ascribes syllables to specific notational values, regardless of their placement within the beat. Sets of syllables are also assigned to specific rhythmic patterns. For example, an eighth note is called ‚Äòti‚Äô whether it is on the attack of the beat or in the middle, and regardless of the meter. This method was intended for use at the elementary level, and critics say that it is not expandable to upper level classrooms. Philip Tacka and Michael Houlahan, who studied the Kod√°ly method at Millersville University, have stated that ‚Äúthe Takadimi rhythm system solves the problems associated with the Kod√°ly rhythm syllables. We believe that were Kod√°ly alive today, he would certainly encourage his students and colleagues to use the Takadimi system.‚Äù Lois Chosky proposed modifications to the Kod√°ly method, providing further subdivisions of syllables, in the 1981 book The Kod√°ly Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning. McHose/Tibbs Allen McHose and Ruth Tibbs developed a system that is based on counting within the measure. For example, ‚Äòone‚Äô is said on the attack of beat one, ‚Äòtwo‚Äô is said on the attack of beat two and so on. This system also ascribes syllables to certain notational values, but the syllables are not unique to certain attack points as in the Takadimi system. Hoffman believes that this system requires a formal understanding of musical notation before it can become useful. Edwin Gordon Edwin Gordon has developed a system similar to the McHose/Tibbs system above. It is similar in that it also assigns syllables based on beat orientation. However, these syllables are meter-dependent. For example, 3 eighth notes in 6/8 are pronounced ‚Äòdu-da-di‚Äô whereas in 7/8 they are pronounced ‚Äòdu-ba-bi.‚Äô ==References== Category:Music education ","title":"Takadimi"},{"id":"35269454","text":"Steve Nease Steve Nease is a Canadian editorial and comic strip cartoonist based in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.

As of 1 August 2020, he is ranked the #6 welterweight in the world by Combat Press.https://combatpress.com/2020/08/combat-press-kickboxing-rankings- august-2020/ ==Career== Early career Grigorian rose to prominence as a young fighter with an extensive record in his adopted country of Belgium. In perhaps the most notable bout of his early career, he featured as a reserve fighter at the S-Cup Europe 2008 in Gorinchem, Netherlands on 20 September 2008, where he defeated Abdallah Mabel by decision. On 21 February 2009, he defeated Pedro Sedarous via decision after five rounds to claim the Benelux Muay Thai -70 kg Championship. He debuted in the It's Showtime organization later that year when he defeated Chris Ngimbi by an extra round decision at It's Showtime 2009 Lommel on September 24. He followed this up with a technical knockout win over Seo Doo Won at It's Showtime 2009 Barneveld on 21 November 2009. 2010 Grigorian competed in the eight-man grand prix at the K-1 World MAX 2010 West Europe Tournament held in Utrecht, Netherlands on 21 March 2010. He defeated Bruno Carvalho and Anthony Kane by decision in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, before losing via a second-round KO to Mohamed Khamal in the final. Following this, he went 2-0 throughout the rest of the year, with decision wins over Henri van Opstal and Alessandro Campagna. 2011 He began 2011 with a decision win over Henri van Opstal on 12 February 2011. Following a disqualification loss to Gino Bourne on 19 March 2011, he rebounded with a first-round KO of Lahcen Ait Oussakour on 9 April 2011, before being invited to take part in the eight-man grand prix at BFN Group & Music Hall presents: It's Showtime \\"Fast & Furious 70MAX\\", which was held in Brussels, Belgium on 24 September 2011. At the quarter-finals stage, he was drawn against veteran Dutch fighter Andy Souwer and was able to take him to an extra round, after which he lost a close split decision. 2012 He was scheduled to face Chahid Oulad El Hadj at It's Showtime 2012 in Leeuwarden on 28 January 2012, but El Hadj pulled out due to an injury and Grigorian was instead set up with a rematch against It's Showtime 70MAX Champion Chris Ngimbi in a non-title fight. He put in a spectacular performance against the Congolese Muay Thai fighter, picking him apart before forcing the referee to stop the fight due to a cut in round two. On 21 September 2012, Grigorian won his first bout as a professional boxer when he took a unanimous decision over Hovhannes Kishmiryan in Antwerp. 2013 Next up for Grigorian was a match with Juanma Chacon at Enfusion Live: Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain on 9 March 2012. 2014 On 20 September 2014, Grigorian competed in the eight-man grand prix at the A1 World Combat Cup held in Eindhoven, Netherlands. He defeated Nicky Lopez and Tayfun Ozcan by decision in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, and defeated Nordin Ben Moh by a first-round knockout in the finals to win the tournament championship. 2017 Grigorian suffered a controversial knockout blow from Murthel Groenhart in their rematch at Glory 42 Paris. He inexplicably turned his head away from Groenhart after getting kneed on the face which seem to have left him a little dazed, confused, and shocked. With his back turned to Groenhart looking to get out of the ring, Groenhart took that opportunity to end the fight by delivering the knockout punch to Grigorian from behind shocking the crowd and drawing anger from three fans who invaded the ring and punched Groenhart, hurting the fighter. There was chaos in the ring until trainers from both sides as well as officials broke up the brawl with Grigorian still lying dazed with a deep cut over his eye. Groenhart and Grigorian later seemingly made up. This led to speculation that a third grudge match between the two rivals is very possible. At Glory 44: Chicago, Grigorian competed in the Glory Welterweight Contender Tournament, defeating both Karim Benmansour in the semi-finals and Antoine Pinto in the finals, and earned a shot at the welterweight title. 2018 Grigorian faced Murther Groenhart for a third time at Glory 50: Chicago for the Glory Welterweight Championship. In the first round, Harut dropped Groenhart with punches and the referee stopped the fight soon after, making him the Glory Welterweight Champion. ==Personal life== Harut and his teammate Marat Grigorian are often mistaken to be brothers, however both have confirmed that they are good friends but not related. ==Titles== *2018 Glory Welterweight Champion *2017 Glory Welterweight Contender Tournament Winner *A1 World Combat Cup 2014 Tournament Champion *Benelux Muay Thai -70 kg Champion *2010 K-1 World MAX West Europe Runner up ==Kickboxing record== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\\" - !

The accuracy of laser trackers is of the order of 0.025 mm over a distance of several metres.Bridges, 2009. Some examples of laser tracker applications are to align aircraft wings during assemblyMartin, 2007 and to align large machine tools.Machine Design, 2011. To take measurements the technician first sets up a laser tracker on a tripod with an unobstructed view of the object to be measured. The technician removes a target from the base of the laser tracker and carries it to the object to be measured, moving smoothly to allow the laser tracker to follow the movement of the target. The technician places the target against the object and triggers measurements to be taken at selected points, sometimes by a remote control device. Measurements can be imported into different types of software to plot the points or to calculate deviation from the correct position.Vera, 2011. The targets are known as \\"retroreflective\\" because they reflect the laser beam back in the same direction it came from (in this case, back to the laser tracker). One type of target in common use is called a spherically mounted retroreflector (SMR),Machine Design, 2011. which resembles a ball bearing with mirrored surfaces cut into it.Martin, 2007. ==History== The first laser tracker was invented in 1987 by Dr. Kam Lau, CEO of API (Automated Precision, Inc.) while at NIST\\"NIST\\", 2010 and made commercially available by API in 1988 with its first production unit being made available to Boeing under a 9-month lease agreement. Tennessee Technology University received an API 6-D laser tracker in 1989. Instruments were later produced by Kern in 1991 following a technology agreement with API. Currently, there are three well known manufacturers of Laser Trackers; FARO, API, and Leica. ==FootnotesReferences and sources== *Bob Bridges. ‚ÄúHow Laser Trackers Work.‚Äù Quality Digest, June 25, 2009. *James R.

They earned a third place result in their debut campaign before going on to win a string of three divisional titles. They declined participation in the promotion round for the Regionalliga West (II) in each of these seasons, and instead went on to a record three consecutive national amateur championships. In their final appearance in amateur championship play in 1972, the side went out against TSV Marl-H√ºls in their semifinal tie. The playoff went to three games after the two teams exchanged 6:0 victories before TSV prevailed 4:3 on penalties. SC earned a second place and two third place finishes over the next four seasons before slipping to mid-table status. The club finished bottom in the newly formed Amateuroberliga Nordrhein (III) in 1979 and was demoted to the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (IV) for a single season. On returning to the Amateuroberliga they remained a lower tier side until demoted again for the 1986‚Äì87 season.

The French captured her at Corfu in 1797. She took part in a sanguinary and inconclusive single-ship action with a British privateer shortly after her capture. She continued to serve in the Mediterranean carrying dispatches between France and Alexandria and then moved to the West Indies where she supported the French attempt to defeat the Haitian Revolution in Saint Domingue. captured her on 11 July 1803; her subsequent fate is unknown. ==Career== Giasone was a Venetian vessel, possibly originally a cutter but completed as a brig. The French captured her at Corfu on 23 July 1797.Neptunia, Vol. 81-84, p.57.On√©sime-Joachim Troude (1868), p.67. The French initially named her Jason, but after the Battle of Lodi they renamed her Lodi on 11 November 1797. Jason arrived at Toulon on 7 February 1798. On 12 May she was in Carthage roads, while under the command of Enseigne de vaisseau Sennequier. She was on a cruise between Almeria and North Africa.Fonds Marine: Campagnes, Inentaire de la sous-s√©rie Maine BB 4, Tome premier, p.210. On 4 July 1798, Lodi, was sailing down the Piombino Channel from Leghorn with dispatches for Napoleon Bonaparte, then at Alexandria. She encountered a British brig that attacked her and the two vessels exchanged fire. The crew of the brig twice attempted to board Lodi and twice the French repelled them. The French then attempted to board the brig, and the British repelled them. The two vessels separated and continued to exchange fire, with the French succeeding in bringing down the brig's masts. Even so, the French did not capture the brig, which used sweeps to reach the neutral coast of Tuscany, where it took refuge by a fort.Victoires (1855), Vol 5, pp.527-9. Lodi, although she had retained her masts, was sufficiently damaged that she had to stop at Civita Vecchia to effect repairs.On√©sime-Joachim Troude (1868), p.138-40. Lodi then continued on to Alexandria. Lodi had lost two men killed and more than 25 sailors and soldiers wounded, including Sennequier.James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.223-5. Lodi reported that she had engaged the British sloop of war Aigle, of a \\"force much superior to her own\\". Various accounts give Lodis armament as 12 guns. Sennequier was immediately promoted to the rank of Capitaine de fr√©gate.Messages, Vol. 5, p.183. There was no Aigle or Eagle in the Royal Navy at the time, nor any mention of the encounter in the logbooks of any British navy vessels matching her description. A Paris newspaper later reported that on 28 July, the British privateer brig Acquila, under the command of Captain Colonna, of 14 guns and 57 men, had arrived at Leghorn in great distress, having engaged a French vessel on 4 July. This may have been the ship Eagle, Captain Colin Campbell, of twelve 6-pounder guns and 317 tons (bm), which had received her letter of marque on 13 June 1797.Letter of Marque, - accessed 14 May 2011. On the night of 1 March, or the next morning, Lodi arrived at Alexandria. With the failure of Ganteaume's expeditions, she was one of the few French ships to penetrate the British blockade.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.99. In mid-May Lodi sailed for France, taking with her General Reynier, dispatched by General Menou, the French commander in Egypt. Lodi reached Toulon on 12 June, bringing with her a captured British vessel with 3-4,000 quintals of wheat. In June 1799, Lodi sailed from Toulon, in company with Frippone, arriving at Carthage on 24 June.On√©sime-Joachim Troude (1868), p.158. There they joined Vice-Admiral Bruix's squadron, engaged in what became known as the fruitless cruise of Bruix. On 10 April 1800 was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Gastaud. She was on a round trip carrying dispatches between Toulon and Damietta.Fonds Marine: Campagnes, Inventaire de la sous-s√©rie Maine BB 4, Tome premier, p.241. On 28 June 1801 she was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Guien. She was engaged in transporting General Reynier and dispatches from Alexandria to Nice. ==West Indies== Still under Guien's command, between 19 June and 13 September 1802, she sailed from Livorno to Cap-Fran√ßois, in the West Indies, via Malaga and Cadiz.Fonds Marine: Campagnes, Inentaire de la sous-s√©rie Maine BB 4, Tome premier, p.268. She was escorting 13 vessels that were carrying 2,270 men of the Polish Legions. Although Napoleon wanted to put down the Haitian Revolution, he had no wish to deplete his main French army any more than he had to. On 3 November 1802 Lodi was under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Lafosse. General Willaumez sent a letter to General Pierre Quantin, who was besieged at Saint-Marc, apologizing that he, Willaumez, could not spare any other vessels. At the same time, Willaumez instructed Lafosse to gather all the schooners that the captain of port L√©og√¢ne could assemble and escort them to Saint-Marc. There he was to put them at Quantin's disposal for the evacuation of the French in the town. Once the schooners were loaded, he was to escort them to Port-au-Prince. Lodi returned to on 13 December. At some point Lieutenant de vaisseau M. Pierre Isaac Taupier replaced Lafosse. Willaumez then sent her to take up a station below Fort Bizoton. Next, he had Lodi take 100 men to L√©og√¢ne, to clear the rebels from the shore front. Lodi arrived too late to do anything immediately, but with the arrival of further reinforcements, the rebels were dispersed. General Rochambeau, the French commander-in-chief in Haiti, wrote a letter on 15 January 1803 requesting a promotion for Taupier, commander of Lodi, and two other naval commanders, in part for their services at L√©og√¢ne. The announcement of Taupier's promotion to Capitaine de fr√©gate appeared on 26 May 1803.Affiches (1802), p.172. On 18 May, Lodi succeeded in intercepting three barges and 50 men between Arcahaie and L√©og√¢ne. The air was too calm for Lodi to be able to capture the barges, but through cannon fire she was able to force them ashore near Grand-Go√¢ve. ==Capture== On 11 July 1803, Racoon, under Commander Austin Bissell, was sailing between Guanaba and St. Domingo in the West Indies when she sighted a French naval brig anchored in L√©og√¢ne Roads. As Racoon sailed towards her, Bissell saw that the French had springs on their cables and were ready to engage. Racoon was flying the French flag, and although he was unaware that the war had broken out again between France and Britain, the French captain was wary, rightly so as things turned out.On√©sime-Joachim Troude (1868), p.296-7. At 2:45 p.m. Racoon anchored, also with springs, 30 yards from the brig. She then exchanged her French ensign for the British, and opened fire. The two vessels exchanged fire for half an hour before the French vessel cut his cables and tried to sail away. Racoon followed and after about another 10 minutes of fire from Racoon, the French brig surrendered. The Frenchman was Lodi, pierced for 20 guns but with only 10 mounted. The French had lost one man killed and 13 or 14 men wounded; Racoon had only one man wounded. One French account gives Lodis armament as six 6-pounder guns. Whether the number was six, 10, or 12 guns, Racoon, with 18 guns, of which 16 were 32-pounder carronades, heavily outgunned Lodi. Also, Lodis crew numbered only 40 men, many of them ill. In all, she was not in a position to put up a strong defence. Lodi was among a number of British prizes that arrived at Jamaica between 2 and 16 July.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4385. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References *Affiches Am√©ricaines de Saint-Domingue.

MiR cluster 23/27/24 regulates angiogenesis, which is the process of forming new blood vessels by deposition of endothelial cells. There are 2 types of miR-27s found on endothelial cells: miR-27a and miR-27b. The actual mechanisms of miR-27s are not well known, but studies showed that overexpression of miR-27b increases angiogenesis. These results suggest that miR27b might be useful for treating patients with ischemic heart disease. ==Ischemic Heart Disease== Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries, and its incidence has increased drastically in the relatively short span of a few decades. Due to the blockage of the coronary arteries, blood supply to the heart is cut off which leads to inadequate supply of blood to the heart muscle resulting in ischemic heart disease. ==mir-27b and revascularization== A plausible treatment for patients with this disease is revascularization,which would restore blood supply to the heart. MiR-27b is linked to Semaphorin 6A, which is an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Overexpression of miR-27b decreased the protein expression of Semaphorin 6A which favored new blood vessel sprouting in the heart. To further determine that Semaphorin 6A is an inhibitor of angiogenesis, silencing of Semaphorin 6A using siRNA showed an increase in blood vessel formation further proven that mir-27b might be useful in treating patients with ischemic heart disease. ==mir-27b and thrombospondin-1== MiR-27b also targets Thrombospondin-1, an antiangiogenic protein. Reduction in miR-27b increases Thrombospondin-1 levels, which decreases angiogenesis by silencing Drosha and Dicer. Thus, miR-27b can be used to promote angiogenesis in patients with ischemic heart disease by suppressing Thrombospondin-1. ==References== Category:Non-coding RNA ","title":"MiR-27b microRNA precursor"},{"id":"35270031","text":"Rate base is the value of property on which a public utility is permitted to earn a specified rate of return, in accordance with rules set by a regulatory agency. In general, the rate base consists of the value of property as used by the utility in providing service. It may be calculated by any one or a combination of accounting methods, such as fair value, prudent investment, reproduction cost, or original cost. The rate base can include: cash, working capital, materials and supplies, deductions for accumulated provisions for depreciation, contributions in aid of construction, customer advances for construction, accumulated deferred income taxes, and accumulated deferred investment tax credits, all dependent on the method that is used in the calculation. An emerging question facing utility regulators in some states is whether cloud computing software should be included in rate bases. Conventional software, in which a company purchases and installs the program on hardware that it own, generally is included, but most regulators do not allow a rate of return on cloud software. == Depreciation == In a period of static costs or no inflation, an original cost valuation may be sufficient. With a period of inflation, a rate base which values plant and equipment at original cost substantially undervalues the plant. In these circumstances, utilities argue in favor of reproduction cost valuations. In either case, depreciation on plant and equipment is subtracted from the rate base and carried as an operating expense. The theory behind including depreciation as an expense is that capital may be accumulated for further expansion and growth. The utility's rate of return (a ratio of net operating income earned) is calculated as a percentage of its rate base. ==References== Category:Public utilities of the United States Category:Real estate valuation ","title":"Rate base (utility)"},{"id":"35270055","text":"Mechanical weed control is an physical activity that inhibits unwanted plant growth. Mechanical, or manual, weed control techniques manage weed populations through physical methods that remove, injure, kill, or make the growing conditions unfavorable. Some of these methods cause direct damage to the weeds through complete removal or causing a lethal injury. Other techniques may alter the growing environment by eliminating light, increasing the temperature of the soil, or depriving the plant of carbon dioxide or oxygen. Mechanical control techniques can be either selective or non-selective. A selective method has very little impact on non-target plants where as a non-selective method affects the entire area that is being treated. If mechanical control methods are applied at the optimal time and intensity, some weed species may be controlled or even eradicated. ==Mechanical Control Methods== Weed Pulling Pulling methods uproot and remove the weed from the soil. Weed pulling can be used to control some shrubs, tree saplings, and herbaceous plants. Annuals and tap-rooted weeds tend to be very susceptible to pulling. Many species are able to re-sprout from root segments that are left in the soil. Therefore, the effectiveness of this method is dependent on the removal of as much of the root system as possible. Well established perennial weeds are much less effectively controlled because of the difficulty of removing all of the root system and perennating plant parts. Small herbaceous weeds may be pulled by hand but larger plants may require the use of puller tools like the Weed Wrench or the Root Talon. This technique has a little to no impact on neighboring, non-target plants and has a minimal effect on the growing environment. However, pulling is labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it a more suitable method to use for small weed infestations. Mowing Mowing methods cut or shreds the above ground of the weed and can prevent and reduce seed populations as well as restrict the growth of weeds. Mowing can be a very successful control method for many annual weeds. Mowing is the most effective when it is performed before the weeds are able to set seed because it can reduce the number of flower stalks and prevent the spread of more seed. However, the biology of the weed must be considered before mowing. Some weed species may sprout with increased vigor after being mowed. Also, some species are able to re-sprout from stem or root segments that are left behind after mowing. Brush cutting and weed eating are also mowing techniques that reduce the biomass of the weeds. Repeatedly removing biomass causes reduced vigor in many weed species. This method is usually used in combination with other control methods such as burning or herbicide treatments. Mulching Mulch is a layer of material that is spread on the ground. Compared with some other methods of weed control, mulch is relatively simple and inexpensive. Mulching smothers the weeds by excluding light and providing a physical barrier to impede their emergence. Mulching is successful with most annual weeds, however, some perennial weeds are not affected. Mulches may be organic or synthetic. Organic mulches consist of plant by products such as: pine straw, wood chips, green waste, compost, leaves, and grass clippings. Synthetic mulches, also known as ground cover fabric, can be made from materials like polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyester. The effectiveness of mulching is mostly dependent on the material used. Organic and synthetic mulches may be used in combination with each other to increase the amount of weeds controlled. Tillage Tillage, also known as cultivation, is the turning over of the soil. This method is more often used in agricultural crops. Tillage can be performed on a small scale with tools such as small, hand pushed rotary tillers or on a large scale with tractor mounted plows. Tillage is able to control weeds because when the soil is overturned, the vegetative parts of the plants are damaged and the root systems are exposed causing desiccation. Generally, the younger the weed is, the more readily it can be controlled with tillage. To control mature perennial weeds, repeated tillage is necessary. By continually destroying new growth and damaging the root system, the weed's food stores are depleted until it can no longer re-sprout. Also, when the soil is overturned, the soil seed bank is disrupted which can cause dormant weed seeds to germinate in the absence of the previous competitors. These new weeds can also be controlled by continued tillage until the soil seed bank is depleted. Soil Solarization Soil solarization is a simple method of weed control that is accomplished by covering the soil with a layer of clear or black plastic. The plastic that is covering the ground traps heat energy from the sun and raises the temperature of the soil. Many weed seeds and vegetative propagules are not able to withstand the temperatures and are killed. For this method to be most effective, it should be implemented during the summer months and the soil should be moist. Also, cool season weeds are more susceptible to soil solarization than are warm season weeds. Using black plastic as a cover excludes light which can help to control plants that are growing whereas clear plastic has been shown to produce higher soil temperatures. Fire Burning and flaming can be economical and practical methods of weed control if used carefully. For most plants, fire causes the cell walls to rupture when they reach a temperature of 45 ¬∞C to 55 ¬∞C. Burning is commonly used to control weeds in forests, ditches, and roadsides. Burning can be used to remove accumulated vegetation by destroying the dry, matured plant matter as well as killing the green new growth. Buried weed seeds and plant propagules may also be destroyed during burning, however, dry seeds are much less susceptible to the increased temperature. Flaming is used on a smaller scale and includes the use of a propane torch with a fan tip. Flaming may be used to control weeds along fences and paved areas or places where the soil may be too wet to hoe, dig, or till. Flaming is most effective on young weeds that are less than two inches tall but repeated treatments may control tougher perennial weeds. Flooding Flooding is a method of control that requires the area being treated to be saturated at a depth of 15 to 30 cm for a period of 3 to 8 weeks. The saturation of the soil reduces the availability of oxygen to the plant roots thereby killing the weed. This method has been shown to be highly effective in controlling establish perennial weeds and may also suppress annual weeds by reducing the weed seed populations. ==Effects of Mechanical Control on the Environment== Mechanical methods of weed control cause physical changes in the immediate environment that may cause positive or negative effects. The suppression of the targeted weeds will open niches in the environment and may also stimulate the growth of other weeds by decreasing their competition and making their environment more favorable. If the niches are not filled by a desirable plant, they will eventually be taken over by another weed. These weed control methods also effect the structure of the soil. The use of mulches can help decrease erosion, decrease water evaporation from the soil, as well as improve the soil structure by increasing the amount of organic matter. Tillage practices can help decrease compaction and aerate the soil. On the other hand, tillage has also been shown to decrease soil moisture, increase soil erosion and runoff, as well as decrease soil microbial populations. Solarization can cause changes in the biological, physical, and chemical properties of the soil. This can cause the soil to be an unfavorable environment for native species which may be beneficial or harmful. ==See also== * Aquatic weed harvester ==References== Category:Horticultural techniques ","title":"Mechanical weed control"},{"id":"35270057","text":"Marc Zamansky (Gen√®ve 14 February 1916 - 6 November 1996) was a French mathematician and a member of the French Resistance. ==References== *Marc Zamansky Category:1916 births Category:1996 deaths Category:20th-century French mathematicians ","title":"Marc Zamansky"},{"id":"35270076","text":"Zamansky is a surname.

It is situated along the banks of the Narva River, by the Narva Falls; the Baltic Sea is approximately away, and there is a distance of to Saint Petersburg. It was founded by Ludwig Knoop, a cotton merchant from Bremen. At one point, the company's cotton spinning and manufacturing mills were the largest in the world; and Kreenholm was considered in its time to be the most important mill in Russia, owning 32,000 acres of land and employing 12,000 people. Throughout its history, the company faced different obstacles such as the possibility of closure after World War I. In 1994, it was privatized after Estonia regained independence. The company went bankrupt in 2010, but continued limited operations after purchase by a new owner. ==History== 19th century The Krenholm mill was founded in 1857 by the pioneer of the Russian cotton industry, Ludwig Knoop, along with Kozma Soldatyonkov, and Aleksey Khludov. After the 1872 cholera epidemic which killed 420 workers, the mill's internal police force was disbanded. But when the administration reintroduced it later in the year, a strike ensued, the first major industrial strike in Estonia, which became a riot, and regular troops were called in to end it. A State Commission investigated the situation, and its report concluded that work conditions had to improve and the internal police ceased to exist. In 1893, it contained 340,000 spindles and 22,000 looms, requiring 6,000 horse power, and employing 7,000 people. Professor Gerhart von Schulze-G√§vernitz visited the mills in the 1890s stating that, \\"The whole place is a bit of England on Russian ground.\\" Narwa River, Narwa Falls, and the Krenholm Manufacturing Company, 1886. The mill is located on an island and along the banks of the Narva River. The Baltic Sea is only about 10 miles away, and in the harbor at the mouth of the river large cotton warehouses were erected where cotton, imported directly from the United States or Liverpool, was stored and brought up the river to the mill as needed. The Narva, just before it runs into the sea, has a fall of about 27 feet which provided a source of power. The machinery was distributed through three separate buildings, of brick and stone construction, two of them being five stories and one four. The last mill, devoted entirely to spinning, was of American construction. The carding and spinning machinery was from the firm of Platt Brothers & Co Ltd, in Oldham, England. Some of the looms were English, but most of them were made by the firm in its foundry and machine works, which were an adjunct of the mill. Driving power included 11 water turbines with a combined horsepower of 8,550, and supplementary steam engines of 700 horsepower were employed. Seventy per cent of the spindles were used in making yarns for sale principally among weavers in the St. Petersburg and Moscow textile districts. A specialty of the mill was 90s ply yarn, made from Egyptian yarn, for the rubber-tire manufacturers. The range of yarns produced was wide, running from 3s to 90s, and about 330,000 of the spindles were mules. The woven textile consisted mainly of print cloth in various types of construction and sateens, both woven from 34s warp and 38s weft. Practically all the goods were shipped to a factory in Moscow, in which the firm had a large interest. The managers and assistant managers of the mills were English. The laborers were partly Russian and partly Estonian. The company was active in looking after the welfare of the employees. It provided a hospital, schooling for 1,200 children, a Russian Orthodox Church (built at a cost of $250,000) and a Lutheran church (for the Esthonians). Employees lived at the mill paying only nominal rental. Illustration from the Album \\"Krengolmskaya Manufactory.

In that year, 74,660 bales of cotton were used, from which 34,861,796 pounds of yarn and 159,994 pieces of cloth (average 45 yards each) were used. Before the war, this mill employed over 10,000 people and manufactured yearly over 70,000,000 yards of semi-finished cotton cloth, which was sent to Russia for bleaching and dyeing, and then utilized in Russia. The Estonian cotton industry experienced a crisis after World War I which resulted in the practical closure of the mill, which at the time, was the largest mill in the former Russian Empire. The closure occurred as there was no market for this cloth due to postwar conditions in Soviet Russia. 100 years Krenholm manufacture. Post of USSR, 1957. By 1944, the company was in ruins, and came under the ownership of the Soviet Union, which turned it into a large industrial enterprise, driven by policy rather than profits. In the early 1970s, the company reportedly owned of land and employed 12,000 people. After 1986, the company did not have to rely on approvals from the textile ministry in Moscow, as it had gained the authorization to independently export its goods. After Estonia regained independence in 1994, the company was privatized. Its main shareholder became the Swedish company, Bor√•s W√§fveri AB. Renamed Krenholm Group, the realignment included several production units, Krenholm Finishing, Krenholm Sewing, Krenholm Spinning, Krenholm Terry Clothes, Krenholm Weaving; a service unit, Krenholm Service; and sales subsidiaries, Krenholm Textile, Krenholm Scandinavia AB, and Krenholm Germany GmbH. 21st century In 2000s, the company lost money, and was under restructuring; many employees lost their jobs. In 2003, the company was forced to fire 170 workers after the closure of its spinning facility. In early 2004, the company had 4,600 workers, of which a further 400 were made redundant in April 2004. There was speculation in 2008 and 2009 that the company would go bankrupt, and it eventually did in November 2010. It was purchased by the Swedish company Prod i Ronneby AB whose affiliate company in Narva, Eurotekstiil, would continue some of the operations; there were about 500 people employed. By 2012, the company chairman stated that it would be \\"absolutely impossible\\" to restore the previous scale of operations. ==See also== * Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution ==Further reading== * (1933). 75, 1857-1932 Gesellschaft der Kr√§hnholm Manufaktur f√ºr Baumwollfabrikate.

They decided that Fort St. John, then a boomtown populated mostly by United States Army soldiers, was a good place to start a newspaper, and the weekly Alaska Highway News was born in 1943. Murray became the \\"best-known, best-loved and also most cordially disliked person in Fort St. John\\" for her folksy and outspoken editorials, including attacks on the local power and telephone companies, and her solution to a town water shortage: > There has been a terrible waste of water in this small town. ...

Along with several other small British Columbia dailies, the Alaska Highway News was one of the last Hollinger properties to be sold, to Vancouver-based Glacier Ventures International, later called Glacier Media, in 2006.

It was written in 1866 but first published, in a slightly bowdlerized form, in Poems of the Past and the Present (1901). ==Overview== Thomas Hardy's \\"The Ruined Maid\\" is a poem about a woman who loses her purity or virginity during the Victorian Era, which is looked down upon. This poem displays how the ruined maid sees herself, but also how society sees her. Though the poem takes on real issues of culture during the Victorian Era, Hardy intended this poem to be light-hearted. The poem is presented a conversation between two people. To depict this, Hardy uses two voices: For the ruined maid he uses proper English, and for the other person he uses a broken dialect. The poem features a couplet rhyme scheme which can often be found in satirical poetry. This form is also known as an \\"aabb\\" rhyme scheme because every two lines rhyme in each stanza. ==TextAnalysis== The poem depicts a young country girl who has become a rich man's mistress to escape her own poverty, and does not seem to regret her decision. Her position is contrasted with that of her old friend who is still a respectable but poor country farm worker, and who seems to envy Amelia. The poem offers an ironic comment on the lives of working class women. Hardy implies the only way a woman can obtain independence in this society is by selling herself. The ruined maid acts as an archetype and also an image that relates to social realities which are important during the Victorian Era. Because Amelia is a prostitute and therefore she must be 'ruined', most women should not envy her lifestyle. But in Hardy's satirical poem, it seems obvious that the unnamed speaker is envious of Amelia because of the beautiful clothes Amelia is wearing. This poem also discusses the concept of money. During this time in history, those who had wealth were considered important in society. Amelia has money but she knows that she had to sacrifice much in order to get the money. Since \\"The Ruined Maid\\" is about two women meeting for the first time in a strange part of town, their dialogue includes discussion of the past in order for the reader to understand the present. This poem has a parallel in which the first part of the stanza discusses Amelia's past while the second part of the stanza discusses her present. Hardy uses imagery to help the reader read between the lines. The unknown speaker in the poem illustrates how Amelia's life is before by reminding her of how things had looked so long ago, and the reader can understand how things are now because of the imagery of the jewels and fine clothing. Hardy uses every word in his poems with meaning; each has a set purpose to enhance the reader's understanding of the poem. Though each word illustrates a specific emotion to show the reader how each speaker is feeling, that emotion is not necessarily specifically named. The title itself has meaning; Hardy uses the word \\"ruin\\", \\"ruin\\" has an \\"oo\\" sound which is a low frequency that imitates the mood of gloom or destruction. \\"The Ruined Maid\\" is a satire and full of intended irony. Nevertheless, some critics argue that the poem is more serious than one might think due to what was going on in Hardy's life at the time. He was young and did not have his life figured out quite yet, nor did he have much of a love life. == Adaptations == An \\"opera skit\\" by Seymour Barab called The Ruined Maid, based on Hardy's poem, was premiered in 1981. The poem was set to music by Judith Lang Zaimont as one of her Two Songs for Soprano and Harp. ==References== Category:1901 poems Category:Poetry by Thomas Hardy Category:1866 poems ","title":"The Ruined Maid"},{"id":"35270334","text":"Maria Col√≥n S√°nchez (1926 - November 25, 1989) a.k.a. \\"La Madrina\\" (The Godmother), was an activist and politician who, in 1988, became the first Hispanic woman elected to the Connecticut General Assembly.

Her family's poor economic situation forced her to quit school in the 8th grade, in order to help her parents with the caring of her brothers and sister. In 1954, Col√≥n S√°nchez moved to Hartford, Connecticut to live with her aunt. She held various jobs, and her work in the tobacco fields enabled her to send money to her family in Puerto Rico.Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame ==Political activist== Col√≥n S√°nchez and her husband met political activist Olga Mele, who in 1954 was involved with the Puerto Rican community and was instrumental in convincing Puerto Ricans to register as voters for the upcoming elections.Maria Sanchez: Godmother of the Puerto Rican Community Col√≥n S√°nchez and Mele, who were Catholics, complained that they couldn't confess at their local church (St. Peter's Church) because there were no Spanish-speaking priests. This resulted in the appointment of a priest in charge of the church's Hispanic worshipers. In 1959, S√°nchez, Mele, and others at Sacred Heart Church demanded the removal of another priest from the parish, because he refused to move the Spanish- language mass out of the church basement. The petitioners' demands were met by the Chancery. Col√≥n S√°nchez saved enough money to open her own storefront, \\"Maria's News Stand,\\" on Albany Avenue in Hartford. The location would also serve her as an office for much of her political work. In 1964, she founded the Puerto Rican Parade Committee and in 1965, she was elected treasurer of the \\"Puerto Rican Democrats of Hartford,\\" a political organization which she helped organize. In 1967, she organized the Spanish Action Coalition, an advocacy network. ==The Comanchero riot== On August 10, 1969, a bar brawl erupted between French Canadians and Puerto Ricans in Hartford. The brawl turned into a riot known as the \\"Comanchero riot\\" and was quickly classified as a political incident. Nearly 150 men gathered at the intersection of Park and Main streets, in order to air their social and economic grievances. Col√≥n S√°nchez, who helped to maintain communication with the police, the firefighters, and the general public, organized a meeting between the men and City Councilmen Nicholas Carbone, George Athanson and City Manager Elisha Freedman. In this meeting, the elected officials heard many complaints about the discrimination, which Latinos were being subjected to, in the city of Hartford. This included police brutality, even in instances where Latinos came to the aid of the officers. During this meeting, Councilman Athanson urged Puerto Ricans to run a candidate for city council. Also after this meeting, the Hartford Foundation donated $78,640 to the Greater Hartford Community Council to address Puerto Rican needs. Using the funds from the Hartford Foundation, Col√≥n S√°nchez and her colleagues transformed the Spanish Action Coalition into La Casa de Puerto Rico, the community's oldest social service agency. ==Educational reform for Bilingual Education== In 1971, Col√≥n S√°nchez, with the help of Perry Alan Zirkel, a professor at the University of Hartford, conceived the idea of creating a federally funded teacher recruitment program. The program, known as the Teachers Corps, hired Spanish-speaking teachers who could address the educational needs of Latino students, many of whom spoke Spanish as a primary language. Col√≥n S√°nchez, together with Edna Negron Rosario, led the fight for mandatory bilingual education in Hartford. Though she was met with resistance from the non-Hispanic community who opposed the idea of bilingual education, Col√≥n S√°nchez persisted and, in 1972, she helped to open La Escuelita (The Little School), the first bilingual school in the state of Connecticut. In 1973, with support from the Democratic Party, the Campaign Committee of the Bilingual Task Force, and a group organized by La Casa de Puerto Rico, Col√≥n S√°nchez won a seat on the Hartford Board of Education. She became the first Puerto Rican elected to public office in Hartford. She served on the Board for 16 years, during which time she continued to promote bilingual and bicultural education. In 1976 Col√≥n S√°nchez filed a lawsuit, which she won in 1978, mandating bilingual education throughout the entire Hartford public school system. Col√≥n S√°nchez co-founded of the Society of Legal Services, the Spanish-American Merchants Association, the Puerto Rican Businessmen Association, and the Community Renewal Team. ==Elected State Representative== In 1979, Col√≥n S√°nchez expressed her desire to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She was supported by the Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Col√≥n S√°nchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Col√≥n S√°nchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board: > We ran Mar√≠a for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't > an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you > sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did you get over > the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into > a lot of neighborhoods ... You had to be practical as you were trying to get > her on the school board. Torres won the election, and became the first Puerto Rican to occupy a seat on Hartford's city council. In 1988, Abe Giles, a member of the Democratic town committee in the sixth district, managed to have Col√≥n S√°nchez ousted from the committee. Col√≥n S√°nchez reacted to Giles's actions by running against him in a primary for a seat on the state legislature. She won the primary and in November of that year won the election. She thus became the first Hispanic woman elected to the Connecticut General Assembly. Col√≥n S√°nchez held her seat until November 25, 1989, when she was found dead of a heart attack in her apartment . Bishop Peter Rosazza who celebrated the mass of her funeral, stated that \\"she was well respected and strong.\\"Education and of many grassroots organizations. Maria S√°nchez elementary school At the time of her death she was survived by four brothers: Jose J. Col√≥n of Hartford; Benigno Col√≥n, Arcardio Col√≥n, and Pedro Col√≥n and a sister, Luz Consuelo Col√≥n de Fuentes.New York Times ==Legacy== In addition to being the first Puerto Rican to occupy a seat on Hartford's city council, and the first Hispanic woman elected to the Connecticut General Assembly, Maria Col√≥n S√°nchez left behind a lifetime of leadership and community empowerment. She was a role model for her generation, and every generation which followed. The state of Connecticut honored her memory in 1993, by naming a school on Babcock Street in Frog Hollow the \\"Mar√≠a S√°nchez Elementary School.\\" A street close to her Newsstand was named \\"Maria Col√≥n Sanchez Way\\" in her honor.Maria Colon Sanchez street The Connecticut Institute for Community Development (CICD) Puerto Rican Parade, Inc. ‚Äì Hartford Chapter created the annual \\"Maria C. Sanchez Award.\\" Recipients are selected based on their outstanding contributions to the Puerto Rican and Hispanic community in the areas of leadership, education, community empowerment, cultural enrichment, and activism.Annual Maria C. Sanchez Award On October 14, 1993, Col√≥n S√°nchez was commemorated, along with other distinguished Hartford citizens, in the Hartford Public Library's Plaza of Fame. In 1995, she was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Puerto Rican activists Category:Puerto Rican women activists Category:People from Comer√≠o, Puerto Rico Category:Connecticut city council members Category:Women state legislators in Connecticut Category:Members of the Connecticut House of Representatives Category:Politicians from Hartford, Connecticut Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:20th-century American women politicians ","title":"Mar√≠a Col√≥n S√°nchez"},{"id":"35270347","text":"Wrong Lake Airport, , is located next to Wrong Lake, Manitoba, Canada. ==References== Category:Registered aerodromes in Manitoba ","title":"Wrong Lake Airport"},{"id":"35270349","text":"Patrick O'Kane is an Irish actor who was born in 1965 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

It was founded in 1767 AD by Munny Begum, wife of Nawab Mir Zafar. Earlier in this place Nawab Murshid Quli Khan had built the \\"Chahel Sutan\\", which was the city's forty pillared audience hall. The mosque still recalls the stories of the ruling days of the Nawabs and still holds on its glory of the past. ==Construction== The Masjid was founded by Munny Begum, the wife of Nawab Mir Zafar in 1767 AD under the supervision of Shaikh Khalilallah . Earlier on this venue Nawab Murshid Quli Khan built the \\"Chahel Sutan\\", which was the city's forty pillared audience hall. The mosque still recalls the stories of the ruling days of the Nawabs and still holds on its glory of the past. The mosque is located in the Nizamat Fort Area near the Hazarduari Palace and its other nearby buildings. An old photo of the \\"Chawk Masjid\\" (picture taken by C.B. Asher) This mosque was of great importance in the Nawabi era as Munny Begum was a favourite of Robert Clive and Warren Hastings in terms of her lavish distribution. She in turn received several gifts; one was a palanquin which could accommodate 30 people from Rani Bhavani. Munny Begum had her allowances separately assigned. Thus, she was a Gaddinashin Begum. There have been several other Begums who have been a Gaddinashin Begum, like Babbu Begum another wife of Nawab Mir Zafar, she was on a receipt of 8000 per month while Munny Begum received 12000. There have been more such Gaddinashin Begums. Munny Begum had done several acts of munificence to the East India Company and their servants. On her death a salute was fired by the Government corresponding to the number of years of her age as she was always viewed with cordial regard and has a distinguished consideration to the Government of the East India Company. So, the mosque was of utmost importance then under the rule of the Nawabs. ==Etymology== The Masjid (mosque) has been named so as it has a Chawk still surrounding it. Chawk means a shopping place often square in shape. So Chawk- means shopping place or a market and Masjid- means mosque. Thus, the total sums up to a mosque in a market. This market is the principle market of the city of Murshidabad. ==Features== This mosque has a majestic and grand appearance. It is a five domed mosque and has two chau- chala-end-vaults at the two corners at the side of the mosque. The exterior and the interior of the mosque both are decorated with motifs, panels and so on; this mosque has been ornamented with such arched shaped niches in stucco and vegetal motifs lavishly. Five gates passing through arched gateways lead in front of this grand mosque. There are several shops around so this place is known as the \\"Chawk\\" (shopping place or market, square in shape). This market is the principle market of the city of Murshidabad. ==Festivals== Earlier this mosque usually used to remain closed throughout the year. But nowadays, daily 5-time prayers are led by the Imam of the Masjid and a large number of people attend the daily obligatory prayers. For prominent occasions like Eid-uz Zoha, Eid ul-Fitr the mosque is decorated and whitewashed to welcome the people of the town. Earlier a single gun was fired from the Hazarduari Palace and several other guns were fired from several other places - one was fired from here - to proclaim the different intervals of the hours for the meals and prayers during the great fast of Ramzan. ==MapSee also== * Hazarduari Palace * Nizamat Imambara ==External links== Category:Mosques in West Bengal Category:Tourist attractions in Murshidabad Category:Buildings and structures in Murshidabad district Category:1767 establishments in India ","title":"Chawk Masjid"},{"id":"35270385","text":"Adolf Eichmann (1906‚Äì1962) was a German Nazi leader and Holocaust perpetrator.

He committed to Clemson University on September 13, 2007 under coach Oliver Purnell over offers from the University of Oregon, the University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University, the University of Georgia, Auburn University, and the University of Cincinnati. He played high school basketball at Wesleyan School in Norcross, Georgia. He was rated as a 3-star prospect in high school and as the #22 small forward in the nation by Scout.com and given a Scout Grade of 87 on ESPN.com. He was also rated 16th in the state of Georgia by Rivals.com, two spots lower than his teammate and roommate at Clemson, Andre Young. When considering schools, Smith chose Clemson mainly because of location; It was far enough away from home for him to be independent, but still close enough that his parents would be able to come to his games. Conference also played a part in his decision. Clemson is in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which Dana O'Neil says is \\"a league Tanner remembers watching as a kid.\\" Statistics {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Season Averages !

Not only is the Chico Basin a working cattle ranch, it is also a wildlife preserve. The Chico Basin works with the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory to band migratory birds. This activity is also open to schools and universities to come and learn about birds. Free programs are offered to all ages of children and adults to learn about wildlife and ranch life. ==History== The Chico Basin Ranch is owned by the Colorado State Land Board. The Colorado State Land Board was founded in 1876 to manage land given by the federal government to the state and creates revenue for some of the state‚Äôs foundations and public education. The Chico Basin Ranch is overseen by the part of the Colorado State Land Board that leases out agricultural farm land. Cattle first grazed on Chico Basin lands in the mid-1800s. The famous cattleman, Charles Goodnight, grazed many of his cattle on the present day Chico Basin Ranch. The HOP Ranch, formed by William Holmes and two Detroit business partners at the north end of Chico Basin Ranch, started operations in 1871.\\"Sale Of The Holmes Ranch Recalls Days When Roundups Were Great Events.\\" Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph. December 2, 1928. Over the next hundred years the ranch land changed hands several times, eventually coming under the jurisdiction of the Pueblo Army Depot. The Chico is currently managed by Duke and Janet Phillips who stress the point of land conservation. The Colorado State Land Board bought the 87,000 acres of land and in 1999 made a one of a kind lease with the Phillips family. The Phillips are able to lease the land for twenty-five years. ==Cows== The Chico Basin‚Äôs grass-fed beef is sold through Lasater Grassland Beef, which sells grass-fed beef from both the Chico Basin and the Lasater Ranch. The cattle are raised with no exposure to antibodies, pesticides, or hormones nor are they fed animal bi-products. The beef is kept fresh by dry-aging for about two weeks and then by flash freezing. This is an older way to preserve meat. ==Horses== The quarter horses used to herd cows on the Chico Basin Ranch are raised and trained on the ranch. The twenty-five horses that are ridden by guests are trained to be ridden with a western saddle and to accommodate all riding experiences. Riding lessons are offered to inexperienced beginning riders. Guests who are experienced are able to round up cows and participate in the branding of the calves. ==Ranchlands Horse Sanctuary== The Chico Basin Ranch has just recently opened a horse sanctuary where horses who need to retire or who are injured can live out the rest of their days on the open range. The horses are not immediately released out on the range. They are gradually acclimated to large pastures. The horses are continually monitored to make sure they are safe and healthy. All supplemental feed, hoof trimming, and medical treatments are taken care of. The goal of the horse sanctuary is to give the retired horses a home in their natural habitat, where they can live free to run, sleep and eat to their fill. ==Accommodations== The housing facility is a renovated adobe house. The house offers two bedrooms, one bathroom, a full kitchen, dining room, and sitting area. There are also washers and dryers available for guest use. Guests may also use wireless internet and a telephone. There is a fire pit and screen porch outside. ==Fishing and Hunting== The fishing and hunting on the Chico Basin is coordinated by a branch of Ranchlands LLC, Box T Cowboys. Hunts range from released upland game birds to big game opportunities. Big game hunting includes mule deer. Waterfowl hunting is also available to hunters. Fishing is described by local guides as the best warm water fisheries on Colorado‚Äôs Front Range. There are five lakes that contain bass, crappie, and blue gill. Hunts are currently available ala carte. The Box T Cowboys are partners with The Colorado Division of Wildlife, Ducks Unlimited, and other local wildlife organizations. ==Bird Watching== The Chico Basin Ranch is a bird banding station for the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory. Bird banding helps biologists understand migratory habits and bird anatomy. Mist nets are used to catch birds without harming them. Once caught, a small metal band is placed on the bird‚Äôs leg. Each band is numbered so when a bird is recaptured scientists will know when and where it was banded. The bird‚Äôs condition is observed by checking its weight and measurements. Banding stations are also very important for education. Teachers are encouraged to bring their class to learn about birds and their habitat. There are over three hundred birds on the ranch bird list. Anyone may come throughout the year and observe the local or the migratory birds. ==Education== Free programs are offered for children of ages and college students. Activities incorporate different subjects like science, math, and geography. Aquatic invertebrates, grasslands ecology, botany, livestock grazing, ranch animal anatomy and physiology, natural art, prairie dog studies, and pioneer studies are just a handful of topics that are offered. Activities can be tailored to meet the needs of the class. Teaching Environmental Science-Naturally is a program sponsored by the Colorado Division of Wildlife. The Division of Wildlife describes it as an activity the focuses on local natural resources that provide teachers with hands-on experiences, in their own backyard. The program gives students a chance to learn in a classroom and then experience in the outdoors. Some of the camps that are offered are On the Wing which is a summer camp for bird observatory, Scouting which is for boy and girl scouts, and Ranch Camp which teaches about life on a working cattle ranch. For adults, the Chico Basin has a class in holistic resource management, grazing planning, horsemanship and ranch roping. All of these classes are taught by experienced staff educators. ==Chico Basin Holistic Goal== The main goal of the Chico Basin Ranch is to have a natural environment that encourages a local economy and conveys a beautiful landscape of wide open spaces. To also live a full meaningful life that has freedom, peacefulness, and privacy. Agriculture should both be creative and traditional. The Chico Basin wants to create an ecosystem that supports human community and wildlife. The Chico Basin staff has the knowledge to teach others about the land and the people living on it. ==Partnerships== *The Nature Conservancy *Rocky Mountain Bird Observation *American Birding Association *Colorado State Department of Agriculture *Pikes Peak Birding Trail *The Quivera Coalition *The Allan Savory Center for Holistic Management *Lasater Grasslands Beef *Sustainable Beef Productions *Cattle Industry of the American West *Colorado Historical Society *Colorado Adventure Guide *Colorado Film Resources *American Cowboy ==Recommendations== *The World Outdoors *Ranchweb *American Roundup *Gordon‚Äôs Guide *Hidden Trails *Working Cattle Ranches ==References * Chico Basin Ranch - official site Category:Ranches in Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:Education in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Colorado Springs, Colorado ","title":"Chico Basin Ranch"},{"id":"35270428","text":"The Toronto Tabla Ensemble (TTE) is a non-profit charitable organization founded by Artistic Director and tabla master Ritesh Das. The performing ensemble has toured Canada coast-to-coast six times, toured Australia in 2006, and India in 2011. Since 1996 the TTE has produced three music videos and six albums, including Firedance, which received a nomination for the Juno Award for Best Global Album. Their original music has been used in numerous films and commercials, and in 2003 the Ensemble was commissioned to create the theme music for CBC Radio‚Äôs daily morning show, Metro Morning. ==25 years== In 2016 the Toronto Tabla Ensemble celebrated its 25th anniversary with a pair of concerts at the Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. This was the official debut of the Toronto Tabla Youth Ensemble and featured brand new music composed by Artistic Director Ritesh Das. In addition to the tabla, students played South Indian mridangam, ghatam, and keyboard, and also launched the JAMKat. For this event, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, wrote a congratulatory letter which was presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Arif Virani, during the concert. The concert was supported in part by Ontario Arts Council. ==Indian Diaspora Festival== In 2014 the Toronto Tabla Ensemble launched an innovative festival called the Indian Diaspora Festival.

She is the first player from China to become a member of the LPGA Tour, which she joined in 2008. Feng has 10 victories on the tour, including the 2012 LPGA Championship, a major title, in which she shot a bogey-free 67 in the final round to win by two strokes. She is the first player from China to win an LPGA major championship, as well as the first player from mainland China (male or female) to win a major championship.http://tucsoncitizen.com/usa-today-sports/2012/06/10/shanshan- feng-wins-a-major-for-china/ Her best finish in 16 previous majors was a tie for 22nd at the 2012 Kraft Nabisco Championship. With the victory, she moved from tenth to fifth in the Women's World Golf Rankings. On 20 August 2016, Feng won the Olympic bronze medal in women's golf at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. From November 2017 to April 2018, she was first in the Women's World Golf Rankings. ==Early life, family and early golf development== 2009 Women's British Open Feng was born in Guangzhou, in the province of Guangdong, and started playing golf at age 10 at the urging of her father, Feng Xiong, who worked at the golf association in their hometown.Golf Channel television interview with Feng upon winning the 2012 LPGA Championship on 10 June 2012 Due to limited resources and a lack of reputable golf coaches, Feng's father, who was the captain of a junior golf team, worked with her every day. During the week, Feng would attend school from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and then her father would bring her to the driving range where she would practice for two hours hitting golf balls off a mat. On the weekends, she travelled outside of the city to a local course to play practice rounds and work on her short game. When Feng was in high school an agent discovered her, at a tournament in China, and this led to her meeting coach Gary Gilchrist. When Feng was 17 years old, Gilchrist offered her a full scholarship to attend his junior golf academy in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Feng accepted the offer and moved to the U.S hoping to become a professional golfer. Despite the scholarship to Gilchrist's academy, living expenses, tuition at a nearby high school, and traveling costs became heavy financial burdens on her parents, Feng Xiong and Zheng Yuyan, who both work at governmental institutes and earn average salaries. Feng's parents had spent almost all of their savings by the end of 2007, and they considered mortgaging their house to support their daughter. However, the family support paid off in December 2007 when Feng, a teenager amateur, earned a spot on the LPGA Tour's 2008 season after tying for ninth place at the Tour's qualifying tournament. ==Amateur career== Feng won the China Junior Championship and the China Junior Open in 2004. She was a three- time winner of the China Amateur Tournament (2004‚Äì06). She was the Champion of the 2006 China Women's Amateur Open. A member of the 2006 All-China Championship Team, she earned a medalist honors at the event. In 2007 she was named Golfweeks's Top Chinese Amateur after winning four tournaments on the International Junior Golf Tour (IIGT) in 2007. While still an amateur, Feng tied for ninth at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament in December 2007 to earn a spot on the LPGA Tour in 2008. ==Professional wins (23)== LPGA Tour wins (10) {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" -
